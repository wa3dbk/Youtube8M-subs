00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.050
 hi to all friends 7 iso and we get 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.140
 find today to discover 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.279
 together exclusively the map of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 fixed scenes and the map 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.560
 exo zombies of the new dlc reckoning which 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.380
 will be officially released tomorrow 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.899
 you have a small image on the screen 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 with other videos that I already have 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.190
 realized gameplay presenting each 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.870
 multiplayer map so I invite you to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.250
 click if you have not seen them and if 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.350
 you want to discover the multi maps 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.320
 but today as I wanted to say we 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.149
 will focus on the zombie so already 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.699
 you see the little preface we'll say 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.129
 of this zombie so downhill this is the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.940
 So the last part of the forgotten 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.699
 fourth 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.440
 and suddenly we go a little bit to see the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.720
 the outcome of this story 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.150
 I confess that for my part it is a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.900
 little bit confused I do not know exactly 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.300
 how are we going to end up 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.890
 at the very beginning of the map you will see 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.230
 by the way, at the end of the video 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.210
 there will be an annotation on a gameplay 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.050
 discovery and there you can really 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.530
 see goes all a part starts to get 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.350
 start 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.700
 and then here are the different rooms and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.140
 it's this new map 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.300
 and I assure you that there is still 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.910
 a lot of things to see so there you 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.220
 see this little preface really 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.590
 pretty three-dimensional a kind of 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.120
 stage with all our protagonists and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.950
 some zombies it's really pretty 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.840
 so I wanted you doctor a little 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.190
 little in introduction and we will return 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.040
 in the heart of the subject since today 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.080
 we are dedicated to new products 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.750
 our first novelties so the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.960
 blunderbuss that will be playable so we 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.490
 therefore he added no 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.160
 very long when updating 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.720
 on the aden multiplayer on far and there 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.700
 we will be able to play it in zombies and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.860
 it is true that he is super class this 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.200
 old-fashioned shotgun we see their 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.640
 loading who is really who has 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.470
 really mouth that we see 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.480
 outright put the powder except breed 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.480
 is really nice so little novelty 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.540
 so for this this exodus have said we can 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.250
 play this little round 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.930
 second novelty of the zombies that have 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.610
 teleportation so that was going to be 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.980
 very quickly I do not know if you saw 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.200
 after that I would like to add a slow motion 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.350
 to be able to see a little better 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.620
 so you have zombies from 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.900
 handle above 10 12 as it 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.150
 that they will have teleportation so this 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.230
 level is hard enough to handle you see 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.170
 in slow motion what does it give 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.180
 hop it appears is it suddenly bah he 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.520
 can surprise you and directly you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.190
 put a blow is hard enough to handle 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.910
 that then other novelty we have the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.460
 Goliath 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.220
 we saw in the trailer we have the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.780
 goliath which is playable in zombies so 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.340
 there you see that in my part there is 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.590
 had someone he had had 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.620
 unfortunately I had the chance to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.320
 get it but there was wmr 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.360
 by the way who had this goliath is not 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.980
 it is very very bad and I think 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.230
 that in the highs it will be 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.180
 really very important is the last 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.900
 novelty and not the least tear 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.170
 special of this are cans of this map 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.930
 cents is the trident so trident 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.370
 it makes you think of the sea 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.730
 just because this map is 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.140
 underneath the water so a trident and that 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.660
 is going to be a weapon that actually sends 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.940
 small electrical impulses 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.800
 plasma balls but who have the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.990
 particularity of ricochet on 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.170
 surfaces so that's really cool 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.520
 when you have a small room where you 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.380
 have a lot of zombies around you 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.510
 you can swing the sauce and with 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.340
 the walls eh ben to make carnage 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.730
 ricochet like that it's really 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.940
 cool by the way there is a small success 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.920
 which involves doing without him behind 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.420
 self with the trident ie in 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.430
 bouncing and were 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.570
 zombies that lies behind so I 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.200
 find that it's really cool this 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.600
 small weapon 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.460
 we could not really get the punch punch at 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.830
 background because obviously she's not 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.510
 appreciable because bah voila it's 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.359
 a weapon like any other we could not 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.320
 the pac to punch bottom to see if 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.239
 eventually there were variants 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.209
 where we will have the opportunity to see him from 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.250
 less 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.620
 will leave me here the friends were all 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.840
 very short videos but especially for 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.380
 make a digest of all these 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.449
 new 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.669
 and if you really want to know 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.400
 more because we still went to 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.770
 that one has unlocked even a success that 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.819
 you think puts us on the path to 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.770
 listrac of the map 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.690
 do not hesitate to click on the notation 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.910
 that you have right now on the screen 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.620
 you will be redirected to my gameplay 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.289
 is discovered and here are the friends 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.120
 good evening have fun and then 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.930
 enjoy the holidays 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.930
 Hi everybody
