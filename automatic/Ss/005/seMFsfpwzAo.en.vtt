her<00:04:17.440> very<00:04:18.100> clearly<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.670> this<00:04:18.850> was<00:04:19.060> all<00:04:19.390> just

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
her very clearly that this was all just

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.540 
her very clearly that this was all just
a<00:04:19.960> fun<00:04:20.230> thing<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.890> she<00:04:21.160> didn't<00:04:21.340> seem<00:04:21.460> to

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
a fun thing and she didn't seem to

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.820 
a fun thing and she didn't seem to
understand<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.390> when<00:04:23.320> she<00:04:23.470> picked<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.740> up

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
understand that so when she picked it up

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.770 
understand that so when she picked it up
I<00:04:23.980> decided<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.430> couldn't<00:04:24.700> lose<00:04:24.790> so<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.150> do<00:04:25.390> I<00:04:25.690> had

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.610 

little<00:05:23.910> upset<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.480> wanted<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.080> bad

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
little upset I wanted it bad

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.220 
little upset I wanted it bad
I<00:05:25.650> do<00:05:26.370> think<00:05:26.760> grace<00:05:27.210> should've<00:05:27.900> cut<00:05:28.020> her<00:05:28.110> nails

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230

I do think grace should've cut her nails
a<00:05:28.410> little<00:05:28.590> bit<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:29.280> some<00:05:29.610> some<00:05:30.300> injuries

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
a little bit I have some some injuries

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.120 
a little bit I have some some injuries
from<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.170> game<00:05:31.380> I<00:05:31.410> mean<00:05:31.710> there<00:05:32.070> was

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
from the game I mean there was

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.920 
from the game I mean there was
definitely<00:05:32.190> some<00:05:32.700> home<00:05:32.880> cooking<00:05:33.330> going<00:05:33.480> on<00:05:33.690> as

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
definitely some home cooking going on as

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.500 
definitely some home cooking going on as
well<00:05:34.110> I<00:05:34.440> definitely<00:05:35.100> think<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.670> team<00:05:36.300> was

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
well I definitely think the team was

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.500 
well I definitely think the team was
favoring<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.500> Terra<00:05:38.100> grace<00:05:38.520> team<00:05:38.850> but<00:05:39.150> we

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
favoring the Terra grace team but we

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.090 
favoring the Terra grace team but we
played<00:05:39.750> hard<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.200> that's<00:05:40.410> all<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.560> can<00:05:40.650> ask<00:05:40.950> for

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
played hard and that's all I can ask for

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.130 
played hard and that's all I can ask for
I<00:05:41.250> mean<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:41.580> still<00:05:41.880> have<00:05:42.060> three<00:05:42.780> more<00:05:42.990> years

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
I mean I still have three more years

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.690 
I mean I still have three more years
here<00:05:43.380> so<00:05:43.620> who<00:05:43.740> knows<00:05:43.890> maybe<00:05:44.130> I'll<00:05:44.310> be<00:05:44.520> back

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:59.390 
here so who knows maybe I'll be back
again<00:05:55.400> I<00:05:57.650> think<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:58.980> was<00:05:59.100> just<00:05:59.190> you<00:05:59.370> know

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
again I think I was just you know

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.150 
again I think I was just you know
relieved<00:06:00.030> it<00:06:00.210> went<00:06:00.630> down<00:06:00.840> and<00:06:01.290> we<00:06:01.800> could<00:06:01.950> we

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
relieved it went down and we could we

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:29.610 
relieved it went down and we could we
could<00:06:02.280> move<00:06:02.460> move<00:06:03.060> on<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.270> practice

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.770 

girl<00:06:32.340> going<00:06:33.340> five<00:06:33.670> of<00:06:33.850> six<00:06:34.060> on<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.420> weekend

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
girl going five of six on the weekend

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:54.720 
girl going five of six on the weekend
and<00:06:34.960> 83%<00:06:35.620> right<00:06:36.010> there<00:06:53.280> fortunate<00:06:54.280> to<00:06:54.550> get<00:06:54.670> a

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730 
and 83% right there fortunate to get a

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.080 
and 83% right there fortunate to get a
sombrero<00:06:55.090> I<00:06:55.860> honestly<00:06:56.860> think<00:06:57.190> that<00:06:57.340> Jocelyn

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
sombrero I honestly think that Jocelyn

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.480 
sombrero I honestly think that Jocelyn
tinkle<00:06:58.450> killed<00:06:59.170> the<00:06:59.470> rebounding<00:06:59.920> that<00:07:00.190> trip

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
tinkle killed the rebounding that trip

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.160 
tinkle killed the rebounding that trip
and<00:07:00.700> I<00:07:00.790> really<00:07:01.150> am<00:07:01.300> honor<00:07:01.510> airily<00:07:01.810> giving<00:07:02.080> it

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170 
and I really am honor airily giving it

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.290 
and I really am honor airily giving it
to<00:07:02.260> her<00:07:02.410> but<00:07:02.680> it's<00:07:03.490> just<00:07:03.670> a<00:07:03.730> really<00:07:03.910> great<00:07:04.000> to

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
to her but it's just a really great to

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.960 
to her but it's just a really great to
have<00:07:04.780> goals<00:07:05.110> and<00:07:05.440> to<00:07:05.590> see<00:07:06.100> things<00:07:06.310> rewarded

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
have goals and to see things rewarded

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.550 
have goals and to see things rewarded
and<00:07:07.120> I<00:07:07.300> think<00:07:07.840> the<00:07:07.900> funnest<00:07:08.170> part<00:07:08.380> is<00:07:08.440> seeing

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
and I think the funnest part is seeing

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.960 
and I think the funnest part is seeing
ember<00:07:08.890> wear<00:07:09.040> sombreros<00:07:09.340> throughout<00:07:09.880> the

ember wear sombreros throughout the

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.300 
ember wear sombreros throughout the
