00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.680 
this video shows how to use a wobbler to
find<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.529> center<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.250> round<00:00:05.490> bar<00:00:05.790> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
find the center of a round bar the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.320 
find the center of a round bar the
wobbler<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.379> held<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.460> drill<00:00:08.730> chuck<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.240> the

milling<00:00:20.160> machine<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:21.029> wobbler<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.660> about<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
milling machine the wobbler is about to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
milling machine the wobbler is about to
touch<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.220> bar<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> center<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.420> table

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
touch the bar in the center of the table

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
touch the bar in the center of the table
and<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.430> flicked<00:00:26.820> out<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and as you can see it is flicked out and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.160 
and as you can see it is flicked out and
that's<00:00:27.779> what<00:00:27.990> gives<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.680> its<00:00:28.890> name<00:00:29.000> wobbler

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
that's what gives it its name wobbler

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.830 
that's what gives it its name wobbler

can see that the speed that the table is

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.200 
can see that the speed that the table is
moving<00:01:42.049> in<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.229> Y<00:01:42.380> direction<00:01:43.009> we<00:01:43.210> reduces
