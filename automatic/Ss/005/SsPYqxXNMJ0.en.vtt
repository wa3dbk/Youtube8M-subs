at the glass on the table and an angle

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.150 
at the glass on the table and an angle
pose<00:00:47.879> light<00:00:48.239> over<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> top<00:00:49.129> now<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:51.030> all

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
pose light over the top now as with all

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
pose light over the top now as with all
bottles<00:00:53.160> anything<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.180> got<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> text<00:00:54.750> on

bottles anything that's got a text on

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.829 
bottles anything that's got a text on
we've<00:00:55.410> always<00:00:55.769> light<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.360> left-hand

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
we've always light from the left-hand

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.689 
we've always light from the left-hand
side<00:00:57.960> because<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.339> way<00:00:59.489> our<00:00:59.820> eye<00:01:00.050> eye

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
side because that's the way our eye eye

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.240 
side because that's the way our eye eye
reads<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.170> put<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> white<00:01:04.589> reflector

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
reads now if I put a white reflector

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.530 
reads now if I put a white reflector
there<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> white

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
there if you can see it's a white

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.389 
there if you can see it's a white
reflector<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.440> put<00:01:07.649> a<00:01:07.680> white<00:01:07.860> reflector

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
reflector if I put a white reflector

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.550 
reflector if I put a white reflector
down<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.060> start<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.110> clinic

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
down the side we start to get clinic

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.529 
down the side we start to get clinic
classic<00:01:12.259> light<00:01:13.729> on<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.789> bottle<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.179> wine<00:01:15.330> so

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
classic light on a bottle of wine so

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.820 
classic light on a bottle of wine so
once<00:01:18.539> we've<00:01:18.690> got<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> reflector<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.560> side

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
once we've got a reflector in that side

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070 
once we've got a reflector in that side
we<00:01:20.369> will<00:01:20.820> think<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.179> fitting<00:01:21.509> reflecting

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
we will think about fitting reflecting

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.169 
we will think about fitting reflecting
the<00:01:22.170> other<00:01:22.289> side<00:01:22.530> I'm<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.550> sure<00:01:23.820> we're<00:01:24.000> going

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
the other side I'm not sure we're going

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.510 
the other side I'm not sure we're going
to<00:01:24.420> I'm<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.200> thinking<00:01:25.800> about<00:01:26.069> it<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.399> this

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
to I'm just thinking about it at this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.309 
to I'm just thinking about it at this
moment

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
moment

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.260 
moment
we'll<00:01:28.319> have<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.679> think<00:01:29.069> I'll<00:01:29.580> put<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> there

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
we'll have to think I'll put it there

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.820 
we'll have to think I'll put it there
for<00:01:30.330> now<00:01:32.420> again<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.840> might<00:01:34.050> move<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.649> later

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
for now again we might move it later

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.460 
for now again we might move it later
we'll<00:01:35.190> see<00:01:35.429> all<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:36.569> let's<00:01:36.899> try<00:01:37.050> a<00:01:37.170> lot<00:01:37.440> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
we'll see all right let's try a lot a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.850 
we'll see all right let's try a lot a
wider<00:01:37.800> one<00:01:38.039> now<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.490> nice<00:01:38.729> isn't<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> I

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
wider one now that's nice isn't it I

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.399 
wider one now that's nice isn't it I
think<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.100> lot<00:01:41.250> better<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.229> see

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
think that's a lot better so just to see

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.340 
think that's a lot better so just to see
a<00:01:43.440> little<00:01:43.619> bit<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.830> black<00:01:43.979> yard<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.899> gradually

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
a little bit of black yard so gradually

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.560 
a little bit of black yard so gradually
we<00:01:46.380> go<00:01:46.619> around<00:01:46.770> building<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.670> building<00:01:48.450> up

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
we go around building up the building up

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
we go around building up the building up
the<00:01:48.719> shot<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.530> trying<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> find<00:01:50.460> what<00:01:50.640> we

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the shot and trying to find what we

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.280 
the shot and trying to find what we
don't<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.210> what<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.020> now<00:01:52.170> what

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
I don't like is of course the flare
that's<00:01:54.990> coming<00:01:55.350> from<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> top<00:01:55.890> light<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.460> what

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that's coming from the top light so what

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.859 
that's coming from the top light so what
I<00:01:56.670> need<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:58.110> cut<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:59.270> the<00:02:00.270> cloud<00:02:00.509> above

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
I need to do is cut down the cloud above

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.440 
I need to do is cut down the cloud above
you<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.850> place<00:02:03.149> will

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you see and that in the right place will

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
you see and that in the right place will
cut<00:02:03.689> down<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.890> light<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.490> we're<00:02:05.610> getting

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
cut down the light that we're getting

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.620 
cut down the light that we're getting
into<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> lens<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.329> bring<00:02:09.479> that

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
into the lens and I like to bring that

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.150 
into the lens and I like to bring that
in<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:09.929> closer<00:02:10.140> counter<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> lens<00:02:10.890> because<00:02:11.100> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
in as closer counter the lens because I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.190 
in as closer counter the lens because I
think<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.430> works<00:02:11.609> better<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.269> I'll<00:02:12.959> bring<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
think it works better so I'll bring that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.400 
think it works better so I'll bring that
to<00:02:13.560> there<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:15.299> when<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> fixed<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.079> place

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
to there and when I fixed it in place

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.390 
to there and when I fixed it in place
I'll<00:02:16.799> switch<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.190> camera<00:02:17.549> back<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:19.400> well

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
I'll switch the camera back on well

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.849 
I'll switch the camera back on well
there's<00:02:20.579> our<00:02:20.730> first<00:02:21.109> little<00:02:22.109> test<00:02:22.410> shot<00:02:22.680> if

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
there's our first little test shot if

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.640 
there's our first little test shot if
you<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.190> at<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:23.640> stage<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:25.079> to<00:02:25.380> pick

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you like at this stage it's just to pick

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.220 
you like at this stage it's just to pick
out<00:02:25.920> little<00:02:26.640> details<00:02:27.239> that<00:02:27.420> now<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.079> to

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
out little details that now that have to

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.170 
out little details that now that have to
be<00:02:28.350> solved<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.220> decide<00:02:29.640> what<00:02:29.880> we're<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
be solved and decide what we're going to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.030 
be solved and decide what we're going to
do<00:02:30.390> with<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.750> rest<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.109> the<00:02:31.200> light<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.739> just<00:02:31.769> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
do with the rest of the light is just a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.250 
do with the rest of the light is just a
nicely<00:02:32.489> all<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.970> thing<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:33.930> halfway

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
nicely all that thing to do halfway

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.740 
nicely all that thing to do halfway
through<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> shop<00:02:35.000> now<00:02:36.000> as<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> said<00:02:36.480> there's<00:02:36.720> one

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
through a shop now as I said there's one

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.110 
through a shop now as I said there's one
or<00:02:36.959> two<00:02:36.989> problems<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.100> blow<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.579> up<00:02:38.790> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
or two problems as we blow this up and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120 
or two problems as we blow this up and
that's<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.720> blue<00:02:39.930> reflections<00:02:40.650> well<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> know

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
that's the blue reflections well I know

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.850 
that's the blue reflections well I know
what

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
what

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.380 
what
because<00:02:42.160> I'm<00:02:42.280> worried<00:02:42.430> look<00:02:42.730> from<00:02:43.000> there<00:02:43.150> in

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
because I'm worried look from there in

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.310 
because I'm worried look from there in
fact<00:02:43.660> my<00:02:44.470> computer<00:02:44.980> screen<00:02:45.160> affecting<00:02:46.320> so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
fact my computer screen affecting so

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.810 
fact my computer screen affecting so
we'll<00:02:47.590> solve<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.190> we<00:02:48.280> come<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.490> shoot

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
we'll solve that when we come to shoot

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.730 
we'll solve that when we come to shoot
there<00:02:49.240> are<00:02:49.360> one<00:02:49.480> other<00:02:49.660> two<00:02:49.990> reflections<00:02:50.590> that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
there are one other two reflections that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.560 
there are one other two reflections that
got<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.160> solve<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.610> dirt<00:02:51.910> on<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.300> glass

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
got to be solve this dirt on the glass

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.170 
got to be solve this dirt on the glass
there's<00:02:52.930> dust<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.590> glass<00:02:53.830> there<00:02:54.310> are

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
there's dust on the glass there are

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.300 
there's dust on the glass there are
several<00:02:55.720> little<00:02:56.110> problems<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.710> reflections

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
several little problems in reflections

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.990 
several little problems in reflections
down<00:02:57.610> here<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.560> bottle<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.100> way<00:03:00.460> out<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.760> shape

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
down here the bottle is way out of shape

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.820 
down here the bottle is way out of shape
up<00:03:01.300> here<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.690> neck<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:02.230> course<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.650> white

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
up here the neck of course that white

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.370 
up here the neck of course that white
reflection<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.550> too<00:03:03.790> far<00:03:04.120> in<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.600> not<00:03:05.050> far

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
reflection is too far in and not far

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.400 
reflection is too far in and not far
enough<00:03:05.590> out<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.130> has<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.550> come<00:03:07.510> back<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.260> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
enough out so it has to come back to the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.830 
enough out so it has to come back to the
edge<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:09.520> we'll<00:03:09.910> do<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.060> by<00:03:10.390> removing<00:03:10.450> the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
edge and we'll do that by removing the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.630 
edge and we'll do that by removing the
piece<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.200> card<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.620> gives<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.160> reflection

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
piece of card that gives this reflection

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.210 
piece of card that gives this reflection
down<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.090> glass<00:03:13.300> so<00:03:14.110> that's<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.920> next<00:03:15.070> thing

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
down the glass so that's the next thing

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.090 
down the glass so that's the next thing
we're<00:03:15.430> going<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.640> do<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:16.090> think<00:03:16.360> also<00:03:16.890> it's<00:03:17.890> a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
we're going to do I think also it's a

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.190 
we're going to do I think also it's a
little<00:03:18.430> bit<00:03:18.580> distorted<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.600> maybe<00:03:19.870> we<00:03:20.170> should

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
little bit distorted so maybe we should

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.940 
little bit distorted so maybe we should
change<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:22.060> our<00:03:22.570> longer<00:03:23.140> lens<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.860> avoid<00:03:24.250> that

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
change to our longer lens to avoid that

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.310 
change to our longer lens to avoid that
so<00:03:26.950> here<00:03:27.160> we<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.580> two<00:03:27.820> different<00:03:28.810> lenses

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
so here we have the two different lenses

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.860 
so here we have the two different lenses
side<00:03:29.590> by<00:03:29.800> side<00:03:30.040> Nelly<00:03:30.340> right<00:03:31.090> hand<00:03:31.360> one<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
side by side Nelly right hand one is the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.610 
side by side Nelly right hand one is the
longer<00:03:32.200> lens

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
longer lens

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.650 
longer lens
and<00:03:32.980> you'll<00:03:33.430> see<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.760> bottle<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.780> lot<00:03:35.170> more

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
and you'll see the bottle is a lot more

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.810 
and you'll see the bottle is a lot more
massive<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.290> more<00:03:38.590> chunky<00:03:39.070> bottle<00:03:39.459> which<00:03:39.670> is

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
massive so more chunky bottle which is

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.090 
massive so more chunky bottle which is
nicer<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.810> glass<00:03:41.080> also<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.739> embed<00:03:42.070> a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
nicer the glass also is embed a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.580 
nicer the glass also is embed a
proportion<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.270> bottle<00:03:43.630> that's<00:03:44.380> what<00:03:44.560> I

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
proportion to the bottle that's what I

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.800 
proportion to the bottle that's what I
prefer<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.820> or<00:03:45.850> two<00:03:46.120> problems<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.720> have

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
prefer one or two problems that have

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.000 
prefer one or two problems that have
been<00:03:46.870> caused<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.560> that's<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.830> background

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
been caused and that's the background

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.250 
been caused and that's the background
that<00:03:48.459> goes<00:03:48.489> has<00:03:48.790> got<00:03:49.000> down<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.630> little<00:03:49.930> and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
that goes has got down a little and

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.620 
that goes has got down a little and
changed<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.920> this<00:03:51.790> reflector<00:03:52.330> that's<00:03:52.420> come

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
changed and this reflector that's come

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.180 
changed and this reflector that's come
into<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.959> image<00:03:53.200> well<00:03:53.440> we<00:03:53.620> could<00:03:53.950> leave<00:03:54.160> that

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
into the image well we could leave that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.070 
into the image well we could leave that
and<00:03:54.489> retouch<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:55.000> afterwards<00:03:55.510> we'll<00:03:55.780> see

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
and retouch it afterwards we'll see

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.900 
and retouch it afterwards we'll see
whether<00:03:56.500> that's<00:03:56.799> going<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.040> be<00:03:57.130> necessary<00:03:57.280> now

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
whether that's going to be necessary now

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.880 
whether that's going to be necessary now
I'm<00:03:58.510> going<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.780> get<00:03:58.959> on<00:03:59.080> a<00:03:59.110> change<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.680> few

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
I'm going to get on a change a few

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.090 
I'm going to get on a change a few
things<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.580> next<00:04:00.700> shot<00:04:01.000> you'll<00:04:01.239> see

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
things and the next shot you'll see

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.620 
things and the next shot you'll see
rather<00:04:03.100> than<00:04:03.190> keep<00:04:03.489> your<00:04:03.670> board<00:04:03.850> for<00:04:04.090> about<00:04:04.299> 20

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630

right shape each side the glass is

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.870 
right shape each side the glass is
looking<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.590> little<00:04:23.950> bit<00:04:24.220> better<00:04:24.430> the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
looking a little bit better the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.719 
looking a little bit better the
background<00:04:25.360> up<00:04:25.540> change<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.560> be<00:04:26.740> quite<00:04:27.520> nice

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729

now<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.210> next<00:04:28.540> thing<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:28.990> light<00:04:29.440> the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
now the next thing is to light the

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.210 
now the next thing is to light the
background<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:32.050> as<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.740> lighting<00:04:33.130> the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
background so as to lighting the

I<00:04:33.910> finished<00:04:34.600> my<00:04:34.750> damage<00:04:35.169> and<00:04:35.350> found<00:04:35.880> this

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
I finished my damage and found this

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.540 
I finished my damage and found this
stand<00:04:39.280> light

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
stand light

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.810 
stand light
as<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.330> know<00:04:41.450> I've<00:04:41.660> just<00:04:41.690> taken<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.260> but<00:04:42.820> right

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
as you know I've just taken it but right

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.450 
as you know I've just taken it but right
well<00:04:44.480> we<00:04:44.600> do<00:04:44.720> it<00:04:44.870> now<00:04:45.110> switch<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.560> on<00:04:45.620> and

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.560 

this<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:49.640> how<00:04:49.820> we'll<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.360> background

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
this is how we'll like the background

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.490 
this is how we'll like the background
we'll<00:04:50.990> do<00:04:51.140> it<00:04:51.230> from<00:04:51.350> low<00:04:51.590> down<00:04:51.860> probably<00:04:53.500> I'm

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
we'll do it from low down probably I'm

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.200 
we'll do it from low down probably I'm
looking<00:04:54.860> at<00:04:54.950> my<00:04:55.070> monitor<00:04:55.310> at<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:55.760> same<00:04:55.940> time

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
looking at my monitor at the same time

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.040 
looking at my monitor at the same time
and<00:04:56.690> we'll<00:04:56.840> do<00:04:56.990> some<00:04:57.260> sort<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.740> light<00:04:59.050> like

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
and we'll do some sort of light like

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.800 
and we'll do some sort of light like
that<00:05:03.280> now<00:05:04.280> I've<00:05:04.430> admitted<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:05.090> my<00:05:05.210> wife<00:05:05.390> that

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
that now I've admitted to my wife that

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.350 
that now I've admitted to my wife that
I've<00:05:06.410> taken<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.860> sheet<00:05:07.100> off<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.490> bed<00:05:07.760> for

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
I've taken the sheet off the bed for

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.690 
I've taken the sheet off the bed for
this<00:05:08.480> background<00:05:08.750> so<00:05:09.260> then<00:05:10.130> she<00:05:10.340> managed<00:05:10.670> to

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
this background so then she managed to

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.600 
this background so then she managed to
iron<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.830> like<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:13.040> light<00:05:13.250> on<00:05:13.520> the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
iron it I like the light on the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.980 
iron it I like the light on the
background<00:05:13.760> now<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:14.210> think<00:05:14.390> I'm<00:05:14.720> going<00:05:14.900> to

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
background now I think I'm going to

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.490 
background now I think I'm going to
leave<00:05:15.140> that<00:05:15.350> like<00:05:15.560> that

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
leave that like that

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.670 
leave that like that
yeah<00:05:18.660> now<00:05:19.660> I'm<00:05:19.840> just<00:05:20.050> worried<00:05:20.260> about<00:05:20.350> one

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
yeah now I'm just worried about one

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.260 
yeah now I'm just worried about one
thing<00:05:20.860> we<00:05:20.980> need<00:05:21.100> at<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.460> end<00:05:21.490> of<00:05:21.700> the<00:05:21.790> shot<00:05:22.030> but

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
thing we need at the end of the shot but

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.850 
thing we need at the end of the shot but
I'm<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.390> bit<00:05:22.660> worried<00:05:22.870> that<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.200> lake<00:05:23.410> was<00:05:23.650> too

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
I'm a bit worried that the lake was too

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.270 
I'm a bit worried that the lake was too
dark<00:05:24.070> now<00:05:24.490> run<00:05:24.760> a<00:05:24.790> Delights<00:05:26.010> can't<00:05:27.010> find

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
dark now run a Delights can't find

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.250 
dark now run a Delights can't find
anything<00:05:27.490> else<00:05:27.730> I<00:05:27.910> can't<00:05:28.240> get<00:05:28.540> a<00:05:28.570> reflector<00:05:29.110> in

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
anything else I can't get a reflector in

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.120 
anything else I can't get a reflector in
there<00:05:29.500> that<00:05:29.650> works<00:05:29.860> bright<00:05:30.280> evening<00:05:30.520> mirror

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
there that works bright evening mirror

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.880 
there that works bright evening mirror
doesn't<00:05:33.130> really<00:05:33.400> work<00:05:33.730> as<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:34.030> want<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:35.230> I<00:05:35.530> went

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
doesn't really work as I want so I went

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.360 
doesn't really work as I want so I went
into<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.220> gang<00:05:36.430> so<00:05:36.730> I've<00:05:36.820> had<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.030> torch<00:05:37.390> now

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
into the gang so I've had a torch now

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.640 
into the gang so I've had a torch now
this<00:05:39.370> is<00:05:39.580> a<00:05:39.840> standard<00:05:40.840> one<00:05:41.020> other<00:05:41.230> standard

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
this is a standard one other standard

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.370 
this is a standard one other standard
you'll<00:05:41.770> put<00:05:41.950> your<00:05:42.070> torches<00:05:42.490> now<00:05:43.120> if<00:05:43.390> I<00:05:43.600> just<00:05:44.170> do

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
you'll put your torches now if I just do

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.430 
you'll put your torches now if I just do
that<00:05:44.590> during<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:45.040> exposure<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.930> like<00:05:47.230> my

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
that during the exposure it like my

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.220 
that during the exposure it like my
label<00:05:47.800> no<00:05:48.160> because<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.700> keep<00:05:48.910> it<00:05:49.060> moving<00:05:49.510> it

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
label no because I keep it moving it

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.590 
label no because I keep it moving it
changes<00:05:50.860> from<00:05:51.070> a<00:05:51.160> direct<00:05:51.580> light<00:05:51.760> into<00:05:52.330> an

changes from a direct light into an

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.480 
changes from a direct light into an
indirect<00:05:53.110> light<00:05:53.260> which<00:05:53.530> is<00:05:53.740> quite<00:05:54.040> handy

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
indirect light which is quite handy

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.920 
indirect light which is quite handy
because<00:05:54.640> it<00:05:54.850> doesn't<00:05:55.180> cause<00:05:55.360> any<00:05:55.630> hard

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
because it doesn't cause any hard

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.290 
because it doesn't cause any hard
shadows<00:05:56.380> it<00:05:56.920> puts<00:05:57.250> a<00:05:57.370> nice<00:05:57.520> little<00:05:57.730> reflection

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
shadows it puts a nice little reflection

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.080 
shadows it puts a nice little reflection
in<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.540> glass<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:59.530> puts<00:05:59.890> a<00:06:00.010> nasty<00:06:00.610> reflection

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
in the glass it puts a nasty reflection

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.390 
in the glass it puts a nasty reflection
in<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.270> bottle<00:06:01.630> but<00:06:01.810> one<00:06:02.170> that's<00:06:02.410> so<00:06:02.710> easy<00:06:02.980> to

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
in the bottle but one that's so easy to

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.700 
in the bottle but one that's so easy to
get<00:06:03.520> rid<00:06:03.670> of<00:06:03.960> so<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:04.990> think<00:06:05.170> that's<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.530> way<00:06:05.650> to

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
get rid of so I think that's the way to

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.890 
get rid of so I think that's the way to
go<00:06:06.010> now<00:06:06.430> this<00:06:06.880> is<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.060> technique<00:06:07.480> I've<00:06:07.720> been

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
go now this is a technique I've been

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.020 
go now this is a technique I've been
using<00:06:08.140> for<00:06:09.130> a<00:06:09.160> long<00:06:09.220> long<00:06:09.610> time

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
using for a long long time

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
sá and taken the final shot now this is

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.210 
sá and taken the final shot now this is
it<00:06:24.910> straight<00:06:25.390> from<00:06:25.600> the<00:06:25.750> camera<00:06:26.220> obviously

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
it straight from the camera obviously

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.130 
it straight from the camera obviously
needs<00:06:27.550> a<00:06:27.669> bit<00:06:27.820> of<00:06:27.910> retouching<00:06:28.240> so<00:06:28.840> we'll<00:06:29.020> do

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
needs a bit of retouching so we'll do

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.119 
needs a bit of retouching so we'll do
that<00:06:29.169> now

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.209 

what<00:06:35.189> I've<00:06:35.309> done<00:06:35.520> is<00:06:35.819> in<00:06:36.569> fact<00:06:36.809> I<00:06:36.929> have<00:06:37.050> added

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
what I've done is in fact I have added

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:42.559 
what I've done is in fact I have added
50%<00:06:38.219> blue<00:06:39.409> 5%<00:06:40.409> cyan<00:06:40.800> to<00:06:41.159> the<00:06:41.249> color<00:06:41.489> and<00:06:42.449> I've

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
50% blue 5% cyan to the color and I've

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.339 
50% blue 5% cyan to the color and I've
increased<00:06:42.839> the<00:06:43.080> contrast<00:06:43.349> by<00:06:43.949> 20%<00:06:45.110> now<00:06:46.110> that's

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
increased the contrast by 20% now that's

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.649 
increased the contrast by 20% now that's
the<00:06:46.739> result<00:06:47.129> I've<00:06:47.550> had<00:06:47.789> to<00:06:47.939> do<00:06:48.089> that<00:06:48.300> of<00:06:48.479> course

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:48.659 
the result I've had to do that of course

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.659 
the result I've had to do that of course
because<00:06:49.110> the<00:06:49.229> lights<00:06:49.439> are<00:06:49.709> not<00:06:49.739> really<00:06:50.429> color

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
because the lights are not really color

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.699 
because the lights are not really color
