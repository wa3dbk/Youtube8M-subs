 well all the paper views I bring the 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.499
 summary and my opinion next to the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.139
 results of all the fighting that 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.599

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.599
 it was not going to be less yesterday was held in 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.560
 this past dawn the royal rumble a 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:28.589
 royal rumble with surprises with laps 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.960
 of some fighters and others and good 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.610
 with disappointments for some I 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 I include but good also good 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.120
 news that I have not taken so 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.960
 well let's start we have the kickoff 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 between the fight of Caesar O and Jason Kidd 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.600
 and adam braun against those of vicky 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.540
 lines tone kofi kingston and xavier boots 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.090
 victory to stop today tyson kidd that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.790
 I think they are going to become a tag 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.770
 team and good the truth me tyson kidd no 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.350
 I like too they processed the truth 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.980
 yes and good to see how its future 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.170
 although I like the future of cesario more 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.360
 as an individual fighter, I do not eat 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.630
 detective but hey let's see what 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.080
 happens and as he said victory for them 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.240
 The show officially begins with a 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.910
 combat between the new ways outlaws 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.150
 against ascension a victory that would be 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.120
 days before starting the show that was going to 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.010
 be for extension and with this a push 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.320
 they have to grow they say that 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.950
 they're going to be the best tactician there has been 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.810
 they have shone many lower leagues and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.230
 now on the double double website as they go 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.390
 down that road so good luck to 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.430
 them and see what they bring us and I think that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.400
 It will not take long to be rivals of 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.560
 uses for the title not but good to 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.900
 see how and talking about the applications we are going 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.110
 with his combat the fight for the title 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.680
 in pairs where they faced use of 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.430
 my and also my two where I also 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.350
 could the selfishness and lost the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.770
 combat for I think that because of its 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.560
 no fault 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.800
 quite because I'm a fan of the uses are 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 great fighting but honestly 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.250
 lately they do not give the show that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.670
 they gave before for me but well now yes 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.610
 They are very good and good of me is very 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.590
 touched the floor lying down and have the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.650
 opportunity to give relief to adam well 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.340
 myth but how the public supports a lot 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.069
 the latter because the truth is angry 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.470
 cabrea and says that we prefer to go 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.230
 follow the half dead there to give him the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.880
 I relieve my partner and because of it 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.780
 because the uses just have to finish 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.200
 finish it and take the title home 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.900
 again they do not retain it we go with him the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.510
 combat of the candles against page and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.430
 natalia I also saw quite clearly 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.010
 this fight that if they were going to take her 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.530
 the candles although I had some doubt 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.910
 not why page the truth is good 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.709
 fighter and maybe I could take it 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.600
 but Natalia is not at her best 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.850
 and the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.160
 the candles then take the victory 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.590
 as I say we go with the last two 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.020
 you fight for the world title of 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.690
 the web of w and the royal rumble match 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.630
 let's start with the one for the title 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.070
 a spectacular combat between progression 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.950
 without exceeding rollings with good 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.440
 performances of the three are them 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.230
 showing a lot of power with many 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.080
 substitutes towards sen rollings the rolling 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.720
 some impressive jumps in fact one 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.830
 party the commentator table with them 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.590
 will give up jump from the top 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.790
 and he jumped on the s dar as I say 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.610
 I was lying on the table 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.440
 commentators then we have jones 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.230
 china that also makes several adjustments to 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.120
 good attitude sina combat 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.430
 Rawlings executes a shot at sheen 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.070
 also very touched all anyone of 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.280
 the three some failure could take the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.920
 combat but you win is the smartest or 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.960
 you will go the cars in the background is impossible 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.240
 record at this time male and a lot 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.240
 traffic but good as I say 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.520
 he is nothing does a f5 to rollins and ends 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.310
 winning the fight so I would forward the 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.090
 title and now you get to know the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.090
 until now not the one that was going to face 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.980
 to pro they bring them after the menu can already 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.230
 Enlarge the combat with several 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.620
 people I am more but good at the moment 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.380
 the combat is roman reigns against 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.430
 problem in transilvania 31 we are going to 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.169
 summarize how this royal rumble match was 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.509
 things to highlight back the boogie man 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.759
 they return to some more the truth but 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.469
 well they came back a couple or three but 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.120
 all three were fast especially the 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:51.939
 woman what I did if I'm not wrong 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.779
 break why is quite a while by the way 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:57.909
 very good performance of break wyatt let's go 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:59.889
 to things to highlight we have to the entrance 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.810
 from daniel bryan where people turned 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.650
 crazy entered if I'm not wrong in the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.689
 number 10 or 11 out there but there comes the 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.120
 surprise and where people have got angry 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.900
 much even me, because it has taken me 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.069
 small disappointment does not eliminate it 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.050
 relatively soon to be daniel 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:20.830
 bryan in fact eliminates it opens and guayas 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.749
 where in the ring they had quite a few 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.029
 piques between them actually were 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:29.490
 practically all the time fighting and 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.490
 others and it ends up eliminating break wyatt 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.540
 what do you want me to tell you that daniel bryan 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.750
 has returned that the public is crazy and 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.730
 to leave when there was still a 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.740
 time to finish where I thought that 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.510
 he or romÃ¡n rain were going to be the 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.370
 winners so what do you want me to tell you 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.870
 it brings me to the truth a disappointment 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.400
 important and here's the biggest 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.250
 disappointment of all the pay per view for 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.070
 for the public that saw it already arriving 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.970
 in the end they come out that inhibition where 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.430
 They allied to authority to eliminate 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.940
 people like dolph ziggler very socially 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.160
 opens and wyatt later eliminate dylan 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.780
 bruce are like the three that the 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.220
 public was we wanted it with them 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.290
 three the truth is the best there is 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.630
 right now and they were eliminated from 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.850
 a pretty dirty way thing that seems 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.930
 that you laugh at them but not good 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.630
 that's how it was and the authority is like that the truth 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.580
 already almost finishing the roman combat reims 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.560
 take advantage of that big show and kane 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.670
 they start to stick between them and the 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.460
 eliminate the two 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.070
 out of the ring but rousseff was by 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:39.000
 there thrown away and they only remain two 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:41.280
 it appears in rock and well they end up throwing 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.060
 rousseff of the roman ring highlights with the 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.800
 victory as you see the return of the rock 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.840
 romÃ¡n rain jumps jumps with victory 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.300
 will face in the area already 31 brock 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.860
 Lesnar and let's see what happens radius 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.960
 tonight because they decided 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.700
 many things so I hope that I have 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.890
 liked and I'll leave a like and a 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.780
