00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
familiar with what that is basically

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.609 
familiar with what that is basically
it's<00:00:22.449> a<00:00:22.539> whole<00:00:22.749> new<00:00:22.960> movement<00:00:23.140> that<00:00:23.470> is

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
it's a whole new movement that is

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.739 
it's a whole new movement that is
sweeping<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.400> scrapbooking<00:00:25.089> industry<00:00:25.569> and

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
sweeping the scrapbooking industry and

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.439 
sweeping the scrapbooking industry and
pretty<00:00:26.380> much<00:00:26.439> it<00:00:26.769> is<00:00:26.980> just<00:00:27.339> simplifying<00:00:28.149> the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
pretty much it is just simplifying the

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.800 
pretty much it is just simplifying the
process<00:00:28.480> so<00:00:29.439> for<00:00:29.800> instance<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:31.060> have<00:00:31.300> all<00:00:31.599> of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
process so for instance they have all of

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.319 
process so for instance they have all of
these<00:00:32.280> pre-measured<00:00:33.280> segmented<00:00:33.940> page

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
these pre-measured segmented page

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.470 
these pre-measured segmented page
pockets<00:00:34.840> so<00:00:35.740> all<00:00:35.980> you<00:00:36.010> have<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.430> do<00:00:36.670> is<00:00:36.880> simply

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
pockets so all you have to do is simply

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.960

my<00:01:07.060> canon<00:01:07.719> printers<00:01:08.109> is<00:01:08.289> that<00:01:09.280> they<00:01:09.460> have<00:01:09.759> a

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:09.999 
my canon printers is that they have a

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.809 
my canon printers is that they have a
chroma<00:01:10.450> life<00:01:10.810> 100<00:01:11.649> plus<00:01:11.950> promise<00:01:12.609> and

chroma life 100 plus promise and

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:15.270 
chroma life 100 plus promise and
basically<00:01:13.630> what<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:13.899> means<00:01:14.049> is<00:01:14.469> your<00:01:14.950> photos

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280

last<00:04:20.829> thing<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:21.160> wanted<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.489> talk<00:04:21.729> about<00:04:21.940> before

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
last thing I wanted to talk about before

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.469 
last thing I wanted to talk about before
we<00:04:22.750> go<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.979> difference<00:04:24.430> between<00:04:24.610> the

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
we go is the difference between the

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.880 
we go is the difference between the
glossy<00:04:26.050> in<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.410> mat<00:04:26.760> so<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:29.410> might<00:04:29.680> be<00:04:29.710> a

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
glossy in the mat so it might be a

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.959 
glossy in the mat so it might be a
little<00:04:30.220> bit<00:04:30.460> hard

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
little bit hard

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.149 
little bit hard
to<00:04:31.239> show<00:04:31.539> up<00:04:31.779> the<00:04:32.139> difference<00:04:32.349> on<00:04:32.799> camera

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
to show up the difference on camera

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.509 
to show up the difference on camera
because<00:04:33.879> as<00:04:34.569> far<00:04:34.629> as<00:04:34.869> print<00:04:35.619> quality<00:04:35.829> you're

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:36.519 
because as far as print quality you're

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.549 
because as far as print quality you're
going<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:36.759> get<00:04:36.879> a<00:04:36.939> great<00:04:37.569> print<00:04:38.079> either<00:04:38.289> way

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:38.559 
going to get a great print either way

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:40.589 
going to get a great print either way
whether<00:04:39.039> you<00:04:39.309> use<00:04:39.339> the<00:04:39.699> glossy<00:04:40.179> or<00:04:40.209> whether

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
whether you use the glossy or whether

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.689 
whether you use the glossy or whether
you<00:04:40.869> use<00:04:40.899> the<00:04:41.229> mat<00:04:41.469> so<00:04:41.979> really<00:04:42.369> where<00:04:42.579> the

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
you use the mat so really where the

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.339 
you use the mat so really where the
difference<00:04:42.909> comes<00:04:43.239> in<00:04:43.629> is<00:04:43.779> what<00:04:44.049> kind<00:04:44.259> of

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
difference comes in is what kind of

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.979 
difference comes in is what kind of
Sheen<00:04:44.709> you<00:04:45.039> want<00:04:45.309> the<00:04:45.729> glossy<00:04:46.179> obviously<00:04:46.839> is

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:46.989 
Sheen you want the glossy obviously is

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:48.600 
Sheen you want the glossy obviously is
going<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.229> be<00:04:47.319> a<00:04:47.349> little<00:04:47.529> bit<00:04:47.709> more<00:04:47.799> shiny<00:04:48.249> a

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
going to be a little bit more shiny a

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.059 
going to be a little bit more shiny a
little<00:04:48.879> bit<00:04:48.999> more<00:04:49.119> crisp<00:04:49.479> I<00:04:49.689> think<00:04:50.110> personally

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:52.239 
I think it looks a little bit a little

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:55.049 
I think it looks a little bit a little
more<00:04:52.689> professional<00:04:53.249> the<00:04:54.249> one<00:04:54.459> thing<00:04:54.579> I<00:04:54.669> love
