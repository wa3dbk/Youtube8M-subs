eugenics and evolution and wants to make
the<00:00:51.180> argument<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:52.039> evolution<00:00:53.039> justifies

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the argument that evolution justifies

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.990 
the argument that evolution justifies
the<00:00:54.300> idea<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.989> eugenics<00:00:55.770> well<00:00:56.070> rather<00:00:56.579> than<00:00:56.850> me

his video so you can go and have a look

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.830 
his video so you can go and have a look
at<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.490> where<00:01:56.700> he<00:01:56.820> makes<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.299> argument

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
at that where he makes that argument

at that where he makes that argument
instead<00:01:58.290> i<00:01:58.439> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> make<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> different

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
instead i want to make a different

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.370 
instead i want to make a different
argument<00:01:59.610> just<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> substance<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.020> of

argument just on the substance of of

evolutionary theory itself and comparing

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.319 
evolutionary theory itself and comparing
it<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.020> eugenics<00:02:04.619> because<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.399> seems<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.939> me
