00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.430
 hello a big hello to all those who 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.440
 are watching this video 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.390
 today we are going to deal with a problem that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.720
 makes it increasingly common with computers 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.720
 From now 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.919
 and esque 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.449
 when you want to format one of the 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:33.149
 brand computers such as lenovo 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.850
 sony vaio some six be and others 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.460
 marks this error occurs that we see in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.579
 screen 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.469
 so the specific product key 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.150
 does not match any of the images 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.850
 of windows available 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.850
 this this problem can be avoided 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.360
 in two ways but you can only be a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.630
 through booting through memory 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.940
 usb is to say 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.010
 you want to format this 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.110
 computer that presented this problem 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.500
 they can only do it through a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 pendrive puteando the operating system to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 Through this time to teach 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.160
 how to install an operating system or 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.130
 create a bootable disk from a memory 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.430
 usb here I leave the link of a video 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.330
 where I explain this video we're just going to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.330
 try 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.540
 promptly the problem already with the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.040
 operating system mounted in the memory 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.040
 so 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.660
 once you detected in this error and 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.420
 they already have the operating system mounted 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.670
 in memory what they have to do is 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.340
 the following 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.180
 me in the description of the video them 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.500
 I'm going to leave the files 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.750
 they are compressed in winrar format and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.740
 according to the operating system that you 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.410
 are going to use then in my case it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.170
 it comes to windows 8 there are two versions one 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.690
 is the ultimate version that usually 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.910
 which is downloaded from the internet and 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.830
 enterprise version that is one more action 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.210
 complex and heavier this windows 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.230
 So what do we have to do? 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.950
 boys 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.330
 and girls once they download the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.530
 file that I leave the link in the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.299
 description of the video and that identify 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.659
 what is the operating system that are going to 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.549
 use then open the folder and go 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.610
 to find this blog notes with this 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:42.690
 cfg extension 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.390
 but we open and they will find this 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.850
 code that what this code does this 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.700
 code is going to prevent windows from 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.950
 generates the error that does not allow 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.380
 you train on your computer is 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.660
 to say what it does is to avoid being asked 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.840
 the activation key in advance 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.610
 to continue with the installation and 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.160
 the formatting of the computer 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.680
 then once you have the 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.200
 file can download it in the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.630
 desk or wherever so that they 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.280
 stay like this alone do not go to 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.690
 replace 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.480
 from the compressed file leave it like this 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.770
 alone the notepad loose in the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.480
 desk then you have it there 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.110
 they look for their usb memory where they have 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.360
 installed where where they created the disk 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.750
 boot of the operating system in 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.550
 this case I have the windows 8.1 that I 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.120
 he presented this same error that they see in 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:48.160
 screen at this moment I'm 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:53.260
 formatting a lenovo 845 then 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.780
 I got this solution worked for me and I 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.910
 I share this you then we open 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.890
 the usb memory where we have 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.440
 the operating system and we look for the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.020
 shows folder is 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.120
 in this case this one that I'm pointing out 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.030
 here 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.790
 is here 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.229
 once he identifies it they open it 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.310
 and ready and we take the file from the notebook 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.310
 notes that we had identified 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.700
 and we drop directly into this folder 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.630
 then there he will tell you that 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.569
 replace the destination file and to 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.789
 accept the replacement century 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.479
 in my case, it has already replaced it 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.479
 that in this 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.919
 this once does they do that they can already 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.009
 flip the computer again with the 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.630
 usb memory has already made this change in 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.290
 the folder song cesc and 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.790
 you have to start the installation 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.200
 of the operating system without any 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.270
 problem 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.610
 that's all friends in the description of 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.530
 video I leave some configurations 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.290
 what do they do in the bio of these 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.570
 computers especially the order 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.180
 so that they configure it and they can 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.430
 flip from your usb memory many 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.780
 thank you the course 'attention and we hope 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.780
 that you have liked the good
