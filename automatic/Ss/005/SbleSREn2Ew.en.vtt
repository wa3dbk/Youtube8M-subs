power the boards and also the separately

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.680 
power the boards and also the separately
in<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> clean<00:01:25.920> manner<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.460> engines<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.660> I

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
in a clean manner the engines so I

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.109 
in a clean manner the engines so I
connect<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> battery<00:01:31.490> we<00:01:32.490> hear<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> phone

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
connect the battery we hear the phone

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.170 
connect the battery we hear the phone
beeps<00:01:33.650> corresponding<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> phone<00:01:36.030> as

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
beeps corresponding to the phone as

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
beeps corresponding to the phone as
battery<00:01:37.940> so<00:01:38.940> now<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> am<00:01:39.720> step<00:01:40.619> 6<00:01:41.040> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
battery so now I am step 6 of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.350 
battery so now I am step 6 of
calibration

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
calibration

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749 
calibration
I<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.660> calibrated<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.470> asks<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> when<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I have calibrated the asks and when I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:56.780 
I have calibrated the asks and when I
move<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.270> throttle<00:01:45.420> stick

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.580 

we<00:01:57.790> hear<00:01:58.030> very<00:01:58.270> well<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:59.260> have<00:01:59.410> a

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
we hear very well that I have a

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.070 
we hear very well that I have a
progressive<00:01:59.950> throttle<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.810> at

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
progressive throttle so this is at

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.060 
progressive throttle so this is at
calibration<00:02:03.300> moment

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.100 

this<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.220> when<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.760> signal<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
this is when the signal of the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.410 
this is when the signal of the
transmitter<00:02:14.740> directly<00:02:15.550> transmitted<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
transmitter directly transmitted to the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.870 
transmitter directly transmitted to the
asks<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.010> last<00:02:18.370> step<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
asks now the last step of the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.000 
asks now the last step of the
calibration<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.960> unplug<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.410> battery

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
calibration is to unplug the battery

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.960 
calibration is to unplug the battery
plug<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.160> again<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:28.860> will<00:02:29.860> arm<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.310> mode<00:02:30.730> the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.160 
3 in which correspond to throttle 990 89
is<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.519> minimum<00:03:39.980> throttle<00:03:41.510> at<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.810> moment

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
is the minimum throttle at the moment

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.030 
is the minimum throttle at the moment
you<00:03:43.409> see<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.069> gives<00:03:44.220> out<00:03:46.040> 985

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
you see that it gives out 985

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.220 
you see that it gives out 985
practically<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.609> same<00:03:47.790> value<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.989> four

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
practically the same value on the four

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:57.110 
practically the same value on the four
motors<00:03:50.989> now<00:03:51.989> if<00:03:52.349> I<00:03:52.790> increase<00:03:55.190> just<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.370> bit<00:03:56.579> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
motors now if I increase just a bit the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:07.470 
motors now if I increase just a bit the
throttle

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.870 

you<00:04:08.019> see<00:04:08.319> that's

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.190 

you<00:04:11.880> see<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.300> just<00:04:12.570> with<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> minimum

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
you see that just with a minimum

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.580 
you see that just with a minimum
throttle<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.890> jumps<00:04:14.280> immediately<00:04:15.240> from<00:04:15.600> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
throttle it jumps immediately from the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.130 
throttle it jumps immediately from the
new<00:04:16.980> value<00:04:17.660> 985<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:20.090> very<00:04:21.090> high<00:04:21.300> speed<00:04:21.690> engines

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
new value 985 to very high speed engines

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:33.230 
new value 985 to very high speed engines
we<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.470> hear<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.700> throttle<00:04:33.000> stick

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
we can hear it so and the throttle stick

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.720 
we can hear it so and the throttle stick
was<00:04:33.480> barely<00:04:33.750> moved<00:04:34.080> upwards<00:04:34.980> so<00:04:35.220> there<00:04:35.430> is<00:04:35.550> no

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
was barely moved upwards so there is no

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.590 
was barely moved upwards so there is no
progressive<00:04:36.150> throttle<00:04:36.840> at<00:04:37.020> all<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.420> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
progressive throttle at all this is the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.410 
progressive throttle at all this is the
issue<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:40.200> I<00:04:40.260> have
