00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
this engines been on a steam test

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.030 
this engines been on a steam test
because<00:02:23.930> every<00:02:24.110> once<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.440> while<00:02:24.590> things<00:02:24.860> go

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
because every once in a while things go

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.170 
because every once in a while things go
wrong<00:02:25.190> with<00:02:25.370> them<00:02:25.459> they<00:02:25.550> need<00:02:25.670> lots<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.060> lots

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
wrong with them they need lots and lots

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.930 
wrong with them they need lots and lots
of<00:02:26.330> TLC<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.410> every<00:02:28.070> once<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.430> while<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.850> get

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
of TLC so every once in a while you get

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.430 
of TLC so every once in a while you get
a<00:02:29.000> little<00:02:29.209> batch<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.510> defects<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.170> fix

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
a little batch of defects and you fix

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.440 
a little batch of defects and you fix
the<00:02:30.590> problems<00:02:31.010> or<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.310> big<00:02:31.459> problem<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.030> then

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the problems or the big problem and then

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.030 
the problems or the big problem and then
you<00:02:32.600> do<00:02:32.750> what's<00:02:32.930> called<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.200> steam<00:02:33.350> test<00:02:33.680> you

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
you do what's called a steam test you

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.620 
you do what's called a steam test you
put<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> fire<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.090> bring<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.390> up<00:02:35.480> to

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
put a fire in it and you bring it up to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.150 
put a fire in it and you bring it up to

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
to go anywhere and then you just test

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.600 
to go anywhere and then you just test
the<00:02:38.990> components<00:02:39.620> or<00:02:39.709> components<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.459> you've
