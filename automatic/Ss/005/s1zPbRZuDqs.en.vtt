00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
my name is William Perkinson and I'm

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.649 
my name is William Perkinson and I'm
here<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.700> tell<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:02.909> how<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.060> empty<00:00:03.330> the

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
here to tell you how to empty the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:04.490 
here to tell you how to empty the
garbage<00:00:03.689> disposal

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
garbage disposal

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.430 
garbage disposal
now<00:00:05.279> hopefully<00:00:05.580> your<00:00:06.359> garbage<00:00:06.600> disposal<00:00:06.690> does

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
now hopefully your garbage disposal does

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.230 
now hopefully your garbage disposal does
not<00:00:07.589> get<00:00:07.770> filled<00:00:08.099> because<00:00:08.490> once<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.970> flip<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
not get filled because once you flip the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.509 
not get filled because once you flip the
switch<00:00:09.269> its<00:00:09.660> supposed<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.990> empty

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
switch its supposed to empty

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.799 
switch its supposed to empty
automatically<00:00:11.519> but<00:00:11.910> from<00:00:12.090> time<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.420> time<00:00:12.450> we

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
automatically but from time to time we

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.999 
automatically but from time to time we
put<00:00:12.960> things<00:00:13.170> down<00:00:13.320> there<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.679> shouldn't

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
put things down there that we shouldn't

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.279 
put things down there that we shouldn't
or<00:00:14.849> sometimes<00:00:15.299> like<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> paper<00:00:15.690> towel<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.170> get

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
or sometimes like a paper towel can get

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.380 
or sometimes like a paper towel can get
down<00:00:16.410> there<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.680> clog<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.279> anyway<00:00:18.180> but

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
down there and clog it up and anyway but

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.900 
down there and clog it up and anyway but
then<00:00:18.539> you'll<00:00:18.810> know<00:00:19.070> by<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> smell<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.760> it's

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
then you'll know by the smell that it's

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.000 
then you'll know by the smell that it's
time<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.210> empty<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.510> baby<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:22.890> we'll

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
time to empty that baby but what we'll

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.230 
time to empty that baby but what we'll
do<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.279> we'll<00:00:23.400> reach<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.000> there<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
do is we'll reach in and there is a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.259 
do is we'll reach in and there is a
rubber<00:00:24.660> fitting<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.800> keeps<00:00:26.340> spoons<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
rubber fitting that keeps spoons and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.670 
rubber fitting that keeps spoons and
stuff<00:00:27.480> hopefully<00:00:28.080> from<00:00:28.199> falling<00:00:28.470> down<00:00:28.560> in

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
stuff hopefully from falling down in

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.660 
stuff hopefully from falling down in
there<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.250> friction<00:00:29.460> fit

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
there and it's just a friction fit

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.669 
there and it's just a friction fit
you'll<00:00:30.480> stick<00:00:30.660> two<00:00:30.810> fingers<00:00:31.170> through<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you'll stick two fingers through the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.610 
you'll stick two fingers through the
middle<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.120> pop<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.390> looks<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.559> like

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
middle and pop it out looks about like

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.950 
middle and pop it out looks about like
this<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.489> sometimes<00:00:35.880> around<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> edges<00:00:36.719> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
this now sometimes around the edges you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.709 
this now sometimes around the edges you
can<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.500> odor<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.340> buildup<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> smells

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
can get odor and get buildup and smells

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.049 
can get odor and get buildup and smells
funny<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.620> put<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> dishwasher<00:00:41.250> but

just for for general cleaning out of the
chamber<00:01:22.170> there<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.220> take<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.490> ice<00:01:24.590> pour

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
chamber there we can take some ice pour

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
chamber there we can take some ice pour
it<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.950> fill<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.400> ice<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it in there and fill it up with ice and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.899 
it in there and fill it up with ice and
if<00:01:27.570> you've<00:01:27.720> got<00:01:27.900> some<00:01:28.229> say<00:01:29.130> rock<00:01:29.369> salt<00:01:29.700> for
