00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 today with again current cod news like 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.020
 I think you can bring in the moment 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.700
 not so much content though 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.349
 It's really important to me that you always 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.330
 be up to date with the cod 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.490
 news and that's why we catch 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 right away 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 Today, something was released or confirmed 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.650
 from activision and that you have today 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.390
 in ingame chat so if you like that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.000
 first time logs in cod 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.890
 or the first time today then 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.990
 pops up a message and that is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.489
 that this 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.170
 here in German actually only 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.360
 that one has to buy the season pass 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.629
 should and for epic cards to one 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.590
 grand awards and blablabla 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.809
 however, it stands in the English 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.149
 version then a little more in it 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.809
 and what for example download 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.410
 weapons so it is dlc weapons give 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.840
 so i can only speak english if you like 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.370
 as they say so dlc weapons it will be in 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.050
 give the six weapons and the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.559
 The point is not it will be one 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.450
 but there will be weapons 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.280
 that means it will simply be several weapons 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.670
 give the ones purely patched into the game 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.470
 become 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.880
 and I'm pretty curious what 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.460
 I'll give it there for weapons 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.100
 personally for such a ne really 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.330
 really cool sng something like an op 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.290
 or mp5 from black ops 2 or acker or 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.020
 something like that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.509
 or how about such a thing 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.659
 nice aka from black ops 1 that would be it 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.180
 but so I personally like it 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.759
 totally if weapons when I arms out 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.829
 have old games because that's so cool 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.210
 just such a beautiful ak lies 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.680
 easy in every game because you are in one 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.540
 another game already so much with it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.220
 You have experience in me 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.500
 the comments write which weapon 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.590
 you would prefer which ones, so to speak 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.060
 you're hoping to come back and I would from 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.710
 you also want to know what 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.079
 ye shall keep it that again purely weapons 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.540
 patched it will be much map 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.159
 give packs and overall if you have the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.689
 doing in a certain order and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.729
 the english pronunciation then there is 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.110
 So for the people who are still up there 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.329
 did not hear that a bit 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 older news yes I just want to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.849
 Know what you think about it I'm out 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.849
