00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.150 
this episode I just want to show you how
to<00:00:29.250> reduce<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.939> brightness<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:31.800> couple<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to reduce the brightness of a couple of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.500 
to reduce the brightness of a couple of
windows<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.120> clearly<00:00:33.690> blown<00:00:34.140> out

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
windows that are clearly blown out

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.869 
windows that are clearly blown out
basically<00:00:37.190> what<00:00:38.190> I've<00:00:38.309> done<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.730> I've

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
basically what I've done here is I've

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.080 
basically what I've done here is I've
taken<00:00:39.059> seven<00:00:39.540> exposures<00:00:40.399> nice<00:00:41.399> place<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
taken seven exposures nice place and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.260 
taken seven exposures nice place and
then<00:00:42.600> I've<00:00:42.750> fused<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:43.440> into<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.640> once

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
then I've fused them into this so once

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.229 
then I've fused them into this so once
again<00:00:45.420> here's<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.440> exposure<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
again here's your first exposure and

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
again here's your first exposure and
there's<00:00:48.239> refused<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:49.520> there's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> problem

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
there's refused now there's a problem

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.520 
there's refused now there's a problem
and<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.390> think<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> that's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and I think you can see it that's

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.869 
and I think you can see it that's
probably<00:00:52.860> actually<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.280> couple<00:00:53.460> problems<00:00:53.670> with

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
probably actually a couple problems with

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.819 
probably actually a couple problems with
this<00:00:54.000> first<00:00:54.360> off<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.840> entire<00:00:55.079> view<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> blown

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
this first off the entire view is blown

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.670 
this first off the entire view is blown
out<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.750> good<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.379> good<00:00:58.440> at

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
out it's it's it's not good not good at

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.160 
out it's it's it's not good not good at
all<00:00:59.149> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
all and then there's this little bit of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
all and then there's this little bit of
glare<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.710> over<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> end<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
glare thing over here not the end of the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.840 
glare thing over here not the end of the
world<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> recover

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
world but what you can do to recover

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.480 
world but what you can do to recover
this<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.950> unfortunately<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.340> plan

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
this is unfortunately you have to plan

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.609 
this is unfortunately you have to plan
ahead<00:01:08.670> because<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.619> negative<00:01:10.619> 3<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.369> terms<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
ahead because at negative 3 in terms of

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
ahead because at negative 3 in terms of
bracketing<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.430> still<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.729> view<00:01:15.180> it's

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
bracketing this is still your view it's

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.450 
bracketing this is still your view it's
still<00:01:15.750> way<00:01:16.259> blown<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.280> was

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
still way blown out and I think this was

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.460 
still way blown out and I think this was
taken<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.450> sixtieth<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.080> second

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
taken that one one sixtieth of a second

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
taken that one one sixtieth of a second
plants<00:01:20.400> are<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> view<00:01:21.240> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
plants are all right but the view is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.760 
plants are all right but the view is
still<00:01:21.479> been<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.869> what<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> did<00:01:22.110> was<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.500> popped

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
still been so what I did was I popped

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.890 
still been so what I did was I popped
off<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.330> thousandth<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
off one and one one thousandth of a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.499 
off one and one one thousandth of a
second<00:01:25.229> our<00:01:25.979> plants<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.580> gone<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.090> our<00:01:27.210> view

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
second our plants are gone but our view

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.160 
second our plants are gone but our view
is<00:01:27.540> intact<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.579> need<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.720> ahead<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
is intact so we need to go ahead and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.990 
is intact so we need to go ahead and
kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> put<00:01:31.920> these<00:01:32.070> together<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> one

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
kind of put these together put that one

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.080 
kind of put these together put that one
in<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.360> together<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:35.939> we

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
in that one together so what we do is we

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
in that one together so what we do is we
take<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.450> Photoshop<00:01:37.159> put<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.280> both<00:01:38.400> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
take it in Photoshop put them both in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
take it in Photoshop put them both in
the<00:01:38.579> same<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.420> find<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:40.200> not

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the same you know find them what not

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.120 
the same you know find them what not
make<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> visible<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> layer<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:44.009> we

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
make it visible make a layer and then we

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.639 
make it visible make a layer and then we
cover<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.820> oops<00:01:45.390> okay<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
cover that up oops okay so it this is

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.429 
cover that up oops okay so it this is
going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> really<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.600> ugly<00:01:51.600> but

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
going to be really really ugly but

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.270 
going to be really really ugly but
anyway<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.520> paint<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> back<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.420> and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
anyway you just paint that back on and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.090 
anyway you just paint that back on and
kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.670> hoops<00:01:57.560> kind<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.770> some<00:01:59.009> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
kind of get hoops kind of get some of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.209 
kind of get hoops kind of get some of
that<00:01:59.219> back<00:01:59.430> now<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.060> would<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.450> taking<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:00.930> time

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
that back now I would be taking my time

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.230 
that back now I would be taking my time
obviously<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.430> were<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.090> real

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
obviously if I were to do this for real

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.539 
obviously if I were to do this for real
in<00:02:03.869> fact<00:02:04.049> when<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.290> did<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.159> real<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
in fact when I did do this for real it

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.190 
in fact when I did do this for real it
took<00:02:06.180> me<00:02:06.329> about<00:02:06.450> an<00:02:06.600> hour<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> half<00:02:07.049> in

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
took me about an hour and a half in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.260 
took me about an hour and a half in
post-production<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.920> get<00:02:08.039> everything<00:02:08.940> right

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
post-production to get everything right

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.040 
post-production to get everything right
so<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.080> said<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.860> before<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
so I said this before the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.590 
so I said this before the
benefit<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.620> exposure<00:02:13.460> fusion<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.420> field

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
benefit of exposure fusion in the field

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.030 
benefit of exposure fusion in the field
is<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.990> can<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.230> very<00:02:15.440> efficient<00:02:15.920> you

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
is that you can be very efficient you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.860 
is that you can be very efficient you
can<00:02:16.070> move<00:02:16.280> quickly<00:02:16.340> from<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.540> place<00:02:17.840> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
can move quickly from one place to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.530 
can move quickly from one place to
another<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.280> downside<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.240> you<00:02:20.420> can

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
another but the downside is that you can

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.970 
another but the downside is that you can
spend<00:02:20.780> most<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.020> your<00:02:21.080> time<00:02:21.200> sitting<00:02:21.740> in<00:02:21.890> front

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
spend most of your time sitting in front

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.260 
spend most of your time sitting in front
of<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.190> computer<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.820> if<00:02:22.910> that's<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.180> you

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
of a computer and if that's what you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.810 
of a computer and if that's what you
want<00:02:23.450> that's<00:02:23.570> fine<00:02:23.690> I'm<00:02:24.280> okay<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.490> it's

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
want that's fine I'm okay with that it's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.080 
want that's fine I'm okay with that it's
you<00:02:26.240> know<00:02:26.350> nothing<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.500> world<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:27.770> anyway

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
you know nothing of the world but anyway

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.470 
you know nothing of the world but anyway
so<00:02:29.230> we've<00:02:30.230> got<00:02:30.410> our<00:02:30.440> view<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:32.120> what<00:02:32.210> we<00:02:32.300> need<00:02:32.420> to

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
so we've got our view so what we need to

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.240 
so we've got our view so what we need to
do<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.810> bring<00:02:33.080> back<00:02:33.290> some<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.530> those<00:02:33.680> plants<00:02:34.130> so

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
do is bring back some of those plants so

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.910 
do is bring back some of those plants so
we<00:02:34.340> bring<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.700> down<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:35.000> about<00:02:35.560> bring<00:02:36.560> our<00:02:36.650> flow

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
we bring it down to about bring our flow

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.590 
we bring it down to about bring our flow
down<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.400> about<00:02:37.550> ten<00:02:37.760> percent<00:02:37.880> or<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.180> and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
down to about ten percent or so and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.720 
down to about ten percent or so and
bring<00:02:39.290> them<00:02:39.470> back<00:02:39.500> put<00:02:39.920> their<00:02:40.040> fake<00:02:40.370> looking

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
bring them back put their fake looking

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.040 
bring them back put their fake looking
they're<00:02:40.910> really<00:02:41.150> really<00:02:41.240> fake<00:02:41.540> looking<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:41.960> if

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
they're really really fake looking so if

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.320 
they're really really fake looking so if
we<00:02:42.140> wanted<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.500> do<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:42.740> correctly<00:02:43.210> what<00:02:44.210> we

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
we wanted to do this correctly what we

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.720 
we wanted to do this correctly what we
would<00:02:44.480> do<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.960> we'd<00:02:45.260> get<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.800> one<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.580> is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
would do is we'd get this one this is

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.940 
would do is we'd get this one this is
our<00:02:46.850> negative<00:02:47.180> 3<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.570> we<00:02:48.320> bring<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.770> one

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
our negative 3 and we bring that one

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.310 
our negative 3 and we bring that one
into<00:02:49.130> Photoshop<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:49.760> well<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.320> basically

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
into Photoshop as well and basically

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.950 
into Photoshop as well and basically
mask<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.980> off<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.880> we'd<00:02:53.030> have<00:02:53.060> good<00:02:53.540> plants

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
mask that off so we'd have good plants

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.170 
mask that off so we'd have good plants
good<00:02:54.470> view<00:02:54.740> but<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.520> still<00:02:55.820> doesn't<00:02:55.910> look

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
good view but it still doesn't look

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.450 
good view but it still doesn't look
right<00:02:56.390> looks<00:02:56.900> super<00:02:57.410> fake<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.130> we're<00:02:58.280> going<00:02:58.340> to

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
right looks super fake so we're going to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.210 
right looks super fake so we're going to
bring<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.730> down<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.900> we're<00:03:00.830> losing<00:03:01.130> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
bring it down and and we're losing the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.490 
bring it down and and we're losing the
view<00:03:01.400> every<00:03:01.700> time<00:03:01.880> we<00:03:02.030> bring<00:03:02.240> this<00:03:02.450> down<00:03:02.870> you

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
view every time we bring this down you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.890 
view every time we bring this down you
know<00:03:03.680> our<00:03:03.950> opacity<00:03:04.340> but<00:03:05.270> that's<00:03:05.420> incredibly

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
know our opacity but that's incredibly

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.510 
know our opacity but that's incredibly
important<00:03:06.260> because<00:03:06.350> we<00:03:06.560> don't<00:03:06.800> want<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.310> to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
important because we don't want it to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.030 
important because we don't want it to
look<00:03:07.670> painted<00:03:07.970> on<00:03:08.240> it<00:03:08.510> can't<00:03:09.020> be<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.740> can't<00:03:09.770> be

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
look painted on it can't be it can't be

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.830 
look painted on it can't be it can't be
fake<00:03:10.220> looking<00:03:10.490> it<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.880> brighter<00:03:11.210> outside<00:03:11.450> than

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
fake looking it is brighter outside than

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.980 
fake looking it is brighter outside than
it<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.050> on<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.290> inside<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.580> maybe<00:03:14.150> about<00:03:14.420> 70

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
it is on the inside so maybe about 70

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.570 
it is on the inside so maybe about 70
some<00:03:15.170> percent<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.740> keep<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.100> mind<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.550> have

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
some percent and keep in mind you have

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.790 
some percent and keep in mind you have
to<00:03:16.760> imagine<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:17.959> actually<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.560> way<00:03:18.680> it

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
to imagine that is actually the way it

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.840 
to imagine that is actually the way it
should<00:03:18.860> look<00:03:19.180> with<00:03:20.180> those<00:03:20.690> plants<00:03:21.520> but<00:03:22.520> for

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
should look with those plants but for

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.940 
should look with those plants but for
the<00:03:22.910> most<00:03:23.060> part<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.630> mean<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:24.410> our<00:03:24.440> tutorials

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
the most part I mean for our tutorials

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.010 
the most part I mean for our tutorials
sake<00:03:25.130> this<00:03:25.730> is<00:03:25.880> how<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.060> do<00:03:26.330> it<00:03:26.360> same<00:03:26.810> thing

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
sake this is how you do it same thing

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.350 
sake this is how you do it same thing
down<00:03:27.140> here<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.560> mask<00:03:27.830> off<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.370> this

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
down here you just mask off that this

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.870 
down here you just mask off that this
glare<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:30.020> can<00:03:30.380> also<00:03:30.530> be<00:03:30.890> gotten<00:03:31.700> rid<00:03:31.730> of

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
glare here can also be gotten rid of

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.530 
glare here can also be gotten rid of
just<00:03:32.510> same<00:03:33.140> way<00:03:33.380> I'm<00:03:33.950> just<00:03:34.459> there<00:03:35.270> we<00:03:35.360> go<00:03:35.450> I

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
just same way I'm just there we go I

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.090 
just same way I'm just there we go I
tapped<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.900> few<00:03:36.020> times<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.470> eleven

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
tapped it a few times that eleven

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.580 
tapped it a few times that eleven
percent<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.940> tapped<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.300> a<00:03:38.360> few<00:03:38.480> times<00:03:38.590> that

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
percent is tapped it a few times that

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.690 
percent is tapped it a few times that
basically<00:03:40.300> brings<00:03:41.300> back<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:42.310> black<00:03:43.310> part

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
basically brings back this black part

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.120 
basically brings back this black part
right<00:03:43.970> there<00:03:44.000> now<00:03:44.690> yeah<00:03:44.989> it's<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:45.980> not

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
right there now yeah it's it's not

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.610 
right there now yeah it's it's not
perfect<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:46.880> in<00:03:47.540> retrospect<00:03:47.870> thinking<00:03:48.500> about

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
perfect and in retrospect thinking about

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.380 
perfect and in retrospect thinking about
this<00:03:48.830> what<00:03:49.010> I<00:03:49.040> should<00:03:49.400> have<00:03:49.430> done<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.940> couple<00:03:50.180> of

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
this what I should have done a couple of

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.630 
this what I should have done a couple of
things<00:03:50.500> see<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.650> shadow<00:03:51.890> up<00:03:52.160> there<00:03:52.370> it's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
things see that shadow up there it's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.250 
things see that shadow up there it's
coming<00:03:52.850> from<00:03:52.910> that<00:03:53.000> light<00:03:53.360> I'm<00:03:53.570> not<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.020> big<00:03:54.230> fan

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
coming from that light I'm not a big fan

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.520 
coming from that light I'm not a big fan
of<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.739> what<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:55.760> am<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> fan<00:03:56.300> of<00:03:56.330> is<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.930> organic

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
of it what I am a fan of is the organic

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.620 
of it what I am a fan of is the organic
light<00:03:57.890> that's<00:03:58.220> coming<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.850> from<00:03:59.120> this<00:03:59.300> big

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
light that's coming in from this big

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.260 
light that's coming in from this big
open<00:04:00.380> space<00:04:00.860> coming<00:04:01.580> in<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:01.850> filling<00:04:01.970> up<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
open space coming in and filling up the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.150 
open space coming in and filling up the
room<00:04:02.300> I<00:04:02.630> really<00:04:03.170> like<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.590> but<00:04:03.980> what<00:04:04.130> I

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
room I really like that but what I

room I really like that but what I
should<00:04:04.430> have<00:04:04.459> done<00:04:04.690> was<00:04:05.690> pop<00:04:05.989> off<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.440> flash<00:04:06.920> to

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
should have done was pop off a flash to

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.910 
should have done was pop off a flash to
my<00:04:07.310> left<00:04:07.610> where<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:07.970> was<00:04:08.330> diffused<00:04:09.290> not<00:04:09.590> hard

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
my left where I was diffused not hard

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.740 
my left where I was diffused not hard
flash<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:10.430> never<00:04:10.580> just<00:04:10.760> want<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.000> use<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.300> bear

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
get all these hard edges just like you

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.360 
get all these hard edges just like you
would<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.140> portrait<00:04:15.590> think<00:04:15.920> of<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.220> same

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
would in a portrait think of it the same

would in a portrait think of it the same
way<00:04:16.640> you<00:04:16.700> know<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.480> wanted<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.750> fuse<00:04:18.019> that

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
way you know you wanted to fuse that

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.320 
way you know you wanted to fuse that
thing<00:04:18.350> maybe<00:04:18.500> with<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.709> bedsheet<00:04:19.330> something

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
thing maybe with a bedsheet something

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.080 
thing maybe with a bedsheet something
very<00:04:20.510> large<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.080> you'd<00:04:21.890> want<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.310> at<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.760> very

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090

low power and just to just to fill in
those<00:04:27.780> tiny<00:04:28.260> bits<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.560> shadows<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.040> basically

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
those tiny bits of shadows and basically

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.820 
those tiny bits of shadows and basically
give<00:04:30.000> some<00:04:30.240> light<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.410> side<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.770> the

give some light to the side of the
cabinet<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.210> definitely<00:04:33.630> needs<00:04:33.720> some

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
cabinet that that definitely needs some

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.680 
cabinet that that definitely needs some

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
light and you know I can't I can't go

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.750 
light and you know I can't I can't go
back<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.020> do<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.110> again<00:04:37.230> but<00:04:37.770> live<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.640> learn
