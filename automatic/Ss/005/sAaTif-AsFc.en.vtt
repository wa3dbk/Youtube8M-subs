 hello youtube here the team 29 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.299
 bringing it is a new video and today we are going 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.670
 to review what is the installation of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.570
 g7 for the ipad2 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.570
 let's go with the intro 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.700
 to 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.810
 well from the computer we will see 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.660
 that we have the ipad2 with the ios 6 points 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.810
 1.3 we need as a first measure 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.300
 have our device in the last 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.879
 operating system that has left for 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.710
 him at this time as you know the 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.900
 17 is available only for 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.230
 developers but we can install it 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.320
 in this way we also need the ios 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.510
 7 the ip is double that we will be able to 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.580
 download from a page that I'm going to 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.760
 leave here in the description once 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.520
 we have this let's see itunes 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.190
 from our pc we are going to need to have 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.690
 press the shift key and click 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.300
 Well, what is it to look for? 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.220
 update or from a mac we're going to 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.010
 need to press the control key and 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.900
 We are going to click on 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.570
 look for update once we do 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.460
 this is going to open a window in the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.650
 what are we going to look for the operating system 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.510
 that we download now asks us 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.960
 confirm if we want to update you 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.450
 We update and begins what 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.970
 the software extraction here is 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.890
 delay to a few minutes but let's go 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.600
 to advance a bit the video in this 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.720
 point is already finishing extracting what 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.640
 what is the software and we will continue to 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.650
 which is the next step that is the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.310
 verification of the update and 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.829
 prepare the ipad to update 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.380
 and all those steps that we are going to omit 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.509
 we go something that interests us that when 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.520
 is already finishing the operation in this 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.020
 point already begins as such the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.939
 software update then 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.070
 let's wait for it to finish loading 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.570
 all the update and we're seeing in 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.610
 real time what is happening in 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.620
 our good ipad is verifying what 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.800
 which is the ipad software in some 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.330
 instants will be removed and what is the 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.670
 ipad recognition of our 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.010
 computer and let's move on to follow the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.590
 video on the ipad to perform the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.989
 respective installation of all 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.910
 configurations already on the ipad we are 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.830
 with the welcome screen and we're going 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.370
 now to proceed to what is the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.620
 configuration of the device as such and 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.870
 then let's unlock this 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.190
 we open as it already appears that the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.340
 update is complete we give in 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.440
 continue 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.750
 allows us to ask us to activate the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.290
 location I'm going to deactivate it 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.500
 ok let's continue now at this point 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.980
 I will omit what is the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.330
 air configuration and apo and no 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.700
 I want any kind of block in the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.120
 device then let's see that already 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.610
 we have installed what is ios 7 in 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.830
 our ipad we check the control 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.930
 center and here is perfect let's see 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.450
 now what is the center of 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.150
 notifications and we moved a bit the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.599
 camera but it was perfect just like what 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.250
 which is year 7 for other devices 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.170
