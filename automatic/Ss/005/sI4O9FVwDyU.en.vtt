00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
oh hi there obviously here in the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.290 
oh hi there obviously here in the
reverse<00:00:02.190> osmosis<00:00:02.340> section<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.120> website

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
reverse osmosis section of the website

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.180 
reverse osmosis section of the website
or<00:00:03.780> you're<00:00:04.049> on<00:00:04.080> one<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.440> our<00:00:04.589> reverse<00:00:04.890> osmosis

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
or you're on one of our reverse osmosis

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.880 
or you're on one of our reverse osmosis
specials<00:00:05.790> pages<00:00:06.299> so<00:00:07.049> basically<00:00:07.560> what<00:00:07.799> I'm

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
specials pages so basically what I'm

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.110 
specials pages so basically what I'm
going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.040> do<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.280> run<00:00:08.460> through<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.730> reversal

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
going to do is run through the reversal

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120 
going to do is run through the reversal
spaces<00:00:09.540> like<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.410> would<00:00:10.530> say<00:00:10.650> anyone<00:00:10.860> who<00:00:10.920> came

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
spaces like it would say anyone who came

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.039 
spaces like it would say anyone who came
into<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:11.490> shop<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:12.240> give<00:00:12.360> me<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> bit<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.630> an<00:00:12.780> idea

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
into my shop to give me a bit of an idea

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.620 
into my shop to give me a bit of an idea
and<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> feel<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> products<00:00:14.089> and<00:00:15.089> maybe<00:00:15.509> to

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and a feel for the products and maybe to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.790 
and a feel for the products and maybe to
find<00:00:15.870> some<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.109> suits<00:00:16.379> your<00:00:16.500> needs<00:00:16.529> an

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
find some that suits your needs an

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.279 
find some that suits your needs an
application<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:18.390> basically<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.140> auto

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
application so basically the auto

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.900 
application so basically the auto
reverse<00:00:19.410> osmosis<00:00:19.830> systems<00:00:20.310> work<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> same

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
reverse osmosis systems work in the same

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.490 
reverse osmosis systems work in the same
way<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.660> water<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.990> produced<00:00:22.199> at

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
way the water is produced at

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.769 
way the water is produced at
approximately<00:00:22.980> four<00:00:23.160> leaders<00:00:23.400> an<00:00:23.640> hour<00:00:23.820> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
approximately four leaders an hour and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.900 
approximately four leaders an hour and
of<00:00:24.869> course<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.560> splits<00:00:26.039> off<00:00:26.130> into<00:00:26.189> two<00:00:26.519> parts

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
of course it splits off into two parts

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.849 
of course it splits off into two parts
one<00:00:27.390> part<00:00:27.449> runs<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> waste<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.650> that's<00:00:28.769> all

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
one part runs to waste and that's all

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
one part runs to waste and that's all
your<00:00:28.980> rejected<00:00:29.519> heavy<00:00:30.359> metal<00:00:30.689> mineral

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
your rejected heavy metal mineral

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.139 
your rejected heavy metal mineral
content<00:00:31.500> fluoride<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.099> whatnot<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
content fluoride and whatnot and the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.880 
content fluoride and whatnot and the
other<00:00:33.360> part<00:00:33.660> rose<00:00:33.989> from<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> storage<00:00:34.530> tanks

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
other part rose from the storage tanks

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.709 
other part rose from the storage tanks
the<00:00:35.489> reason<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.850> use<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> storage<00:00:36.390> tank<00:00:36.600> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the reason we use the storage tank is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.959 
the reason we use the storage tank is
because<00:00:37.050> there<00:00:37.380> wasn't<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.739> made<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.489> slowly

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
because there wasn't that made so slowly

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.220 
because there wasn't that made so slowly
the<00:00:39.300> rate<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> 4<00:00:39.660> liters<00:00:39.780> an<00:00:39.989> hour

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the rate of 4 liters an hour

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
the rate of 4 liters an hour
you've<00:00:40.620> always<00:00:40.770> got<00:00:40.890> 8<00:00:41.160> liters<00:00:41.520> or<00:00:41.700> 16<00:00:42.030> liters

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you've always got 8 liters or 16 liters

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.020 
you've always got 8 liters or 16 liters
of<00:00:42.390> water<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.870> hand<00:00:43.170> at<00:00:43.440> any<00:00:43.680> time<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
of water on hand at any time so you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.369 
of water on hand at any time so you
never<00:00:45.149> run<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> water<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:45.960> actually

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
never run out of water because actually

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
never run out of water because actually
you<00:00:46.469> used<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> take<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> glass<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> kettle<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you used to take a glass or a kettle it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
you used to take a glass or a kettle it
just<00:00:48.510> tossed<00:00:48.690> itself<00:00:49.020> back<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.320> automatically

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
just tossed itself back up automatically

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920 
just tossed itself back up automatically
and<00:00:50.219> requires<00:00:50.550> no<00:00:50.640> electricity<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.660> works

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and requires no electricity just works

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
and requires no electricity just works
on<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> water<00:00:52.440> pressure<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:52.860> house<00:00:53.239> so

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
on the water pressure in your house so

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.459 
on the water pressure in your house so
there's<00:00:54.449> three<00:00:54.600> main<00:00:54.629> grades<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.230> reverse

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
there's three main grades are reverse

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.979 
there's three main grades are reverse
osmosis<00:00:55.820> systems<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.030> carry<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.840> have

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
osmosis systems that we carry we have

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.260 
osmosis systems that we carry we have
the<00:00:58.140> original<00:00:58.530> style<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.789> what<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.059> call

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the original style which is what we call

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.110 
the original style which is what we call
the<00:01:00.660> economy<00:01:00.800> reverse<00:01:01.800> osmosis<00:01:02.100> system<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the economy reverse osmosis system the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.579 
the economy reverse osmosis system the
idea<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.570> proponent<00:01:03.930> II<00:01:03.960> had<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> reverse

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
idea of the proponent II had a reverse

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.140 
idea of the proponent II had a reverse
osmosis<00:01:04.769> system<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.339> produced<00:01:05.640> exactly<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
osmosis system it produced exactly the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510 
osmosis system it produced exactly the
same<00:01:06.330> quality<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.750> water<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.950> more<00:01:08.189> modern

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
same quality of water as a more modern

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580 
same quality of water as a more modern
units<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.750> very<00:01:09.900> heavy<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.350> maintenance

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
units but it's very heavy in maintenance

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
units but it's very heavy in maintenance
so<00:01:11.189> when<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.490> comes<00:01:11.670> time<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> replace<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
so when it comes time to replace the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
so when it comes time to replace the
filters<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.650> unscrew<00:01:13.860> canisters

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
filters you need to unscrew canisters

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
filters you need to unscrew canisters
sanitize<00:01:15.090> them<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.780> by<00:01:15.930> hand<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.380> run<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
sanitize them all out by hand and run a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
sanitize them all out by hand and run a
flasher<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> system<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> new

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
flasher in the system with the new

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
flasher in the system with the new
systems<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.549> my<00:01:20.640> biggest

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
systems that is on so this is my biggest

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.960 
systems that is on so this is my biggest
selling<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.509> we've<00:01:21.659> challenged<00:01:22.970> system

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
selling one that we've challenged system

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
selling one that we've challenged system
design<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.200> simply<00:01:25.500> untwist

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
design so you can just simply untwist

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.590 
design so you can just simply untwist
the<00:01:26.159> cartridge<00:01:26.610> throw<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> whole<00:01:27.360> thing<00:01:27.420> away

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the cartridge throw the whole thing away

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.140 
the cartridge throw the whole thing away
when<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.650> screw<00:01:28.860> new<00:01:29.100> filter<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.909> sold

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
when you screw new filter in they sold

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.050 
when you screw new filter in they sold
sanitized<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.380> very<00:01:31.680> very<00:01:31.710> easy<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.220> operate
