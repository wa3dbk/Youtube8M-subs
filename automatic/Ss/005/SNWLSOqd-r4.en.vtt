of<00:00:24.359> resistance<00:00:24.750> into<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> movement<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.099> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of resistance into the movement and to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.310 
of resistance into the movement and to
really<00:00:26.670> get<00:00:26.880> those<00:00:27.029> lower<00:00:27.390> hard<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.199> reach

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
really get those lower hard to reach

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:40.230 
really get those lower hard to reach
muscles<00:00:28.740> engaged

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:01:00.209

the next exercise high capable crunches

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.350 
the next exercise high capable crunches
is<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.309> great<00:01:03.579> way<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.760> be<00:01:03.969> able<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.180> add

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
is a great way to be able to add

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.960 
is a great way to be able to add
resistance<00:01:05.019> through<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.440> cables<00:01:05.860> onto<00:01:06.850> the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
resistance through the cables onto the

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.940 
resistance through the cables onto the
upper<00:01:07.360> region<00:01:07.659> of<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.930> abdominals<00:01:08.680> as

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
upper region of the abdominals as

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.590 
upper region of the abdominals as
opposed<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.430> simply<00:01:09.670> holding<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.270> weighted

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
opposed to simply holding a weighted

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.930 
opposed to simply holding a weighted
plane<00:01:10.869> or<00:01:11.290> a<00:01:11.350> dumbbell<00:01:11.710> when<00:01:12.369> laying<00:01:12.610> flat

doing<00:01:13.330> those<00:01:13.740> all-star<00:01:14.740> crunches<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:15.520> here's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
doing those all-star crunches so here's

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.560 
doing those all-star crunches so here's
how<00:01:16.180> we<00:01:16.240> do<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.479> on<00:01:17.310> mat<00:01:18.310> about<00:01:18.700> two<00:01:19.180> feet<00:01:19.360> away

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
how we do it on mat about two feet away

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.370 
how we do it on mat about two feet away
from<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.080> base<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:21.310> cable<00:01:21.729> machine<00:01:22.380> I'm

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
from the base of the cable machine I'm

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.990 
from the base of the cable machine I'm
going<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.590> keep<00:01:23.710> Rob's<00:01:23.950> been<00:01:24.340> at<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.820> right

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
going to keep Rob's been at the right

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.690 
going to keep Rob's been at the right
angle<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.600> keep<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.080> upper<00:01:26.289> arms<00:01:26.619> fixed<00:01:27.070> in

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
angle and keep the upper arms fixed in

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.430 
angle and keep the upper arms fixed in
line<00:01:27.970> with<00:01:28.180> our<00:01:28.270> ears<00:01:28.539> and<00:01:28.840> then<00:01:29.049> simply

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
line with our ears and then simply

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.410 
line with our ears and then simply
crunch<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:30.100> ABS<00:01:30.250> closing<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.030> gap<00:01:31.210> between

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
crunch the ABS closing that gap between

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:55.340 
crunch the ABS closing that gap between
the<00:01:31.690> shoulders<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.710> hips

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.780 

now<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:56.680> make<00:01:56.829> sure<00:01:56.979> this<00:01:57.220> one<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:57.670> you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
now just make sure this one that you

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.700 
now just make sure this one that you
can't<00:01:58.060> side<00:01:58.299> your<00:01:58.479> breathing<00:01:58.869> with<00:01:59.079> each<00:01:59.380> rep

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
can't side your breathing with each rep

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.880 
can't side your breathing with each rep
so<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.159> put<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.490> breathe<00:02:00.640> out<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.409> close

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
so I put it breathe out as you close

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.310 
so I put it breathe out as you close
down<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.430> really<00:02:03.579> crunch<00:02:03.909> those<00:02:04.149> abs<00:02:04.320> forcing

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
down and really crunch those abs forcing

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.410 
down and really crunch those abs forcing
that<00:02:05.470> contraction<00:02:06.009> even<00:02:06.310> deeper<00:02:06.700> inside<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
that contraction even deeper inside the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.630 
that contraction even deeper inside the
muscles<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.709> breathe<00:02:08.979> in<00:02:09.190> through<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.489> nose

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
muscles and breathe in through the nose

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.820 
muscles and breathe in through the nose
as<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.239> open<00:02:10.929> up<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.140> ribcage<00:02:11.349> again

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
as you open up the ribcage again

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.940 
as you open up the ribcage again
straightening<00:02:12.519> up<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.940> upper<00:02:13.180> torso<00:02:13.950> moving

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
straightening up the upper torso moving

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.280 
straightening up the upper torso moving
on<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.519> third<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:15.849> final<00:02:16.300> exercise<00:02:16.870> now

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
on to the third and final exercise now

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.620 
on to the third and final exercise now
for<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> ABS<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.730> one<00:02:18.970> it's<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.480> new

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
for the ABS for this one it's a new

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.960 
for the ABS for this one it's a new
exercise<00:02:20.019> I've<00:02:20.500> recently<00:02:20.709> started<00:02:20.980> doing<00:02:21.519> to

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
exercise I've recently started doing to

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.120 
exercise I've recently started doing to
really<00:02:22.239> work<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.959> lower<00:02:23.170> these<00:02:23.500> section<00:02:23.920> here

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
really work the lower these section here

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.210 
really work the lower these section here
and<00:02:24.280> hit<00:02:24.940> those<00:02:25.090> internal<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.900> external

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
and hit those internal and external

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.000 
and hit those internal and external
obliques<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.519> let's<00:02:28.330> get<00:02:28.480> started<00:02:28.989> when<00:02:29.920> I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
obliques so let's get started when I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.559 
obliques so let's get started when I
lower<00:02:31.650> cable<00:02:32.650> pretty<00:02:33.040> down<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.209> the

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
lower cable pretty down this is on the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.390 
lower cable pretty down this is on the
fourth<00:02:35.500> hole<00:02:35.799> from<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.340> top<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.950> attach<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
fourth hole from the top and attach the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.830 
fourth hole from the top and attach the
long<00:02:39.610> bar<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.630> one<00:02:40.989> side<00:02:41.260> only<00:02:44.099> now<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.519> one's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
long bar to one side only now this one's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.780 
long bar to one side only now this one's
basically<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:47.380> one<00:02:47.590> side<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.950> Clark<00:02:48.190> Froy<00:02:48.489> so

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
basically on one side of Clark Froy so
