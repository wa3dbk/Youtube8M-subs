the<00:00:50.030> caddy<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.570> think<00:00:50.809> when<00:00:50.930> it's<00:00:51.050> on<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.200> road

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
the caddy I think when it's on the road

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.830 
the caddy I think when it's on the road
is<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.829> sexiest<00:00:52.460> looking<00:00:52.730> van<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:52.940> think<00:00:53.090> it<00:00:53.390> it

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
is the sexiest looking van I think it it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.930 
is the sexiest looking van I think it it
looks<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.170> really<00:00:54.500> sporty<00:00:54.950> van<00:00:55.129> but<00:00:55.760> when<00:00:55.850> you

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
looks a really sporty van but when you

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.670 
looks a really sporty van but when you
turn<00:00:56.120> it<00:00:56.239> into<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.510> caddy<00:00:56.780> racer<00:00:57.020> I<00:00:57.350> think<00:00:57.590> it

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
turn it into a caddy racer I think it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.189

it and also proper race suspension and

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.980 
it and also proper race suspension and
brakes<00:01:31.160> so<00:01:31.490> it's<00:01:31.640> transformed<00:01:32.300> so<00:01:32.539> as<00:01:32.899> a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
body roll evident for the corners I mean

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.690 
body roll evident for the corners I mean
it'd<00:01:36.440> probably<00:01:36.619> be<00:01:36.830> most<00:01:37.130> eligible<00:01:37.399> for

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
it'd probably be most eligible for

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
it'd probably be most eligible for
something<00:01:37.970> like<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.149> Irish<00:01:38.330> Touring<00:01:38.570> Car

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
something like the Irish Touring Car

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.850 
something like the Irish Touring Car
Championship<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.410> they'd<00:01:39.530> be<00:01:39.649> up<00:01:39.740> the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
Championship and they'd be up the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.919 
Championship and they'd be up the
sheriff<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.369> agreed<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.119> we<00:01:41.630> did<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.780> few

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
sheriff and that agreed and we did a few

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.270 
sheriff and that agreed and we did a few
laps<00:01:42.110> in<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.320> earlier<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.679> morning<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.160> it's

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
laps in it earlier this morning and it's

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.100 
laps in it earlier this morning and it's
putting<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.610> impressive<00:01:43.970> times<00:01:44.330> who<00:01:44.840> never

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
putting in impressive times who never

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.570 
putting in impressive times who never
