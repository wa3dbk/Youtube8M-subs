you<00:01:02.160> know<00:01:02.280> women<00:01:02.870> divide<00:01:03.870> themselves<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:05.129> you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you know women divide themselves and you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 
you know women divide themselves and you

know place people in categories and
groups<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.979> i<00:01:08.100> think<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.240> want

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
groups because i think that if you want

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.560 
groups because i think that if you want
to<00:01:09.890> divide<00:01:10.890> people<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.909> don't<00:01:12.119> need<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> hair

to divide people you don't need a hair

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
to divide people you don't need a hair
typing<00:01:12.930> system<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
typing system to do that I think that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.270 
typing system to do that I think that
you<00:01:15.119> whether<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> divide

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you whether you you know want to divide

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.050 
you whether you you know want to divide
people<00:01:17.580> between<00:01:18.030> kinky<00:01:18.900> curly<00:01:19.549> Kinky's<00:01:20.549> and

people between kinky curly Kinky's and
only<00:01:21.600> Hurley's<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.250> could

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
only Hurley's and or you know you could

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.490

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.349 
where you certainly don't want to
tighten<00:04:11.720> them<00:04:11.840> up<00:04:11.989> so<00:04:12.410> i<00:04:12.829> think<00:04:13.459> it's<00:04:14.000> helpful

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
tighten them up so i think it's helpful

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.479 
tighten them up so i think it's helpful
in<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.900> regard<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.620> then<00:04:15.769> also<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.250> tighter

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
in that regard and then also the tighter

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.580 
in that regard and then also the tighter
the<00:04:16.729> curl<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:18.500> harder<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:18.979> for<00:04:19.039> your<00:04:19.640> sebo

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the curl the harder it is for your sebo

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.640 
the curl the harder it is for your sebo
to<00:04:21.590> get<00:04:21.769> down<00:04:22.160> your<00:04:22.490> hair<00:04:22.849> strand<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.569> you<00:04:24.110> will

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
to get down your hair strand so you will

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.270 
to get down your hair strand so you will
have<00:04:24.710> dryer<00:04:25.340> hair<00:04:25.690> but<00:04:26.690> besides<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:27.319> I<00:04:27.860> don't

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
have dryer hair but besides that I don't

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.260 
have dryer hair but besides that I don't
I<00:04:28.669> really<00:04:29.599> think<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:29.960> there<00:04:30.650> are<00:04:30.680> other<00:04:31.270> you

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
I really think that there are other you

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.110 
I really think that there are other you
know<00:04:32.300> features<00:04:33.289> of<00:04:33.500> hair<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:34.039> people<00:04:34.940> should

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
know features of hair that people should

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.850 
know features of hair that people should

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
looking at my hair and then they leave a

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.510 
looking at my hair and then they leave a
comment<00:04:48.380> or<00:04:48.500> like<00:04:48.560> what's<00:04:48.889> your<00:04:48.979> hair<00:04:49.280> type

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
hair though because you're looking at

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.059 
hair though because you're looking at
the<00:04:56.120> same<00:04:56.270> there<00:04:56.509> i'm<00:04:56.690> looking<00:04:57.080> at<00:04:57.199> so<00:04:57.560> it's

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
the same there i'm looking at so it's

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.740 
the same there i'm looking at so it's
just<00:04:58.250> like<00:04:58.430> even<00:04:58.909> just<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.449> it's<00:04:59.569> not<00:04:59.720> that

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
just like even just and it's not that

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.219 
just like even just and it's not that
the<00:05:00.020> question<00:05:00.590> is<00:05:00.919> my<00:05:01.729> Pepe<00:05:02.180> but<00:05:02.509> it<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.840> me<00:05:03.020> it

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
the question is my Pepe but it to me it

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.159 
the question is my Pepe but it to me it
just<00:05:03.259> shows<00:05:03.740> how<00:05:04.310> inaccurate<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.659> system<00:05:06.020> is

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
just shows how inaccurate the system is

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.999 
just shows how inaccurate the system is
because<00:05:07.569> obviously<00:05:08.569> if<00:05:09.289> they<00:05:09.409> feel<00:05:09.590> they<00:05:09.830> need

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
because obviously if they feel they need

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.170 
because obviously if they feel they need
to<00:05:10.159> ask<00:05:10.340> me<00:05:10.789> what<00:05:11.150> my<00:05:11.180> hair<00:05:11.539> type<00:05:11.720> is<00:05:11.960> then<00:05:13.180> we

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
to ask me what my hair type is then we

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.170 
to ask me what my hair type is then we
may<00:05:14.630> not<00:05:14.810> be<00:05:14.870> seeing<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.979> same<00:05:16.250> thing<00:05:16.729> because

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
may not be seeing the same thing because

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.029 
may not be seeing the same thing because
they're<00:05:17.599> not<00:05:17.840> good<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.259> don't<00:05:18.500> think<00:05:18.740> that<00:05:18.800> they

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
they're not good I don't think that they

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.460 
they're not good I don't think that they
just<00:05:19.280> want<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.550> tell<00:05:19.819> me<00:05:20.030> what<00:05:20.720> they<00:05:20.960> think<00:05:20.990> it

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
just want to tell me what they think it

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.149 
just want to tell me what they think it
is<00:05:21.620> so<00:05:22.610> if<00:05:23.169> Harrigan<00:05:24.169> was<00:05:24.440> really<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.800> end<00:05:24.949> all

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
is so if Harrigan was really the end all

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.370 
is so if Harrigan was really the end all
be<00:05:25.190> all<00:05:25.370> they<00:05:25.610> really<00:05:25.909> be<00:05:26.180> no<00:05:26.330> argument<00:05:26.539> so

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
be all they really be no argument so

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.550 
be all they really be no argument so
there<00:05:27.530> would<00:05:27.680> be<00:05:27.710> no<00:05:27.800> need<00:05:27.949> for<00:05:28.159> the<00:05:28.460> question

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
there would be no need for the question
