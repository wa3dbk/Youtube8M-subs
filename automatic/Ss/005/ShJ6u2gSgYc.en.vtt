is<00:01:36.150> standard<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.630> cable<00:01:37.020> first<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.530> going

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
is standard a cable first we are going

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.950 
is standard a cable first we are going
to<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.060> four<00:01:39.329> cables<00:01:39.509> one

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
to go with this we have four cables one

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.050 
to go with this we have four cables one
two<00:01:40.200> three<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> four<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.340> first<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
two three and four the first one is the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
two three and four the first one is the
5<00:01:42.270> volts<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.720> power<00:01:43.020> supplies<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> power

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
5 volts so that power supplies the power

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.069 
5 volts so that power supplies the power
for<00:01:44.009> various<00:01:44.310> ferric<00:01:44.850> rods<00:01:45.149> mouse<00:01:45.810> or

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
for various ferric rods mouse or

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.420 
for various ferric rods mouse or
keyboard<00:01:46.110> anything<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.369> is

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
keyboard anything like that and this is

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
keyboard anything like that and this is
the<00:01:47.549> data<00:01:47.820> transfer<00:01:48.149> these<00:01:48.570> two<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the data transfer these two in the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.139 
the data transfer these two in the
middle<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> data<00:01:50.490> manages<00:01:51.060> the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
this is no hello portion is the black

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.560 
this is no hello portion is the black
portion<00:02:04.710> during<00:02:04.920> an<00:02:05.130> original<00:02:05.610> using<00:02:06.300> people

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
portion during an original using people

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.660 
portion during an original using people
yeah<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.140> spaces<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.770> middle<00:02:08.040> first<00:02:08.490> one

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
yeah the spaces in the middle first one

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.880 
yeah the spaces in the middle first one
I<00:02:08.820> see<00:02:08.970> should<00:02:09.180> is<00:02:09.420> 5<00:02:10.050> volt<00:02:10.320> second<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:10.740> is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I see should is 5 volt second one is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.640 
I see should is 5 volt second one is
same<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:12.240> -<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.960> third<00:02:13.380> one<00:02:13.620> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
same as that be - and third one is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.290 
same as that be - and third one is
deeply<00:02:14.100> its<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.370> fourth<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.850> grounding

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
deeply its and fourth one is grounding

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.150 
deeply its and fourth one is grounding
so<00:02:15.450> now<00:02:15.600> let<00:02:15.960> me<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.260> give<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.650> physical

white one is the third one fourth one is
black<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:27.180> example<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.660> you're<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
black for example if you're going to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.870 
black for example if you're going to
connect<00:02:28.380> some<00:02:28.620> Farrakhan<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.520> wanna<00:02:29.700> run

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
connect some Farrakhan so you wanna run

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.300 
connect some Farrakhan so you wanna run
a<00:02:30.060> CPU<00:02:30.600> fire<00:02:30.810> or<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.080> wanna<00:02:31.260> run<00:02:31.470> nine<00:02:31.710> o'clock

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
a CPU fire or you wanna run nine o'clock

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.830 
a CPU fire or you wanna run nine o'clock
and<00:02:32.550> what<00:02:32.670> are<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> do<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> judgement

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and what are you going to do a judgement

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.140 
and what are you going to do a judgement
of<00:02:33.900> countries<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.640> +5

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
of countries and this so this is the +5

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.880 
of countries and this so this is the +5
volts<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.840> red<00:02:37.020> one<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.680> black

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
volts that is a red one and the black

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.500 
volts that is a red one and the black
one<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.580> ground<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.390> current

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
one is the ground so if the current

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.810 
one is the ground so if the current
leads<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.990> whatever<00:02:40.530> files<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.250> cracked<00:02:41.580> it's

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
leads to whatever files you cracked it's
