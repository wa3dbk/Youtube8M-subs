00:00:00.800 --> 00:01:38.873
 A [Am] night footsteps to guard [Little] small 

00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:43.371
 Suddenly [G] remember the flower wall [C] vi 

00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:48.693
 Table [Am] hands cut flowers from the street [You] 

00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:53.010
 Now [G] this has forgotten the old garden [C] 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.521
 One day [Am] walked through the strange city 

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:02.632
 City [G] has gone to the army [C] yet 

00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:07.895
 Life [Am] we have the title of [Em] grass 

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:11.808
 Sitting [G] sings very well [C] by 

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:17.195
 Many [Am] when suddenly like children remember [Me] home 

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:21.191
 From [Dm] the old streets I [Am] returned 

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:26.477
 Day [Am] spring step died very [Em] light 

00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:30.453
 Season [F] is over. [G] now 

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:35.713
 Many [C] nights saw me as [E] waterfall 

00:02:35.713 --> 00:02:39.555
 Province [F] out [E7] sometimes [Am] heard 

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:47.154
 One day [Am] walked to the middle of the [Em] market 

00:02:47.154 --> 00:02:51.133
 Suddenly [G] was as happy as the young [C] poetry 

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:56.323
 Life [Am] we have when it is the fire [Em] 

00:02:56.323 --> 00:03:00.351
 One [G] was together in the garden late 

00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:05.377
 The garden [Am] is late in bloom 

00:03:05.377 --> 00:03:09.459
 Life [G] anyone has [C] passed 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.257
 Many [Am] when you see hundreds of thousands of [Em] graves 

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:18.000
 I [G] thought around here and there [C] like 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.061
 Life [Am] we have all brought new things [I] strange 

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:26.899
 I [Dm] lived very well [Am] worshiping 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:32.005
 My heart [Am] I have sometimes closed [You] the door 

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:35.757
 Then [F] beside my wound [G] knelt 

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:40.745
 And [C] I brought [E] small words 

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:44.925
 Leaving [F] I stood [E7] on the other [Am] life 

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:52.703
