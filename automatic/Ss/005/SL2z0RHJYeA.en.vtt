00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.519
 That day 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.649
 to all those months 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:19.599
 so today we meet again for episode 4 2 for nuclear with 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.820
 all the weapons 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.839
 this time on him 4 2 accuracy 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.619
 always happy with my actions he also quotes using the carpenter 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.369
 so for the tarn station I think I played with 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.570
 to bravo causes 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.920
 elise who dropped the study 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.080
 because a huge disappointment for his channel 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.789
 it is for what seems to me that it's all 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.469
 so what you need to know is that the term table travels to kenya no 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.790
 accessory facts 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.240
 escg up a show yesterday contrary to what you will not be able 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.320
 because it's our first and tight 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.900
 elliot qu'alex and tarbes 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.300
 then I had that so it's pretty cool 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.710
 so I had it first time because 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.910
 if ibm I will not spoil the suspense even if the cases force it anyway 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.490
 past 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.000
 I think what happened to me may be a little bit more 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.140
 pokora joy by chance and I succeeded in the neck of the first blow so that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.220
 it's pretty nice as I tell you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.760
 for this gift that seems to me 6 yes after that will be the gameplay at mca this guy 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.520
 apple i'm more sure 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.140
 but it will finally be the cinema text 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.010
 so m today father 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.140
 with the help of someone you will have later in the series 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.850
 with imanche and opens up to a lot cute because I find it 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 is super cool and he is well 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.310
 % and cgg and there 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.350
 savoy 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.720
 and so percent what I mean it's passenger gl elsewhere on a year 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 victim who was dressed in clothes for new lighthouses 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 if you want forces allied to quebec for sea send me a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.360
 message to their masters in ten years 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.260
 so many points 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.960
 I will help you bare king yet you do as you want his season boyer 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.190
 so to get rich, say so we finally finished aum 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.280
 for this one of assault 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.750
 because it was there contrary to what one might think low lg 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.950
 past 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.619
 because two o'clock today is the day yesterday ripped off first because 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.249
 that I do not know why I have not at all I'm not behind 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:14.099
 acceptable despite all the anti-puncture mancha of these cool 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.689
 Oh well, I finished brief of the town halls just after the 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.559
 2010 who had taken Kabylie 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.499
 as one to celebrate I immediately besides power of 15 and 7 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.599
 so that allows you to leave time 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.769
 haidar who minimized a bomb with a different weapon a day 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.449
 macha allah n'guessan kabush I am 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.209
 I am morin who is today the mayor in France m 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.549
 here I think my marriage is over 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.029
 am 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.579
 so I managed to take some of 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.529
 business for the pursues my grandparents 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.409
 and percent 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.829
 anyway 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.359
 I will be there until Tuesday from Tuesday and I will be there but what 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.529
 I'm going to do is I'm going to m 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.429
 the bombs I made and jeep commented shelley 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:57.429
 because this need of his best claude he is sent to 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:01.289
 on masters in india 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.079
 and so for that 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.380
 so the small precision I play as usual with pignard 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.539
 he will leave 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:08.869
 France 2 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:09.929
 dia 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.929
 with the lake the dead because most c 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.070
 so she saw her she will be guincher 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.759
 once the arrival 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.089
 I would say maeder 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.349
 there I run I run to schoelcher a little particular but who me 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.449
 culture at that level so it was rather 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.469
 pretty cool 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.200
 so for this next 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.829
 and so that the buyer 11 1% over one year 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.139
 7 some patients 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.349
 about the risks for just part a first 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.759
 rather demented that of chris patten it's still a good 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.029
 for the blocks well so that's for sure 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.069
 not bad at all 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.069
 so logic temporize in these small 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.939
 in this little building that can be really pretty good for a kid who is 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.839
 a small country procrastinate which one is sure that the stops face 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.239
 active 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.549
 I'm not sure if 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.589
 if we do not get a lot of a few months it is the giclette 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.389
 both windows because 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.669
 here's 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.339
 gg i'm going to do in this case justin it's gone and here i'm going to have a 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.339
 little stressed but my wife so I see her 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.219
 first who had arrived 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:19.539
 dallas at 5 o'clock 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.519
 electoral pass 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.849
 which more is a chain chef equipped 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.009
 jemaine clÃ©ment because I picked up this morning hour 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.349
 e 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.590
 and if he had entered the sport then she has a duration that lies 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.529
 e come back 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.529
 his set by a hard time 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:39.479
 there we can see that to facilitate the arrival 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.639
 e 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.639
 so that's cool but I'll say 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.460
 ah yeah insisted 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.020
 cisse be 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.120
 easyjet gunner a try - e first group 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.220
 Why 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.159
 this crime 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.409
 cycling 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.159
 woerth 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.550
 this season 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.150
 Ouattara ap pose the betrayal of helicopters 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.919
 the string encrypted by the critics 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.330
 who will allow me to hide such free in the dark to captivate 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.659
 the little computer that will allow me 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.349
 crowley the workers 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.759
 there it is gone 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.930
 so seeing the titan waiting adventure work 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.290
 where he is this defeat I know that the year he arrives he was already 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:26.599
 a little bit shortly 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.050
 he accused me it's hidden 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.409
 he generated close to you congratulations to him 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.479
 why here 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.310
 current speech demitra 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.810
 ankara ap ap after i do not know if that interests you in the next 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.199
 episode 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.340
 you want me to cut the goal sequence so that you do not see 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.949
 a strike some 500 meters maybe that 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.979
 not the work behind this affair 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.839
 anyway I do not know if you prefer that I run to leave from 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.349
 some people who do not like being elsewhere 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.080
 1 in April destroy 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.659

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.330
 and here I am top agca useful 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.050

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.580
 and o marked the pace anyway pass of a change of the boiler 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.389
 here I am not staying there waiting for anyone for the whole party 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:13.650
 loser so that's where 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.960
 for 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.099
 asmi very anxious interprets on twitter

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:21.080
 history 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.669
 m to slow down a possible mini 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.650
 so percent 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.939
 also no 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:29.150
 % 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.150

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.559

 but I'm rather on this channel so it's good but you do not 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:42.180

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.340
 we will make hugs to two again he will go as you say a 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.999

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:51.039

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.669
 for that see I thought I was bomb and what I did 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.159

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:01.289
 to do so there I pull on seven and a half I'm down and then hold on and 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:02.699

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.639
 lala com the key in the talk at the time I die and so I have when 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.389
 even had the bomb on the ceiling 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:10.999
 it was extremely endearing frankly I was very happy 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:13.399
 because I did not have much luck during the day as 

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.870
