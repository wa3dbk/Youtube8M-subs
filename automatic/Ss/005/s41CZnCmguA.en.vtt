three weeks to get streaks and
highlights<00:01:09.810> put<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.409> find<00:01:10.710> that

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
highlights put in I just find that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.249 
highlights put in I just find that
accessory<00:01:11.820> isn't<00:01:12.090> expensive<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.869> quite

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
accessory isn't expensive and quite

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.630 
accessory isn't expensive and quite
damaging<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> hair<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
damaging to the hair so this is

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
damaging to the hair so this is
fantastic<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:15.840> maybe<00:01:16.470> once<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:16.890> twice<00:01:16.950> a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640 
now honey produces its own natural
bleach<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> form<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> hydrogen<00:02:13.140> peroxide

bleach in the form of hydrogen peroxide

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
bleach in the form of hydrogen peroxide
and<00:02:14.159> this<00:02:14.459> happens<00:02:15.000> when<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.690> hits<00:02:15.989> another

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.890 
and this happens when it hits another
liquid<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.700> when<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.540> hear<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.870> people

applying honey to wounds for its
antibacterial<00:02:21.870> properties<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.470> why

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
antibacterial properties that's why

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.410 
antibacterial properties that's why
because<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.250> having<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.060> reaction

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
because it's having that reaction

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.020 
because it's having that reaction
creating<00:02:25.080> its<00:02:25.230> own<00:02:25.290> peroxide<00:02:26.069> when<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.760> hits

next<00:02:37.880> we've<00:02:38.030> got<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.360> cinnamon<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.200> can

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
next we've got the cinnamon and you can

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.400 
next we've got the cinnamon and you can
use<00:02:39.680> cardamon<00:02:40.310> as<00:02:40.520> well<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.150> they<00:02:41.959> just<00:02:42.140> act

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
use cardamon as well and they just act

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.070 
use cardamon as well and they just act
as<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.620> natural<00:02:42.980> booster<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.300> peroxide

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
as a natural booster to the peroxide

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.770 
as a natural booster to the peroxide
and<00:02:46.650> now<00:02:46.920> we're<00:02:47.130> adding<00:02:47.430> one<00:02:47.820> tablespoon<00:02:48.600> of

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
probably the only bleach in the world

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.680 
probably the only bleach in the world
that<00:03:11.250> I'd<00:03:11.340> recommend<00:03:11.520> having<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.240> little<00:03:12.510> sip
