00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 july at minecraft there and sincerely 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.779
 welcome to a new attack of the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.330
 beat in the tutorial today I show you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.639
 just something for the top craft 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 dimension everything can and what topic force 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 Anyway , how does that look if you are 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.410
 up here on a set presses and her 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.609
 is aufmotzt be there are many 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.060
 different mods and today I explain 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.010
 you just the top craft motto topic 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.990
 Often, it's pretty much like him 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.849
 you could see very briefly 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.019
 There are quite a few things and also 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.640
 quite a few doctors and stuff like that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.810
 but then come in one 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.920
 I want to follow you today 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.450
 just once explained how he 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.190
 ever get into the dimension 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.800
 through this portal here 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.239
 and what it actually is was like that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.430
 what this dimension really is 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.250
 yes, the dimension is a stone age 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.360
 dimension where dinosaurs live and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.629
 native people 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.520
 the whole thing looks pretty tropical 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.320
 and yes at the beginning this needed 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.270
 bamboo stuff here that grows that way 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.800
 as you can see there, then you have to 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.059
 I just go now 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.109
 a little more on top of it me 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.539
 I still have this bamboo here 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.590
 things like that and normally again 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.739
 Actually, if they object 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.390
 is the normal paper what yes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.189
 also in the normal minecraft finds 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.570
 then bamboo is currently chopping off 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.100
 here and then you make this yourself 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.510
 Bamboo Ticks These plastic are whole 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.530
 Just you have to then these bamboo tubes 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.000
 take and just two on top of each other 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.619
 set you'll get this bamboo 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.210
 sticks I'm not even more 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.729
 because I may still have the bamboo here 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.439
 need with this bamboo you can 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.580
 Also a cup make this one off 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.900
 I already have two pieces here and we 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.619
 I can just write that 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.540
 so far, see better company and better 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.259
 like bamboo this mt dinger these are 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.579
 Cup this very important for you 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.280
 first you have to have a pina colada 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.479
 make and be as nice as a solarium studio 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.590
 It makes a sunchair so 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.689
 actually principle you just 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.799
 needs to do it and indeed completely 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.380
 certain wool exists 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.540
 different sun chairs and five 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.420
 Piece of a blue-white-red of a yellow 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.659
 a special pineapple screen so green 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.219
 and songs stop and find the easiest 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.630
 I am he high up the red sunlounger 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.380
 that's why the rose red and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.759
 usually there is actually 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.170
 No rose advises so I have at least 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.610
 never found any you have to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.079
 look out for flying islands here 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.149
 somewhere the island is flying in the sky 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.190
 and on these flying islands are 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.740
 yellow and red flowers you get the am 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.930
 best in my opinion 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.880
 if you quickly do any 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.880
 needs so then she just wanted to dye 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.740
 1 red wool then makes a threesome 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.900
 wide line from top to bottom in the 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.370
 middle and on the strings then do you 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.540
 These bamboo ticks then you get in 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.830
 SchÃ¤rding I do not now because I 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.140
 already have it in the box in it 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.020
 and then you just take that clear 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.370
 and places it somewhere on the beach 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.940
 I know I also went to meadow 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.010
 think you should do that on the beach 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.360
 I am sure yes as 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.620
 second then needed a pina colada 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.390
 you actually do that completely 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.740
 Simply you need these bamboo pieces 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.650
 here and you need astrium and 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.300
 this station pieces I get bamboo 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.860
 Pieces of coconut pieces exactly like you 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.300
 These coconut pieces get it all 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.010
 simply is a sword too 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.420
 use of this sword is indeed in 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.210
 these palms here and there hangs one 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.710
 Coconut then also carries and says 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.720
 this coconut with the sword if he 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.790
 that does not do then comes a whole 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.930
 normal coconut out like this one 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.210
 I've already tried that 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.380
 and yes you just can not do it 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.240
 more given so can you nothing 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.950
 do with the coconut that is in 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.210
 moment still pretty useless to do so 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.190
 her behind still coconut grenades 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.330
 and so what but in one 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.010
 Another story when I murder 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.980
 can do a little better and more with it 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.210
 has tried so now you have to 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.550
 Do a pina colada like you do 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.960
 that in this bamboo mug I have 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.480
 I think I just shows a u 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.400
 shape with the bamboo things again 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.600
 have departed and you have this bar 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.430
 must come on top then the button 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.080
 Coconut pieces in the middle 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.840
 just a pineapple probably this year 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.190
 gets the grow somewhere in the middle of 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.630
 the area around there would have to be one more 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.700
 standing there on top of it I show I the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.350
 just a short time with which he believes 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.780
 that we are about to grow there is one then 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.400
 there you go and already have yours 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.980
 others that can be that easy 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.210
 yes, now the important point is that he 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.290
 putting a sunbeam on the beach 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.280
 and now you have to wait 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.820
 until the sun really does too 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.770
 goes down 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.210
 I put to now even the time to 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.980
 So until the sunset below 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.250
 in the back we see the sun like her 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.030
 slowly sinking at the horizon 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.680
 Now I'm still waiting a bit 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.700
 that is really nice orange in the sky 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.140
 So that's really true 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.810
 goes down and then you set 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.900
 here on the chair and 1 lives 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.849
 one his pina colada I do that 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.470
 just now 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.669
 unappealing, the new world is charging 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.530
 It has already done that to me because I have it 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.870
 just had before and then you land 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.970
 here in such a world and that in the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.500
 Topical people mostly in the water 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.410
 So mainz Bonn point is mostly 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.400
 somehow it always takes water 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.509
 of course a bit longer until that 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.710
 we have been here since then the world is 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.210
 generate and so what with me it has 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.870
 That's why it's done now 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.250
 a little faster 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.690
 yes you have a box where 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.100
 usually something like that too 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.509
 there should be a book right now 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.380
 somehow not in it with me it is 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.419
 I do not know 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.259
 Why is there a book in there ? 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.820
 you can also like that then 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.949
 take and there's even a few see 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.440
 info yes now you are here a top 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.720
 craft dimension i'll go in now 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.150
 the other game mode I go 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.380
 will go into the adventure mode then 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.610
 I can fly around like a bit 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.860
 and also a little something to tell 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.210
 The portal should be very important 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.590
 you definitely remember where this 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.780
 portal is because otherwise you come to me 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.520
 no more out of the dimension so 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.610
 it's best to set the waypoints that 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.349
 he just makes a double click with m 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.130
 right-click on the card marks or 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.900
 I 'll just say portal like that 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.120
 group is really totally unimportant 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.639
 blablabla coordinates now i have 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.800
 so my fixpoint set Jacob 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.060
 topical the humans are mostly 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.430
 the dinosaur I can do now 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.449
 probably do not show everything because 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.169
 I myself not so often here 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.460
 I have been 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.930
 but I'll give you that a little bit 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.159
 the basics show that here is a where 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.260
 can also break out of the 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.610
 vowel there is lava in it and the 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.599
 then actually flooded here 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.590
 the whole area like you are here 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.460
 probably already can see 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.180
 He's probably already 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.300
 erupted 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.940
 or the like yes that went there is one 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.800
 huge of her dinosaurs totally 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.810
 freaks out no idea why he does that 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.340
 but makes so great the eu this 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.720
 really blatant you can then 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.000
 also breed behind with the 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.349
 fossil mod in the normal world or 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.580
 I do not know how else to do it 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.199
 maybe there is something here 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.940
 you have to use that there 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.690
 our saber tooth tigers and there arise 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.610
 also a mammoth rum 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.530
 yes and there are quite a lot 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.979
 other published pugs that are here 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.949
 it still a few mammoth yet so art 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.240
 So it's pretty cool here 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.759
 also not why the whole time 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.050
 but make people quite tall like 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.199
 you can see that that's the biggest 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.639
 whether that will be about 30 blocks tall for 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.340
 and otherwise does not exist 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.390
 much more about this to the dimension 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.340
 to say here 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.080
 the only thing you might still have 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.450
 are small npc villages 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.000
 these are woody beaches that exist 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.770
 everywhere mostly on beaches 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.530
 I do not know if I'm here right now 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.440
 I do not want to be so far from 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.800
 spa fly away but that's as if out 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.470
 birch wood or I believe palms 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.840
 Wood is the otherwise water rose and there 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.310
 are just such a npc inhabitant inside 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.640
 with which you usually act 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.380
 can 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.060
 somehow that does not work with that 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.590
 Act with me it is not because 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.990
 even in the chest lasting no book in it 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.250
 is that's weird so wanted now 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.630
 Of course, I'm back from the dimension 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.770
 get out of here and I'm me 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.210
 other factors, how do I get now 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.250
 back out because if I quite normal in 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.560
 the tensioner then jump happened 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.210
 just nothing so you are easy 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.280
 the important thing is that we are there 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.620
 purely jumping and doing a pina colada 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.170
 it works i take it again now 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.520
 a drink to that and that 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.750
 it is best to wear the underwater 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.980
 I can not go wrong that way 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.730
 I did not want to sit down I wanted 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.530
 like to drink 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.240
 I'll probably have to go in for that again 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.700
 the normal way because we go mode 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.290
 now i live the ina colada here 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.290
 water and I will be back 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.850
 hopefully posted in the normal world 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.860
 juhu has also worked wonderfully 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.300
 and there we are already back 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.830
 Of course you can do things too 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.760
 take along your inventory 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.050
 and you can still behind 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.580
 maybe build a teleporter there 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.590
 or so the mod I like 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.850
 pretty cool you can do a lot 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.950
 Maybe I even discover 

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.030
 not discovered everything 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.140
 Of course that will stay with you 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.210
 a bit open there a bit around 

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.740
 to do research except for the mia and one 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.540
 normal world you should then so here 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.730
 a normal portal gets well 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.040
 if you liked the tutorial or 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.270
 maybe even helped or 

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.560
 perhaps a few things with you 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.750
 somehow still completely new from 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.220
 let me have a murder here then 

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.510
 rating because the network writes in the 

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.010
 comments maybe a few 

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.320
 ask how you have or something you can 

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.880
 also like to write in the comments and 

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.650
 otherwise we will see each other at one 

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.410
 another attack of the beating tutorial 

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:19.250
 on my channel again until then and 

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.250
 the Rio friends
