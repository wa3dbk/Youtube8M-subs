G<00:00:38.760> ups<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.750> maybe<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.840> if<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
G ups I think maybe not but if if so I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790 
G ups I think maybe not but if if so I
will<00:00:44.160> put<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> description<00:00:45.800> but

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
will put that in the description but

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100 
will put that in the description but
yeah<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.789> got<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> Ziggy<00:00:48.629> Colonel

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
yeah it's got the Ziggy Colonel

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.779 
yeah it's got the Ziggy Colonel
installed<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:52.070> what<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> does<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.670> allows

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
installed so what that does is it allows

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.630 
installed so what that does is it allows
you<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> overclock<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.010> too<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:57.030> like

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
you to overclock it too I think like

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
you to overclock it too I think like
1,900<00:00:59.640> or<00:00:59.760> something<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.100> what

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
1,900 or something like that and what

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
1,900 or something like that and what
that<00:01:02.129> Ziggy<00:01:02.789> clone<00:01:03.090> does<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> allows<00:01:03.840> you

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that Ziggy clone does is it allows you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
that Ziggy clone does is it allows you
to<00:01:04.970> rotate<00:01:07.280> any<00:01:08.280> way<00:01:09.770> look<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.640> kinda

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
to rotate any way look it's kinda

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.300 
to rotate any way look it's kinda
glitchy<00:01:13.220> any<00:01:14.220> way<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.760> want<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.310> yeah

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
glitchy any way that you want to so yeah

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
glitchy any way that you want to so yeah
you<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.390> going<00:01:19.350> ok<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:24.380> nope

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you see you see going ok and then nope

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260
