00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 Hi people, it's finally time to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.150
 talk about rone more concerned by applying the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.609
 Heroes screen belittles bid 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.949
 lenny or simply and midi and route more 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.980
 between the two bases and obviously the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.270
 shortest path to victory 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.899
 therefore it should be the most 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.300
 so protected that it is more 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.969
 important not to risk peter doig who 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.760
 run to overthrow the enemy 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.129
 wizards for being fragile need 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.110
 a shorter escape route and this makes 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.430
 of online media is the ideal place for a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 duel between them 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.270
 so as damage killers 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.280
 physical is very common to make the following the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.110
 mind champions did 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.939
 zed dragas and dali and some more 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.290
 but what he has so special for 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.780
 used in most of the games 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.060
 in the current goal the heroes who will tell me 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.880
 are those that have great mobility and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.670
 are able to post an enemy by killing 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.920
 letting him invite enough 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.310
 low to have to go on base to heal 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.960
 thus giving a loophole to be able to fight 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 it is also possible to be doing the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.009
 main that is nothing more than to stay 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.590
 sulking allen while their 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.229
 enemies are far and this causes 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.659
 was one of the team mkt stop giving you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.350
 an advantage in case you join 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.020
 quickly fight with your team 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.390
 but be careful if your team is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.820
 far behind in gold has priority for 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.719
 defend the 2 of his team so that 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.890
 becomes even more difficult to start and 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.780
 game usually from minc is one against one 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.939
 except when the team decided to do 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.850
 a connection and sent down and 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.729
 media support 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.920
 But this is a subject for another day, you? 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.890
 should we focus on the last rites 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.260
 wine and annoy the enemy and can give 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.840
 an opportunity to catch your breath 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.790
 and ensure a kill and then a 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.010
 tower or a dragon 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.380
 if you had a hero with mobility 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.660
 always seek to help their 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.520
 team mates with guÃ©ant 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.709
 do not forget to ask if she can 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.709
 take bond that guards Sentinels 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.920
 free 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.440
 more sentinels than 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.000
 keep the 75 decoud thinking that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.000
 go buy the ramadan and 3 minutes 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.569
 mind game things already start to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.519
 complicate a little 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.350
 probably the enemy team is already 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.989
 buying defense items 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.580
 it makes your life a little harder but it is 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.620
 just wait for your team to give in milk and 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.560
 We keep getting five behind the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.630
 source you online and it 's 6 are sources 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.750
 primary damage since it is the largest 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.250
 responsible for causing damage 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.440
 as soon as the game reaches 7 minutes 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.019
 and health and even years because it calls for 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.760
 handle the blueon or call itself 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.540
 present the last blow on goal line 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.609
 blue and receive booth uff is joy 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.810
 of all techweb game take a lot 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:31.640
 Be careful and always walk with your team. 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.220
 any crucial death and may result in 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.829
 in an inhibitor have stolen what can 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.040
 complicate the life of your team until 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.440
 even things to defeat your strategy 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.140
 game is basically the same as the media game 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.750
 but if you are with her, you have 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.310
 A very good taste already can kill 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.420
 the enemies more easily for today is 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.489
 these people 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.200
 I missed you more. 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.000
 I spent that time away analyzing the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.100
 changes of this preseason 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.069
 so let's leave the support street 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.109
 lastly since there have been so many changes 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.230
 we expect the next episode talking 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.420
 to tap lenny and do not forget to 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.329
