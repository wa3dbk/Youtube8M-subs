00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.990
 ani 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.679
 pane 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.679
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.440
 Had 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.570
 Hello Shibata so 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.920
 Actually my brother is now 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.329
 I went to Chichijima of the Ogasawara Islands 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.850
 As you seem to enjoy the life of the sea 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.680
 I am too jealous 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.720
 Go to play a little 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.890
 A little 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.470
 Me too 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.690
 I think that I want to try swimming in the clean sea 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.830
 Well it is today it is why 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.930
 I think I will make me 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.740
 I keep on spiting fish 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.260
 Well, it's a little different from weapons, but there are probably not similar elements 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.600
 We will be in such things a little today by saying how 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.490
 It is often this 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.390
 There was a lot of common storage 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.960
 It's a flat bar This is a material that is steel and steel for building 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.030
 Also 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.900
 There iron called sphc 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.900
 Let's use this 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:40.149
 I think I want to do it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.479
 First we will continue to the received letter to the flat bar It is a First 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.479
 Is a very important task, so it will be polite 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.840
 in this way 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.479
 Handwriting was completed 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.479
 I will cut along this line all night 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.090
 in this way 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.090
 I was able to cut it into 1000 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.220
 Goodbye not a Oh 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.500
 I will keep it smooth 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.989
 Grinder blade from cutting wheel 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.989
 Was a rough four losses to the grindstone for water will continue to cut in this 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.670
 If you go wrong 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.540
 Let's go forward to bend this angle 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.540
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.540
 ch 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.819
 in this way 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:17.130
 Two chopsticks became parallel 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.970
 I think it will be easy to sting morning flowers if you go down 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:25.330
 I was able to go to a good shape 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.330
 Today I will raise anti-day Goto 's with this drill 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.750
 A hole in this way through a string opened 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.380
 this 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.380
 I cut the pipe into Ozawa length because it is a little long 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.630
ãƒ¼

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.860
 I hit it 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.900
 Get this cut by this cut and by 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.440
 This is it 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.290
 It's a kind of addicting bash 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.340
 with this 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:23.000
 Most are almost complete 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.000
 Now it has through therein a sister to this 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.320
 Finally, I will go through this simmering book 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.040
 It will be my sensibility now is good 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.330
 This does not penetrate the big game 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.669
 Well then 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.669
 Let's go into a plate and catch fish 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.030
 a 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.350
 It is why say so 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.950
 I had to go to your Baa customers 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.169
 from now on 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.800
 I am in the middle of nowhere and I do not want to go along with it 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.800
 We will enter 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.310
 Hmm 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.310

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.440
 A'got it will please 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.280
 It's not such a big deal, but it's about success 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.290
 That's why 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.290
 I was able to get a fish 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.830
 Venue report is au 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.729
 Did you become a member ah 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.980
 Everyone still has different ways of tying up extra 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.660
 It looks like that 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.660
 Wow Wow at this 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.230
 Hmm 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.520
