when they get in turn one here at
Michigan<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:49.020> carrying<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
Michigan they are really carrying a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.529 
Michigan they are really carrying a
bunch<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.460> speed<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> reason<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.449> don't

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
bunch of speed and the reason they don't

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
bunch of speed and the reason they don't
carry<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.050> speed<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.680> year<00:00:52.980> Alan<00:00:53.550> is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
carry more speed this year Alan is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
carry more speed this year Alan is
because<00:00:54.210> when<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> new<00:00:55.289> low<00:00:55.469> ride<00:00:55.710> height

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
because when the new low ride height

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
because when the new low ride height
rule<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.520> leave<00:00:56.760> pit<00:00:57.000> road<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> car

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
rule is they leave pit road in the car

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779 
rule is they leave pit road in the car
is<00:00:57.870> already<00:00:58.079> low<00:00:58.559> they're<00:00:59.010> only<00:00:59.160> moving<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
is already low they're only moving a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
is already low they're only moving a
half<00:00:59.969> an<00:01:00.149> inch<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> move<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.379> half<00:01:01.590> an

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
half an inch so when you move a half an

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.439 
half an inch so when you move a half an
inch<00:01:01.829> you're<00:01:02.070> already<00:01:02.399> done<00:01:02.670> we've<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.180> moved

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
inch you're already done we've we moved

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
inch you're already done we've we moved
to<00:01:03.629> three<00:01:03.840> inches<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> nationwide<00:01:04.860> they

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
to three inches in a nationwide they

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.010 
to three inches in a nationwide they
don't<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> car<00:01:06.659> never

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
don't have to do that so the car never

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810 
don't have to do that so the car never
comes<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.430> carries<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
comes up and that's what carries the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.940 
comes up and that's what carries the
speed<00:01:09.299> down<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> front<00:01:10.260> straightaway<00:01:10.530> down

Hendrick has any kryptonite but Michigan

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100 
Hendrick has any kryptonite but Michigan
maybe<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.180> tell<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> have

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
maybe it so you tell me what do you have

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
maybe it so you tell me what do you have
to<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.680> successful<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:47.310> Michigan<00:01:47.670> fuel

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to do to be successful at Michigan fuel

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.450 
to do to be successful at Michigan fuel
mileage<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.009> see<00:01:50.280> them

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
mileage and I think when you see them

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.670 
mileage and I think when you see them
stats<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.149> don't<00:01:51.390> show<00:01:51.630> how<00:01:51.869> good<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.409> ran

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
stats that don't show how good they ran

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
stats that don't show how good they ran
there<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.549> does<00:01:53.820> show<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.149> they<00:01:54.479> didn't

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
there that does show that they didn't

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.050 
there that does show that they didn't
finish<00:01:54.930> good<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:55.979> did<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.399> win<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> race

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
finish good or they did not win the race

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.730 
finish good or they did not win the race
but<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.450> look<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> 88<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> couple<00:01:58.560> years

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
but you look at the 88 a couple years

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.649 
but you look at the 88 a couple years
ago<00:01:58.799> he<00:01:59.399> wouldn't<00:01:59.820> race<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.119> fuel<00:02:00.360> mileage

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
ago he wouldn't race on fuel mileage

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.090 
ago he wouldn't race on fuel mileage
statelets<00:02:01.110> heart<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.469> then<00:02:01.560> work<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> fuel

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
statelets heart and then work the fuel

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.130 
statelets heart and then work the fuel
mileage<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.520> ended<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:02.850> winning<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.479> think

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
mileage and ended up winning it I think

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.440 
mileage and ended up winning it I think
that<00:02:04.710> when<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.759> Detroit<00:02:05.969> Michigan

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that when they go to Detroit Michigan

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.510 
that when they go to Detroit Michigan
everybody's<00:02:06.930> trying<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.740> everything<00:02:07.950> they

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
everybody's trying to do everything they

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.760 
everybody's trying to do everything they
can<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.910> win<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.390> race<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.289> backyard

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
can do to win that race in the backyard

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.630 
can do to win that race in the backyard
of<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> big<00:02:11.310> manufacturers<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.239> know

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
of the big manufacturers you know

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.450 
of the big manufacturers you know
so<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.180> think<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.960> when<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.319> go<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.650> Michigan

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
so I think that when you go to Michigan

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.040 
so I think that when you go to Michigan
I<00:02:15.580> think<00:02:16.000> Hendrick<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.510> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.840> turn<00:02:16.990> out
