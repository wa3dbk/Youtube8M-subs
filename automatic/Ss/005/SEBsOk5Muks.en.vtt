you can see I'll wait till you got that
you<00:01:04.500> conceived<00:01:05.009> it<00:01:05.190> in<00:01:05.759> my<00:01:05.970> top<00:01:06.240> super<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
you conceived it in my top super so this

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.760 
you conceived it in my top super so this
is<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.649> deep<00:01:08.009> a<00:01:08.280> medium<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.509> supers<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
is a deep a medium and to supers and in

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.529 
is a deep a medium and to supers and in
my<00:01:10.890> top<00:01:11.130> super<00:01:11.610> they're<00:01:11.759> actually<00:01:12.180> storing

my top super they're actually storing

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.320 
my top super they're actually storing
food<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.429> a<00:01:14.459> very<00:01:14.789> robust<00:01:15.240> hive<00:01:17.330> let's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
food so this is a very robust hive let's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.090 
food so this is a very robust hive let's
see<00:01:18.569> in<00:01:18.690> fact<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.259> might<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.649> some<00:01:19.860> capped

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
see in fact I might have some capped

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.480 
see in fact I might have some capped
honey<00:01:20.399> all<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> way<00:01:20.819> up<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.240> top<00:01:21.450> one

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
honey all the way up in this top one

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.320 
honey all the way up in this top one
nope<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:24.630> teeny<00:01:24.869> little<00:01:25.110> bit<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> little

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
nope just a teeny little bit so a little

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.550 
nope just a teeny little bit so a little
bit<00:01:27.479> different<00:01:27.539> than<00:01:27.929> that<00:01:28.020> hive<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.380> just

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
bit different than that hive we just

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.940 
bit different than that hive we just
looked<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:30.030> sure

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
looked at that's for sure

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.020 
looked at that's for sure
now<00:01:31.950> some<00:01:32.220> differences<00:01:32.729> are

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.590 

I'm<00:01:35.659> only<00:01:35.869> using<00:01:35.990> nine<00:01:36.500> frames<00:01:36.890> up<00:01:37.190> here<00:01:37.600> maybe

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
I'm only using nine frames up here maybe

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.390 
I'm only using nine frames up here maybe
they<00:01:38.750> like<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.110> additional<00:01:39.500> space<00:01:39.799> just

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
they like the additional space just

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.630 
they like the additional space just
something<00:01:40.700> I'm<00:01:40.820> fooling<00:01:41.180> around<00:01:41.420> with<00:01:41.540> to<00:01:41.750> see

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
something I'm fooling around with to see

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.460 
something I'm fooling around with to see
so<00:01:43.640> I've<00:01:43.700> got<00:01:43.850> my<00:01:43.970> sugar<00:01:44.210> shaker<00:01:44.570> just<00:01:45.320> like

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470
