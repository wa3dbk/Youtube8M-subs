00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.530
 Y 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.320
 i 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.250
 hello how about today we will make a lamp 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.450
 hooks for which we will need the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.010
 next material very easy to 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.169
 get percent the wooden hook 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.920
 glue either basic liquid silicone 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.400
 in bar and silicone stand too 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.620
 we'll be with a little bit of soccer 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.720
 this way and will press that is a basis 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.820
 as you see I have cut in a way 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.800
 square because this is going to be very lamp 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.490
 and as a building in the center to be able 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.480
 this 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:59.230
 how can you see what will fit in this 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.230
 way for me to base my lamp 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 all right 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.560
 I have my ready 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.250
 what is my base that is going to be a bit 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.610
 already connected now nothing else already work 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 in what will be which the hook 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.190
 first before everything measure the size 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.020
 very basic one I have cut off 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.850
 half 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.189
 They can then locate the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:38.039
 hooks and from there I go to 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.420
 go through this form well for that I'm going to 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.610
 mark before 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 To do as ruler and pencil as 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.060
 look half 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.159
 once I have measured nothing else one 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.050
 but slightly for what 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.050
 I do not know I rolled everything in the base 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.999
 once I've given myself forever it's 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.710
 put together the hooks that you will have from this 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.200
 shape 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.160
 this union the first trick is different 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.930
 with front in the second row that already 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.930
 will do this way 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.120
 and in the opposite direction I have felt 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.310
 First base control 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.310
 and so on 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.799
 here again base with front with front 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.799
 and here again in this way 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.620
 thus raising a height that you want 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.180
 It can be 2015 hooks in this case 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.650
 of the area of 17 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.769
 well in this way 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.760
 one forehead with another form 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.549
 different panties backs and so on 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.989
 until a tower rises well 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:17.319
 now one by one with her from the 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.230
 silicone that is liquid or stable in 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.489
 this case I will be a gun but before 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.170
 do that I can work two ways 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:31.700
 either a row first 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.780
 or both together is to say it 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.820
 and waka this way 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.820
 and I'm hitting here 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.820
 we were 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:50.190
 and so on or also work 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:55.550
 in this way two by two 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.550
 so does the silicone 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.200
 I have here I have here two ways that you 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.379
 better that is convenient you can work 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.379
 i 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.860
 Y 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.860
 and now 

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:24.440
 here in the meetings so that it is here 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.320
 you can paste in this way 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.120
 and so work all waiting 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.200
 hitting us but instead if I already have 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.390
 prepared and of these about 2 or 3 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.090
 whatever you want 26-7 first one 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:45.630
 fiction of hbo the other then nothing else anymore 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.630
 I have these I put all silicone 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.600
 it's like once they 've stuck like this 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.380
 the whole base 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.290
 I have already advanced 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.800
 I have two prepared as I said look 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.630
 already worked in this way if I can give 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.990
 to work this way first I have done 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.810
 one row and then the other and nothing more and 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.169
 then nothing else go up 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.530
 in this way as you say 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:22.400
 I put glue and thus return the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.090
 Chinese four so here until you get 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.940
 this 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.720
 until we stay in this way 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.720
 two 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.680
 two 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.680
 so it will be 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:54.210
 and eye 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.750
 before I put cycle of good you 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.509
 I think that if you need to put it on base 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.680
 This glue once once a 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.680
 base or first 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.730
 A) Yes 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.969
 but then there the insurance 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.970
 secure 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.360
 i 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:45.080
 something simple and easy to do 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.080
 and so 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.930
 my name is elmer we see one 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.930
 possibility
