 ana claudia and friends of the earth 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.110
 paradise now I am going to present to you 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.880
 director of the school san ignacio who 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.670
 will tell us how is your experience 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.650
 in this beginning of classes with all the 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.480
 children and the great ones and all those who 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.430
 they are forming the first day 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.789
 It is always very exciting especially 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.040
 because here children of 3 years and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.140
 clear to them for many is the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.480
 first time they go to a center 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.820
 educational they go to a nest 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.239
 there were some moms to see how 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.890
 there was the child hiding themselves and as 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.559
 that the child was given a tour of the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.840
 school they were hiding so they would not 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.149
 be seen but that indicates that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.940
 really the love and it seems to me that 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.550
 school is the complement with the family 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.059
 because family and school we have to 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.059
