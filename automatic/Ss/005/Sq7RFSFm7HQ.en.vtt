00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:08.600
 rationalize the fraction 2 - root of 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.740
 three parties three more root of 3 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.560
 rationalize a fraction consists of 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:21.529
 find a fraction equivalent to the 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.630
 cup so that said fraction the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.230
 new fraction does not have roots in the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.230
 denominator 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.600
 in our case, let's note that in the 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.810
 denominator we have a root that is 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.810
 here 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.130
 and that root is adding up to a number or 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.910
 whether we have a sum or subtraction in the 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.470
 denominator 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.960
 in which one of the roots intervenes 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.580
 in this case to rationalize this 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.580
 fraction what is done is to copy it 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.230
 you have to multiply by something that as 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.650
 result this same fraction is obtained 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.070
 then you have to multiply by 1 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.020
 because that one is obtained by multiplying 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.410
 for a fraction that in the numerator and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.230
 in the denominator, it has the same 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.590
 result of that division is 1 and what 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.480
 appears is the same as we have here 3 + 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.409
 root of 3 in the denominator but the 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.590
 sign of the medium changed 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.659
 would appear 3 and so not half was more 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.350
 now we put less 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.060
 and the same thing we put in the denominator 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.859
 as in the numerator and denominator of 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.460
 this new fraction appears the same 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.790
 We are multiplying by 1 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.580
 large fraction line multiplication 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.240
 of fractions this by this numerator 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.240
 by numerator 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.149
 denominator party by denominator 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.760
 and above we have to make this product 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.530
 product of two radical expressions 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.920
 what we do is multiply all by 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.920
 everyone 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:22.820
 236 now 2 x less root than 3 220 3 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.090
 we have finished with the first and now the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.090
 second 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.440
 - root of three by three less by more is 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.560
 minus three root of 3 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.020
 finally less cadiz than 3 - root of 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.270
 three less for less more root than three 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.830
 by root of three root of three at 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.650
 square 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.720
 and below we have sum by difference as 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.090
 we know that is difference of squares 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.040
 because the elements that intervene 3 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.070
 root of 33 root of three are the same 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.830
 then the first minus 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.810
 square of the second 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.700
 up we would stay 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.209
 6 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.480
 now minus 2 root of 33 root of 3 are 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.819
 radicals with the same radicand 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.220
 then we operate with the coefficients 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.930
 minus 2 - 3 - 5 and left the same 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.260
 root root of 3 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.019
 and it was more root than 3 squared root of 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.620
 3 and square the square root evans 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.790
 we would be more 3 match 3 squared 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.940
 which is 99 minus root of 3 squared 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.680
 root and squares are going we are left 3 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:48.820
 this would fit us then 6 39 less 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.820
 five root of three down 9 minus 36
