00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 beaver all dear friends with you as 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.240
 today I will tell you about 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.250
 mod called stargate 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.710
 he will allow you to teleport between 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.929
 Here is such a crap such and necessary 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.000
 completion who well I put here alone 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.350
 special block then or turn into 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 absolute circle to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.800
 in mykraft we have not seen this yet 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 give in to the beginning I will tell how everything 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.330
 this is done this remote control will 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.769
 look so here so here so 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 the consoles lot is made of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.510
 obsidian and but in general you have seen if you 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.020
 slightly roll back and video you'll see it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 in more detail then what is made of 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.379
 This is the gate of the chevron block 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.010
 that's how you do it from this crap 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.870
 here it is this ring god to become pretty 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.539
 just lining is made from such 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.030
 pollen and pollen ore that can be found 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.480
 not difficult enough but such labor 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.609
 it can be found quite easily in 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.370
 caves caves von levla would she dwell 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.670
 and the last thing is that right in the middle 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.430
 here it is this thing special too new 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.229
 it can be purchased from people by 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.060
 For some strange reason, she baryzhit 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.060
 ordinary merchants as well as it will be possible 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.479
 find in chests in every dungeon 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.280
 author any other topic now let's 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.140
 Finally for building these gates from them 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.080
 waited and here it looks 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.290
 now right-clicking on it you 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 open the address well if you area 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.090
 rotates can memorize top sevok 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.939
 they planted a little man and you can 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.909
 notice only remember the top character 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.340
 however I prefer to memorize Latin 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.079
 well how are you there the sky is easier this address 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.210
 allows you to teleport to them 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.070
 but we do not teleport to these from 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.950
 others have already put me here alone 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.470
 the gate to them we will move by pressing 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.259
 right click here we open such 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.689
 here's a cool tune made very much 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.520
 cool but I forgot one thing first you need 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.219
 throw fuel here see here 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.899
 little fetish punko about this one on her 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.149
 pressing the right button you open 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.100
 a menu with fuel in the fuel put in 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.800
 hoards which falls in 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.840
 like i said caves near catching 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.750
 all now we are ready and we can enter 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.030
 address address you can enter the keyboard as 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.740
 and do it on my own because I donâ€™t 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:28.140
 Of those perverts that are introduced in TPA this 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:31.980
 blue tum-dum base until he thought long 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:38.130
 and that's how cool it opens right from 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:41.910
 sound such things they can still 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.950
 teleport between other worlds 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.600
 roos boucles go there to you my 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.420
 sort of fall behind sleep 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.320
 interesting to kill them i can teleports 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:58.830
 interesting idea gate bastard you have me 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.630
 and there are a lot of them there and now mothers 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.060
 rub with another gate here pretty 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.500
 dark and in general we are lacquered or even 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.200
 do not immediately understand that this is another place 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.640
 again it is another gate here somewhere 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.410
 but let's go back it we will 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.290
 wait here these critics so much so 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.930
 well you see that there is water there is water 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.040
 no it will be maintained for five minutes 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.250
 or until we turned it off yes this one 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.500
 damn sounds guys this is cool and home 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.720
 modelka modelka just steers so i 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.830
 maybe I'll make it brighter 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.080
 modelka just drop dead the truth and 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.820
 more on the circle well and break it pretty 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.160
 difficult enough slo-mo none of these 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.210
 blocks and everything breaks by the way ru 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.310
 only the diamond pick is there 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.800
 Everything basically I told the most important 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.550
 there is one more thing 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.410
 improve 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.320
 better with extra 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.110
 subject which are called 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.420
 chevron of greek pulls it out 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.880
 right-click and previously uniqued 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.990
 because you yourself have to guess how 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.670
 it's a joke 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.490
 Generally suitable for this click shiv 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.470
 right click will be mts and brumes no i 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.870
 I can no longer worse al 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.750
 and as you saw it just increased it 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.459
 allows you to enter an address for several 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.010
 more characters however not necessary 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.120
 these few characters allows you 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.720
 teleport 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.280
 as much as another universe but 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.470
 I won't show you this because 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.870
 that I don't have another universe there you are 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.150
 should also put other stellar 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.860
 gates and teleport them 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.230
 in other universes I mean others 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.320
 worlds meaning you can set off 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.660
 let's say v2 white for due to deliver 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.220
 there is this stargate and 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.650
 teleport to them from one of his 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.180
 home to another your home which is very cool 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.940
 also actually 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.860
 playing on the server you can put these 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.740
 the gate and what can not enter them 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.780
 another pepper is also quite interesting 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.190
 thing and you can still take away from it 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.440
 redstone and not then 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.070
 the gate will report when they 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.140
 will switch you can then set a trap 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.570
 there is a man opens the gate and here 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.690
 here we have a sharp lava that 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.190
 man can not get out of here until 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.900
 click let's say or not put 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.000
 somewhere on the wall lever 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.780
 do not press the right button to lava 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.030
 remove seems to me a good idea but it's me 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.120
 I will leave your imagination 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.220
 Dear friends, the greatest fantasy of all 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.060
 thanks for watching bye bye 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.060
 see you
