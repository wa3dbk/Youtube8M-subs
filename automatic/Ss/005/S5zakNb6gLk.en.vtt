00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.720
 oli dinner gold good choice he 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.020
 per child 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:52.970
 father seen know how to wash it off 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.170
 slacker goldenrod root we will try 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.820
 the same time you will find also under 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.559
 closed snow cover because of the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.019
 plant or stop I see directly 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.720
 right up in the north and 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:09.490
 did not taste bad 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.970
 who smokes he enriches his eyes enough 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.340
 there is something going on 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.119
 It's time for a little one 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:23.439
 health net what I have the hair 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.439
 or who use the hair 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.040
 can you assign a tasteless yes 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.690
 but it tastes good 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.190
 So somehow grass set correctly 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.190
 that has already been a slight ethical departure 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:22.620
 pretty easy on parsley 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:27.500
 but never seen anyone like that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.500
 hearty in a goldenrod russian brits 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.200
 I am first or worse than 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 tasteless 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:25.560
 It is not unpleasant and the root 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:27.630
 is a bit of water pretty long 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.570
 and then you could drink it sooner 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:46.800
 or a bit but the better ones are 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:49.500
 the best of the calories here yes 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.469
 of course worth it for me to say I am 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.000
 no chemist, there are none 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:55.950
 Data about it is not really good 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.959
 data I also have no offers on the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.170
 packaging so seen this whole 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.700
 fabrics like the one I read yes 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.269
 have the wrap on the way threw 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:10.290
 after digging, separate additives 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:18.180
 no glutamate yet and very much today 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:20.400
 so if it is something again 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.360
 to spend there is what I try 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.889
 let me know and thank you 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.889
 we are at the top
