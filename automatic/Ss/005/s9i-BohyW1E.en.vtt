bottom<00:01:37.939> of<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.119> screen<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.570> does<00:01:38.810> look<00:01:39.049> like

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
bottom of the screen it does look like

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.600 
bottom of the screen it does look like
power<00:01:39.409> ups<00:01:39.590> are<00:01:39.770> going<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.130> be<00:01:40.250> making<00:01:40.430> a

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
power ups are going to be making a

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.490 
power ups are going to be making a
return<00:01:40.939> as<00:01:41.150> for<00:01:41.540> what<00:01:41.689> they<00:01:41.810> do<00:01:41.869> that's<00:01:42.350> a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
return as for what they do that's a

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.270 
return as for what they do that's a
whole<00:01:42.650> nother<00:01:42.799> story

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
but power ups are very likely to be

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.390 
but power ups are very likely to be
included<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.560> then<00:01:45.740> taking<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.100> look<00:01:46.130> at<00:01:46.310> this

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
included and then taking a look at this

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.520 
included and then taking a look at this
frame<00:01:46.640> over<00:01:46.759> here<00:01:47.180> once<00:01:47.570> again<00:01:47.689> this<00:01:48.140> could<00:01:48.409> be

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
frame over here once again this could be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.170 
frame over here once again this could be
another<00:01:48.770> type<00:01:49.009> of<00:01:49.040> zombie<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:49.790> looks<00:01:50.000> like

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
another type of zombie and it looks like

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.850 
another type of zombie and it looks like
this<00:01:50.299> is<00:01:50.479> some<00:01:50.659> type<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:50.869> radioactive<00:01:51.619> aura

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
this is some type of radioactive aura

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.590 
this is some type of radioactive aura
coming<00:01:52.159> off<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.700> zombies<00:01:53.060> just<00:01:53.360> like

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
coming off of the zombies just like

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.030 
coming off of the zombies just like
those<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.960> ones<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.350> crawl<00:01:54.560> off<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.890> wall

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
those the ones that crawl off the wall

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.950 
those the ones that crawl off the wall
on<00:01:55.220> kino<00:01:55.610> der<00:01:55.640> toten<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.270> moving<00:01:56.720> right<00:01:56.840> along

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
on kino der toten and moving right along

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.230 
on kino der toten and moving right along
we<00:01:57.110> have<00:01:57.439> dogs<00:01:57.770> yes<00:01:58.100> that's<00:01:58.310> right<00:01:58.490> dogs<00:01:58.880> will

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
we have dogs yes that's right dogs will

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.210 
we have dogs yes that's right dogs will
be<00:01:59.360> making<00:01:59.570> a<00:01:59.869> return<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:00.890> looks<00:02:01.070> like

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
be making a return and it looks like

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.440 
be making a return and it looks like
they're<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.399> little<00:02:01.579> bit<00:02:01.729> faster<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.329> I'm

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
they're a little bit faster and I'm

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.969 
they're a little bit faster and I'm
assuming<00:02:02.869> they're<00:02:03.020> going<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.320> be<00:02:03.439> as<00:02:03.590> part<00:02:03.860> of

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
assuming they're going to be as part of

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.280 
assuming they're going to be as part of
a<00:02:04.130> boss<00:02:04.430> round<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.909> some<00:02:05.090> sort<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:05.630> if<00:02:05.780> not<00:02:05.990> we

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
a boss round of some sort but if not we

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.229 
a boss round of some sort but if not we
do<00:02:06.500> know<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:07.070> some<00:02:07.369> way<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.759> hellhounds

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
do know that in some way the hellhounds

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.210 
do know that in some way the hellhounds
are<00:02:08.390> back<00:02:08.630> next<00:02:09.110> screenshot<00:02:09.350> as<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:09.890> can<00:02:10.040> see

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
are back next screenshot as you can see

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.740 
are back next screenshot as you can see
right<00:02:10.399> here<00:02:10.429> we<00:02:10.729> do<00:02:10.850> have<00:02:10.880> these<00:02:11.239> doors<00:02:11.510> and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
right here we do have these doors and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.600 
right here we do have these doors and
they<00:02:12.049> actually<00:02:12.200> do<00:02:12.560> close<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.190> kill<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.489> zombie

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
they actually do close and kill a zombie

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.030 
they actually do close and kill a zombie
so<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.510> may<00:02:14.690> be<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.870> potential<00:02:15.290> trap<00:02:15.739> just

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
so this may be a potential trap just

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.949 
so this may be a potential trap just
like<00:02:16.070> we<00:02:16.280> had<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.579> fire<00:02:16.850> traps<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.660> all<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
like we had the fire traps and all the

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.630 
like we had the fire traps and all the
different<00:02:18.110> sorts<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.590> traps<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.190> Treyarch

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
different sorts of traps and Treyarch

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.930 
different sorts of traps and Treyarch
zombies<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.239> could<00:02:20.480> be<00:02:20.599> exactly<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.379> next

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
zombies that could be exactly that next

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.700 
zombies that could be exactly that next
we<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.330> screenshot<00:02:22.870> over<00:02:23.140> here<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.560> it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
we have the screenshot over here and it

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.830 
we have the screenshot over here and it
looks<00:02:23.860> like<00:02:23.920> some<00:02:24.250> sort<00:02:24.460> of<00:02:24.580> EXO<00:02:25.180> station<00:02:25.660> and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
looks like some sort of EXO station and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.390 
looks like some sort of EXO station and
my<00:02:26.080> best<00:02:26.290> bet<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.650> we<00:02:26.890> need<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.130> complete

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
my best bet is that we need to complete

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.190 
my best bet is that we need to complete
various<00:02:27.850> different<00:02:28.240> jobs<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.780> kill<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.020> certain

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
various different jobs or kill a certain

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.870 
various different jobs or kill a certain
amount<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.530> zombies<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.950> rack<00:02:30.220> up<00:02:30.250> points<00:02:30.430> on

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
amount of zombies to rack up points on

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.940 
amount of zombies to rack up points on
our<00:02:30.910> access<00:02:31.480> card<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.900> from<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.470> we<00:02:32.680> could

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
our access card and from there we could

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.830 
our access card and from there we could
be<00:02:33.160> able<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.610> upgrade<00:02:33.790> our<00:02:34.150> suits<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.630> more

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
be able to upgrade our suits for more

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.810 
be able to upgrade our suits for more
jump<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.290> different<00:02:35.890> types<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.250> abilities

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
jump and different types of abilities

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.670 
jump and different types of abilities
but<00:02:37.120> moving<00:02:37.480> along<00:02:37.690> here<00:02:38.020> we<00:02:38.140> have<00:02:38.350> what<00:02:38.560> is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
but moving along here we have what is

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.860 
but moving along here we have what is

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
and it's called 3d militarized printing

and it's called 3d militarized printing

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
be able to see that it does cycle

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.940 
be able to see that it does cycle
through<00:02:46.720> some<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.140> weapons<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.710> then

with the same idea and concepts as

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.320 
with the same idea and concepts as
Treyarch<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.070> mystery<00:02:54.520> box<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.120> do

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
Treyarch like a mystery box then we do

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.520 
Treyarch like a mystery box then we do
know<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.690> they<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:55.990> listened<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.380> the
