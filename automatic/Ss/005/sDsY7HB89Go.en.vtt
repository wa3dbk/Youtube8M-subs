00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.429
 we have the first melon gazpacho 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.520
 This is a proposal to eat 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.860
 Gazpacho in a different way or eat 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.080
 melon in a different way in any case 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.250
 It's a very cool dish and you'll see 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.800
 what are you going to like 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.439
 we're going to need half a melon about five 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.769
 melon slices an onion salt 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.779
 preferably not refined a cucumber and 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.380
 of course virgin olive oil 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.380
 extra 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.580
 the first step will be to take the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.010
 melon slices the skin the melon is a 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.260
 rainfed fruit that is to say they are crops 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.050
 that do not receive more water than water from 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 rain with which the less water 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.100
 receive and less has rained more 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.230
 concentrated will be the natural sugar 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.230
 melon and sweeter and more tasty will be 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.040
 Now we are going to peel and chop the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.080
 scallion we use spring onion because it's more 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.450
 sweet than onion and will be more in 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.760
 consonance with the sweetness of the melon and 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.590
 it will give a less strong touch 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.270
 to cucumber the first thing we will do is 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.820
 to take away what all his life has been 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.280
 called the ass is to say the most 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.310
 dark because indeed bitter is not 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.290
 a legend of the grandmothers we peel it and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.090
 we do it because we are going to add it to 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.480
 crystal bowl where we have the rest 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.480
 of ingredients 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 The most abundant variety of melon is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.270
 called frog skin that is the melon 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.280
 green that we all know to know if 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.410
 a melon is ripe we will take it by 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.230
 the two ends and with the yolks of the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.940
 fingers we will tighten if it gives is that it is 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.340
 mature 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.950
 now we will add a little salt 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 that as I always say preferably not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.060
 We can find it refined in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.760
 any supermarket the sea salt does not 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.660
 is refined and we add a little 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.660
 of olive oil 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.380
 now we will spend everything very well for the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.369
 blender so that a mixture is left 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.369
 finest possible 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.880
 if we want a bit more 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.390
 fine then we can go through a 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.520
 strainer and it will be even softer 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.860
 this is the texture with which it remains without 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.830
 pass through the colander really is a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.700
 cold soup and until the next recipe if 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.280
