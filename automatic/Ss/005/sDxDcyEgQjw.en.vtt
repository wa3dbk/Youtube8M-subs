we<00:01:56.730> kind<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.030> saw<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.870> only<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
we kind of saw not only you know the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.710 
we kind of saw not only you know the
show<00:01:59.010> but<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.640> effects<00:01:59.910> of<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.480> that<00:02:00.600> was

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
show but the effects of it and that was

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
show but the effects of it and that was
a<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:00.900> cool<00:02:01.140> thing<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.470> from<00:02:01.620> that

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
a really cool thing to see from that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.450
