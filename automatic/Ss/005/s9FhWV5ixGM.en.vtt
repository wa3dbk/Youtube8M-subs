00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
this is the best bow storage access in

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.770 
this is the best bow storage access in
the<00:02:40.530> industry<00:02:40.980> look<00:02:41.189> at<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.879> on<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> gas<00:02:42.390> shock

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
the industry look at it's on a gas shock

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.860

cushion<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.920> can<00:02:47.069> get<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.459> through<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
cushion you can get in through it so you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.589 
cushion you can get in through it so you
can<00:02:48.659> store<00:02:48.900> things<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.409> are<00:02:49.530> long<00:02:49.739> in<00:02:49.769> here

it's<00:02:51.599> got<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.019> around<00:02:52.409> so<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.769> drains<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:56.069> same

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
it's got it around so it drains the same

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.940 
it's got it around so it drains the same
