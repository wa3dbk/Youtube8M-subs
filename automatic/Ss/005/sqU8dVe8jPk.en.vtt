00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the i can tell you that the normal penny

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.800 
the i can tell you that the normal penny
is<00:01:21.950> much<00:01:22.950> harder<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.460> write<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.420> beginner

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
is much harder to write for a beginner

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.310 
is much harder to write for a beginner
than<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.619> penny<00:01:25.890> nickel<00:01:26.930> penny<00:01:27.930> nickel<00:01:28.080> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
than the penny nickel penny nickel is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.980 
than the penny nickel penny nickel is
definitely<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:28.770> stable<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.250> easy<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.700> ride

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
definitely more stable and easy to ride

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
definitely more stable and easy to ride
I<00:01:30.990> don't<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.650> why<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.640> penny<00:01:32.850> nickel

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I don't know why but the penny nickel

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.929 
I don't know why but the penny nickel
seems<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.659> quicker<00:01:34.110> than<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> penny

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
seems to be a bit quicker than the penny

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.950 
seems to be a bit quicker than the penny
even<00:01:35.939> though<00:01:36.119> they've<00:01:36.360> got<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> same<00:01:36.810> way

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
even though they've got the same way

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.520 
even though they've got the same way
back<00:01:37.140> seven<00:01:37.500> bearings<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> them<00:01:39.409> don't<00:01:40.409> know

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
back seven bearings in them don't know

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.600 
back seven bearings in them don't know
what<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.820> why<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.610> it's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
what that's what why that is but it's

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.999 
what that's what why that is but it's
definitely<00:01:44.820> feeling<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> bit<00:01:45.329> quicker<00:01:46.009> also

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
definitely feeling a bit quicker also

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.240 
definitely feeling a bit quicker also
the<00:01:47.780> penny<00:01:48.780> nickel<00:01:49.020> does<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.560> turn<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.070> well

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the penny nickel does not turn as well

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.149 
the penny nickel does not turn as well
as<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> normal<00:01:50.759> penny<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:52.049> cornering<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.829> much

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
as a normal penny the cornering is much

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.410 
as a normal penny the cornering is much
better<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> penny<00:01:53.909> than<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
better on the penny than it is the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.899 
better on the penny than it is the
pinnacle<00:01:55.100> but<00:01:56.100> depending<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> call<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.759> much

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
pinnacle but depending the call is much

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.569 
pinnacle but depending the call is much
more<00:01:57.090> stable<00:01:59.689> my<00:02:00.689> opinion<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.219> penny

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
more stable my opinion I like the penny

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.520 
more stable my opinion I like the penny
just<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.689> normal<00:02:06.259> even<00:02:07.259> though<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> bit

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
just a normal even though it's a bit

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.109 
just a normal even though it's a bit
harder<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> ride<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.670> into<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
harder to ride want to get into it you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.140 
harder to ride want to get into it you
get<00:02:09.360> better<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.259> better<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:11.760> it'll<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
get better and better I think it'll be a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.900 
get better and better I think it'll be a
better<00:02:12.360> border

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
better border

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.450 
better border
than<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.420> pinion<00:02:13.990> nickel<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.470> whip<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.250> up

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
than the pinion nickel I whip it up

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.220 
than the pinion nickel I whip it up
because<00:02:15.700> there<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.180> get<00:02:16.300> like<00:02:16.360> transports<00:02:17.050> but

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
because there to get like transports but
