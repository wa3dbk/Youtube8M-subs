00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.170

 force beauty of agents has three 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.010
 monitors we are already testing in this 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.800
 moment you can see it 's flowing 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.380
 play sensationally plays there ses 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.090
 almost 60 frames one thing I want to call 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.040
 enough attention for the care 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.460
 during the course of all this video is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.710
 the consumption of the video cards of the personnel 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.110
 deny him this is the curse of the game I 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.960
 I want you to look good so many 70 and 80 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.000
 and now I'm going to do obviously stand 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.399
 There for the wall here is the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.460
 well-known benchmark 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 Vatican that you play well, we are 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 here as the option sounds 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 ultra graphic of the person and the screen one 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.600
 resolution according to 160 by 1080 né 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 are three monitors arranged side by side 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 then look you're going for him now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.570
 real pro test and start moving it's there 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:31.369
 which is now temporarily 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:34.380
 we're there 33 seconds 30 fell for us 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:44.970
 two cars bikes and three cars not 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:46.920
 spoil everything from strong safety car 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 you're seeing here in ultra am with 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 three monitors in this resolution I will not 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.909
 I adapt and I fell 20 opposite face of here and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.329
 much more than this is personal 14 to 14 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.759
 but we can effortlessly 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.010
 dropping up to 10 franchises understood 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.010
 so obviously we are 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.600
 changing the score of the best boards aah 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.750
 strongest video card on the market 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.460
 nowadays, two years ago, 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.650
 we will have to change a little 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.240
 personal quality of the other pro alto 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.310
 I'll play a few minutes to see if 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.060
 we can make 30's fall or not 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.880
 OK 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.520
 we know 30 is not aaa either 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.890
 10 perfection yes but 30 can already 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.640
 do not play personal this time on 30 and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:38.400
 few in front of the city and go here already 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.120
 fell from 31 but no problem as a 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:53.310
 bit more of the city always in places 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.030
 in the city there we have already fallen 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.430
 30 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.010
 So I'm not going to do much testing, I'm going 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:17.720
 change the graphic quality for utah and 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:20.970
 in the medium and 30 and 32 30 d medium 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:27.630
 three monitors and staff this is very 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:31.290
 more than three times more than the average 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.690
 I think it 's a cell phone it 's a lack 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.080
 a sacrilege has to play on the bass 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.780
 understood a stronger card in the market 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.120
 I understand the bass can not do 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.800
 30 year old knows but I think I 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.450
 I try hard if I can free the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.340
 grenade when launching a missile something 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.930
 I do not know if the weapon has this game. 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.390
 I think I can drop 30 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.989
 easily accurate when riding by car 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.310
 is the one that weighs the most between acts like this. 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.580
 in these games that we see there 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.459
 riding the car - which came closer 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.050
 to 32 years singing in the end then 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.930
 I think it's not that hard 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.170
 put this post here is made of 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.790
 What's the difference? 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.790
 Material else that gives worth 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.049
 note that you did not see the r 9 290 test 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.840
 left on the channel 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.359
 already ran in the middle with three monitors and 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.159
 We only have to see you, do not we? 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.680
 Here staff stop here that 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.810
 plates make their place in the 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.190
 the children too seems to have some 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.840
 wrong actually what we 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.740
 can comment to say that they have 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.690
 wrong thing 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.270
 it may be the fault of several 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.819
 companies in the middle is can compare to 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.699
 understand that by not having a decent driver 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.349
 of a board like this is how it can be a 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.729
 misuse of the game since the game is 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.409
 power of nvidia 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.729
 We may be feeling and here 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:54.000
 a little bit of pull pull the tongue 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.560
 nvidia popular because I do not know there and it 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.060
 also has another face both in the cities 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.940
 how much in our failures 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.569
 we're having a false relationship 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.120
 of video consumption, not of the cards 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.530
 they are not having their good and 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.180
 slc crossfire 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.639
 so man I know you have a lot of customer 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.169
 of the shop that has been crossfire alice 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.120
 I wish you were the 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.740
 Our father, you're facing this. 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.599
 At home, I want you to leave the 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.580
 comments because we will use this 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.389
 to do new tests of Jordan was the 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.340
 face 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.590
 We are witnessing in this 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.580
 moment the score of 5 thousand reais 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:33.120
 turning hote dollars into the expensive low 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.669
 this is not legal being that 1 r 990 which is 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.490
 less than half the graphics power 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.580
 This fucking thing turned out better than she did. 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.080
 then guy has good things wrong there're 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.020
 Until now I know that you comment 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.000
 I want you to think that it is if it is 16 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.610
 companies that produce games I know 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.250
 had an I know the game is to inhibit 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.289
 people know this more by letter 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.180
 I do not know if the church that charges 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.400
 pmdb made with them in the summer the 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.800
 four so do not know if this fight and 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.259
 It's a personal truth in this fight. 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.960
 she is much more in the hands of executives 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:09.029
 and from the industry itself understood 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.279
 so boyfriends of children who 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:14.069
 Do you think it 's happening? 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:16.440
 change of mbi influence amd 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:18.029
 golf course or not what you think 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.889
 of staff but really want people 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.360
 has performed poorly in this case 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.310
 of the hot dog is because the 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.969
 I actually have already tested 295 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.819
 several tests on channel 9 5 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.439
 several games but it keeps and 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.969
 The hta board has been connected more 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.429
 We're really going to have to wait for 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.679
 a better team driver than one would expect 

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:36.969
 news package that just a 

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:38.499
 completion of the inaugural game 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.749
 consciousness we can test in full 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.459
 hd just to see let's face crumble 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:44.739
 because dissatisfied with the hotel only 

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:47.139
 with the monitor steps and 295 really 

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:48.549
 is testing you in flight from 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.489
 house that has signaled that it does not know if 

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:54.039
 was warned of a cap or did you use any 

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:55.569
 kind of fooled modest in 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.279
 description and leave comments in 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.869
 Please, we'll get the best people. 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:00.519
 comments from the mess iron make 

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:02.259
 new videos on top of these comments 

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:03.789
