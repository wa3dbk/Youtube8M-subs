00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.109
 you will see it does little and the thing they are for 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.990
 happier and the fact that they are there 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.539
 also some exclusive products that are 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.060
 an absolute novelty for this autumn 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.769
 and this makes me really happy 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.349
 had to give one of you the chance 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.230
 of book goes there and so now I do you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.329
 see the prize at stake and then 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.329
 we can always pass to the rules 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.090
 here we are with the prizes for this 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.190
 fantastic of wei and now i will go to 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.040

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.760
 there is this product which is called drops 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.380
 magical face and is a concentrate 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.150
 ultra fast tanning effect 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.030
 I think this product is perfect in 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.380
 this period because precisely 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.900
 the tan is leaving us then 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.420
 to intensify the we say and prolongs the 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.880
 I think it's really gave then there is 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.300
 this other product that is called 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.940
 light maker illuminating face eyes 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.729
 lips and is very cute because like 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.130
 see this motif with circles 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.680
 of different shades that can be 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 Modular and mix to taste the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.670
 next product and this maxi farr 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 silk effect and the number 19 as you see 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.580
 this beautiful dark pink color and it is 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.950
 also slightly bright so it makes a 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.619
 really very nice effect then 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.770
 let's move on to these four enamels and ho 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.790
 tried to insert typical colors 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.420
 autumn 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.390
 so there is this that is the number 50 yes 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.700
 called petunia and is this shade of 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.930
 violet which in my opinion is a color 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.150
 very autumn then we have the number 64 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.790
 torture and in fact it is a dove gray color 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.180
 so very elegant then there is the number 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.330
 21 rossonero and the perfect name because it is 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.080
 just a red black color and finally I have 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.049
 wanted to insert a news glaze let's say 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.950
 skin color because in my opinion 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.880
 timeless so it is good for everyone 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.340
 the seasons and is the number 86 and yes 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.470
 call powder up here we have three 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.350
 eye shadows of the double effect line 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.650
 then wet and dry that can be used 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.850
 both dry and wet so 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.760
 we have the number 24 which is this color 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.220
 beautiful that is a purple gray with a 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.110
 purple undertone so very nice 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.390
 even here with eye shadows I tried to 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.970
 insert autumn colors 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.090
 then there is this that the number 25 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.180
 and it's called the lagoon and that's it 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.520
 I have so much beautiful color for you 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.350
 cute very intense by the way and 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.110
 finally we have the number 26 that this 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.670
 wine-colored in fact the eye shadow yes 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.860
 he calls his own marc 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.590
 Now let's move on to these three products 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.810
 they are an absolute novelty for 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.090
 then this autumn of the collistar 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.310
 I am really very happy indeed of 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.670
 introduce one of you to this news 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.010
 absolutely absolute and are practically i 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.700
 tattoo lipsticks that I show you now 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.620
 one by one 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.130
 so as you see it is done in this 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.680
 way and is a duo and therefore applies in 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.740
 two simple steps on one side is the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.350
 tattoo base that applies first and 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.540
 on the other hand there is lipstick instead 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.959
 in this case it is this pink color 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.080
 coral and this is the number one 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.160
 obviously as the name implies 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.280
 it is called tattoo lipstick e 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.310
 then the extreme tightness 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.530
 then there is the number two which is called 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.040
 sangria 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.170
 and it is indeed a sangria color I would say e 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.640
 finally we have the number 5 which is called 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.810
 caramel and so this will say more 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.690
 verse of nyon 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.660
 here we have this product 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.780
 called foundation plus uniforming primer 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.180
 perfect skin 24 hours so it's a 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.400
 foundation plus primer in one 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.620
 product and I find it really a thing 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.720
 very comfortable so we have the effect 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.110
 uniforming of the primer and effect 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.940
 covering of the foundation moreover to a 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.740
 protection factor 15 and therefore 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.620
 protects from the sun and how it is written 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.660
 precisely perfect skin 24 hours 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.910
 remains unchanged all day without 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.850
 need tweaks then we have here 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.120
 this smoothing face primer 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.400
 illuminating for face and eyes with factor 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.500
 of protection 10 and finally we have here 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.390
 the last product and this is called 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.630
 sublime 5-in-1 drops for hair 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.200
 so we have 5 treatments in one 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.240
 product 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.920
