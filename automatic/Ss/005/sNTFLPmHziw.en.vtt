ceramic<00:07:36.890> bearings<00:07:37.040> and<00:07:37.550> I'm<00:07:38.210> ready<00:07:38.420> to<00:07:38.570> go

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.690 
ceramic bearings and I'm ready to go

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.130

you'll notice the difference right away
the<00:07:41.390> bearings<00:07:42.080> are<00:07:42.350> slightly<00:07:42.770> louder<00:07:43.130> because

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.090 
the bearings are slightly louder because

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.720 
the bearings are slightly louder because
they<00:07:44.240> are<00:07:44.360> ceramic<00:07:44.900> but<00:07:45.770> they<00:07:46.040> certainly<00:07:46.370> have

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:46.730 
they are ceramic but they certainly have

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:54.760 
they are ceramic but they certainly have
a<00:07:46.760> great<00:07:47.060> feel<00:07:51.520> happy<00:07:52.520> fishing
