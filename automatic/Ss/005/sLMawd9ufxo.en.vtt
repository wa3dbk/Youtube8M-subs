00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
then you know it can be done about this

yeah<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.280> video<00:02:31.670> should<00:02:31.850> be<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.239> lot

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
yeah this this video should be a lot

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.440 
yeah this this video should be a lot
clearer<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.440> view<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.910> can<00:02:38.060> see<00:02:38.090> i'm

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
clearer to view and as you can see i'm

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.760 
clearer to view and as you can see i'm
still<00:02:38.510> not<00:02:38.810> glitching<00:02:39.200> i'm<00:02:39.350> not<00:02:39.500> even<00:02:39.620> using

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
still not glitching i'm not even using

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.050 
still not glitching i'm not even using
the<00:02:40.459> flogger<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.250> think<00:02:43.489> if<00:02:43.670> i<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:43.940> do<00:02:44.030> it

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
the flogger so just think if i can do it

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.340 
the flogger so just think if i can do it
like<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:44.360> without<00:02:44.540> using<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> flogger<00:02:45.200> all

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
like this without using the flogger all

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.960 
like this without using the flogger all
you<00:02:45.590> guys<00:02:45.770> have<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.340> turn<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.640> flora

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
you guys have to do is turn that flora

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.080 
you guys have to do is turn that flora
and<00:02:47.209> it's<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.050> much<00:02:48.170> easier<00:02:48.350> easier<00:02:49.340> than<00:02:49.670> it

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
and it's so much easier easier than it

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.390 
and it's so much easier easier than it
looks<00:02:50.120> when<00:02:50.540> I'm<00:02:50.690> doing<00:02:50.920> but<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.100> mean<00:02:52.310> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
looks when I'm doing but I mean the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.370 
looks when I'm doing but I mean the
reason<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.700> don't<00:02:52.880> use<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.540> mean<00:02:53.930> because<00:02:54.049> I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
reason I don't use is I mean because I

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.320 
reason I don't use is I mean because I
don't<00:02:54.650> have<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.950> use<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.820> can<00:02:56.090> go<00:02:56.209> about

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
don't have to use it I I can go about

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.030 
don't have to use it I I can go about
using<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.840> up<00:02:56.930> been<00:02:57.200> doing<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.500> quite<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.830> long

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
using it up been doing this quite a long

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.410 
using it up been doing this quite a long
time<00:02:58.070> now<00:02:58.489> and<00:03:00.310> obviously<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.970> floor<00:03:02.180> doesn't

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
time now and obviously the floor doesn't

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.120 
time now and obviously the floor doesn't
count<00:03:02.630> for<00:03:02.750> kills<00:03:02.989> if<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.680> turn<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:03.950> flow

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
count for kills if you turn that flow

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.530 
count for kills if you turn that flow
around<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.549> kills<00:03:04.760> stuff<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:05.269> not<00:03:05.390> going

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
around and it kills stuff it's not going

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.690 
around and it kills stuff it's not going
to<00:03:05.630> account<00:03:06.010> on<00:03:07.010> your<00:03:07.130> kill<00:03:07.340> count<00:03:07.519> on

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
to account on your kill count on

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.860 
to account on your kill count on
leaderboards<00:03:08.060> as<00:03:09.280> you'll<00:03:10.280> see<00:03:10.519> I<00:03:11.090> mean<00:03:11.660> if<00:03:11.780> you

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
leaderboards as you'll see I mean if you

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.539 
leaderboards as you'll see I mean if you
want<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.110> build<00:03:12.200> up<00:03:12.320> some<00:03:12.440> points<00:03:12.860> leave<00:03:13.519> a

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
want to build up some points leave a

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.220 
want to build up some points leave a
zombie<00:03:13.880> alive<00:03:14.120> get<00:03:14.510> your<00:03:14.600> Thompson<00:03:14.900> outside

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
it just keeps braining I mean I don't do

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.940 
it just keeps braining I mean I don't do
that<00:03:17.420> because<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:17.780> just<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.200> don't<00:03:18.590> see<00:03:18.799> the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
that because I just I don't see the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.930 
that because I just I don't see the
point<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.400> don't<00:03:19.549> give<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.700> shit<00:03:19.880> about

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
point in it I don't give a shit about

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.449 
point in it I don't give a shit about
the<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:21.079> whole<00:03:21.260> point<00:03:21.560> leader<00:03:21.920> board<00:03:22.220> because

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
the the whole point leader board because

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.970 
the the whole point leader board because
I<00:03:22.989> mean<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.110> only<00:03:24.230> way<00:03:24.410> you're<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.829> get

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
I mean the only way you're going to get

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.280 
I mean the only way you're going to get
far<00:03:25.250> on<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:26.420> spray<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> zombie<00:03:27.170> that

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
far on that is to spray a zombie that

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.949 
far on that is to spray a zombie that
you<00:03:27.380> can't<00:03:27.620> kill<00:03:28.150> for<00:03:29.150> hours<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:29.780> just

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
you can't kill for hours it's just

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.890 
you can't kill for hours it's just
ridiculous<00:03:30.470> which<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.850> probably<00:03:32.120> why<00:03:32.299> you'll

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
ridiculous which is probably why you'll

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.660 
ridiculous which is probably why you'll
see<00:03:33.140> that<00:03:33.290> I'm<00:03:33.410> not<00:03:33.470> in<00:03:33.650> first<00:03:33.829> place<00:03:34.100> on<00:03:34.549> the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
see that I'm not in first place on the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.090 
see that I'm not in first place on the
scoreboards<00:03:35.290> by<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.320> am<00:03:36.530> in<00:03:36.680> first<00:03:36.829> place<00:03:37.010> for

scoreboards by I am in first place for

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.460 
scoreboards by I am in first place for
kills<00:03:37.489> by<00:03:37.970> my<00:03:38.120> score<00:03:38.360> isn't<00:03:38.540> as<00:03:38.810> much<00:03:38.840> as<00:03:39.260> them

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
kills by my score isn't as much as them

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.350 
kills by my score isn't as much as them
because<00:03:40.340> obviously<00:03:40.519> they<00:03:40.940> just<00:03:41.150> SAT<00:03:41.329> there

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
because obviously they just SAT there

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360 
because obviously they just SAT there
and<00:03:41.750> sprayed<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.350> zombie<00:03:42.890> there<00:03:43.010> they<00:03:43.100> cannot

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
and sprayed a zombie there they cannot
