00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.080
 on 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.889
 so and welcome here 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.690
 the next part of my weapons will be 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.130
 and you already know her by now 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.300
 before I start with the actual video 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.849
 I have to start a few more 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.439
 Get rid of information and one 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.200
 I have the information for you 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.730
 was written quite often like that 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.410
 net looks what i next 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.480
 I'll make another weapon if we can 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.759
 or I'll go back to that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.559
 tips and tricks videos gonna go and 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.910
 the direct answer is I have 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.039
 still no plan what I have in the future 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.390
 bring a channel nice content 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.519
 I would of course relish a 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.350
 that's another weapon, though 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.329
 a bit difficult then what I am 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.890
 doing machine gun, I think 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.170
 Not so much of it and I do not know if 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.179
 at sniper rifles or economy wholly 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.219
 the demand or the 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.960
 interest is so great games as well 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.809
 Personally, I do not really like it myself 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.039
 this wrong guy or I go 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.329
 really back to the tips and tricks 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.489
 All videos just write 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.109
 please in the comments what you on 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.760
 would like to see 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.430
 accordingly can stand the new one 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.500
 bring content I'm taking off now too 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.060
 again content or if 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.560
 have any questions eg three then 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.570
 just write me a private message 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.340
 and depending on how good or how 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.140
 then discuss this topic in detail 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.180
 I will be able to do tips and tricks 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.680
 make videos so that was already travel 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.090
 enough with future music 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.799
 we'll just start with it again 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.810
 took the tournament and we look in 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.130
 group 1 the ump successfully against the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.290
 enforced mp 5 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.990
 Group 2 won the p90 in the last race 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.030
 video against the pp 90 m 1 and in group 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.469
 3 today we see the pearls like them 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.329
 compete against the npd 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.670
 I can tell you now that it is 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.469
 An exciting duel is thought as there 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.180
 This not so far apart 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.799
 see or some 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.289
 Surprises give in the course 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.000
 this videos and the afx the that today 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.180
 then they would win the big duel 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.909
 finale and enters the ump and the p90 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.640
 against so now we are up to date 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.350
 stand are 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.470
 The tournament situation looks straight 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.470
 we can look at what the p 99 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.620
 worth cent 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.750
 This really has a lot on it 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.370
 Overall, this weapon is more for 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.320
 the industries suitable respectively 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.400
 for the melee at long distance is 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.230
 this somewhat weaker 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.390
 is the best thus the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.280
 most played weapons in mw3 it me 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.950
 noticed also still quite strong 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.530
 against them led the mp 7 as europe 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.940
 place applies and as well as the pm 9 is the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.920
 mpc if he is for the fast game 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.300
 or suitable for washing 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.190
 so now we can with the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.280
 heart namely with the test begin 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.660
 the pm 9 is unlocked from level 56 onwards 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.239
 You have to enter the decision 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.500
 brought 74 and recommends it 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.450
 who likes to be with the mp 7 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.760
 or with the pm new plays 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.380
 and sister wants the can 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.209
 just with le prestige brand this 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.530
 Unlock weapons when we get the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.480
 We can already see the damage 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.680
 very first big surprise 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.720
 Damage is exactly the same 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.230
 both in the pm 9 and in the mp 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.850
 7 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.160
 they make a harm 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.970
 close distance of 35 and also far distance 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 from 20 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.230
 if we now see rpm go over 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.880
 we that the pm new a much higher 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.850
 rpm has as the mp sm 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.280
 this beats with 1090 rpm 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.940
 By the way, hotspot minute to book during 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.530
 the n so far has only one rpm of 895 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.030
 the theoretical harm then 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.120
 arise within a minute 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.910
 Can is on close distance from the pm 938 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.360
 1000 150 masseur is a problem of mp 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.130
 7 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.380
 This can cause only one harm or 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.540
 a theoretical loss of 30,000 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.370
 65 at close range 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.630
 The pm new may salt on further 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.780
 within one minute of 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.560
 theoretical damage of 21,800 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.540
 the mp salven of 17,900 thus can the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.790
 pm 9 within a minute more 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.620
 Doing theoretical harm to me 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.209
 probably wondered how the damage or 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.850
 the number of hits 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.920
 the two weapons need these 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.420
 namely also identical open 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.310
 hold and five shots at a distance 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.720
 distance 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.400
 despite being distributed two shot 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.020
 near distance and four shots on further 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.000
 land so now we come to already 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.150
 first weak point of the pr nine of these 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.370
 32 shots magazine 48 cents with extended 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.400
 mix that is pretty little if you are from 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.870
 the rpm starts from 1090 and 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.040
 then correspondingly fast nor 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.320
 always the magazine empty 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.270
 in the mp sm, the whole thing already something 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.580
 different from this whole 40 bowl 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.139
 Magazine 60 are even with extended max 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.030
 After a long time is with both 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.190
 weapons again identical in the light 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.960
 three seconds as interim conclusion can 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.580
 you say and now comes 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.139
 bit my own opinion with by 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.030
 but I think that this opinion 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.040
 Majority of all spectators now represented 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.590
 and I would never have thought that 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.840
 the pm 9 1 is supposed to be strong opponent and 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.490
 with the mp 7 the law clearly 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.590
 you can pay or you over 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.000
 a few points beats though 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.350
 you look at all this again it looks at 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.060
 it unlocked earlier it has exactly 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.280
 but the same damage still has 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.110
 a higher rpm the number of hits 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.639
 until the opponent environment is exactly 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.620
 same as the mp sm 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.150
 okay the magazine size is a bit smaller 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.550
 what a big drawback is there as well 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.830
 said without external max is the magazine 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.360
 extremely fast after charging time 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.729
 also finally sees that 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.890
 I really need to be amazing though 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.510
 you can also say what I mean so far 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.550
 videos have not yet introduced 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.830
 that the reach of the perren not 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.300
 as high as the mps have something like that 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.340
 but now means reach exactly 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.050
 reach simply means that 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.970
 you can continue shooting with the mp 7 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.080
 until the damage starts to decrease 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.270
 with dpa on 9 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.830
 and accordingly you can go on too 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.260
 further to the sea shells with the mp 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.720
 Salves are very nice with the pnp 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.400
 em 9 in the lead because everyone knows who 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.229
 ever played with the pr man 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.690
 that on melee an absolute 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.190
 Beast is what the stats prove 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.930
 In the middle distance are the weapons 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.160
 Almost balanced, though 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.070
 I still have the point 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.230
 distribute the pp 9 and in the long run 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.780
 dpm has 9 against the app and no 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.910
 chance so come now to the spray comparison 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.530
 are first the m9 as above 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.920
 planned look like the mps 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.960
 help 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.030
 As always, the weapons are completely naked 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.120
 and without any influence works 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.980
 or weapons crafts like that 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.810
 now but the graphics displayed on the left 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.100
 we see the result of the mp 7 and 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.500
 on the right the rpm 9 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.690
 you can see that the msm is relatively straight 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.470
 to top spray tpm a bit 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.940
 confused 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.320
 that was about the middle one now 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.840
 distance means one sees that on 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.390
 middle distance the mp 7 ever the 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.120
 m9 beats the comparison and the 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.220
 recoil from the mp 7 lower available 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.380
 is as of fpm 9 or better too 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.120
 control is therefore completely win 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.380
 Clear the little spray comparison 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.840
 against ipm 9 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.280
 So now we come to a conclusion and you 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.560
 can say that the apps have the 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.540
 pearls has beaten new very close 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.580
 sat comparison has the pr new 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.950
 very well beaten was even short 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.360
 front against the amis and ins 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.860
 strike the same she could no longer 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.200
 keep up with the mp 7 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.270
 thus the mpc simply has the higher one 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.890
 precision and is the total 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.750
 more popular weapon, however, you can the 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.310
 ipm new right now after the patch 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.930
 gold also highly patched 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.970
