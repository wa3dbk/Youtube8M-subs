00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 if you are going to build a house and live 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.460
 mil constantly and should be paid 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.120
 attention to the materials of which will 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.190
 home made more important 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:17.600
 blocks of the so-called claydite concrete 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.980
 claydite is small balls 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.539
 clay clay burnished by special 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.680
 technology and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 due to high temperature foamed 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.980
 containing air bubbles inside they 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.950
 similar to brick by brick are not 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.570
 Unlike bricks they exude 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.260
 the gases that they have occurred at 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.170
 high temperature cutting 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.899
 These harmful gases for the health thing is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.629
 that the gases from the lightweight aggregate blocks from 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.170
 haydite will be exhausted for long 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.500
 years and in this regard generally such 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.699
 materials practically do not use 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.359
 Now in the cottage and private building houses 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.390
 they stayed away in the seventies 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.850
 eighties 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.850
 now they are usually used for 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.060
 construction of production facilities 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.939
 pigsty barns and other things 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.619
 some warehouses where there is no question of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.729
 ecology where you just need to have 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:29.520
 something durable that roof covered in 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.060
 In this case, I am holding a wall in my hands 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.250
 panel made of expanded clay 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.100
 blocks it contains inside the void for 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.350
 relief and maybe partly something else 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.150
 will play its role in thermal conductivity 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.189
 although 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.430
 special heat here is this air 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.000
 the cavity here will not give because the air 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.329
 starts to transfer heat to convective 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.670
 by and transfers heat in general very 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.840
 effectively but for example we use 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.829
 This material Yes and can be somehow 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.740
 way 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.000
 but protect yourself from his bad years 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.820
 up in this case 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.300
 as if the house is built already not to break the same 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.879
 the end of the spit numbers means the situation 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.500
 next to the inside, the house seemed to me 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.300
 would be a good thing 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.680
 Tureit ordinary plaster then another 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.610
 plaster plaster and paint and upholster 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 some kind of decorative materials for 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.610
 In order to reduce the release of these 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.490
 gases inside buildings need to be organized in 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.680
 this house is well ventilated in order 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.890
 so he ventilated well in good 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.560
 ventilation and generally a pledge of environmental 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.080
 how would the frequency of women be harmful 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.470
 radiation may appear not only from 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.680
 of these walls let's say materials from any 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.270
 linoleum carpet and other 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.190
 finishing material that will be in 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:01.800
 you inside the building since this block in 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.550
 Generally cold block it is colder 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.940
 brick despite the fact that there are 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.600
 clay balls are colder 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.260
 bricks 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.140
 so as we see it now 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.120
 this house cannot be used in it 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.920
 it's very cold to live or u will have to very 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.239
 strongly stoke 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.230
 outside of course you need to warm it 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.110
 at least ten centimeters either 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.090
 styrofoam or foam or 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.769
 some kind of mineral wool and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.810
 then later facing the facade 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.810
 easy there either tree or siding
