there has to be perfectly straight or
carve<00:01:02.010> straight<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.850> only<00:01:06.060> thing<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
carve straight the only thing that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.000 
carve straight the only thing that
matters<00:01:06.690> with<00:01:06.870> this<00:01:06.990> baseboard<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> has<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
matters with this baseboard is it has to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.860 
matters with this baseboard is it has to
be<00:01:08.130> softer<00:01:08.580> than<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.910> drill<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.750> have

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
be softer than this drill you can have

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.750 
be softer than this drill you can have
to<00:01:09.990> find<00:01:10.229> something<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> drill<00:01:11.550> can

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to find something that the drill can

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.790 
to find something that the drill can
spin<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.300> allow<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> hold<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
spin in and allow you to hold it this is

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.770 
spin in and allow you to hold it this is
basically<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:14.310> sedimentary<00:01:15.030> stone<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
basically a sedimentary stone like a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.910 
basically a sedimentary stone like a
sandstone

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.810 

you

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.520 

and<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.120> real<00:01:24.390> spinning<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.020> fast<00:01:25.050> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and it's real spinning so fast it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
and it's real spinning so fast it
creates<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> lot<00:01:26.130> evening<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.760> ignites

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
creates a lot evening and that ignites

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
creates a lot evening and that ignites
the<00:01:30.360> dust<00:01:30.570> into<00:01:30.930> an<00:01:31.050> ember<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.890> transfer

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the dust into an ember you then transfer

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.570 
the dust into an ember you then transfer
that<00:01:32.730> Ember<00:01:33.360> into<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.290> fire<00:01:34.590> tinder<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
that Ember into your fire tinder and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.310 
that Ember into your fire tinder and
you'll<00:01:35.730> blow<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.480> and<00:01:36.690> blow<00:01:36.870> on<00:01:37.050> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you'll blow on that and blow on that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.200 
you'll blow on that and blow on that
until<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.950> flame<00:01:38.220> now<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.910> see<00:01:39.090> what

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
until you get a flame now you see what

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.550 
until you get a flame now you see what
it's<00:01:39.330> ready<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:39.630> produce<00:01:39.780> flame<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
it's ready to produce flame like that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.690 
it's ready to produce flame like that
you<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.490> under<00:01:41.760> our<00:01:41.790> teepee<00:01:43.400> it's<00:01:44.400> really

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you get it under our teepee it's really

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
you get it under our teepee it's really
not<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.880> hard<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.690> see<00:01:45.870> we<00:01:46.050> made
