00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.449
 the word kermis originated from the word kerkmis 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.820
 Around the church mass was once held at the market and a fair 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.089
 the horn fair was in 14 46 for the first time 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.949
 for the stalls and the games at the end of the 19th century, the fair grew 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.869
 to grow in the top 10 in the second half of the last century 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.689
 The Netherlands 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.130
 in 2012 the horn fair was organized for the 566 times a discovery 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.129
 you everywhere it is 2012 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
 it is 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.319
 we are already here above the city in the ferris wheel 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.399
 during the fair in the ears to 2012 of course it is an annual tradition 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.629
 from over 55 years old, who really is carried in the city and where people come every year 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.370
 look out again it is the biggest event we have here 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.120
 it is rejected at fairs in the Netherlands and then also in one 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.829
 historic downtown that is really unique 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.089
 and therefore maria we think terrorist fair such a unique event 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:29.370
 That is what it deserves to be properly transferred to the plates 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:33.609
 the next generations now if I look around me today than they walked 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.959
 and that people from near and far can make people back to the fair 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.139
 look forward to it so I am sure we will be able to show that 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.040
 the horn fair is carried in horn and with the dog 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.849
 fair 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.989
 popular entertainment par excellence 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
 and in Hoorn even an integral part of the city culture 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:56.780
 and that creates a special tradition 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.160
 such as the annual fair news jet service that is held in one of the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
 attractions today he goes the first minute 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.140
 this very well prepared to pay the the history 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.010
 and you have that the idea arose 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.309
 and I said to him has two options 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:16.779
 on the i 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.779
 fairground operator on a seat is the hand 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.419
 and I think he does 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.949
 we'll see it sit 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.789
 7 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.549
 just then it is always people who are us 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.590
 acquittal demanded because Serbia sometimes loses the almighty and that makes it here 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.259
 to give everyone the chance to optimally enjoy the horn fair 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.639
 Zenner special target days 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.379
 is elderly day 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.340
 all elderly people come to eat clean poffertjes and there is music 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.340
 to dance on 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.239
 dunn and then about thirty years that we have been standing here 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.449
 The singer is that there is a kind of coming home every time and all famous people 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:13.189
 operated by the hustle and bustle the other way I give it a hand 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.459
 at home in the middle of the city center 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.329
 divide a ribbon throughout the city and then there is nothing unique in that sense 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.209
 The Netherlands 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.419
 but also becoming almost unique in europe we have all the great lunapark to make it that way 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.419

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.009

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.009
 to please the consumer 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.210
 during the Wednesday evening the women leave the strings 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.240
 it is therefore 4 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.240
 a totally different one 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.810
 on Friday evening tens of thousands of people watch the fireworks at the station 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.700
 a blazing evening 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.849

 it is a very different matter, it is testified by motor sport and what we do 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.779
 now i have myself disagree with the criticism and a girl mark van dijk 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:34.189

 although the drawing board one day everyone uses west frisia knows exactly what 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.979
 harder to go everything became an expensive affair that the 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.059
 just agree the prices better 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:04.579
