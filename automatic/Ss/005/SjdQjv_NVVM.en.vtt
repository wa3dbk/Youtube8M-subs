JON: So, it's good to be back on the
LXD set. It's been awhile, but I feel refreshed,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.130
I feel creative to be able to be riffing with
these guys. It's like playing jazz. Someone

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.200
comes up with an idea, another person adds
on to that idea and we just keep going and going. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
Cut. Good. Alright.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.550
Today we call Super Ballet and it's sort of 
the story of an understudy ballerina

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.600
who doesn't get his shot at the girl that
he loves, because she is the Prima Ballerina

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.769
in this company and she's dating sort of the
lead male ballet dude in the company, so he's

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.900
defending the girl by going out onto stage.
He gets his one shot when one of the dancers

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.869
gets injured and he makes his case by doing
these crazy insane trick. Let's get Demetri

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.890
right here. Demetri and the boys. It's sort
of a love story - love triangle - and ultimately

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.020
in the end though, it's a dark tragedy. Okay,
everyone get to that position. And action.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.200
You turn to him. Look. And you collapse, collapse,
collapse. The curtain will fall. The curtain will fall.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.630
Obviously time is always a big issue. Especially when you 
have something as dynamic as dance and you only have one

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.979
camera. You wear out the dancers, because
they have to do it over and over again. Today,

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.969
specifically we had the snow which for the
dancers, was made out of corn syrup, so when

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:41.359
they sweat, the snow turned into a slick gel
which wasn't very good for the trickers or

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.249
the ballerinas. The guys, they had to wear
the armor when they did the tricking and the

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:52.000
ballet and it was starting to cut them up.
Obviously, toe shoes, never easy. Crazy costumes

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and a spring floor. Shit goes down. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.350
So the shot that we really wanted to get was with

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.649
this jib arm which was beautiful, you know,
to be able to be above the dance and float

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.750
around. The issue was that it takes time for
that jib to be built. Of course it's a money

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.420
shot, but ultimately we were trying to tell
the story and we were running out of time

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.970
to tell the story. So it came down to the
choice of do we take the time to shoot around

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.959
the jib arm or do we switch to the back? Shoot
towards the audience with these beautiful flares

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.019
from the lights. Ultimately we just had to
tell our story and that's what we always have

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.459
to remember, that as much as this is a
dance series, it's also a storytelling series

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.489
and we need to keep that front and center.
Across the board, our crew is amazing. From

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.890
Moe Moe, our production designer to Alice
Brooks, our Cinematographer, to Nick, who

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:53.100
does our steadicam. Today was crazy, amazing,
epic, beautiful. It was extremely creatively satisfying

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.390
You don't get a lot of opportunity
in your life to do something you really love

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.000
and that people around you love as well. You
feel like you're part of a family.
