00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
on the tips here you can see there's a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.510 
on the tips here you can see there's a
little<00:01:28.710> space<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.979> use<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.009> fingers

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
little space for you to use your fingers

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.270 
little space for you to use your fingers
so<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.000> slip<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.960> still<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.740> gets<00:01:35.040> hot

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so they don't slip but still it gets hot

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.179 
so they don't slip but still it gets hot
so<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.939> careful<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.500> inside<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> the

this Court is this is a nice one I think

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.810

it<00:03:17.260> was<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.440> other<00:03:17.740> comment<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.430> had<00:03:18.670> or

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
it was the other comment that I had or

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.700 
it was the other comment that I had or
wasn't<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.270> know<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.660> wasn't<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.960> Carmen<00:03:20.290> it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
wasn't to know it wasn't the Carmen it

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.080 
wasn't to know it wasn't the Carmen it
was<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.980> other<00:03:21.070> iron<00:03:21.460> that<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.640> did<00:03:21.850> there<00:03:22.000> if

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
was the other iron that I did there if

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.690 
was the other iron that I did there if
you<00:03:22.240> on<00:03:22.710> that<00:03:23.710> I<00:03:23.740> wasn't<00:03:23.950> too<00:03:24.130> crazy<00:03:24.340> about<00:03:24.550> the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
you on that I wasn't too crazy about the

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.370 
you on that I wasn't too crazy about the
swivel<00:03:25.150> cord<00:03:25.300> but<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:25.600> one<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.900> pretty<00:03:26.110> good

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
swivel cord but this one is pretty good

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.460 
swivel cord but this one is pretty good
so<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.460> mean<00:03:27.610> that's<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.660> cord<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.170> pretty

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
so I mean that's it the cord is pretty

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.720 
so I mean that's it the cord is pretty
long<00:03:30.720> can<00:03:31.720> probably<00:03:32.290> jump<00:03:32.950> rope<00:03:33.160> with<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.400> if

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
long can probably jump rope with it if

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.440 
long can probably jump rope with it if
you<00:03:33.850> need<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.330> just<00:03:34.630> kidding<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.270> is<00:03:37.390> a
