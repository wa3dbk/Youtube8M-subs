but still he is very weak so out of all
the<00:01:13.979> forwards<00:01:14.460> he<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> last<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.479> I

messy<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.500> feel<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.950> team

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
messy just don't really feel like a team

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.920 
messy just don't really feel like a team
of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> player<00:01:53.850> he<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
of the a player he is really the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.600 
of the a player he is really the
dominant<00:01:55.380> form<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:56.009> good<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.369> should

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
dominant form is really good but should

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.399 
dominant form is really good but should
you<00:01:56.640> spend<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.240> money<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.630> again<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> team

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
you spend more money just again the team

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
you spend more money just again the team
of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> Year<00:01:58.740> version<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.850> isn't

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
of the Year version because there isn't

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.030 
of the Year version because there isn't
that<00:02:00.180> much<00:02:00.450> difference<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.110> my<00:02:01.229> opinion<00:02:01.649> he

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that much difference in my opinion he

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.679 
that much difference in my opinion he
actually<00:02:02.399> has<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> stronger<00:02:03.060> short<00:02:03.450> that's

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
actually has a stronger short that's

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.539 
actually has a stronger short that's
that<00:02:03.930> something<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.439> definitely<00:02:04.649> felt<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.460> he

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that something I definitely felt and he

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
that something I definitely felt and he
has<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:06.149> good<00:02:06.240> financials<00:02:06.689> from<00:02:06.840> outside

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
has really good financials from outside

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.199
