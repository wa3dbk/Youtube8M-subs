00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.220
 Things can go fast in football a few months ago, Tom Hiariej 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.170
 and yet to be let out, the club came back in preparation last night 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.809
 did hiariej a proclaimed middle of the match and he makes his own 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.879
 debut on the highest stage 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.659
 with the neighborhood we become 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.039
 for national TV 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.009
 magnificent 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.019
 from nij i don't think about you after 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.609
 but maybe businessman goal scores on might 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.919
 enter the number that happens 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.140
 well there you are immediately scored do you often think I think this 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.159
 become an artist 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.620
 it's exciting you think it's weird you like it 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.220
 at ajax not exciting it is nice 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.380
 You know you have this time that the way 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.410
 jj played a great game as a midfield controller and that 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.940
 involvement with a nice goal against this in March and 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.240
 follows in my opinion of the goalkeeper the team is out 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.010
 I saw the corners of my eyes, insects come over again 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.199
 think so 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.370
 shoot it was it as most invited 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.770
 yes rule the time that the only way to score thinking 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.139
 in the crowd is the peak of jealousy 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:01.970
 that settles 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.620
 I have no and maybe with that more and more 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.170
 yes check that on the intended order and then you think that and then you do that after 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.180
 he was comfortable in it 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 as a respect he lost the competition but on it 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.869
 midfield hiariej seems to be taking this opportunity 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:15.829
 but he drives 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.390
 many of those in the front as we like it and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.830
 he has signed late playing days so he did the wk 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.190
 For years we knew of course that they could win that for both 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.920
 having on training we see that arranged to see the interpretation as we do 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.450
 I would like to have him, I can give one in terms of results 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.900
 celebrating a small party in terms of game is still enough to improve but with 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.620
 8 points from four games 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.740
 There is no reason to complain because Groningen is currently in second place 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 place yes for 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.630
 just for the duel 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.200
 well that is of course in advance there 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.180
 for having to sign this has done 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.140
 yes you know by now that I not only have point to watch but also 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.030
 of the game one 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.840
 well that's sometimes nice and sometimes we had better
