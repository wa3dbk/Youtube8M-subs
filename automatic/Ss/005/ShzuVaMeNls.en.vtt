inspired when you look at the photograph

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.680 
inspired when you look at the photograph
of<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.660> car<00:00:37.930> it<00:00:38.200> is<00:00:38.230> a<00:00:39.030> jet<00:00:40.030> with<00:00:40.180> short<00:00:40.480> wings

of the car it is a jet with short wings
on<00:00:40.930> it<00:00:41.110> in<00:00:41.560> fact<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.010> exhaust<00:00:42.340> clearly<00:00:42.850> comes

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
on it in fact the exhaust clearly comes

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.850 
on it in fact the exhaust clearly comes
off<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.420> back<00:00:43.630> and<00:00:44.230> that<00:00:44.410> was<00:00:44.530> one<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.800> the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
off the back and that was one of the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.620 
off the back and that was one of the
problems<00:00:45.190> with<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.399> initial<00:00:45.760> design<00:00:46.060> one<00:00:46.329> is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
problems with the initial design one is

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.229 
problems with the initial design one is
that<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.260> only<00:00:47.460> seated<00:00:48.460> one<00:00:48.610> person<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.120> to

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
the exhaust came off the back and it was

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.330 
the exhaust came off the back and it was
very<00:00:51.190> hot<00:00:51.399> in<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.780> particular<00:00:53.110> car<00:00:53.590> they

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
very hot in this particular car they

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.710 
very hot in this particular car they
wanted<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.670> show<00:00:54.820> how<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.000> gas<00:00:55.210> turbine<00:00:55.570> would

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
wanted to show how a gas turbine would

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.840 
wanted to show how a gas turbine would
work<00:00:55.930> as<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.140> passenger<00:00:56.710> vehicle<00:00:56.860> and<00:00:57.399> this<00:00:57.790> one

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
work as a passenger vehicle and this one

seats<00:00:58.300> four<00:00:58.570> you'll<00:00:59.230> notice<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.620> exhaust<00:00:59.890> now

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
seats four you'll notice the exhaust now

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.889 
seats four you'll notice the exhaust now

comes out the rear deck on top so that

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.859 
comes out the rear deck on top so that
it's<00:01:02.410> not<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.739> burn<00:01:03.030> burn<00:01:04.030> passerby<00:01:04.600> so<00:01:04.659> as

let's<00:01:29.920> go<00:01:30.039> take<00:01:30.189> a<00:01:30.219> look<00:01:30.429> at<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.609> Firebird<00:01:30.999> 3

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
let's go take a look at the Firebird 3

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.389 
let's go take a look at the Firebird 3
and<00:01:31.659> Greg<00:01:32.350> standing<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.009> front<00:01:33.159> of<00:01:33.310> the

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
and Greg standing in front of the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.879 
and Greg standing in front of the
Firebird<00:01:33.969> 3<00:01:34.329> here<00:01:34.659> we've<00:01:34.840> just<00:01:35.170> heard<00:01:35.349> someone

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889 
Firebird 3 here we've just heard someone

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:39.120 
Firebird 3 here we've just heard someone
say<00:01:36.099> it<00:01:36.399> looks<00:01:36.909> like<00:01:37.359> it<00:01:37.539> flies<00:01:37.920> absolutely<00:01:38.920> if

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
say it looks like it flies absolutely if

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.399 
say it looks like it flies absolutely if
a<00:01:39.490> couple<00:01:39.939> fins<00:01:40.149> are<00:01:40.329> good<00:01:40.509> more<00:01:41.079> must<00:01:41.349> be

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
a couple fins are good more must be

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.589 
a couple fins are good more must be
better<00:01:41.709> so<00:01:41.950> this<00:01:42.099> one<00:01:42.279> here<00:01:42.459> has<00:01:42.609> more<00:01:43.119> fins<00:01:43.420> on

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
better so this one here has more fins on

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.719 
better so this one here has more fins on
it<00:01:43.719> than<00:01:43.869> any<00:01:44.049> of<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.289> other<00:01:44.439> Firebirds<00:01:44.979> it's

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
it than any of the other Firebirds it's

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.419 
it than any of the other Firebirds it's
a<00:01:45.789> very<00:01:45.999> unique<00:01:46.299> design<00:01:46.329> it<00:01:46.899> has<00:01:47.049> a<00:01:47.429> twin

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
bubble tops it also features the gas

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.419 
bubble tops it also features the gas
turbine<00:01:52.270> engine<00:01:52.539> as<00:01:52.689> well<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:53.709> has<00:01:53.859> a<00:01:53.889> joystick
