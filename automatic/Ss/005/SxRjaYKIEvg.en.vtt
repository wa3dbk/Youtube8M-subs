00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.080 
could have a wraparound display and i
think<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.409> lot<00:01:50.679> less<00:01:50.979> likely<00:01:51.429> then<00:01:51.789> the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
think this is a lot less likely then the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.569 
think this is a lot less likely then the
screen<00:01:52.359> size<00:01:52.539> will<00:01:52.840> just<00:01:53.079> be<00:01:53.289> increased<00:01:53.829> now

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
screen size will just be increased now

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.309 
screen size will just be increased now
when<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.850> iphone<00:01:54.969> 6<00:01:55.359> comes<00:01:55.749> out<00:01:55.929> it<00:01:56.259> will

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
when the iphone 6 comes out it will

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.099 
when the iphone 6 comes out it will
almost<00:01:56.740> certainly<00:01:57.130> ship<00:01:57.609> with<00:01:57.850> iOS<00:01:58.359> 8<00:01:58.599> the

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
almost certainly ship with iOS 8 the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.959 
almost certainly ship with iOS 8 the
next<00:01:59.469> version<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.859> Apple's<00:02:00.219> mobile<00:02:00.369> operating

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
next version of Apple's mobile operating

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.059 
next version of Apple's mobile operating
system<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.929> will<00:02:02.109> probably<00:02:02.439> also<00:02:02.889> have

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
system it will probably also have

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.069 
system it will probably also have
increased<00:02:03.700> specs<00:02:04.179> maybe<00:02:04.509> like<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:04.869> same

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
increased specs maybe like the same

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.589 
increased specs maybe like the same
stacks<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.859> iPad<00:02:06.249> air<00:02:06.579> and<00:02:06.849> maybe<00:02:07.479> the

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
stacks on the iPad air and maybe the

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.950 
stacks on the iPad air and maybe the
ipad<00:02:07.990> mini<00:02:08.259> 2<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:09.009> will<00:02:09.610> probably<00:02:10.270> also<00:02:10.479> have<00:02:10.930> a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
ipad mini 2 it will probably also have a

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.950 
ipad mini 2 it will probably also have a
higher<00:02:11.350> resolution

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
higher resolution

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.350 
higher resolution
display<00:02:12.380> above<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.130> isn't<00:02:13.610> quite<00:02:14.180> as

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
display above this isn't quite as

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.780 
display above this isn't quite as
confirmed<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.230> i'm<00:02:15.800> not<00:02:15.950> sure<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:16.460> else<00:02:16.610> it

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
confirmed and i'm not sure what else it

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.610 
confirmed and i'm not sure what else it
could<00:02:16.910> have<00:02:17.120> because<00:02:17.510> really<00:02:18.020> we<00:02:18.230> haven't

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
could have because really we haven't

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.770 
could have because really we haven't
seen<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.800> many<00:02:19.340> leaks<00:02:19.670> about<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.270> iphone<00:02:20.570> 6

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
seen that many leaks about the iphone 6

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.230 
seen that many leaks about the iphone 6
about<00:02:21.410> its<00:02:21.590> actual<00:02:21.860> features<00:02:22.160> when<00:02:22.940> we've

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
about its actual features when we've

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.670 
about its actual features when we've
really<00:02:23.540> seen<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.050> all<00:02:24.320> just<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.650> a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
really seen is that all just have a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.340 
really seen is that all just have a
larger<00:02:25.130> screen<00:02:25.370> size<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.690> will<00:02:26.810> probably

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
larger screen size and it will probably

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.230 
larger screen size and it will probably
come<00:02:27.590> with<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.920> newer<00:02:28.190> operating<00:02:28.430> system

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
come with a newer operating system

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.960 
come with a newer operating system
