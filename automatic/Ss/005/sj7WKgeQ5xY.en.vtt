00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hi, in today's video, I'll tell 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.130
 you the difference between ram memory 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.250
 memory here to the memory module 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 Yes, it's an old good. 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:24.060
 ram memory means running a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.510
 access better rom memory means ride 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.490
 on line - understood translating this one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.930
 the random access memory and that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.870
 read only memory 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.059
 ram memory is used to load the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.980
 keep the programs on it 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:48.329
 while it is running 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:52.140
 for example a game is a game 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.030
 the hd and are loaded in memory because 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
 are loaded from memory are not used 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.699
 from hd because ram is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.189
 much faster than HD is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.860
 virtual memory on the head and she leaves 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.650
 a lot more computer that understood by 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.740
 what the memory the lower 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.600
 You had better to play. 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.860
 of course if you have eight gigabytes of 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.509
 RAM memory 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.880
 if you install another gold order 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.130
 for me totaling 16 gigabytes 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 maybe not try does not have the difference in 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.159
 games 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.280
 but for example you run 1 on a 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.119
 heavy game with one gigabyte of memory 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.070
 ram 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.950
 then run the same computer with 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.470
 35 you will now have a difference and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.829
 will notice a certain difference and in the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.829
 game 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.329
 it is responsible for starting smoothing the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.570
 computer is in it is stored the 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.270
 beaux god and tap program 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.530
 then it will define the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.820
 processor clock 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.560
 actually when you do yourself a favor 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.790
 set it up 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.129
 understood she is like us 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.550
 commands to the processor and other 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.640
 parts of the countryman 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.100
 It's how to start 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.860
 Furthermore it is configured the first 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.050
 device gives boot ie will format 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.330
 the computer and I need the computer gives 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.850
 boot a cd drive first 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.510
 then you will set up ships and she 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.760
 will configure this is our memory here 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.340
 well, this is it , guys, I hope you have 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.890
 understood if you're going to engage me like 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.630
 I did not like it down here, sign up for 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.730
 channel click the button above or 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.130
 has a button here on the side that appears 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.960
 sometimes in the video any doubt 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.470
 leave a comment and until the next 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.470
 video
