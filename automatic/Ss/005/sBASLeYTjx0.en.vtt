00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
cool you can see the effect that i have

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460 
cool you can see the effect that i have
on<00:01:30.180> its<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.570> around<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> screen<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
on its going around the screen it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
on its going around the screen it
basically<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.610> follows<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.090> cursor<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
basically just follows my cursor and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.140 
basically just follows my cursor and
it's<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.729> cool<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.090> can

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
it's really cool because you can

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
it's really cool because you can
customize<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.470> different<00:01:37.500> ways<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
customize it a lot of different ways and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.609 
customize it a lot of different ways and
uh<00:01:38.540> pretty<00:01:39.540> much<00:01:39.600> endless<00:01:39.900> possibilities

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
uh pretty much endless possibilities

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.580 
uh pretty much endless possibilities
when<00:01:40.829> you're<00:01:40.920> doing<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.189> customization<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
when you're doing the customization and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.200 
when you're doing the customization and
what's<00:01:43.590> even<00:01:43.799> cooler<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.220> because<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.970> game

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
what's even cooler is because we game

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
what's even cooler is because we game
doesn't<00:01:46.070> record<00:01:47.689> my<00:01:48.689> cursor<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:49.530> i<00:01:49.619> move<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
doesn't record my cursor when i move it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
doesn't record my cursor when i move it
around<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.939> add-on<00:01:51.180> actually

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
around but what this add-on actually

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.620 
around but what this add-on actually
records<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.439> effect<00:01:53.220> whatever<00:01:53.759> customize<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
records the effect whatever customize it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.980 
records the effect whatever customize it
to<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.500> pretty<00:01:55.909> sweet<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.420> opinion<00:01:57.600> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
to so it's pretty sweet in my opinion so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.510 
to so it's pretty sweet in my opinion so
now<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.320> guys<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.710> where<00:01:59.040> my<00:01:59.159> cursor<00:01:59.340> is

them

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
them

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.909 
them
on<00:06:30.460> you<00:06:30.580> right<00:06:30.699> now<00:06:30.850> so<00:06:31.449> you<00:06:31.540> see<00:06:31.870> that<00:06:31.919> my

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
on you right now so you see that my

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.010 
on you right now so you see that my
experience<00:06:33.460> bar<00:06:33.639> is<00:06:33.850> almost<00:06:34.300> there<00:06:34.600> and<00:06:34.810> I
