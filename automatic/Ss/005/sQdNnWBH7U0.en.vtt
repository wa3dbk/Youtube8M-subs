00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
so what we did was we built our own our

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.290 
so what we did was we built our own our
own<00:00:19.350> green<00:00:19.800> house<00:00:20.010> covered<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.850> solar<00:00:21.060> out

own green house covered in solar out

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.140 
own green house covered in solar out
plastic<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.990> now<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.170> grow<00:00:22.619> all<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.220> them

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.420 

check<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.360> out<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.020> am<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.190> in<00:00:29.220> our

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
check this out I am here in our

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.760 
check this out I am here in our
greenhouse<00:00:29.970> dome<00:00:30.360> with<00:00:30.660> solar<00:00:30.930> up<00:00:31.230> covering

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
greenhouse dome with solar up covering

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.860 
greenhouse dome with solar up covering
and<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.760> just<00:00:32.970> want<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.330> talk<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.630> bit

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and I just want to talk a little bit

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510 
and I just want to talk a little bit
about<00:00:33.990> our<00:00:34.290> Tomatoes<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.220> want<00:00:35.400> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
about our Tomatoes and I want to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.070 
about our Tomatoes and I want to
contrast<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> difference<00:00:36.870> between

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
contrast and you the difference between

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.200 
contrast and you the difference between
the<00:00:37.320> tomatoes<00:00:37.770> grown<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.220> dirt<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the tomatoes grown in dirt and the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.660 
the tomatoes grown in dirt and the
tomatoes<00:00:39.570> grown<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.870> aquaponics<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> with

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
tomatoes grown in aquaponics so with

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.940 
tomatoes grown in aquaponics so with
aquaponics<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.630> have<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> allow<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> cycle

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
aquaponics you have to allow it to cycle

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.729 
aquaponics you have to allow it to cycle
which<00:00:44.430> means<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.600> allow<00:00:45.900> it<00:00:45.930> allow

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
which means you have to allow it allow

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.150 
which means you have to allow it allow
the<00:00:46.800> fish<00:00:47.220> to<00:00:47.250> fertilize<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> water<00:00:48.330> and

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
the fish to fertilize the water and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.370 
the fish to fertilize the water and
bacteria<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.220> convert<00:00:50.630> that<00:00:51.630> ammonia<00:00:52.050> into

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
bacteria to convert that ammonia into

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.369 
bacteria to convert that ammonia into
nitrate<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:53.640> takes<00:00:54.059> between<00:00:54.420> two<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> six

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
nitrate that takes between two and six

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.190 
nitrate that takes between two and six
weeks<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.180> seem<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.780> very<00:00:58.080> long

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
weeks so it can seem like a very long

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.130 
weeks so it can seem like a very long
process<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:59.310> you're<00:00:59.400> going<00:00:59.610> through<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.140> but

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
process when you're going through it but

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
process when you're going through it but
once<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.830> done<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.820> plants<00:01:03.180> will<00:01:03.300> grow

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
once it's done your plants will grow

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
once it's done your plants will grow
really<00:01:03.660> quickly<00:01:03.810> so<00:01:04.440> these<00:01:05.100> tomato<00:01:05.700> plants

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
really quickly so these tomato plants

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.530 
really quickly so these tomato plants
right<00:01:06.479> here

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
right here

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.320 
right here
same<00:01:08.780> time<00:01:09.230> as<00:01:09.680> these<00:01:10.220> tomato<00:01:10.640> plants<00:01:10.760> over

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
same time as these tomato plants over

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.030 
same time as these tomato plants over
here

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
here

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.190 
here
and<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:13.820> can<00:01:14.030> see<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.450> these<00:01:14.630> ones<00:01:14.960> are

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
and you can see that these ones are

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.890 
and you can see that these ones are
significantly<00:01:15.920> smaller<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:17.090> that's<00:01:17.450> because

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
significantly smaller and that's because

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.570 
significantly smaller and that's because
when<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.620> aquaponic<00:01:19.310> system<00:01:19.700> was<00:01:19.850> cycling

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
when the aquaponic system was cycling

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.100 
when the aquaponic system was cycling
the<00:01:22.580> plants<00:01:23.000> weren't<00:01:23.180> actually<00:01:23.540> growing<00:01:23.840> it

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
the plants weren't actually growing it

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.290 
the plants weren't actually growing it
stayed<00:01:24.350> alive<00:01:24.650> they<00:01:25.040> were<00:01:25.100> fine<00:01:25.460> but<00:01:26.180> they

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
stayed alive they were fine but they

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.480 
stayed alive they were fine but they
weren't<00:01:26.450> actually<00:01:26.930> growing<00:01:27.260> so<00:01:28.040> they've<00:01:28.280> been

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
weren't actually growing so they've been

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.700 
weren't actually growing so they've been
stunted<00:01:29.120> right<00:01:29.420> now

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
stunted right now

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.560 
stunted right now
while<00:01:31.130> these<00:01:31.340> have<00:01:31.640> been<00:01:31.730> drilling<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.330> whole

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
while these have been drilling the whole

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.230 
while these have been drilling the whole
time<00:01:32.870> so<00:01:33.080> they're<00:01:33.320> bigger<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.820> they'll<00:01:35.000> start

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
time so they're bigger and they'll start

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.500 
time so they're bigger and they'll start
producing<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.620> few<00:01:36.860> months

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.480 

really<00:01:44.510> started<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.020> take<00:01:45.229> off<00:01:45.440> well<00:01:46.190> as<00:01:46.340> our

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
really started to take off well as our

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.360 
really started to take off well as our
strawberries<00:01:47.650> some<00:01:48.650> of<00:01:48.800> them<00:01:48.950> are<00:01:49.100> getting

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
strawberries some of them are getting

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.570 
strawberries some of them are getting
just<00:01:49.550> really<00:01:50.270> big<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.050> once<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.100> system

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
just really big and so once the system

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.090 
just really big and so once the system
has<00:01:52.610> cycled<00:01:53.300> there's<00:01:53.570> just<00:01:53.840> an<00:01:54.020> explosion<00:01:54.530> of

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
has cycled there's just an explosion of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.300 
has cycled there's just an explosion of
growth<00:01:55.310> with<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.060> plant<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.320> expect<00:01:58.070> these

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
growth with the plant so I expect these

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.750 
growth with the plant so I expect these
will<00:01:58.670> grow<00:01:59.000> at<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.420> same<00:01:59.450> time<00:02:00.110> as<00:02:00.590> those<00:02:00.950> in

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
will grow at the same time as those in

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.190 
will grow at the same time as those in
our<00:02:01.880> dirt

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
our dirt

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.100 
our dirt
this<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:05.130> growth<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:05.789> be<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.939> faster<00:02:06.840> rate

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
this this growth will be a faster rate

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
this this growth will be a faster rate
than<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.740> rope

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
than that rope

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
than that rope
that's<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.479> sustained<00:02:09.989> growth<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.709> is

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that's a sustained growth and this is

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.820 
that's a sustained growth and this is
going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.959> faster<00:02:12.959> stronger<00:02:13.379> growth

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
going to be much faster stronger growth

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.050 
going to be much faster stronger growth
because<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:15.269> exposed<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.290> many

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
because now it's exposed to so many

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.960 
because now it's exposed to so many
available<00:02:18.080> nutrients<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:20.310> will<00:02:20.610> monitor

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
available nutrients so we will monitor

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.390 
available nutrients so we will monitor
these<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.750> we'll<00:02:21.930> let<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.260> how<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.830> goes

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
these and we'll let you know how it goes

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.260 
these and we'll let you know how it goes
as<00:02:23.489> we<00:02:23.819> grow<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.420> our<00:02:24.510> big<00:02:24.750> milestone
