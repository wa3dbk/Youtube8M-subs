00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
are the way to go so what we do is start

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.200 
are the way to go so what we do is start
a<00:00:39.120> cut<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.670> slide<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
a cut out here and we just slide it

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
a cut out here and we just slide it
right<00:00:42.239> down<00:00:42.420> next<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> next<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> rings

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
right down next to the next of the rings

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.430 
right down next to the next of the rings
under<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> little<00:00:45.930> thicker<00:00:46.170> right

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
under there it's a little thicker right

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.170 
under there it's a little thicker right
here<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:46.950> again<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.700> our<00:00:47.730> spine

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
here because again we have our spine

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.610 
here because again we have our spine
centered<00:00:48.690> right<00:00:48.840> through<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> drum<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
centered right through the drum the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040 
centered right through the drum the
spine<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> thicker<00:00:50.480> after<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.660> past<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
spine is thicker after you get past that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.520 
spine is thicker after you get past that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it's a matter just sliding the scissors

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.299 
it's a matter just sliding the scissors
around<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> ring<00:00:57.420> staying<00:00:58.260> close<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309

going<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.960> hard<00:01:04.199> later<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
going to get hard later on it's going to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.730

be<00:01:05.700> uncomfortable<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.420> play<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
be uncomfortable to play so you want to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
be uncomfortable to play so you want to
go<00:01:07.890> ahead<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.250> keep<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> right<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:08.939> next<00:01:09.299> to

go ahead and keep it right down next to
those<00:01:09.630> rings<00:01:11.299> starting<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> look<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> drum

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
those rings starting to look like a drum

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.789 
those rings starting to look like a drum
nice<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> even<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.470> rings<00:01:16.650> are

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
nice and even and it's the rings are

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
nice and even and it's the rings are
very<00:01:16.950> close<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> top<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:18.000> okay

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
very close to the top but that's okay

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.480 
very close to the top but that's okay
because<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.159> stretches<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
because as this stretches it's going to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
because as this stretches it's going to
pull<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:20.880> further<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.350> very

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
pull that down further we have a very

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.539 
pull that down further we have a very
light<00:01:23.430> amount<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.850> tension<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.549> now

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
light amount of tension on there now

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.640 
light amount of tension on there now
what<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.360> let<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.110> dry
