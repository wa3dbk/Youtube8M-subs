just<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.820> clip<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.570> your

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
just just this is the clip and your

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.109 
just just this is the clip and your
microphone<00:01:55.680> microphone<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.700> over<00:01:56.910> here<00:01:57.350> and

microphone microphone is over here and

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.020 
microphone microphone is over here and
this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.810> clip<00:02:01.550> so<00:02:02.550> if<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
this is just a clip so if you see a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.060 
this is just a clip so if you see a
picture<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:03.690> think<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> microphone
