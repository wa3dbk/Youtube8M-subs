00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 good morning friends thank you for being in a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 video more with me this week for me 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.780
 this week I'm going to tell you how they can 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:17.100
 make colored wicks with paints 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.320
 cake that are these these paintings that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 They come in all colors these 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 good paintings are ideal for 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.490
 to apply them to children or to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.000
 people that require or want them 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.550
 use only a day or two and wash with the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 water is removed immediately and the good 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.180
 of this is that they do not need a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.550
 Previous discoloration so that the colors 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 they remain as they see them in the range 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 of color and good to do this process 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.789
 we are going to need good 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.710
 our pastel paintings and a spray for 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.960
 The hair 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 this is optional right now I tell you 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.050
 when used and when not and water water 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.329
 to make our application that is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 everything we need right now I'm going to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.400
 make an application so you can see how 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.400
 Good friends, I'm here, I already have 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.700
 I brought my model because it is already 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.119
 the dark hair so they see that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.040
 these tones or this this pull this 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.950
 technique do not need to have a 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.440
 previous discoloration and the tones 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.050
 they are accurate to how they come in their 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.619
 good cake bars me here I already 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.080
 I did a hairstyle to try to go this one 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.830
 accommodating the colors so that 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.270
 can appreciate various shades good and 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.310
 Now I'm going to make another dough but this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.950
 I'm going to start doing is the only thing 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.940
 what we have to do is in our water 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.229
 that we already have we go to our 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.319
 bar we are going to moisten the tip and 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.180
 with this we are going to go painting in 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.700
 The hair 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.650
 as this is an interlacing as there is more 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.980
 or less let's see what is that is 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.470
 here 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.910
 in this part 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.910
 is the one that comes out here 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.210
 with this technique it is not necessary to bring 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.860
 what are being gloves because this 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.260
 Well here I have a damp cloth 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.930
 because I do not have a key x the cast but 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.380
 that is very easy to clean hands 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.380
 as well 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.500
 everything is a matter of putting it 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.879
 they put it with a brush but the brush leaves 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.030
 a lot of waste 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:42.880
 a lot of dust and I do not know 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.750
 does not stay this one that dries goes 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.410
 to be very well fixed they will not shake 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.410
 set 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.610
 Hello 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.600
 It is very easy to apply here as you see 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.090
 it's super easy to use it 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.940
 well here I already have an interlaced 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.060
 it's all a matter of waiting for it to dry 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.000
 little for what 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.890
 be ready if you are going to apply 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.040
 what girls are coming to 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.969
 that's where they're going to use 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.519
 her spray yes because girls take the 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:26.400
 the hair and they may be staining 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.739
 hands and that's why we here are going 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.060
 to apply our spray plans and let's 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.920
 to let it dry and well I'm going right now 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.870
 to make one of him with his hair down 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.959
 so that they see how it is in the hair 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.200
 I'm good friends, here I already have 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.239
 my head turned and with my hair 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.150
 loose this is for you to see how 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.970
 we can make long loose strands not 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.310
 you need to go the collected hair me here 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.870
 I made two together but they can go separate 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.900
 or as you like it true and 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.390
 it's just a matter of starting to separate 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.459
 small tufts 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.069
 to be able to paint them 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.860
 Make your combinations according to 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.690
 color of the clothes that you bring or 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.690
 they can make their own combinations 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.099
 this is very simple to perform 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.900
 very easy and dry very soon if right now 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.370
 it looks like that because it's wet but 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.090
 Now that it dries, you will not see my 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.379
 nor what is dust or anything even if you 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.919
 here you want to make an application 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:46.650
 extra and that lasts the two days because you 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.949
 you put spray but if not with washing 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.360
 This hair is going to be removed for 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:56.360
 the people who can not have it 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.360
 painted 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.710
 for work for school 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.350
 i 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.820
 good girlfriends me since I finished several 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.940
 true colors for you to see 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.510
 as they are staying now they are wet 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.810
 and you see this appearance but when you 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.300
 dry like this one that is almost dry 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.400
 true and they will not be afraid of it 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.650
 they are grabbing them and they are going to 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.230
 to drop this, nothing else will be removed 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.750
 when you wash your hair in the 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.390
 shower or with the shampoo this is when 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.400
 they will be removed completely 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.700
