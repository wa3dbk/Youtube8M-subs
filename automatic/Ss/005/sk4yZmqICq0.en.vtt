00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.790
 welcome to the facilities of 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.559
 bima production 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.930
 this building has a control of 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:11.230
 access monitoring and video surveillance to 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.180
 24 hours we underwent rigorous 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.000
 certifications to make sure that 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.480
 be of the highest quality the building 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.980
 It consists of 17 thousand 622 square meters is 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.019
 big enough for 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.519
 fit three full football fields and 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.289
 have enough space for 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.249
 locker rooms the plant has a capacity 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.989
 Daily production of 400,000 bottles 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.120
 recently vima invested 5.5 million 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.310
 of dollars in the renewal of the line 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.100
 canned to produce body bird and 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.050
 berg now we have a daily capacity 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.470
 production of more than one million 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.990
 cans the quality is crucial for our 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.420
 Vima success has a laboratory 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.820
 microbiological where all the materials 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.860
 bonuses are analyzed at a micro level 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.660
 road also in heavy metals and 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.520
 pesticides 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.890
 and the materials are put in 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.840
 quarantine for analysis once 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.600
 they are accepted they are placed a label 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.729
 green and are released for use some 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.800
 raw materials as well as labels 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.200
 heat sensitive are stored in the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.090
 refrigerator this could be one of the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.000
 largest refrigerators in the state 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.800
 Arizona in the production day 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 ingredients in the recipe are reviewed 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.690
 three times to make sure everything is 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.570
 Exactly after they are transferred to the warehouse 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.610
 where they will mix in the hopper in this 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.259
 point will start a trip around 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.300
 five kilometers of pipe that 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.399
 distribute the mixture to be combined 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.500
 with the best purified water created by 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.880
 reverse osmosis machine that 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.460
 find behind the tanks of 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.740
 decant then return to the room 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.990
 filling this is a clean room with 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.759
 positive air pressure clean air 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.649
 is pumped constantly to avoid 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.350
 that any bacteria enters the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.450
 bottles are made nine changes of 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.800
 air per hour and it is always pressurized 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.900
 for a psi about the atmosphere 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.520
 on the other side is the access 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.290
 for the filling room where the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.260
 stuffed and caps for bottles 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.060
 are ready to label the line 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.760
 on the left side is for the products 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.890
 pasteurized by heat a product is 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.380
 subjected to a thermal process so 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.780
 alive as well as the shots operate in this 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.180
 exclusively where they are filled and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.820
 200 bottles of b2 are processed by 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.680
 minute the pasteurizer for the line 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.290
 of canned was purchased from a 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.810
 brewery and brought here in pieces took 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.820
 almost six months to reassemble it has 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.260
 the ability to produce a thousand cans per 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.090
 minute 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.180
 dima feels proud to have and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.530
 operate its own production plant 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.390
 the processes are carefully 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.970
 monitored at each stage of the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.070
 production is our commitment to create 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.380
 the best quality products taking 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.120
 in mind the security I hope that you 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.220
 have fun knowing how your 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.220
 favorite dimas products are made
