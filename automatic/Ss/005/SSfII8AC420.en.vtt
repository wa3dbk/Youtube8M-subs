00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.279
 captain america is one of the most beloved 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.099
 Us comic characters 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.760
 glorifies a great country 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.430
 protects her every scum and piss 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.090
 the toilet 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.650
 American Putin is no wonder 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.020
 that game developers have long and in some places 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.660
 successfully exploit this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.260
 superheros are the same filmmakers 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 on the eve of wide screen 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.050
 ecotone tape mercosur about soldiers 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.400
 industry broke out 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.760
 game of the same name 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.390
 strong and courageous captain 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.370
 America is ready to fail again 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.300
 by the enemy 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.360
 more about this to praise in battle 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.460
 will tell the video review of Cato Mercosur 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 just comfortably won a friend 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 according to the already established tradition of claims 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.120
 script, we do not present wrote 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.660
 its completely different people so 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.390
 developer cancel not all 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.960
 in short everything looks like this 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.180
 nicknames crazy scientists create super 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.520
 duper soldiers his abandoned in the mountains 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.260
 the castle 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380
 captain america can't look at that 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.280
 through his fingers and goes into battle 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 that's the whole story 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.140
 but even because of this you can 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.360
 it was blind something decent alas 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.160
 turned out bun we get the castle and 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.640
 wandering fighting endless 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.230
 corridors throughout five of 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.240
 six o'clock 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.829
 the game looks like days 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.310
 corridors redrawn under 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.549
 carbon paper around the same light devices 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.650
 identical lamps are lit on the ceiling 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.910
 same antenna transmit their signals 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.570
 on the video cost of money is not enough 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.450
 so the animators hastily cooked up 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.020
 something noglikskom engine 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.390
 turned out to be boring badly directed 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390
 and badly traced 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.399
 the very same concert travel 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.270
 borrowed from the player with the case 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.000
 at least I want to believe that 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.270
 developers tried to imitate 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.610
 more successful playing colds hero lock 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.670
 it's not only 200 million equally 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.269
 corridors and rooms but also 200 million 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.610
 equally trees of tanks and carts 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.790
 so the authors don't get lost forever 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.910
 try to suggest the right way and on 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.750
 map at a rally while traveling 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.250
 forever tips pop up 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.250
 in general, do not get lost 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.119
 But sometimes you want to get lost 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.869
 not to encounter again 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.049
 the enemy 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.290
 the combat system here is just as dull 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.009
 calligraphic execution 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.259
 a group of fascist rushes at us 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.699
 Hitler youth lisin wanted to deal with 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.849
 they linger from afar and the monster 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.730
 over time, he will be able to hit several 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.859
 goals at once but for now stunned 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.799
 enemy lying on the ground come up and 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.409
 finish him off but if you want a real one 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.609
 Russian then in orbit became the way and start 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.370
 your death dance here honestly fights when 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.340
 intends as an act of prima big theater 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.560
 sock hold high handles smoothly slide 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.259
 in the face 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.139
 in the project skolkovo project skolkovo and 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.799
 fathers slid unhappy 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 minions affairs 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:14.109
 goal interesting to fight buildings 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.779
 crazy scientist 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.529
 these are such robots like wars every 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.429
 of which is endowed with a unique outfit 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:21.559
 abilities 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.729
 who is the law bad bronuk then masks and 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.089
 trying to blow up in general every creature by 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.549
 a pair of expert does not destroy everything by 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.469
 superudar 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.979
 for this we need to accumulate 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.509
 enough blue 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:34.050
 energy 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.050
 looks good yes little sense 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.779
 it becomes even more boring during 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:40.859
 meetings in ways 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.159
 I honestly could like this all 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.359
 diversity 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.809
 but it always makes us 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.879
 pick up the right moment then apply 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.930
 two three hits deal with the arm and 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.899
 support but they repeat it all 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.109
 re no diversity and drive 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.109
 there is no trace 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.089
 But the fight is still half the trouble 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:01.109
 abbas on demolition melts from local 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.029
 parka 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.019
 why is it unclear until the dynamics 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.949
 we come to the desired point click on 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.909
 button and captain america start 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.259
 jump there here how to go jump 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.819
 manage the case at this moment we can not so 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.739
 that break off where people died 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.499
 nowhere 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.289
 and if everything is so simple, why it was decided 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.109
 pass the game and all that 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.180
 collectibles 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.840
 nothing we only collect in time 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.520
 travel and secret documents 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.229
 scattered around the castle for strings 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.660
 allowing us to improve our 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.780
 abilities and every golden egg bet 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.080
 and card videos and other rubbish 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.150
 It feels like Captain America is not on 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
 special operations and flea market in Turkey 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.500
 and wrap me here these pants off the chip 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.840
 plan a few t-shirts happen 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.979
 while I'm going to go mid in Moscow 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.439
 unfortunately the answer to mete is especially solter 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.080
 gives the impression of raw 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.779
 product 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:56.659
 the developers tried so hard to stretch 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.909
 toy even succeeded 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.149
 stupid gathering 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.550
 prolonged boss fights for the day but 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.599
 long rollers all this 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.110
 added us three four hours 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.150
 journey 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.919
 and after all it was possible to place this 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.409
 path to 1 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.559
 perhaps then resources in the second 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.539
 would be enough to start short but 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.919
 exciting project 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.099
 Assad is sheer disappointment 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.150
 filthiness 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.610
 alas polis 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.710
 Good luck because of the meeting on the program
