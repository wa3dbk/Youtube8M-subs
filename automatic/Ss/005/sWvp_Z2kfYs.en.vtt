00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.659 

so<00:00:00.450> this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.079> very<00:00:01.410> very<00:00:01.709> very<00:00:02.010> nice<00:00:02.190> sample

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so this is a very very very nice sample

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.300 
so this is a very very very nice sample
of<00:00:02.790> very<00:00:03.120> fine<00:00:03.510> copper<00:00:04.080> wire<00:00:04.319> so<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.069> copper

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
of very fine copper wire so the copper

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.299 
of very fine copper wire so the copper
wire<00:00:05.549> here<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.120> what<00:00:06.600> width<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.080> this<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.560> is

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.640 

point<00:00:11.309> I'm<00:00:12.059> looking<00:00:12.420> that's<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:13.080> too<00:00:13.290> too

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
point I'm looking that's just too too

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.120 
point I'm looking that's just too too
small<00:00:13.889> copper<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.420> unusual<00:00:16.410> among<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> metals

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
small copper is unusual among the metals

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.980 
small copper is unusual among the metals
in<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.820> coloured<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.600> really<00:00:18.900> only

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
in that it's coloured it's really only

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.050 
in that it's coloured it's really only
copper<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.740> gold<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.189> are<00:00:20.220> colored<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.000> you

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
copper and gold that are colored so you

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.880 
copper and gold that are colored so you
can<00:00:21.359> see<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.619> copper<00:00:23.519> coins<00:00:24.890> in

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
can see here we have copper coins in

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.609 
can see here we have copper coins in
fact<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.630> see<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.109> looks<00:00:28.320> brighter

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
fact you can see this one looks brighter

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.290 
fact you can see this one looks brighter
than<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.010> one<00:00:29.160> that's<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.519> modern<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.000> that's

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
than that one that's a modern one that's

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.049 
than that one that's a modern one that's
been<00:00:30.510> plated<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.430> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
been plated and you can see it's a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.810 
been plated and you can see it's a
slight<00:00:33.300> cheat<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:34.110> modern<00:00:34.370> UK<00:00:35.370> coins

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
slight cheat because modern UK coins

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.430 
slight cheat because modern UK coins
although<00:00:36.180> they<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.480> copper<00:00:36.809> insides<00:00:37.200> have

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
although they have copper insides have

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
although they have copper insides have
iron<00:00:37.710> inside<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> magnet<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.300> can

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
iron inside so with a magnet you can

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.920 
iron inside so with a magnet you can
just<00:00:39.660> pick<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.670> but<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.270> proper<00:00:42.660> copper

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
just pick them up but the proper copper

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.850 
just pick them up but the proper copper
coins<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.950> magnetic<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:46.020> it's

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
coins are not magnetic at all so it's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.430 
coins are not magnetic at all so it's
point<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> millimeter<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:49.079> copper

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
point one of a millimeter so the copper

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
point one of a millimeter so the copper
wire<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.129> very<00:00:50.399> very<00:00:50.640> high<00:00:50.820> grade<00:00:51.090> this

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
wire here is very very high grade this

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.750 
wire here is very very high grade this
is<00:00:51.329> grade<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.930> copper<00:00:52.289> wire<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.430> point

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
is grade one copper wire and it's point

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.430 
is grade one copper wire and it's point
one<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.180> millimeter<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.750> diameter<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
one of a millimeter in diameter and you

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380 
one of a millimeter in diameter and you
can<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> wonderful<00:00:56.219> copper<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.820> luster

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
can see the wonderful copper is luster

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.840 
can see the wonderful copper is luster
copper<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:59.270> compounds<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:01.489> not<00:01:02.489> very

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
copper and compounds are not very

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.160 
copper and compounds are not very
reactive<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.840> fact<00:01:04.530> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.400> put<00:01:05.540> iron<00:01:06.540> filings

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
reactive in fact if you put iron filings

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.700 
reactive in fact if you put iron filings
into<00:01:07.830> copper<00:01:08.220> sulfate<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:10.110> other<00:01:10.290> copper

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
into copper sulfate or some other copper

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.789 
into copper sulfate or some other copper
salt<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.760> copper<00:01:12.210> coats<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> iron

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
salt the copper coats out on the iron

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
salt the copper coats out on the iron
filings<00:01:14.430> which<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:14.939> gray<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.290> go

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
filings which are gray and then they go

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.520 
filings which are gray and then they go
a<00:01:16.500> nice<00:01:16.890> sort<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.600> rosy<00:01:18.600> color<00:01:18.869> almost<00:01:19.140> like

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
a nice sort of rosy color almost like

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960 
a nice sort of rosy color almost like
gold<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.250> often<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.939> first

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
gold it's often one of the first

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.780 
gold it's often one of the first
experiments<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.110> people<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:23.549> chemists

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
experiments that people do as chemists

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.700 
experiments that people do as chemists
so<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.509> high<00:01:27.780> purity<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so this is very very high purity this is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.480 
so this is very very high purity this is
like<00:01:28.880> 99.99%<00:01:29.930> copper<00:01:30.930> used<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.590> electronics

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
like 99.99% copper used for electronics

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.760 
like 99.99% copper used for electronics
fabrications<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.420> high<00:01:33.659> quality<00:01:34.470> research

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.749 
fabrications and high quality research
samples<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.110> beautiful<00:01:37.259> sample<00:01:37.759> on

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
samples it's a very beautiful sample on

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.020 
samples it's a very beautiful sample on
the<00:01:38.970> other<00:01:39.090> hand<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.720> quite<00:01:40.590> surprisingly

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
the other hand and quite surprisingly

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.569 
the other hand and quite surprisingly
that<00:01:42.030> copper<00:01:42.360> chloride<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.290> quite<00:01:43.560> reactive<00:01:43.890> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that copper chloride is quite reactive I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.420 
that copper chloride is quite reactive I
did<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.600> experiment<00:01:45.960> once<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.680> which<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.070> took<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
did an experiment once in which I took a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.380 
did an experiment once in which I took a
cupcake<00:01:49.310> container<00:01:50.310> which<00:01:50.610> made<00:01:50.909> Van<00:01:51.149> Leer

demonstrate<00:01:57.090> how<00:01:57.750> reactive<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.710> my

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
demonstrate how reactive it was to my

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.280 
demonstrate how reactive it was to my
children<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.549> didn't<00:02:00.090> notice<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.020> copper

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

crustacean crabs and Simmel lobsters

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.780 
crustacean crabs and Simmel lobsters
they're<00:02:23.020> different<00:02:23.230> they<00:02:23.860> use<00:02:24.040> popper<00:02:24.610> they

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
they're different they use popper they

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.240 
they're different they use popper they
use<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> compound<00:02:25.420> called<00:02:25.660> hemocyanin<00:02:26.350> it's<00:02:27.100> a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
use a compound called hemocyanin it's a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
use a compound called hemocyanin it's a
blue<00:02:27.520> compound<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.390> copper<00:02:28.950> cyan<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.430> some

blue compound of copper cyan is some

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.860 
blue compound of copper cyan is some
classical<00:02:32.140> word<00:02:32.350> for<00:02:32.709> blue<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.390> they<00:02:34.570> really

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
classical word for blue so they really

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.330 
classical word for blue so they really
had<00:02:35.050> blue<00:02:35.230> blood<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.920> these<00:02:37.170> hemocyanin<00:02:38.340> uses

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
had blue blood and these hemocyanin uses

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.970 
had blue blood and these hemocyanin uses
two<00:02:39.580> atoms<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.240> copper<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.750> each<00:02:40.900> molecule<00:02:41.500> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
two atoms of copper and each molecule to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.390 
two atoms of copper and each molecule to
transport<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.790> oxygen<00:02:42.970> around<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.380> body<00:02:44.530> of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
transport the oxygen around the body of

transport the oxygen around the body of
the<00:02:45.700> crab<00:02:46.390> or<00:02:46.780> lobster<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:48.250> not<00:02:48.430> nearly<00:02:48.730> as

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
the crab or lobster it's not nearly as

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.110 
the crab or lobster it's not nearly as
good<00:02:49.000> as<00:02:49.890> hemoglobin<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.640> if<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.850> start

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
good as hemoglobin so if you start

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.449 
good as hemoglobin so if you start
running<00:02:52.360> after<00:02:52.720> crab<00:02:53.170> or<00:02:53.350> lobster<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.070> quickly

running after crab or lobster it quickly

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.300 
running after crab or lobster it quickly
gets<00:02:54.670> tired<00:02:55.320> compared<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.470> running<00:02:56.680> after<00:02:57.010> a
