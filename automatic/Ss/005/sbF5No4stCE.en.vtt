00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.870 
just gonna do my opinion about the
Sprint<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:07.830> rumor<00:00:08.010> going<00:00:08.280> around<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.700> it's

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
Sprint the rumor going around that it's

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.150 
Sprint the rumor going around that it's
gonna<00:00:09.000> be<00:00:09.179> buying<00:00:09.360> up<00:00:09.570> t-mobile<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.980> guys

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
gonna be buying up t-mobile and you guys

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.100 
gonna be buying up t-mobile and you guys
know<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.460> t-mobile<00:00:12.179> bought<00:00:12.480> Metro

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
know that t-mobile bought Metro

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.770 
know that t-mobile bought Metro
so<00:00:13.830> if<00:00:14.070> spring<00:00:14.309> buys<00:00:14.490> out<00:00:14.759> t-mobile<00:00:15.509> that's

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
so if spring buys out t-mobile that's

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.410 
so if spring buys out t-mobile that's
basically<00:00:16.080> taken<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.670> Metro<00:00:18.000> customers

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
basically taken over the Metro customers

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.779 
basically taken over the Metro customers
and<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> terrible<00:00:19.109> customers<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:20.609> want

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
to say that if this does happen this is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.859 
to say that if this does happen this is
not<00:00:23.490> gonna<00:00:23.760> look<00:00:23.939> good<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.330> metro<00:00:24.570> pcs

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
not gonna look good for metro pcs

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.170 
not gonna look good for metro pcs
customers<00:00:25.320> because<00:00:25.680> when<00:00:26.310> Sprint<00:00:26.670> bought<00:00:26.970> up

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
customers because when Sprint bought up

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.480 
customers because when Sprint bought up
Nextel<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.560> don't<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.859> next<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.220> anywhere

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
Nextel you don't see next one anywhere

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.990 
Nextel you don't see next one anywhere
they're<00:00:29.760> gone<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.920> does<00:00:32.160> turn<00:00:32.700> around

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
they're gone and if it does turn around

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
they're gone and if it does turn around
and<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.780> approved<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.469> deals<00:00:34.739> approved<00:00:35.160> by

and it's approved this deals approved by
the<00:00:35.489> government<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.020> they

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the government and which I think they

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
the government and which I think they
will<00:00:37.559> approve<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.980> because<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.940> 80

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
will approve it because it's not like 80

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.020 
will approve it because it's not like 80

subscribers<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.579> if<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.760> had<00:00:50.940> bottie<00:00:51.180> mobile<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
subscribers so if I had bottie mobile it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.180 
subscribers so if I had bottie mobile it
would<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.230> been<00:00:52.320> huge<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.100> been

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
would have been huge it would have been

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
a just a huge monopoly and that's why

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
a just a huge monopoly and that's why
the<00:00:55.949> government<00:00:56.219> didn't<00:00:56.489> allow<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.390> if

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

and so that's that's a good part about
it<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> bad<00:01:32.670> part<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.200> they<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> whole

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it but the bad part is they have a whole

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.880 
it but the bad part is they have a whole
different<00:01:34.860> system<00:01:35.220> they're<00:01:35.820> using<00:01:36.119> CDMA

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
different system they're using CDMA

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.090 
different system they're using CDMA
t-mobile<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.400> using<00:01:38.880> GSM<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.590> since

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
t-mobile that's using GSM and now since

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.380 
t-mobile that's using GSM and now since
they<00:01:41.250> bought<00:01:41.430> metro<00:01:41.939> pcs

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
they bought metro pcs

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
they bought metro pcs
they're<00:01:42.810> also<00:01:43.170> converting<00:01:43.649> us<00:01:43.799> over<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.579> GSM

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
they're also converting us over to GSM

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.870 
they're also converting us over to GSM
so<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.750> end<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.380> buying<00:01:46.649> Metro<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
so if they do end up buying Metro and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.910 
so if they do end up buying Metro and
t-mobile<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.600> feel<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.470> they're<00:01:49.590> gonna<00:01:49.710> just

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
t-mobile I feel like they're gonna just

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.480 
t-mobile I feel like they're gonna just
drop<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> ball<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:51.020> metro<00:01:52.020> pcs<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.710> switch
