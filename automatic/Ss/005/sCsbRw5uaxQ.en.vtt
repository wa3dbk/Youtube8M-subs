00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.379
 hello together and welcome to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.000
 next part of our series horny the 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.820
 improve play 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 today it still matters how to advise the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 wm against the second part of the vibratos 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.150
 specials on nutrition today 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.990
 advanced techniques will not 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.540
 explain to you like hand finger and arm 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.170
 vibrator go as they play together 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.940
 when which one uses and how on the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.670
 sensibly the tone so refined ennobles 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 Remember the first one again 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 part of this video tutorials that this 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.309
 Expressive means always only a means to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.960
 Refinement of the clay is never 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.010
 should be used and while we are 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.010
 not to mark the great 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.979
 we start immediately 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.300
 the exercise I showed you is 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.259
 the rhythmic wobble with the finger 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.099
 You can do that quickly or slowly 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.660
 do 

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:17.660
 I'll do it slowly once 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.490
 then a moderately important but also know 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.829
 just an exercise of exercises and can become 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.939
 not always so great that 's okay 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.070
 So that was a typical vibrato 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.140
 That led to the house where I have time 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.140
 again, please indicate on my forearm 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.330
 something is faster then 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.759
 so that's a poor bike ride that is called 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.410
 Main move play in the forearm 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.570
 alternative to this is the wrist 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.570
 Also consult this once 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.870
 O 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 it remains almost calm and only 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.150
 the wrist vibrates and the third 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.800
 Method is the so-called finger 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.800
 vibrator that too I'll show you once 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.090
 while the finger and the moves 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:56.030
 wrist and the under stay 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:58.730
 relatively quiet yes all three kinds how 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.090
 it is possible to do well in the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.450
 practice is usually one 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.660
 combination of two months all three 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.760
 play 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.690
 it depends very much on it 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.760
 which note her cattle wanted to vibrate 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.680
 how long the note is, what is it 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.190
 has contact whether she is stressing 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.760
 or not 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:25.239
 Let me tell you some examples if 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.239
 you are playing slowly 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.450
 you will not usually be on each one 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.450
 individual quarters give the templates 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.580
 that sounds a bit but in 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.320
 In that case , you would actually rather 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.840
 act back with the motto 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.960
 other options are for example 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.450
 that you start a tone indicator and 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.890
 then slowly the vibrato goes to 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:14.100
 example of the beginning of Bach 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.100
 double concert the second set 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.600
 he noticed the first note begins without 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.940
 vibrato and then develops 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.940
 then slowly a vibration into it 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.400
 Again , you will not be with the 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:07.860
 inconsequential beginning because that 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:09.930
 that's just tasteless 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.699
 then a note becomes boring 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.919
 interesting if you are interesting 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.550
 is designed and if we have this note 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.340
 with almost a quiet finger beginning 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.680
 slowly let the vibrato arise 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.690
 then you have a certain 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.180
 crescendo effect that means you increase 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.039
 the note not only with the bow of the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.069
 speed but also with the 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.750
 intensity of the vibrator that is one 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.819
 Examples like the one being serviced 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.990
 used musical expressive 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:42.539
 can and should be when we enter 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.270
 rehearsed well as you 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.159
 when which touch vibrate and 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.319
 especially tries several 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.240
 possibilities 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:54.620
 this is animate of long notes 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.120
 something you can almost always do 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.580
 but sometimes also offers 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:04.380
 really to give the full load to 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:07.830
 Example at the beginning of client dur opus 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:11.840
 48 1 the first set the field with the 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.840
 play is in d-major effect with 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.760
 there it goes straight in the ford going on the 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.620
 first note because they are in contact 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.980
 that is, wise with the one begins 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.210
 not with a kick-off equal also one 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.030
 accordingly toured and that of 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.670
 At the beginning it is not tasty 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.550
 do not fit musically like you do 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.180
 reigns in these devices into 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.840
 O 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.840
 but that is 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.699
 that is, who is emphasizing who it is 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:02.289
 always played as if you were with 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.419
 the beginning as it is stressed 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:09.729
 then note the same from the beginning 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:14.679
 in this case a full vibrato 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:17.969
 needs that is now a relative 

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:21.009
 short tutorial if you have questions about it 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.360
 no mail to the by me immediately and de 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.219
 otherwise I would be happy if on 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.599
 to see you again next time 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:27.599
 bye see you
