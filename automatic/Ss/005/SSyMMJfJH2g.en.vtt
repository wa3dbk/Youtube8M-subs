00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.330
 Although sudden camera course also from father to son from scratch put a ribbon to restart here 

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:12.690
 I will try again 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 The existence of this camera lecture from this father to his son is by video delivery to the son who lives away 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.410
 It was such a plan to teach how to use the camera 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:26.230
 Have come up with that do not tell actually meet and try and yea pretty 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:29.380
 Coming out first camera Holding the recently reunited with son I in of rust and sleep at the wedding of the sister of the worth of the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:34.090
 Beneath that time he has brought one stage Lev 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:38.080
 Well then , take a memorial photo in front of Kanazawa Station. 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.400
 It's like taking a beautiful photo, and if you turn it around, it's the way of change 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.450
 It and set up to do this is Konan 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:51.620
 You know what's wrong, it 's the basic law 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:55.280
 Hold the thumb from below to move the focus ring or zoom ring 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.850
 I feel I always add a thumb index finger I 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.820
 Speaking more'm the right hand grip shutter to take a look at a liquid crystal seed back display 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.119
 I comes with a rear display even imitate Vol.1 web 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.530
 I can not see the viewfinder I took on the back display 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.270
 Take a look at the camera viewfinder when shooting with the LCD without taking a look at the viewfinder 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.399
 I can not help but that camera in the viewfinder 4 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:26.219
 I camera that i have with the exception of the possible finder to me I hope to shoot 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:30.420
 Moving it has achieved eye and focuses the left eye this with you, for example, seen in say you both eyes and binocular vision 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:32.969
 Know what comes with frame-in if seen in it both eyes when you're taking what you are 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.260
 Easy to chase even if it is an easy frame out 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:40.630
 That of the other when the computer is on a commemorative photo 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:46.690
 It is easy to see if tourists will walk in and frame in. 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.010
 There is a difference in the size when monitoring quantity with super telephoto or how much there is merit 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.070
 I'm going crazy but 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.280
 When using gold with a standard zoom lens 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.280
 The amount is easy to shoot Yoshida and Neri 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.500
 It is close to Kanaya 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.560
 It was said that if you put your left hand because it was your right hand, this is the eye 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.409
 This way by putting the woman in the finder 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.229
 I think there is a bone here in the eyebrows here 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.290
 this 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:20.379
 In three points by putting 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.379
 Every little bit of bone on the woman here and 3 points 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.750
 support 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:35.500
 Please close beside it is as much as possible in what mana 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:40.840
 Well I think you will understand if you try everyone, but the stability of the case when it is spread aside and tightened 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.870
 The feeling is different, so you can always adjust the diopter for the finder deer . 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:49.159
 Well , I think everyone's sight how many people with different sights come 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:55.250
 But don't stop it when you ask 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:56.390
 This was also there in stance towards the ne camera today First restart the first time by say the adjustment of value 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.750
