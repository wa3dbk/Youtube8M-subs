and<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> thing<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.800> spin

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
and this is the thing that you spin

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.089 
and this is the thing that you spin
right<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.820> an<00:00:29.970> adjuster<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
right here it's an adjuster and what you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.910 
right here it's an adjuster and what you
would<00:00:32.219> do<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.469> thumb<00:00:34.680> wheel

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
would do is you just it's a thumb wheel

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.459 
would do is you just it's a thumb wheel
type<00:00:35.460> thing<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.790> turn<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.570> by<00:00:36.690> hand<00:00:36.960> no<00:00:37.170> tools

type thing you turn it by hand no tools
are<00:00:37.649> involved<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.480> adjusting<00:00:40.020> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
are involved and that's for adjusting to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.680 
are involved and that's for adjusting to
compensate<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:40.980> any<00:00:41.040> stretch<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> cable

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
compensate for any stretch in the cable

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.520 
compensate for any stretch in the cable
as<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:44.270> bicycle<00:00:45.270> ages<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.200> would<00:00:46.320> write

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
as the bicycle ages as you would write

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.700 
as the bicycle ages as you would write
it<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.399> natural<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.239> normal<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.989> cables<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it it's natural and normal for cables to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.110 
it it's natural and normal for cables to
stretch<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.190> require<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> little<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
stretch and require a little bit of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.459 
stretch and require a little bit of
adjustment<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.750> time<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:52.110> especially

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
adjustment from time to time especially

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.400 
adjustment from time to time especially
when<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> bike<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> new<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> best<00:00:55.050> way<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
when a bike is new now the best way I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.170 
when a bike is new now the best way I
found<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.070> doing<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
found for doing this is they have the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.810 
found for doing this is they have the
bicycle<00:00:57.510> upside<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.859> prior<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> flipping

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
bicycle upside down so prior to flipping

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.869 
bicycle upside down so prior to flipping
it<00:00:59.910> upside<00:01:00.030> down<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:01.250> want<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> floor<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> be

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it upside down I want the floor to be

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.340 
it upside down I want the floor to be
relatively<00:01:03.420> clean<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> do

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
relatively clean you don't want to do

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.219 
relatively clean you don't want to do
this<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.680> concrete<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.930> although<00:01:06.930> some

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
this on concrete and although some

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.109 
this on concrete and although some
people<00:01:07.350> will<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> bike<00:01:08.220> mechanic<00:01:08.460> stand

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
people will have a bike mechanic stand

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.090 
people will have a bike mechanic stand
that's<00:01:09.360> spinnable<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.560> I'm<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:10.979> is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that's spinnable what I'm going to do is

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.380 
that's spinnable what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> set<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> bike<00:01:11.760> upside<00:01:12.150> down

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
I'm going to set the bike upside down

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.539 
I'm going to set the bike upside down
but<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.689> need<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.290> put<00:01:13.710> something<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
but I need to put something on there to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.609 
but I need to put something on there to
soften<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.000> blow<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:16.049> window

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
here the other thing I like to do is
after<00:01:33.900> confirming<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.950> definitely

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
after confirming that I was definitely

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.330 
after confirming that I was definitely
in<00:01:35.670> fourth<00:01:35.939> gear<00:01:36.180> set<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.259> four<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.829> the

in fourth gear set on the four on the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.330 
in fourth gear set on the four on the
device<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.290> I'll<00:01:40.290> spin<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.100> few<00:01:41.310> times

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
device is I'll spin this a few times

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.020 
device is I'll spin this a few times
just<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:43.500> make<00:01:43.590> sure<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.399> set<00:01:44.640> into<00:01:44.850> its

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
just to make sure that it's set into its

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.660 
just to make sure that it's set into its
gear<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> position<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> we

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
gear and it's in the position and and we

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.510 
gear and it's in the position and and we
know<00:01:47.820> we're<00:01:48.000> good<00:01:48.590> you're<00:01:49.590> probably<00:01:50.009> not

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
know we're good you're probably not

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.370 
know we're good you're probably not
going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> entirely<00:01:51.479> know<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.170> any

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580 
new one is still going to take a little
bit<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.479> tuning<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.600> tweaking<00:02:00.659> let's<00:02:01.229> say<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
bit of tuning and tweaking let's say the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.410 
bit of tuning and tweaking let's say the
positioning<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> break<00:02:02.430> pads<00:02:02.759> making

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.430 
where the rubber meeting the road part
that's<00:02:13.440> really<00:02:13.739> important

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that's really important

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.610 
that's really important
relation<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.010> transmission<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:17.380> see

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
relation to the transmission you see

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.010 
relation to the transmission you see
here<00:02:17.860> how<00:02:18.070> there's<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.400> little<00:02:18.870> kind<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.930> a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
here how there's this little kind of a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.530 
here how there's this little kind of a
light<00:02:20.230> green<00:02:20.260> field<00:02:20.800> knotch<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.760> then

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
light green field knotch and then

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.540 
light green field knotch and then
there's<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.900> little<00:02:23.170> notch<00:02:23.440> thing<00:02:23.890> here<00:02:24.400> on

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
there's this little notch thing here on

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.080 
there's this little notch thing here on
the<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.770> housing<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.310> then<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:27.940> can

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
the on the housing and then it you can

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.880 
the on the housing and then it you can
see<00:02:28.240> where<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> cable<00:02:28.960> thing<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.620> kind<00:02:29.860> of

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
see where the cable thing is kind of

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.560 
see where the cable thing is kind of
spring-loaded<00:02:30.250> here<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:30.910> goes<00:02:31.090> back<00:02:31.330> and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
spring-loaded here it goes back and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.120 
spring-loaded here it goes back and
forth<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.020> adjust<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.440> gears<00:02:32.710> which<00:02:32.950> are

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
forth to adjust the gears which are

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.540 
forth to adjust the gears which are
inside<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.850> hub<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.500> drive<00:02:35.740> mechanism<00:02:36.010> or

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
inside the hub on the drive mechanism or

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.630 
inside the hub on the drive mechanism or
transmission<00:02:37.060> mechanism<00:02:37.690> inside<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.170> there

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
transmission mechanism inside of there

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.880 
transmission mechanism inside of there
what<00:02:39.640> happens<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.480> cable<00:02:40.780> stretches<00:02:41.560> and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
what happens is that cable stretches and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.940 
what happens is that cable stretches and
it's<00:02:42.520> all<00:02:42.670> spring-loaded<00:02:43.440> there's<00:02:44.440> actually

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
it's all spring-loaded there's actually

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.250 
it's all spring-loaded there's actually
another<00:02:45.220> notch<00:02:45.460> on<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.970> thing<00:02:46.210> here<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.780> on

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
another notch on this thing here in on

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.320 
another notch on this thing here in on
the<00:02:47.440> older<00:02:47.830> models<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.310> I've<00:02:48.460> had<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.970> had

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
the older models that I've had that had

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.650 
the older models that I've had that had
the<00:02:49.750> little<00:02:50.050> bit<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.260> green<00:02:50.440> paint<00:02:50.740> too<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.660> so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
the little bit of green paint too and so

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.040 
the little bit of green paint too and so
what<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.080> would<00:02:53.230> do<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:55.600> have<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.870> look

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
what you would do is you have to look

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.990 
what you would do is you have to look
really<00:02:56.650> carefully<00:02:56.890> because<00:02:57.250> some<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.820> these

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
really carefully because some of these

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880 
really carefully because some of these
that<00:02:58.360> notch<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:59.020> little<00:02:59.350> bit<00:02:59.440> more<00:02:59.620> visible

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
that notch is a little bit more visible

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.190 
that notch is a little bit more visible
in<00:03:00.220> some<00:03:00.460> spots<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.030> others<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:02.050> when<00:03:02.170> a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
in some spots and others and when a

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.050 
in some spots and others and when a
bike's<00:03:02.440> brand-new<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.250> may<00:03:03.490> come<00:03:03.700> up<00:03:03.880> more

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
bike's brand-new this may come up more

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.170 
bike's brand-new this may come up more
than<00:03:04.270> once<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.080> as<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:06.310> cable<00:03:06.640> stretches<00:03:07.090> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
than once so as that cable stretches and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.600 
than once so as that cable stretches and
everything<00:03:07.480> sets<00:03:07.720> into<00:03:07.960> place<00:03:08.340> you'll<00:03:09.340> notice

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
everything sets into place you'll notice

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.340 
everything sets into place you'll notice
back<00:03:09.850> here<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.630> thing<00:03:10.840> isn't<00:03:10.990> really

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
back here this thing isn't really

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.170 
back here this thing isn't really
adjustable<00:03:11.800> once<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.310> started<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.730> factory

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
adjustable once that started the factory

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.580 
adjustable once that started the factory
that's<00:03:13.330> done<00:03:13.690> okay

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
that's done okay

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.760 
that's done okay
but<00:03:15.310> as<00:03:15.580> we<00:03:15.820> see<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:16.570> what<00:03:17.260> we're<00:03:17.470> going<00:03:17.710> to

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
but as we see this what we're going to

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.440 
but as we see this what we're going to
be<00:03:17.920> doing<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.340> we<00:03:18.520> want<00:03:18.730> these<00:03:18.970> two<00:03:19.209> notches

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
be doing is we want these two notches

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.930 
be doing is we want these two notches
lined<00:03:19.959> up<00:03:20.170> with<00:03:20.350> each<00:03:20.470> other<00:03:20.620> perfectly<00:03:21.190> when

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
lined up with each other perfectly when

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.640 
lined up with each other perfectly when
it's<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.209> fourth<00:03:22.510> gear<00:03:23.489> we<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.760> do<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.300> is

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
it's in fourth gear we we do that is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.960 
it's in fourth gear we we do that is
we're<00:03:26.650> going<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:27.070> adjust<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.670> thumbwheel

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
we're going to adjust the thumbwheel

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.479 
we're going to adjust the thumbwheel
right<00:03:28.720> here<00:03:29.140> so<00:03:30.040> while<00:03:30.640> watching<00:03:31.060> here<00:03:31.989> and

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
right here so while watching here and

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.190 
right here so while watching here and
maybe<00:03:33.489> even<00:03:33.940> having<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.330> look<00:03:34.480> back<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.930> forth

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
maybe even having to look back and forth

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.540 
maybe even having to look back and forth
a<00:03:35.410> little<00:03:35.530> bit<00:03:35.730> we<00:03:36.730> we<00:03:37.120> make<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.390> few<00:03:38.550> little

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
a little bit we we make a few little

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.280 
a little bit we we make a few little
adjustments<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:40.420> see<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.870> thing<00:03:41.080> moving

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
adjustments you see that thing moving

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.420 
adjustments you see that thing moving
just<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.770> little<00:03:41.800> bit<00:03:42.280> subtly<00:03:44.130> kind<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.190> hard<00:03:45.340> to

just a little bit subtly kind of hard to

just a little bit subtly kind of hard to
tell<00:03:45.610> because<00:03:45.820> I'm<00:03:46.060> jiggling<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.810> camera<00:03:47.230> a

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.870 
tell because I'm jiggling the camera a
little<00:03:47.410> bit<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:47.920> I'm<00:03:48.100> going<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.340> move<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.730> in

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
little bit but I'm going to move that in

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.400 
little bit but I'm going to move that in
the<00:03:48.940> other<00:03:49.090> direction<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.980> it's<00:03:51.430> very<00:03:51.760> subtle

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the other direction and it's very subtle

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.000 
the other direction and it's very subtle
very<00:03:53.410> subtle<00:03:53.470> movements<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.810> we<00:03:56.019> will<00:03:56.260> work

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
very subtle movements but we will work

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.890 
very subtle movements but we will work
to<00:03:57.550> get<00:03:58.260> those<00:03:59.260> two<00:03:59.709> notches<00:04:00.610> lined<00:04:01.480> up<00:04:01.690> with

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
to get those two notches lined up with

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.900 
to get those two notches lined up with
each<00:04:02.019> other<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.920> doesn't<00:04:06.280> take<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.519> lot

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
each other so and it doesn't take a lot

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.570 
each other so and it doesn't take a lot
to<00:04:09.150> line<00:04:10.150> those<00:04:10.450> two<00:04:10.690> up<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.950> right<00:04:12.280> there

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
to line those two up so right there

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.259 
to line those two up so right there
we've<00:04:12.850> done<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:13.060> little<00:04:13.300> bit<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.570> fine-tuning

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
we've done a little bit of fine-tuning

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.970 
we've done a little bit of fine-tuning
just<00:04:16.269> one<00:04:16.480> little<00:04:16.690> turn<00:04:16.989> you'll<00:04:17.470> feel<00:04:17.680> little

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
just one little turn you'll feel little

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.570 
just one little turn you'll feel little
notches<00:04:18.190> on<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.730> thing<00:04:19.350> or<00:04:20.350> I'm<00:04:20.950> only<00:04:21.220> doing

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
notches on this thing or I'm only doing

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.580 
notches on this thing or I'm only doing
one<00:04:21.820> notch<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.870> goes<00:04:23.020> into<00:04:23.229> its<00:04:23.470> little

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
one notch and it goes into its little

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.070 
one notch and it goes into its little
slot<00:04:23.950> again<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:25.330> we'll<00:04:25.479> notice<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:25.930> we

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
slot again and we'll notice that we

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.190 
slot again and we'll notice that we
moved<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.500> here<00:04:26.710> just<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:27.039> little<00:04:27.190> bit

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
moved it here just a little bit

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.660 
moved it here just a little bit
now<00:04:29.200> try<00:04:29.530> one<00:04:29.800> more<00:04:30.070> notch<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:32.130> yeah<00:04:33.130> that's

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
now try one more notch and yeah that's

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.650 
now try one more notch and yeah that's
that's<00:04:34.240> pretty<00:04:34.870> well<00:04:37.140> for<00:04:38.140> one<00:04:38.290> one<00:04:39.420> make<00:04:40.420> sure

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
that's pretty well for one one make sure

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.590 
that's pretty well for one one make sure
I'm<00:04:40.750> moving<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.170> in<00:04:41.350> right<00:04:41.500> direction<00:04:42.270> yeah

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
I'm moving that in right direction yeah

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.080 
I'm moving that in right direction yeah
moved<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.500> little<00:04:44.650> too<00:04:44.890> far<00:04:45.160> back<00:04:45.670> up<00:04:45.880> one

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
moved a little too far back up one

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.570 
moved a little too far back up one
knotch<00:04:46.800> but<00:04:47.800> that's<00:04:47.980> how<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:48.250> would<00:04:48.460> adjust

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
knotch but that's how you would adjust

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.880 
knotch but that's how you would adjust
that<00:04:48.940> thing<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.660> remember<00:04:50.230> when<00:04:50.410> it's<00:04:50.530> brand

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
that thing and remember when it's brand

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.400 
that thing and remember when it's brand
new<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:52.270> cables<00:04:52.660> kind<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:52.990> stretching

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
new and the cables kind of stretching

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.770 
new and the cables kind of stretching
and<00:04:53.470> settling<00:04:53.950> into<00:04:54.250> its<00:04:54.400> positions<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.390> may

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
and settling into its positions you may

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.050 
and settling into its positions you may
be<00:04:56.100> stopping<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.250> doing<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.640> little<00:04:57.850> bit

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
be stopping and doing this a little bit

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.700 
be stopping and doing this a little bit
more<00:04:58.240> than<00:04:58.360> once<00:04:58.540> and<00:04:58.750> then<00:04:58.870> as<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.170> bike<00:04:59.320> ages

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
more than once and then as the bike ages

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.110 
more than once and then as the bike ages
you<00:04:59.890> do<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.130> less<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.490> less<00:05:00.580> frequently

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
you do it less and less frequently

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.880 
you do it less and less frequently
that's<00:05:01.330> why<00:05:01.540> a<00:05:01.840> lot<00:05:01.900> of<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.260> people<00:05:02.560> who<00:05:02.680> buy

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
that's why a lot of the people who buy

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.760 
that's why a lot of the people who buy
one<00:05:03.070> of<00:05:03.100> these<00:05:03.280> bikes<00:05:03.490> use<00:05:03.880> have<00:05:04.840> absolutely

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
one of these bikes use have absolutely

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.700 
one of these bikes use have absolutely
no<00:05:05.950> awareness<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.850> adjustment<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:08.560> other

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
no awareness of the adjustment the other

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.980 
no awareness of the adjustment the other
little<00:05:08.920> bit<00:05:09.280> of<00:05:09.370> good<00:05:09.490> news<00:05:09.550> if<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.780> meet

uninformed<00:05:15.310> about<00:05:15.610> how<00:05:15.820> to<00:05:15.880> adjust<00:05:16.120> these

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
uninformed about how to adjust these

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.110 
uninformed about how to adjust these
transmissions<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.590> they<00:05:17.650> say<00:05:17.830> well<00:05:18.120> it's

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
transmissions and they say well it's

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.480 
transmissions and they say well it's
really<00:05:19.300> nice<00:05:19.630> but<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:20.590> seems<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:21.040> skipping

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
really nice but it seems a skipping

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.280 
really nice but it seems a skipping
grind<00:05:21.760> inside<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.480> I<00:05:22.510> don't<00:05:22.570> like<00:05:22.870> it

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
grind inside and I don't like it

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.470 
grind inside and I don't like it
so<00:05:23.680> I'll<00:05:23.890> sell<00:05:24.100> it<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.430> at<00:05:24.550> half<00:05:24.760> price<00:05:25.180> go

so I'll sell it to you at half price go
ahead<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.930> mean<00:05:26.200> because<00:05:26.410> these<00:05:27.340> are<00:05:27.580> a

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
ahead I mean because these are a

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.220 
ahead I mean because these are a
thousand<00:05:27.970> dollar<00:05:28.120> bike<00:05:28.420> so<00:05:28.660> if<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:28.870> can<00:05:28.990> grab

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
thousand dollar bike so if you can grab

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.490 
thousand dollar bike so if you can grab
one<00:05:29.410> for<00:05:29.590> 500<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.340> it<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.700> know<00:05:31.200> but<00:05:32.200> that's

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
one for 500 to it you know but that's

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.680 
one for 500 to it you know but that's
it's<00:05:33.370> basically<00:05:33.790> how<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.090> adjustment<00:05:34.360> goes

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
it's basically how the adjustment goes

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.140 
it's basically how the adjustment goes
you<00:05:34.870> get<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.080> in<00:05:35.170> fourth<00:05:35.440> gear<00:05:35.910> you<00:05:36.910> play

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
you get it in fourth gear you play

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.200 
you get it in fourth gear you play
around<00:05:37.300> that<00:05:37.630> little<00:05:37.870> thumb<00:05:38.050> wheel<00:05:38.260> until<00:05:39.210> you

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
around that little thumb wheel until you
