okay now do you guys train on all these
new<00:02:36.880> vehicles<00:02:37.330> as<00:02:37.450> far<00:02:37.600> as<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.750> difference

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
new vehicles as far as the difference

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.630 
new vehicles as far as the difference
between<00:02:38.080> say<00:02:38.410> an<00:02:38.560> old<00:02:38.740> school<00:02:39.070> chevy<00:02:39.490> with<00:02:39.580> a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
solid axle versus a lot of the new

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.050 
solid axle versus a lot of the new
trucks<00:02:42.010> having<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> independent<00:02:42.910> front

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
trucks having the independent front

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.610 
trucks having the independent front
suspension<00:02:43.150> oh<00:02:43.780> yeah<00:02:44.110> it's<00:02:44.320> one<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.560> those

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
suspension oh yeah it's one of those

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.320 
suspension oh yeah it's one of those
things<00:02:44.680> they<00:02:45.010> get<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> video<00:02:45.370> they<00:02:45.670> watch<00:02:45.880> and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
things they get a video they watch and

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
they go through a tech manual and

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.980 
they go through a tech manual and
there's<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.490> lot<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.670> upfront<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.450> training

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
there's a lot of upfront and training

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.750 
there's a lot of upfront and training
when<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.410> get<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.650> new<00:02:50.800> kit<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.430> your<00:02:51.490> shark

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
when they get a new kit and your shark

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.490 
when they get a new kit and your shark
comes<00:02:51.940> out<00:02:52.120> all<00:02:52.750> right<00:02:52.930> well<00:02:53.080> Jason<00:02:53.410> we
