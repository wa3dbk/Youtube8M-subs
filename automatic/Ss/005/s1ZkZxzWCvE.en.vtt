00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.930
 our research project has been 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.520
 focused on the analysis of the drawings 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.510
 animations that are broadcast on television 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.590
 this work is currently a pioneer 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.139
 in Spain because there has not been 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.190
 previous investigations that focus 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.200
 in analyzing the cartoons 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.430
 There have been previous cases in which 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.050
 has analyzed violence in the 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.660
 television but never focusing on 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.640
 this type of content 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.289
 one of the most revealing data is that 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.390
 we have found is that of all the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.640
 drawings analyzed less than 10 times 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 a hundred have been led by women 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.379
 and in the case of productions 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.379
 Spanish only 74 have been directed 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.420
 for it we have analyzed 163 series 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.660
 cartoons of all of them we have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.300
 studied a total of 621 characters of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.970
 all of them around 33% were just 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.640
 female characters what you want to say 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.790
 that for every female character there are 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.120
 two male characters inside 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.570
 analyzed female analyzed 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.450
 we found many stereotypes 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.860
 Females who are negative are fed 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.570
 much the idea that women are 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.899
 They worry a lot about their physical appearance 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.780
 for purchases are consumerists are more 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.880
 superficial that the boys and so on do not 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 we come to understand why they occur 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.710
 this kind of situations but the true 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.300
 is that there is still a lot of inequality 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 in the audiovisual sector since the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.740
 women never get to occupy these 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.009
 manager positions 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.409
 even though there is more graduate in 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.340
 loads like fine communication arts 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.340
 audiovisual than the licensee 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.880
 I will not fail this time 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.710
 This research is proposed as 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.689
 something necessary to correct the error 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.549
 that we many parents think about 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.549
 that any drawing production 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.310
 animated is suitable for children and in the end the 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.390
 television became a nanny 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.599
 before which we can leave our 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.739
 children hours and hours without worrying 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.989
 really what they are seeing and 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.519
 if the messages that transmit those 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.700
 programs are the right ones for your 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.700
 education
