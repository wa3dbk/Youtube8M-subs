natural so yep that's pretty much it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.430 
natural so yep that's pretty much it
hundreds<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.490> hundred<00:01:10.150> is<00:01:10.390> because<00:01:10.720> it's<00:01:10.900> not

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
hundreds a hundred is because it's not
