 only one park there marks two points of 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.890
 map but if you go to them alone 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.780
 you will find a caravan supposedly 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.140
 to investigate those UFOs but not 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.850
 you will find neither does the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.370
 killer of the chainsaw and no 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.290
 Ness Lake Monster 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.930
 if you ever see one in a video is 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.660
 false alone is a montage some trick 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.270
 some way downloaded the following 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.910
 mysteries are errors of the game failures 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.250
 that the programmers committed the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.070
 ghost cars and vortex ghosts 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.200
 the ghost choches move because of 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.090
 that have been placed on a slope 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.100
 and when we arrive it makes it roll hill 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.860
 down as it would with any other 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.600
 vehicle and the phantom vortex moves 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.640
 due to the unevenness of the sea 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.590
 the suicidal photographer is another simple 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.150
 game error 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.190
 originally the photographer had to take 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.030
 some pictures and keep walking by 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.520
 the street 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.730
 but since it is not well programmed it continues 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.010
 walking straight and the mirror falls into the water 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.050
 ghost is another mistake if you approach with 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.420
 a camera a rifle in the mirror of a 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.540
 tattoo shop you can see people 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.340
 walking and a gaming machine all 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.560
 the underworld of the game are errors 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.660
 these can be allowed to see the city 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.720
 from below, move to places 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.480
 strangers and more things and in this game 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.430
 there are several winks to gta bay city ​​like 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.410
 some figures in the store zero of the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.240
 protagonists and maps of the city 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.240
 thrown in the garbage of a town
