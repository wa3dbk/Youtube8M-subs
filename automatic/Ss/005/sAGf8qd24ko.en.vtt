00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:32.270 

I've<00:01:15.100> got<00:01:15.280> most<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.700> white<00:01:15.880> off

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.499 

if<00:01:33.280> you're<00:01:33.460> doing<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.789> with<00:01:33.969> a<00:01:34.030> cantaloupe

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
if you're doing this with a cantaloupe

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.149 
if you're doing this with a cantaloupe
of<00:01:34.780> course<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.170> would<00:01:35.289> scoop<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.709> seeds<00:01:35.920> out

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
of course you would scoop the seeds out

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.090 
of course you would scoop the seeds out
first<00:01:36.490> but<00:01:36.819> it<00:01:36.909> works<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.179> same<00:01:37.479> way<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
first but it works the same way and

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.010 
first but it works the same way and
that's<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.520> best<00:01:40.030> way<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.270> have<00:01:40.539> cantaloupe

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
that's the best way to have cantaloupe

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:52.829 
that's the best way to have cantaloupe
for<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.289> crowd<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:50.170> that<00:01:50.380> good
