the exact size of the state of

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.600 
the exact size of the state of
California<00:02:50.650> I'll<00:02:51.650> go<00:02:51.890> ahead<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.220> add<00:02:52.340> an<00:02:52.460> alt

you'll see the pointer the cursor

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.030 
you'll see the pointer the cursor
changes<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:13.280> mouse<00:03:13.460> cursor<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.590> if<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.680> stop

changes to a mouse cursor and if I stop

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.380 
changes to a mouse cursor and if I stop
it<00:03:16.250> right<00:03:16.400> there<00:03:16.700> you'll<00:03:16.910> see<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.150> the
