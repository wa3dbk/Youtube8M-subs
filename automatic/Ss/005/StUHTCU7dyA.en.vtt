00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.840
 until everything is well incorporated has 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.090
 of being a homogeneous mass 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.010
 keep working the cookie so that 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.010
 is well impregnated with the butter 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.089
 once well mixed we will prepare 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.740
 the base of the cake in a mold 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.870
 removable the mold has to make 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.479
 approximately about 22 centimeters that 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.479
 it's something more compact we pour the cookie 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.830
 and we press well 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.500
 Once it is ready we will donate it in the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:30.010
 oven 5 minutes about 180 200 degrees 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.050
 after 5 minutes we have the base list 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.570
 while the base cools let's do 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.400
 the filling we need four buds 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.400
 egg we will separate the egg whites 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.080
 we will add condensed milk 8 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.080
 spoonfuls is more than half a pot 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.690
 we beat it well and add little by little 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.250
 the cheeses 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.250
 we started with the pasteurized cheese 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.360
 you have to mix it well in the kitchen 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.360
 Sometimes it takes time 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.870
 We will continue adding the cottage cheese or 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.400
 quark in this case is quark but 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.400
 any type of cottage cheese 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.709
 once we have the smooth mass and 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.220
 homogeneous we will pour it on the base 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.220
 prepared 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.280
 and we will distribute a little bit well 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.540

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.310
 skin in which it is not necessary 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.379
 peel it is not necessary to remove 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.170
 the pine nuts once we have the 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.780

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.370
 about 400 milliliters 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.880
 and we add the sugar we mix a 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.880
 bit 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.180

 medium fire for about 10 minutes 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.230
 once the syrup you're thinking is 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.780
 weighed a bit and the compote is 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.410

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.870
 and we cook it a couple more minutes 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.330
 Once the cooking is finished we remove 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.540
 the cake once we have the cold cake 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.710

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.510
 Once painted we serve it accompanied 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.980
