like<00:00:09.510> piping<00:00:09.990> not<00:00:10.769> writing<00:00:11.160> with<00:00:11.250> markers<00:00:11.580> or

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
like piping not writing with markers or

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.999 
like piping not writing with markers or
anything<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.059> but<00:00:12.360> piping<00:00:13.009> there's

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
anything like that but piping there's

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.919 
anything like that but piping there's
really<00:00:14.099> not<00:00:14.280> much<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.750> isn't

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
really not much to it so this isn't

if you're you know and be textural eyes

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.690 
if you're you know and be textural eyes
and<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.440> write<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.739> cursive<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.399> print

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and you can write in cursive and print

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.970 
and you can write in cursive and print
both<00:00:41.969> equally<00:00:42.450> well<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.469> hat<00:00:43.649> off<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
I'm not one of those people my print

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.549 
I'm not one of those people my print
piping<00:00:47.129> stinks<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.360> terrible<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.930> always

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
piping stinks it's terrible I always

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.810 
piping stinks it's terrible I always
write<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.829> cursive<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.270> Python<00:00:51.899> cursive<00:00:52.820> so

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
write in cursive so I Python cursive so

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.369 
write in cursive so I Python cursive so
they're<00:00:54.000> figure<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.750> which<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.989> strong<00:00:55.230> at

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
they're figure out which is strong at

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.930 
they're figure out which is strong at
and<00:00:55.559> I've<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:55.860> test<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> piece<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and I've actually test on a piece of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.869 
and I've actually test on a piece of
waxed<00:00:57.870> paper<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.350> something<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.520> figure<00:00:59.730> out

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
waxed paper or something and figure out

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
waxed paper or something and figure out
which<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:01.440> seem<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> knack<00:01:02.070> for

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
which one you seem to have a knack for

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.390 
which one you seem to have a knack for
some<00:01:02.579> people<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.229> know<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.979> people<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.309> do

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
some people I know some people can do

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 
some people I know some people can do
both<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:05.970> can't<00:01:06.770> anyway

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
both I just can't anyway

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.300 
both I just can't anyway
trick<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.450> you're<00:01:10.229> doing<00:01:10.500> large

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
individual letters you can go ahead and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
individual letters you can go ahead and
do<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> whole<00:01:15.090> touch<00:01:15.780> down<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> lift<00:01:16.320> thing

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740

let's<00:02:39.870> how<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.260> looks<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.159> it's<00:02:41.400> scripted

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
let's how it looks like it's scripted

let's how it looks like it's scripted
and<00:02:42.569> written<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.829> works<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.159> me

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
and written and it works for me

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.610 
and written and it works for me
you<00:02:44.909> get<00:02:45.060> better<00:02:45.209> control<00:02:45.510> whenever<00:02:46.349> you're

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
you get better control whenever you're

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.929 
you get better control whenever you're
piping<00:02:46.890> anything<00:02:47.340> where<00:02:47.519> you're<00:02:47.640> changing

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
piping anything where you're changing

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.020 
piping anything where you're changing
angles<00:02:48.480> very<00:02:48.689> abruptly<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.530> cursive<00:02:50.280> or<00:02:50.459> you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
angles very abruptly like cursive or you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.300 
angles very abruptly like cursive or you
know<00:02:51.180> piping<00:02:52.170> words<00:02:52.349> you're<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.159> want

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
know piping words you're going to want

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.610 
know piping words you're going to want
to<00:02:53.430> keep<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:54.180> tip<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.599> close<00:02:54.989> as<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.260> possibly

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
to keep the tip as close as you possibly

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.250 
to keep the tip as close as you possibly
can<00:02:55.970> um<00:02:56.970> because<00:02:57.900> you'll<00:02:58.019> have<00:02:58.109> better

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
can um because you'll have better

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.339 
can um because you'll have better
control<00:02:58.530> over<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.790> icing<00:03:00.180> around<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.019> angles

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
control over the icing around the angles

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.809 
control over the icing around the angles
and<00:03:02.810> yeah<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.379> piping<00:03:05.159> consistency

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819
