Kading<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.810> bit<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.409> that's<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.399> sign

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.550 
Kading a little bit so that's a sign
absorbing<00:01:49.259> follicles<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> I'm<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> upset

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
absorbing follicles so I'm kind of upset

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590 
absorbing follicles so I'm kind of upset
about<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.520> I'll<00:01:53.640> try<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> breed<00:01:54.360> her

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600

about that but I'll try to breed her
again<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.770> she<00:01:55.979> will<00:01:58.790> keep

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
again just to see if she will keep

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:10.500 
again just to see if she will keep
getting<00:02:00.680> bred<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> guess

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.150
