00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello to all guys from italian over 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.910
 power are champions 7 and today mine 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.700
 company there is a special nice friend 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.860
 guys here at pan lux and today it is 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:20.670
 returned queen opera first time me and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:24.359
 gigi for ii and iii ii and we are here for 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 bring you a double nuclear I did up 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.449
 a reid map and no and so modes 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.090
 the multiple team and add us where 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.870
 with me because he was there too 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.100
 match and despite the double nuclear 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.840
 there is also his nuclear power so I have 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.469
 said why not even make a video with 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.930
 he and nothing more we wanted to explain two 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.930
 little things to do nuclear double 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.149
 first of all that advice and I 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 to make multiple teams because we are 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.379
 more likely to put up with 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.140
 best connection to be host e 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.230
 so maybe see enemies first is one 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 show curling bit more and then second 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.350
 what is played in three against 6 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.570
 and therefore you have more enemies to kill in 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 less time therefore also come nuclear 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.770
 fast enough and then for another 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.610
 thing 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.530
 has played in a team of three and find 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 really was if the first one came 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.909
 hoisted triggers a chain reaction 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.130
 which is really beastly and the weapons that 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.810
 dependance tips usually closed 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.240
 to the class most resolutely to do 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.479
 nuclear double what I usually use 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.479
 always 1 n 94 without the silencer 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.500
 because in the end he uses mpi the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.869
 contracted so it's pretty useless 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.520
 silencer then I recommend that is those 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.250
 because without a ghost these are however 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.180
 of course everyone has a weapon for that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.670
 also the strongest type I think well 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.560
 the 7 mp among the machine guns 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.540
 yes yes I tell you the classic used 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.060
 rightly in the video is a mmc with 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.030
 quick charger and handle then 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.650
 precisely to invent a little precision 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.470
 rightly for the peaces that continue 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.330
 to arrive for the machine guns and then 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.680
 if you don't use grips really don't 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.540
 you go out to play with friends mass 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.910
 at least for now 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.780
 and so we are the handle then I used 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.849
 anti-shatter it is impossible to precisely 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.390
 have with inflexible state anymore 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.250
 fast and then anti-splinters in fact not 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.590
 to die with a c4 nando but one 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.450
 they will guarantee that it really falls often 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.330
 to die like this 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.040
 then I used jackal justly for 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.220
 reload c4 which is very useful that 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.620
 advice and then I used dexterity because 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.690
 in fact it allows you to shoot more 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.650
 quickly enemy when in the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.810
 clashes approached and then it is the mode 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.110
 it was one of the best locations for 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.590
 do double- nuclear for it to be so 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.540
 time is practically the enemies do 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.400
 on the workstation so if you can 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.549
 manage the sponsors well i go out to do 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.130
 20 of the keys very easy as you see 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.510
 the last part of the video I will make 20 kg 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.370
 in a minute and ten so I am 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.070
 really managed to manage the spawn 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.320
 great and you will see that I will have had a 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.030
 barrel nice dose of ass because on 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.680
 end of the game I really took 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:33.510
 nuclear is an unstoppable and nothing 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.970
 then I hope he puts it in half 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.930
 our pandu description channels if you want 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.180
 talk about holding a little reconnect 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.660
 to the speech he tells lives before to make a 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.359
 core quite fast and I more than that 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.700
 advise you post against six 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.049
 just a lot more advice 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.370
 multiple teams as in this case 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:04:00.090
 because being in 3d a team there 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.950
 scrub the net a lot less and the opponents 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.720
 the killings and then a good one will come 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.230
 nuclear is also done 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.470
 faster not because the enemies at the end 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.650
 are always six though your team is 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.829
 composed of three players then if you want 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.489
 talk about the duo channel so cases 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:22.950
 February on my channel I bring a little 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.200
 that is, not so many are one plays more 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.190
 percent more but as a champion I think so 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.060
 we give ourselves some time however we are 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.580
 always playing a group here teams 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.680
 multiple to do a bit of nothing though if 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.980
 go and see right now my 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 channel or just loaded a hundred more I believe 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.690
 be active precisely with us especially 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.630
 a pando are passionate more than a hundred 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.640
 more than maybe nuclear than to see the 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.520
 rewards that all ask in my opinion 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.919
 at least for me pan docid satisfies us of 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.300
 more than maybe a nuclear here and there 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.400
 for what maybe in our channels 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.870
 you'll find less a hundred plus note by now 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.270
 and then said this and meanwhile that first one 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.400
 nuclear and where then they have 94 that I have 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.390
 taken from the ground with suicide 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.090
 and with no excuse I used it for splinters 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.320
 Stainless steel is not splinter 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.750
 sorry jackal 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.160
 why should I have changed the game 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.750
 first here is a bit so here is how 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.050
 you find yourself with the classes because if 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.120
 manage to control the weapon well e 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.160
 without steel the advice as I said 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.350
 first it is flexible and anti-splinter 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.409
 jackal and dexterity 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:42.439
 unfortunately I can't find myself well 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:44.719
 with maybe if they shoot you at the weapon 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.909
 it hurts a little to me bothers or 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.319
 we used this tactic that was 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.199
 jackal steel splinter and 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.610
 dexterity which, however, you do not 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.369
 facilitates so much takes rewards 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.619
 so I advise you to have gods 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:59.330
 good team mates because type 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.529
 pantuso inflexible sloppy 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.069
 I EVIDENTLY you 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.689
 below to pick 75 kg more 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.059
 billions even a little the situation of 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.429
 I can still take it from you 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:14.899
 so you see a little nothing raga the video 

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:16.189
 a greeting from champion from pando is finished 

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:18.259
 needle 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:21.079
 and passed our dog if you 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:25.149
 they care about good gameplay and nothing 

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:25.149
 we get the next hello beautiful beautiful
