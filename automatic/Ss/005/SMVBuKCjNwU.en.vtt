style<00:00:17.400> cowl<00:00:17.970> projects<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.750> I'm<00:00:18.840> working<00:00:18.869> on

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
style cowl projects that I'm working on

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.349 
style cowl projects that I'm working on

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
now these are going to be mainly

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.170 
now these are going to be mainly
displays<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.439> they<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.740> wearable<00:00:26.670> for

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
Halloween or masquerade the reason

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.400 
Halloween or masquerade the reason
they're<00:00:31.650> white<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.250> because<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.600> using<00:00:34.079> an

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
they're white is because I'm using an

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.200 
they're white is because I'm using an
experimental<00:00:34.829> material<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.000> just

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
experimental material that I just

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.430 
experimental material that I just
started<00:00:36.390> using<00:00:37.129> its<00:00:38.129> called<00:00:38.370> fuss<00:00:39.149> shape<00:00:39.480> now

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
started using its called fuss shape now

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.340 
started using its called fuss shape now
for<00:00:40.710> those<00:00:40.860> folks<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.399> cosplay<00:00:42.170> circles<00:00:43.170> out

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
for those folks in cosplay circles out

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.450 
for those folks in cosplay circles out
there<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.620> probably<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.309> stuff

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
there you probably know what this stuff

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.720 
there you probably know what this stuff
is<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.510> basically<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.230> thermoplastic

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
is but basically it's a thermoplastic

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.180 
is but basically it's a thermoplastic
material<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.969> once<00:00:48.750> heated<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.590> able<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
material that once heated it's able to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.119 
material that once heated it's able to
be<00:00:50.309> molded<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.879> shaped<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.420> virtually<00:00:51.870> any

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
be molded and shaped into virtually any

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.160 
be molded and shaped into virtually any
configuration<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.550> want<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
configuration you want and actually I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.689 
configuration you want and actually I
we're<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.410> trying<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.430> whether<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
we're just trying this to see whether I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.970 
we're just trying this to see whether I
could<00:00:56.820> make<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> cowl<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.710> looks

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
could make a cowl out of it that looks

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.819 
could make a cowl out of it that looks
decent<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.350> unfortunately<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> material

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
decent but unfortunately the material

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.680 
decent but unfortunately the material
only<00:01:02.039> comes<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> flight<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.180> I'm<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.510> have

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
only comes in flight so I'm gonna have

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
only comes in flight so I'm gonna have
to<00:01:03.719> paint<00:01:04.019> these<00:01:04.260> I'm<00:01:04.979> gonna<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.339> using<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:06.090> high

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to paint these I'm gonna be using a high

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
to paint these I'm gonna be using a high
quality<00:01:07.130> upholstery<00:01:08.130> type<00:01:08.430> paint<00:01:09.710> but<00:01:10.710> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
quality upholstery type paint but this

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.030 
quality upholstery type paint but this
material<00:01:11.900> does<00:01:12.900> pretty<00:01:13.260> well<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:13.680> making<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
material does pretty well at making a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.630 
material does pretty well at making a
column<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.740> heads<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.189> molded

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
column and now the the heads are molded

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
column and now the the heads are molded
the<00:01:17.909> main<00:01:18.090> head<00:01:18.390> parts<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.930> molded<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.500> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the main head parts are molded in this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
the main head parts are molded in this
material<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.310> harden<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> fairly<00:01:21.659> rigid

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
material and harden for a fairly rigid

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.060 
material and harden for a fairly rigid
shape<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.490> neck<00:01:23.700> remains<00:01:24.150> flexible<00:01:25.080> so

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
shape and the neck remains flexible so

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.950 
shape and the neck remains flexible so
they<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.490> worn<00:01:26.700> now

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
they can be worn now

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.319 
they can be worn now
as<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.430> captured<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.090> seam

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
as you can see I have captured the seam

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
as you can see I have captured the seam
lines<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:32.040> simulated<00:01:32.729> they're<00:01:32.850> not

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
lines now they are simulated they're not

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
lines now they are simulated they're not
real<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.200> most<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> 60<00:01:35.369> style
