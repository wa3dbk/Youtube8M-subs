00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.600

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.150
 here 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.810
 well I'm video so that is for 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.820
 practically for air mix hq that then 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.130
 takes place on minecraft and how to upload 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.950
 as fast as I am faster 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.950
 leave good for all 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.980
 teach how to do it 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.980
 we go to control panel 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.310
 I really do not know how to make windows 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:22.740
 we wait so much and we are going to record see 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.420
 and we will put what we think that this 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:33.170
 format is x mx 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 this number to stay I have to put 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.720
 this ram is calculated by indicating a point 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.720
 from 1 024 1024 x on a ramp 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 express 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.240
 once this is done 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.590
 ah 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.440

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.760

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.620
 with this we can make the footage more 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.370
 fast we can remove the lions more 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.370

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.730
