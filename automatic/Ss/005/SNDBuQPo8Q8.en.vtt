00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello 3 lessons from the topic 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.230
 games 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.150
 let 's look at a couple more options 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:18.330
 so you can practice 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:21.170
 1 6 strings and then 2 1 2 3 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.170
 put again 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.300
 each finger recall plays only 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.090
 his country is mostly a great poet 2 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.090
 average nameless 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 see for yourself 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.520
 shine 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 to fix it somehow play 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.850
 let's try a liter over ac4 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.580
 Yes 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:15.130
 and also like the previous one playing in this 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.650
 tempo let's say 4 times without errors you 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:24.010
 can try to add pace by 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.460
 let's say let's try the faster 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.090
 150 m that is, we are under each year click 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.470
 metronome 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.470
 friend 1 amount 100 34 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 try to focus on what you 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.000
 play 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.380
 relaxed brush that is not straining 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.750
 as soon as you feel that you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.970
 will start here brush somehow changes its 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 position 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.470
 give yourself a signal that you are 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.090
 do not quite right again 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.090
 relax your brush and start 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:21.210
 and bust 6 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.210
 try video 2 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.650
 looks like 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.090
 and also 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.430
 then you try to accelerate if 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.340
 feel that at a slow pace you are already 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.370
 let's play for example show how 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.629
 it will sound at a pace of 200 if 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.629
 plays every metronome beat 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.550
 In principle, by analogy, you can not put 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.530
 tempo 200 you can set tempo 100 and 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.900
 play in general the same but not under 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.940
 each click it has one metronome hit two 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.470
 take notes 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.470
 growth and 4 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.849
 and accordingly from here you can already 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:47.950
 put 125 to play under each 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.829
 that is, you already play twice 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.829
 faster 34 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.480
 Well, then I think the idea is clear
