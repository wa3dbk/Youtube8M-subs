 voodoo 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.990
 voodoo j 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.990
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.600
 Yes Well it is this wobbling bonbon 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.470
 It is also a book made to make it shake as its name implies 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.760
 Simply put, high buoyancy and high appeal bombo 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.810
 Originally 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:44.880
 But where easy to be caught like a place I bonbon in a really very Labor 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:48.570
 Toko, such as a full stone pointed whether Hey thin if there is the concrete 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.020
 Well I can not blame the oyster shell itself, but if there are many such things like this 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.070
 The Tteyuu places like pulling out the there, there is also little 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.400
 You can use this This is actually as you saw Mami 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.800
 Since the weight and buoyancy body has become a separate 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.040
 The point is 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.820
 It's Ukikun If you're completely on the ground 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 That will make it avoid more surprises 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.920
 Because the differential is June strong 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.960
 further 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.799
 This is not well known , but it is actually better to attack slower than ordinary bonbons 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.590
 I can do it 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:27.240
 That book also era we'll run out of so much left alone and life view it from sinks 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 But in this case 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.479
 Wobbling unsteadily be stopped not by the buoyancy of the above in this trailer 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.800
 It will move 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.490
 When you want to attack the lever faster than + 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.520
 By all means it this Yurayuragonboï½°also to say when want Nechikkokuyari 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:51.280
 We of summer that I think do I'll try 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.280
 It is iron plate item of Shallow 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.790
 me

00:02:45.569 --> 00:03:25.580
 At that time 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:28.270
