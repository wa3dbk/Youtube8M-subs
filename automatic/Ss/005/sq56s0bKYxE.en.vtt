a<00:00:57.710> poorly<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.070> guess<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.699> that's<00:01:00.449> kind<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
a poorly I guess but that's kind of the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
a poorly I guess but that's kind of the
point<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.090> silly

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
point it's it you know if I'm a silly

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
point it's it you know if I'm a silly
game<00:01:03.570> about<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.049> goat<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.559> tumbles<00:01:05.070> its

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
game about this goat that tumbles its

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.880 
game about this goat that tumbles its
way<00:01:05.430> around<00:01:05.630> it's<00:01:06.630> pretty<00:01:07.439> hard<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> control

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
way around it's pretty hard to control

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
way around it's pretty hard to control
but<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.430> kind<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> point<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.270> then

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
but that's kind of point because then

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.140 
but that's kind of point because then
you<00:01:09.510> crash<00:01:09.780> into<00:01:10.020> things<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:10.860> about

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
you crash into things and it's all about

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.719 
you crash into things and it's all about
making<00:01:12.150> ridiculous<00:01:12.930> amounts<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.439> damage<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
making ridiculous amounts of damage to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.899 
making ridiculous amounts of damage to
score<00:01:15.240> points<00:01:15.860> these<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:17.070> sort<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.369> two

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
score points these are sort of two

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.550 
score points these are sort of two
controls<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.810> three<00:01:18.990> controls<00:01:19.259> you've<00:01:19.380> got

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
controls or three controls you've got

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.850 
controls or three controls you've got
you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.890> jump<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.030> headbutt<00:01:21.479> things

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
you can jump and kind of headbutt things

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
you can jump and kind of headbutt things
and<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.250> stick<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:23.850> tongue<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.930> things

then<00:02:57.330> then<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:59.010> use<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.310> card<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.760> deadly

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
then then we can use the card to deadly

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.070 
then then we can use the card to deadly
effect<00:03:00.590> kibosh<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.240> is<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.900> kind
