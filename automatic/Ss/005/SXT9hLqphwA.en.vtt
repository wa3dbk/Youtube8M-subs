00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.090
 remember to subscribe to my channel and for 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.460
 course one of the basics of the kitchen 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.740
 without any doubt and especially of the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.789
 Hispanic cuisine is the rice I need a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.590
 little onion 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.320
 let's apply onion first thing 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.449
 let's do is use the oil 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 basic cooking canola oil 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.239
 we put the recent onion and each one goes 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.980
 for inside one of the combinations 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.790
 basic also in the kitchen as it is 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.829
 this oil onion and garlic we take it 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.730
 to the rice 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.539
 simple very simple we mix onion and 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.640
 garlic lowers the fire and a cup of rice will 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.280
 we turn around and here come two steps 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.559
 fundamentals the first one has to move 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.260
 the rice temperature 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.629
 mean there are references that are basic 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.310
 to realize that rice is going to 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.470
 need to add the medium 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.840
 liquid begins to change color on 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.929
 rice is becoming opaque and that is the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.369
 now you do not notice that visual change 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:20.560
 simple to lift it let it fall and if in the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.959
 at which the rice falls to the pot 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.409
 it sounds like they're falling 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.499
 little sand 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.899
 It's the perfect time to add in 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.509
 instead of using water that would be for the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.340
 basic way to prepare a rice 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.929
 white what we're going to do is that you 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.959
 let's give a color we will give 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:43.280
 a lot of flavor and for this we are going to use 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:46.189
 cilantro a little garlic basil and garlic 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.899
 that I previously previously toasted 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.299
 we are measuring the amount of liquids 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.459
 we have a cup only one cup of 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.689
 rice so we're going to need two 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.689
 cups of liquid medium 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.270
 let's liquefy this and we're going to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.270
 add 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.140
 and we are going to cover leaving only 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.240
 an edge cited for the steam to come out and 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:23.090
 now what we need to convert 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:25.760
 This green coriander rice 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.330
 a little oil a little bit of 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.330
 Butter 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.860
 we add coriander stems 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.060
 in a bit of chicken breast cut 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.640
 in cubes we only add only 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.010
 a little bit of chopped dried tree chili 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.170
 little touch of salt and black pepper 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.180
 to show how you are going to consign not 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.840
 I know how the rice is being made, this is 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.700
 very easy is it checks the liquids 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.340
 begin to absorb they start to 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.080
 look small, small bubbling 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.360
 in rice we are only 10 minutes away 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.200
 that this rice is ready this rice 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.410
 this rice is already cooked look how good it is 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.410
 of
