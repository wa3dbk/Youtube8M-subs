00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
terminator but you know we were so in

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.300 
terminator but you know we were so in
character<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.590> looked<00:01:44.830> at<00:01:44.950> Brenda's

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
character and I looked at Brenda's

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.730 
character and I looked at Brenda's
little<00:01:45.610> eyes<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.540> he<00:01:46.690> kind<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.200> wilted<00:01:47.560> right

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
little eyes and he kind of wilted right

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.170 
little eyes and he kind of wilted right
in<00:01:47.860> front<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.100> me<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.340> know<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:48.490> really<00:01:48.880> kind<00:01:49.119> of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
in front of me you know I really kind of

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.540 
in front of me you know I really kind of
like<00:01:49.770> intimidated<00:01:50.770> him<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.009> stole<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.400> whole

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
like intimidated him and stole the whole

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.980 
like intimidated him and stole the whole
scene<00:01:51.820> from<00:01:52.000> him<00:01:52.150> yeah<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.420> guess<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.869> would

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
scene from him yeah I guess I would

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.499 
scene from him yeah I guess I would
employ<00:01:53.610> straight<00:01:54.610> kick<00:01:54.880> right<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.270> knee

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
employ straight kick right to the knee

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.420 
employ straight kick right to the knee
cap<00:01:55.750> try<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.590> straighten<00:01:56.920> out<00:01:57.100> his<00:01:57.190> leg

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
cap try to straighten out his leg

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.430 
cap try to straighten out his leg
because<00:01:58.090> maybe<00:01:58.390> if<00:01:58.570> his<00:01:58.690> leg<00:01:58.900> got<00:01:59.110> straight

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
because maybe if his leg got straight

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.870 
because maybe if his leg got straight
like<00:01:59.680> that<00:01:59.710> then<00:02:00.070> he<00:02:00.159> wouldn't<00:02:00.490> be<00:02:00.550> able<00:02:00.610> to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
like that then he wouldn't be able to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.940 
like that then he wouldn't be able to
maybe<00:02:01.570> like<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.960> joint<00:02:02.259> would<00:02:02.500> lock<00:02:02.710> or

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
maybe like the joint would lock or

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.080 
maybe like the joint would lock or
something<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.399> guess<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:03.789> would<00:02:03.850> be<00:02:03.970> your

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
something I guess that would be your

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.719 
something I guess that would be your
vessel<00:02:04.300> what<00:02:05.020> would<00:02:05.110> your<00:02:05.200> strategy<00:02:05.320> be<00:02:05.729> kick

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
vessel what would your strategy be kick

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.190 
vessel what would your strategy be kick
him<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.000> natick<00:02:07.390> his<00:02:07.509> knee<00:02:07.660> oh<00:02:07.690> just<00:02:08.050> kick

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
him in the natick his knee oh just kick

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.810 
him in the natick his knee oh just kick
him<00:02:08.289> in<00:02:08.380> a<00:02:08.470> name<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:09.009> would<00:02:09.369> have<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.610> attack

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
him in a name I would have to attack

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.859 
him in a name I would have to attack
them<00:02:09.970> from<00:02:10.000> behind<00:02:10.119> if<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.539> watch<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869

if you guys had to take on the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.870 
if you guys had to take on the
Terminator<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.950> ring<00:02:21.160> how<00:02:21.670> would<00:02:21.850> you

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
Terminator in the ring how would you

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.790 
Terminator in the ring how would you
what<00:02:22.420> tactic<00:02:22.720> would<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.900> use<00:02:23.050> yet<00:02:23.380> put<00:02:23.680> some

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
what tactic would you use yet put some

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.620 
what tactic would you use yet put some
twin<00:02:23.980> magic<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.430> there<00:02:24.580> yeah<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.450> would

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
twin magic in there yeah and I would

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.720 
twin magic in there yeah and I would
turn<00:02:25.810> myself<00:02:25.959> into<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.470> fembot<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.340> probably

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
turn myself into a fembot and probably

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.430 
turn myself into a fembot and probably
shoot<00:02:28.000> him<00:02:28.120> through<00:02:28.330> my<00:02:28.450> girls<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:29.110> think<00:02:29.320> I'd

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
shoot him through my girls I think I'd

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.170 
shoot him through my girls I think I'd
be<00:02:29.620> amazing<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.459> guess<00:02:30.550> that's<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.880> twin
