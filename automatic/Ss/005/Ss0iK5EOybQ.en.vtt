00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.460
 normally I am convinced every winter that my life has come naturally 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.320
 already a year and a half ago 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.680
 Fred Geersen is a skater and checks the ice thickness in the middle of the Netherlands and goes 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.910
 plasma pee and publish the results on the internet 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.659
 they became in need of it 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:22.609
 highly recommended go after his arrest so no one else who 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.710
 decisions just make people first stop is the leersumse field the coldest 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.909
 place of the region 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.909
 yesterday found that irresponsible 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 first he was as much as seven inches honor 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.090
 that in itself is no big i thick enough actually is like you five people fast 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.159
 back together is skating a bit close together 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.469
 it's not about a full for extreme cracking then you can assume it 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.870
 safe is the pieces i would like to have both states here 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.880
 it was a well-kept secret but the skaters have discovered the lake 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.390
 there are dangers such as this narrow ditch, these are not vulnerable for a while 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.600
 places 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.790
 fortunately it is still fairly quiet 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.110
 so for today it's no problem 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.030
 if you have a few hundred people in succession tomorrow, the others will come 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.710
 I expect that he will be the first place where things will go wrong fred 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 That is why everyone has to be well prepared for going out on the ice 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.580
 what is that around your neck 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.490
 those are the final sprint in that is very handy for if you were in an approach 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.100
 hitting you can then help if you always have it pulled at the death of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.480
 to be in Italy 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.750
 a little comes to the side and I have been together for so long but to the side 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.260
 scrambling that you end up on the thick ice 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.360
 and there is a very different whistle here 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.780
 but skating is not yet possible everywhere but while others stop 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.220
 the henschotermeer 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.070
 look here I almost sat through it 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.250
 I immediately follow that behind Ajax 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.980
 it is that goal under its own roof for the first time 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.590
 but I'm going fast now because me 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.960
 the dangerous but hopefully there will be more skating spots in the coming days 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.700
 to recover 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.730
 and what should you pay attention to 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.790
 always go skating in the places where your other people are capable 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.670
 tip 2 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.690
 never fails in places but the requirements of which are unclear 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.369
 tip 3 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:12.949
 stop on time 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.979
 it will not go through if you get tired and say you want to prove yourself 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.489
 because that often goes wrong later in the afternoon my 8
