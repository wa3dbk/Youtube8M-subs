our we could put rock a cow powder or we
could<00:02:23.490> use<00:02:23.730> hemp<00:02:24.180> seed<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:25.170> omega-3<00:02:25.830> and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
could use hemp seed for omega-3 and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.420 
could use hemp seed for omega-3 and
essential<00:02:27.270> amino<00:02:27.540> acid<00:02:28.200> or<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:29.010> could<00:02:29.220> use

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
essential amino acid or we could use

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.550 
essential amino acid or we could use
maca<00:02:29.820> powder<00:02:30.120> or<00:02:30.420> mix<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.870> whole<00:02:31.020> thing<00:02:31.350> in

maca powder or mix the whole thing in

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.370 
maca powder or mix the whole thing in
and<00:02:31.770> for<00:02:32.430> phytoplankton<00:02:33.240> we<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:34.110> take<00:02:34.350> a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
and for phytoplankton we can take a

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.430 
and for phytoplankton we can take a
dropper<00:02:35.040> full<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.450> oceans<00:02:37.170> alive

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
dropper full of this oceans alive

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.710 
dropper full of this oceans alive
phytoplankton<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.210> squeeze<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.690> like

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
phytoplankton we just squeeze it like

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.560 
phytoplankton we just squeeze it like
that<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.320> we<00:02:40.770> just<00:02:40.800> squeeze<00:02:41.610> inside<00:02:41.940> and

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
that and we just squeeze inside and

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.949 
that and we just squeeze inside and
that's<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:44.370> close<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:44.850> up<00:02:45.150> right<00:02:45.510> levels
