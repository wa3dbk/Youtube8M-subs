00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi girls, let's take advantage of it 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.810
 makeup to make a small 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.590
 Demaking demonstration with water 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.860
 abel micellar is supposed to have to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.900
 be a make-up cleansing lotion 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.240
 so let's try how about 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.810
 make-up remover with this look that carries 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.980
 now that you see that it is a bit exhibited 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.980
 so let's try 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.280
 let's go well I'm not using anything else 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.400
 that hidden substitution of water 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400
 micellar 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 well, it looks like it's taking off 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.100
 to me what I like to make up with 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.380
 oils is that you have half that is 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.270
 making up you like this or with wipes or with 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.880
 any other system because you are going to 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.140
 gear well everything and everything outside and above all 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.000
 for eye makeup is going very well 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.000
 the base which is easiest 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.050
 nothing that I wear in my eyes is 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.310
 waterproof arrives only notice now that yes 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.590
 you want to know if that removes 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.390
 waterproof nothing of what I wear is of 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.800
 made the eyeliner that I normally wear 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.020
 used the make a forever that yes is 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.020
 quite tough and today I wear the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.990
 tomorrow I will get the name in the 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.310
 mercadona that is not especially 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.920
 tough not to say absolutely 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.880
 nothing in fact you can remove it is 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.880
 rubbing with fingers 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.180
 is that he is removing the eyeliner 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.260
 and the mask that is also not resistant 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.260
 to the water or anything special 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.379
 if you see that you press to undo the 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.090
 mask without this I 'm not pulling nor 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.069
 nothing you are simply holding it and the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.310
 cotton on top of the lashes so that 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.049
 I'm letting go of the mask I do not like 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.049
 have to scrub this area too much 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.760
 and what I do hold and open the eye 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.760
 then the force link the eyelid 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.599
 well you see that you have removed 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.760
 pretty good we're going to try to pass 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.280
 another subscription cited by the same side I'm 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.490
 has used three cottons in one half 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.400
 of the face 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.970
 to my taste 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.740
 it's a lot but good 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.220
 is that I do not usually remove makeup 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.220
 this way 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.150
 it seems that this is already clean 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.530
 the eye also has practically not 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.890
 so nothing out 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.600
 you see that you can make up 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.260
 perfectly with the micellar water of 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.870
 abel that the skin is clean and I 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.930
 I notice a tad irritated from so much happening 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.480
 cotton quoted is not that is not so much fault 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.520
 of micellar water itself but the fact of 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.990
 be rubbing one with cited against the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.360
 skin constantly to remove everything 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.700
 so if you are especially sensitive 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.320
 although the micellar lotion is for skins 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.040
 sensitive I do not think it's the best 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.280
 system not the product but the system 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.580
 so 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.160
 the conclusion would be that yes it will remove 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.560
 makeup I have not tried with waterproof 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.720
 but normal makeup every day like this 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.720
 it removes although it is very loaded 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.520
 well, that works 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.800
 although it is not my preferred method for 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.800
 make up 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:34.040
 Well, I will not finish removing makeup 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.600
 ready and as you can see it is already removing 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.220
 everything does not need to teach you 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.330
 all the discs but they are all 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.430
 full of makeup 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.409
 because it has taken everything away from me 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.060
 well now I will remove the remains but 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.860
 what gentlemen wanted is what I eat 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.930
 you can see on this side that he has 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.669
 retired everything although nothing was waterproof 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.639
 but everything I had brought to me has 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.370
 removed so the fact of removing make-up 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.400
 we can say yes the water 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.780
 miclar de avn goes well to remove make-up 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.210
 If you want one day, it's already trying 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.789
 test if it works with waterproof or not 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.350
 holes I 'll leave some comment on this 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:12.750
 video or down or on screen 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.520
 Well nothing up here the little review 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.640
 Demaking demonstration with water 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.640
 micellar
