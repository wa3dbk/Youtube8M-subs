00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
will be a good test because it's a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.630 
will be a good test because it's a
little<00:01:16.590> bit<00:01:16.680> windy<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.040> there's

end of the whites to the to the stage

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.270 
end of the whites to the to the stage
here<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:48.360> unfold<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> handle<00:01:49.229> velcro<00:01:49.860> always

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
here we unfold the handle velcro always

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.149 
here we unfold the handle velcro always
has<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.700> forward<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> firm

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
has to go forward and you get a firm

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.749 
has to go forward and you get a firm
grip<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.640> let's<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:55.159> that's<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.460> too<00:01:56.729> bad

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
grip and let's see that's not too bad

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.730 
grip and let's see that's not too bad
that's<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.570> too<00:01:57.750> bad<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.110> basically

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that's not too bad because basically

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.889 
that's not too bad because basically
it's<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.250> sensitive<00:01:59.640> every<00:02:00.000> time<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.719> mount

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
it's so sensitive every time you mount

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.090 
it's so sensitive every time you mount
the<00:02:00.990> camera<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.439> gonna<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the camera you're gonna have to do a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.359 
the camera you're gonna have to do a
little<00:02:02.399> micro<00:02:02.880> adjustments<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.619> which<00:02:05.130> are

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
little micro adjustments so which are

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.249 
little micro adjustments so which are
right<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:06.180> over<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> also<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
right right over here and also in the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.089 
right right over here and also in the
back<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.220> let's<00:02:08.489> let's<00:02:09.030> check<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.479> out<00:02:10.099> see

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
back so let's let's check this out see

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.559 
back so let's let's check this out see
these<00:02:11.190> arrows<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> want<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> camera<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
Steadicam wind is terrible so with a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.960 
Steadicam wind is terrible so with a
Merlin<00:02:26.050> actually<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.709> any<00:02:26.860> Steadicam<00:02:27.370> you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
Merlin actually with any Steadicam you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.000 
Merlin actually with any Steadicam you
want<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.239> be<00:02:28.330> slightly<00:02:28.540> bottom<00:02:29.020> heavy<00:02:29.170> but

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
want it to be slightly bottom heavy but

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.070 
want it to be slightly bottom heavy but
not<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.400> bottom<00:02:30.700> heavy<00:02:30.880> if<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.810> bottom

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
not to bottom heavy if it's to bottom

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.170 
not to bottom heavy if it's to bottom
heavy<00:02:32.230> as<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.769> move<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:33.700> going<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.910> it's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
heavy as you move it it's going to it's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.570 
heavy as you move it it's going to it's
going<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.390> swing<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.920> don't<00:02:36.280> want<00:02:36.400> you

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
going to swing and you don't want you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.759 
going to swing and you don't want you
don't<00:02:36.640> want<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.910> have<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.090> swing<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:38.530> course

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
don't want to have that swing of course

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.410 
don't want to have that swing of course
if<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:38.950> too<00:02:39.130> top-heavy<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:40.060> won't<00:02:40.239> be<00:02:40.360> able

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
if it's too top-heavy you won't be able

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.780 
if it's too top-heavy you won't be able
to<00:02:40.599> really<00:02:40.840> have<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.500> balanced<00:02:41.890> at<00:02:42.069> all<00:02:42.459> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
to really have it balanced at all I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.860 
to really have it balanced at all I
think<00:02:43.660> we<00:02:43.810> have<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:44.140> pretty<00:02:44.380> close<00:02:45.630> that's<00:02:46.630> not

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
think we have it pretty close that's not

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.809 
think we have it pretty close that's not
bad<00:02:47.080> see<00:02:47.410> as<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:48.280> stuck<00:02:48.549> when<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.730> stopped<00:02:50.819> yeah

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
bad see as I stuck when I stopped yeah

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.750 
bad see as I stuck when I stopped yeah
that's<00:02:52.180> not<00:02:52.269> too<00:02:52.420> bad<00:02:52.450> it's<00:02:52.840> not<00:02:52.870> too<00:02:53.049> bad<00:02:53.760> and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
that's not too bad it's not too bad and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.830 
that's not too bad it's not too bad and
there's<00:02:54.940> also<00:02:55.060> one<00:02:55.209> thing<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.450> can<00:02:55.569> do<00:02:55.660> which

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
there's also one thing you can do which

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.620 
there's also one thing you can do which
is<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.110> which<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.799> drop<00:02:57.069> test<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.700> if<00:02:58.480> you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
is the which is the drop test and if you

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.830 
is the which is the drop test and if you
drop<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.930> from<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.260> horizontal<00:02:59.799> position<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
drop it from a horizontal position it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.490 
drop it from a horizontal position it
should<00:03:02.049> be<00:03:02.080> about<00:03:02.260> one<00:03:02.680> second<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.810> boop<00:03:04.810> boop

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
should be about one second so boop boop

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.289 
should be about one second so boop boop
that's<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.610> think<00:03:06.640> that's<00:03:06.880> pretty<00:03:07.060> close<00:03:07.239> to

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
that's I think that's pretty close to

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.570 
that's I think that's pretty close to
one<00:03:07.569> second<00:03:07.930> use<00:03:08.260> your<00:03:08.410> left<00:03:08.860> hand<00:03:08.950> then<00:03:09.280> very

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
one second use your left hand then very

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.949 
one second use your left hand then very
very<00:03:10.090> gently<00:03:10.360> on<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.750> on<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.530> guide<00:03:12.250> ring<00:03:12.959> you

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
very gently on the on the guide ring you
