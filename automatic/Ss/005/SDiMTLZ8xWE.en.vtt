okay<00:00:00.539> so<00:00:00.599> when<00:00:00.840> I<00:00:00.900> was<00:00:01.020> first<00:00:01.290> introduced<00:00:01.770> to

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
okay so when I was first introduced to

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.800 
okay so when I was first introduced to
the<00:00:01.979> green<00:00:02.159> seeker<00:00:02.520> system<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:03.120> started<00:00:03.570> doing

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
the green seeker system I started doing

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.780 
the green seeker system I started doing
some<00:00:03.990> research<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:05.009> quickly<00:00:05.370> discovered

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
some research and I quickly discovered

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.839 
some research and I quickly discovered
that<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.870> data<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.010> old<00:00:08.220> thumb<00:00:08.580> rules

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
that the data that the old thumb rules

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.060 
that the data that the old thumb rules
of<00:00:09.179> applying<00:00:09.540> nitrogen<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.440> my<00:00:10.559> wheat<00:00:10.769> and

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
of applying nitrogen to my wheat and

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.440 
of applying nitrogen to my wheat and
corn<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:12.360> based<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> series<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:14.450> research

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
corn are based on a series of research

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.480 
corn are based on a series of research
projects<00:00:16.020> done<00:00:16.410> over<00:00:16.680> about<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.859> last<00:00:16.980> 50

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
projects done over about the last 50

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.460 
projects done over about the last 50
years

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
years

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.019 
years
well<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> thumb<00:00:19.800> rule<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.039> an<00:00:20.310> average<00:00:20.760> and

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
well the thumb rule is an average and

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.990 
well the thumb rule is an average and
it's<00:00:21.630> an<00:00:21.750> average<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.380> only<00:00:22.650> right<00:00:23.039> one

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
it's an average that's only right one

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.779 
it's an average that's only right one
out<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.420> three<00:00:24.779> years<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.859> other<00:00:26.039> two<00:00:26.340> years

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
out of three years the other two years

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.240 
out of three years the other two years
it<00:00:26.970> applies<00:00:27.660> either<00:00:28.019> too<00:00:28.289> much<00:00:28.470> nitrogen<00:00:28.890> or

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it applies either too much nitrogen or

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189 
it applies either too much nitrogen or
too<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.699> nitrogen<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.480> both<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.109> those

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
too little nitrogen in both of those

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
too little nitrogen in both of those
cases<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.830> lose<00:00:32.219> money<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.210> either

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
cases I lose money because I either

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240 
cases I lose money because I either
waste<00:00:33.719> money<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.170> fertilizer<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.980> didn't

waste money on fertilizer that I didn't

waste money on fertilizer that I didn't

need or I don't grow enough crops that I

need or I don't grow enough crops that I
could<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.590> grown<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.390> wanted<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.570> write

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
could have grown I wanted to be write

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.350 
could have grown I wanted to be write
more<00:00:40.530> often<00:00:40.739> than<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.489> wrong<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
more often than I was wrong and the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.200 
more often than I was wrong and the
thumb<00:00:42.540> rule<00:00:42.719> systems<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.290> wrong<00:00:43.969> twice<00:00:44.969> as

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
thumb rule systems are wrong twice as

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270 
thumb rule systems are wrong twice as
often<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.719> they're<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.079> has<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.250> a

often as they're right has to be a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
often as they're right has to be a
better<00:00:47.370> system<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> green<00:00:48.180> seeker<00:00:48.570> really

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
better system the green seeker really

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.979 
better system the green seeker really
started<00:00:49.620> addressing<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.690> like<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> tell

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
started addressing that I like to tell

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
started addressing that I like to tell
people<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.800> may<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> hundred

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
people it may not be right a hundred

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.209 
people it may not be right a hundred
percent<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.300> time<00:00:54.649> but<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> system<00:00:56.070> you're

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
percent of time but the system you're

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
percent of time but the system you're
using<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.059> right<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> hundred<00:00:57.660> percent

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
using now is not right a hundred percent

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
using now is not right a hundred percent
of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> time<00:00:58.520> think<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.820> way

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
of the time think of it this way

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.510 
of the time think of it this way
a<00:01:00.270> growing<00:01:00.960> crop<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.739> no<00:01:01.949> different<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.340> any

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
a growing crop is no different than any

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.539 
a growing crop is no different than any
other<00:01:02.730> living<00:01:02.969> organism<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.400> eat

the exact same meal at the exact same

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
time you may lose weight I may gain

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.140 
time you may lose weight I may gain
weight<00:01:11.760> why<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> lower<00:01:14.580> activity

this<00:01:24.869> year<00:01:25.409> your<00:01:26.040> wheat<00:01:26.310> or<00:01:26.520> corn<00:01:26.549> might<00:01:27.420> need

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
this year your wheat or corn might need

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.890 
this year your wheat or corn might need
less<00:01:28.140> food<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:29.009> grow<00:01:29.130> next<00:01:30.000> year<00:01:30.390> may<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
less food to grow next year may be a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
less food to grow next year may be a
perfect<00:01:31.439> year<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:31.890> wants<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.030> be

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
perfect year and it really wants to be

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.859 
perfect year and it really wants to be
fed<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> lot<00:01:34.490> find<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.820> much<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> needs<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
fed a lot find out how much it needs and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.069 
fed a lot find out how much it needs and
and<00:01:37.860> it'll<00:01:38.340> it'll<00:01:38.729> result<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.479> success<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and it'll it'll result in a success the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.080 
and it'll it'll result in a success the
green<00:01:40.290> seeker<00:01:40.590> system<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.100> fits<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.520> so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
green seeker system really fits that so

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.410 
green seeker system really fits that so
the<00:01:42.180> green<00:01:42.360> seeker<00:01:42.750> system<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.560> based

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
the green seeker system is really based

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.590 
the green seeker system is really based
around<00:01:46.040> an<00:01:47.040> apparatus<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.149> there's<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
around an apparatus like this there's a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.090 
around an apparatus like this there's a
handheld<00:01:49.049> version<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:49.979> there's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
handheld version and then there's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.819 
handheld version and then there's
there's<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.759> model<00:01:51.509> which<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:52.500> mounts

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
there's this model which actually mounts

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.069 
there's this model which actually mounts
on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> equipment<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:54.000> true<00:01:54.360> variable<00:01:54.930> rate

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
on the equipment for true variable rate

up and down depending on the height of
the<00:02:22.570> crop<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.380> really<00:02:23.770> what<00:02:23.890> we're<00:02:24.040> looking

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the crop and really what we're looking

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.320 
the crop and really what we're looking
at<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.150> device<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.900> shines<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:27.010> light<00:02:27.970> and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
at is a device that shines a light and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.560 
at is a device that shines a light and
then<00:02:29.230> receives<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.800> light<00:02:29.980> too<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.330> what

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
then receives the light too and what

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.750 
then receives the light too and what
it's<00:02:31.690> trying<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.020> do<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:33.040> growing<00:02:33.310> crop

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
it's trying to do is the growing crop

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.580 
it's trying to do is the growing crop
the<00:02:34.660> greenness<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.680> vegetation<00:02:36.570> absorbs

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
the greenness and the vegetation absorbs

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.490 
the greenness and the vegetation absorbs
certain<00:02:38.590> parts<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> life<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.990> sensor

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
certain parts of the life the sensor

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.880 
certain parts of the life the sensor
then<00:02:41.680> sees<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:43.240> is<00:02:43.480> reflected<00:02:44.230> back<00:02:44.410> at<00:02:44.680> it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
then sees what is reflected back at it

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.880 
then sees what is reflected back at it
and<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:46.390> knows<00:02:46.600> what<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.930> shined<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.530> knows

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
and it knows what it shined it knows

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.250 
and it knows what it shined it knows
what's<00:02:48.100> reflected<00:02:48.340> back<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.360> missing<00:02:49.690> part

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
what's reflected back the missing part

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.400 
what's reflected back the missing part
is<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.130> green<00:02:51.490> vegetation<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.900> absorbed

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
is the green vegetation that absorbed

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.220 
is the green vegetation that absorbed
the<00:02:53.560> light<00:02:54.120> using<00:02:55.120> some<00:02:55.330> algorithms<00:02:55.990> in<00:02:56.140> the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
the light using some algorithms in the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.910 
the light using some algorithms in the
system<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.770> then<00:02:57.130> converts<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.850> into<00:02:58.360> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
system it then converts that into a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.330 
system it then converts that into a
real-time<00:02:59.920> live<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.210> go<00:03:01.390> signal<00:03:02.320> into<00:03:03.220> my

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
real-time live on the go signal into my

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.420 
real-time live on the go signal into my
cab<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:04.330> adjusts<00:03:04.750> my<00:03:04.840> pump<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:05.980> apply

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
cab that adjusts my pump so that I apply

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.060 
cab that adjusts my pump so that I apply
only<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.120> amount<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.510> nitrogen<00:03:08.080> that<00:03:08.230> that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
only the amount of nitrogen that that

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.060 
only the amount of nitrogen that that
crop<00:03:09.400> needs<00:03:09.700> right<00:03:10.540> then<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.350> year<00:03:11.710> and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
crop needs right then that year and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.230 
crop needs right then that year and
that's<00:03:12.160> going<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.430> change<00:03:12.490> from<00:03:12.850> year<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.210> year

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
that's going to change from year to year

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.730 
that's going to change from year to year
and<00:03:13.570> that's<00:03:13.960> where<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> green<00:03:14.350> seekers

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
and that's where the green seekers

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.670 
and that's where the green seekers
system<00:03:15.070> comes<00:03:15.250> into<00:03:15.490> play
