00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.239
 eric's mother tops her doing too much 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.250
 she made a homemade bread the recipe goes 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.349
 being here in the discussion in the kitchen of 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.540
 more than a good year of it actually a 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.530
 mass error then with the homemade is also 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.720
 wonderful 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.430
 she made a loaf of bread with stuffing and no filling 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.769
 I showed or without filling because it was 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 easier to film, right, because it was not 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.060
 a lot of her video making 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.930
 and now it takes a lot of fighting both 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:52.150
 People are wonderful they have no idea 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:54.160
 cooking too well and in the afternoon 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.930

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.930

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.019

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.910

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.260

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.620
 I 'm not a hard fan. 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.750
 not that I stop eating but it 's a 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.370
 thing so I'd rather not eat for 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.560
 not like both apple does not transfer 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.419
 but if you have nothing first as it 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.530

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.530
