00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
it's actually pretty comfortable to wear

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.500 
it's actually pretty comfortable to wear
maybe<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.280> couple<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.640> times<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.000> had<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.240> do<00:02:15.360> this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
maybe a couple of times I had to do this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.860 
maybe a couple of times I had to do this
and<00:02:15.810> pull<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.080> down<00:02:16.250> but<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.430> was<00:02:17.520> about<00:02:17.640> it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.210 

so<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.170> pretty<00:02:25.290> much<00:02:25.530> how<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:26.070> it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
so that's pretty much how you do it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.650 
so that's pretty much how you do it
that's<00:02:26.370> how<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.610> make<00:02:26.880> your<00:02:27.030> training<00:02:27.450> mask

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
