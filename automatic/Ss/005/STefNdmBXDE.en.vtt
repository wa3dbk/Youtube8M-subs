00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.980
 thanks big kiss 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.049
 then I would immediately like to debut the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.639
 nephew riccardo grandson in short 15 years 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.780
 but you are already beautiful 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.790
 the last time it went on the air 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.110
 you only need three and a half years then 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 we can finally hear your voice 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.590
 now you have to tell us like your grandmother 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.230
 liana is a grandmother who all a little 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 they wish they had not just because 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.140
 however it is a grandmother who has grown up 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.060
 things during one's life but it is not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.399
 who followed me with when I was little 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.440
 it made me grow and play then 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.570
 I am very happy to have had it as 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.780
 grandfather because if the only grandson is right 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.950
 is the only one here too 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.629
 We love each other's grandmother from 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 when logically I love it since 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.800
 he was small but he wanted you 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.530
 say just what I've been 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 for him a rather strange grandmother because 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 we did the games I can tell you the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.699
 I told the good witch and he book 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 it was instead the prince of the lake we had 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.719
 of adventures on other planets where 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.880
 we came and we did the circus too 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.860
 line is clear in all this and it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.159
 spoils even a little riccardo is the only one 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.159
 typical love 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.180
 in short, as far as possible, I seek 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.250
 to be a grandmother who is not there 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.380
 nephew, however, you understand that we are three 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.479
 families we have a single logical grandchild 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.670
 that a little bit of spoiled arrive 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.250
 right just right riccardo among the poor 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
 start the holidays, cook the grandmother or 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 no until well hoist that's what 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.909
 what will you eat under christmas 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.409
 tortellini kitchen being of origins 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.280
 Bologna and sweet dish roasts 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.579
 what do you think I no longer know about me 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.920
 he likes so many of his costs for me 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.409
 seems your story 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 but you know ours and sometimes it comes 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.570
 also bad guy so I can say how 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.090
 we all do it depends on poverty 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.680
 little beast from the meat that he succeeds in 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.659
 but buy one thing instead of 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.180
 this year I will do and it is new for 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.640
 all mine is the dish of the circuses 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.270
 south of the eve that a dish 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.200
 made with tommaso made spaghetti 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.440
 control raisins and pine nuts raisins 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.580
 cooked well and logically and then put on 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.200
 a nice shell of cooked puff pastry 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.870
 together practically on one side of the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.970
 pasta is on one side and is truly one 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.310
 what a delight and this is the dish that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.150
 they use to present on the eve e 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.280
 southern circuses 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.140
 so here in the very special thing 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.299
 I am very particular I would say that 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.459
 with this culinary indication 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.810
 we can give the bitter line in the studio 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.150
 who knows what you think of this recipe 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.239
 unpublished I would say no to you of life in 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.799
 directed by telling a very hungry 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.769
 great desire to taste these 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:57.769
 spaghetti with pine nuts and raisins 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:02.329
 mass and tuna and tuna and then put inside 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:05.239
 a healthy puff pastry shell a 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:10.670
