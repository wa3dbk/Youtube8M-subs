strings<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.990> screen<00:01:40.229> adjust<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.680> its

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
strings because the screen adjust on its

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.179 
strings because the screen adjust on its
own

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
own

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.980 
own
yeah<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.640> helpful<00:01:42.030> isn't<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> did<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.869> get

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
a chance to maybe expand the cutting

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.490 
a chance to maybe expand the cutting
spot<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.329> 10<00:01:45.479> inches<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.869> good<00:01:46.049> good

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
spot there are 10 inches is good good

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.899 
spot there are 10 inches is good good
enough<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> 10<00:01:47.250> inches<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.610> good<00:01:47.759> enough

me about the the a and B of the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.730 
me about the the a and B of the
situation<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.270> mean<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.479> got<00:01:57.600> gas<00:01:57.810> powerful

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
situation I mean you got gas powerful

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.889 
situation I mean you got gas powerful
you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.979> always<00:01:59.100> fill<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.460> back<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.899> batteries

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
you can always fill it back up batteries

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.289 
you can always fill it back up batteries
more<00:02:01.590> quiet<00:02:01.950> probably<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.729> mean<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
more quiet probably but I mean is it a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.410 
more quiet probably but I mean is it a
big<00:02:03.479> big<00:02:04.350> shift<00:02:04.729> huge<00:02:05.729> difference<00:02:06.210> because

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
big big shift huge difference because

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.930 
big big shift huge difference because
you're<00:02:07.140> always<00:02:07.320> buying<00:02:07.890> gas<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.459> put<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
you're always buying gas to put in it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.119 
you're always buying gas to put in it
but<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.479> top<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.319> was<00:02:10.440> very<00:02:10.709> hard<00:02:11.039> for

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
but on top of that it was very hard for

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.070 
but on top of that it was very hard for
me<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.430> start<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> gas<00:02:12.510> mine<00:02:12.810> whereas

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
me to start it with a gas mine whereas

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.550 
me to start it with a gas mine whereas
one

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
one

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.580 
one
the<00:02:13.770> battery-operated<00:02:14.420> was<00:02:15.420> very<00:02:15.660> easy<00:02:15.930> okay

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the battery-operated was very easy okay

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.250 
the battery-operated was very easy okay
well<00:02:17.430> let's<00:02:17.580> talk<00:02:17.790> then<00:02:18.030> about<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.600> design<00:02:18.959> of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
well let's talk then about the design of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.020 
well let's talk then about the design of
it<00:02:19.500> because<00:02:19.770> your<00:02:19.920> facts<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.370> figures<00:02:20.580> sort

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it because your facts and figures sort

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.280 
it because your facts and figures sort
of<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.180> person<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> medical

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
of a person is a medical

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.410 
of a person is a medical
transcriptionist<00:02:23.010> tell<00:02:23.940> me<00:02:24.030> about<00:02:24.150> what<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
transcriptionist tell me about what you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.010 
transcriptionist tell me about what you
liked<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.720> maybe<00:02:24.900> didn't<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:26.810> liked<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
liked and maybe didn't like I liked the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.690 
liked and maybe didn't like I liked the
fact<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.500> could<00:02:28.830> trim<00:02:29.250> around<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.550> house

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
fact that I could trim around the house

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.030 
fact that I could trim around the house
do<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.000> edging<00:02:30.709> didn't<00:02:31.709> really<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
do the edging didn't really have a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.949 
do the edging didn't really have a
difficult<00:02:32.670> time<00:02:32.850> adjusting<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.600> at<00:02:33.720> first

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
difficult time adjusting it at first

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.720 
difficult time adjusting it at first
with<00:02:34.200> adjusting<00:02:34.770> from<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> edge<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
with adjusting from the edge to the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.210 
with adjusting from the edge to the
trimmer<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.930> was<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.140> little<00:02:37.350> bit<00:02:37.440> stuff<00:02:37.770> but

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
trimmer it was a little bit stuff but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.309 
trimmer it was a little bit stuff but
after<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.610> did<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.880> few<00:02:39.060> times<00:02:39.300> then<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.840> was

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
after I did it a few times then it was

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.440 
after I did it a few times then it was
really<00:02:40.830> easy<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.340> do<00:02:41.489> okay<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.120> broke<00:02:42.270> in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
really easy to do okay so it broke in

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.990 
really easy to do okay so it broke in
for<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:42.900> bit<00:02:43.110> alright<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.100> then<00:02:44.310> as

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
for you a little bit alright and then as

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.420 
for you a little bit alright and then as
far<00:02:45.270> as<00:02:45.330> just<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.080> way<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.320> felt<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:47.340> know

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
far as just the way it felt you know

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.920 
far as just the way it felt you know
because<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.910> almost<00:02:48.090> like<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.330> golf<00:02:48.480> club<00:02:48.780> you

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
because it's almost like a golf club you

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.270 
because it's almost like a golf club you
want<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.140> buy<00:02:49.290> something<00:02:49.890> that's<00:02:49.980> up<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
want to buy something that's up the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.890 
want to buy something that's up the
right<00:02:50.430> length<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.269> adjustable

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
right length so this is adjustable

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170 
right length so this is adjustable
exactly<00:02:52.560> yeah<00:02:52.950> was<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.220> easy<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.700> adjust<00:02:53.820> to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
exactly yeah was it easy to adjust to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.500 
exactly yeah was it easy to adjust to
your<00:02:54.209> frame<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:55.350> little<00:02:56.190> bit<00:02:56.340> difficult<00:02:57.120> at

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
your frame a little bit difficult at

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.690 
your frame a little bit difficult at
first<00:02:57.540> but<00:02:58.170> once<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.739> were<00:02:59.160> able<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.430> adjust

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
first but once you were able to adjust

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.309 
first but once you were able to adjust
that<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.060> fine<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.630> very<00:03:00.750> lightweight

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
that it was fine and very lightweight

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.610 
that it was fine and very lightweight
yeah<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.940> hallmark<00:03:03.150> right<00:03:03.600> yeah<00:03:04.260> so

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
yeah it's the hallmark right yeah so

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.710 
yeah it's the hallmark right yeah so
let's<00:03:04.980> talk<00:03:05.160> about<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.670> battery<00:03:06.180> itself

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
let's talk about the battery itself

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.960 
let's talk about the battery itself
because<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:08.190> lot<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.489> people<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.940> big

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
because a lot of people it's a big

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.430 
because a lot of people it's a big
mystery<00:03:09.420> when's<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.810> going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.989> go<00:03:10.140> dead<00:03:10.319> how

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
mystery when's it going to go dead how

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
and what about charging did you have to

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.800 
and what about charging did you have to
charge<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.640> up<00:03:26.730> he<00:03:27.030> never<00:03:27.209> had<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.480> charge<00:03:27.690> it

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
charge it up he never had to charge it

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.560 
charge it up he never had to charge it
up<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:28.410> Wow<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.000> use<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.329> how<00:03:30.420> many

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
up really Wow and you use it how many

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.990 
up really Wow and you use it how many
times<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:31.079> twice<00:03:31.260> okay<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:32.579> cool<00:03:32.760> though

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
times just twice okay that's cool though

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.460 
times just twice okay that's cool though
because<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.510> know<00:03:33.570> got<00:03:33.780> around<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.110> yard<00:03:34.320> at

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
because you know got around the yard at

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.690 
because you know got around the yard at
least<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.680> couple<00:03:34.829> times<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.370> then<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.579> can

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
least a couple times and then you can

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.949 
least a couple times and then you can
always<00:03:35.850> Park<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.540> charge<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.930> right

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
always Park it and charge it right

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.100 
always Park it and charge it right
exactly<00:03:37.280> okay<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:39.000> read<00:03:39.570> up<00:03:39.720> on<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.079> a

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
exactly okay and I read up on it a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.319 
exactly okay and I read up on it a
little<00:03:40.320> bit<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.769> it's<00:03:40.980> an<00:03:41.190> hour<00:03:41.430> charge<00:03:41.910> time

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
little bit and it's an hour charge time

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.930 
little bit and it's an hour charge time
and<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.720> takes<00:03:42.989> both<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.950> lithium<00:03:44.280> ion<00:03:44.640> and

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and it takes both the lithium ion and

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.860 
and it takes both the lithium ion and
NiCad<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.170> it's<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.470> kind<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.540> dual<00:03:48.540> purpose

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
NiCad so it's a kind of a dual purpose

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.780 
NiCad so it's a kind of a dual purpose
charger<00:03:49.470> right<00:03:49.650> there<00:03:49.859> all<00:03:50.340> right<00:03:50.400> let's<00:03:50.640> talk

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
charger right there all right let's talk

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.039 
charger right there all right let's talk
about<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.180> quality<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.840> do<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.019> think

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
about the quality of it do you think

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.410 
about the quality of it do you think
having<00:03:52.709> used<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.100> just<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.430> bit<00:03:53.579> now<00:03:53.820> do<00:03:54.359> you

what we do at tool select calm we put

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.710 
what we do at tool select calm we put
tools<00:04:29.590> into<00:04:29.949> real-world<00:04:30.550> circumstances<00:04:31.510> with

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
tools into real-world circumstances with

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.629 
tools into real-world circumstances with
real<00:04:31.930> people<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.350> try<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.560> figure<00:04:32.830> out<00:04:32.979> how

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
real people to try to figure out how

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.040 
real people to try to figure out how
it's<00:04:33.820> going<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.030> behave<00:04:34.150> when<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.660> gets<00:04:34.780> into

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
it's going to behave when it gets into

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.500 
it's going to behave when it gets into
