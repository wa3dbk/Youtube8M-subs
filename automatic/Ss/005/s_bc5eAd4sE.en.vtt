00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 and good kids true new case up 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.290
 500,000 you are going to be able to earn that what 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.259
 I sell for 440,000 real pasta and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.259
 good little thing else we started 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.390
 very good hello kids we are in a 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.970
 new gta 5 video online in the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.190
 version 1.23 to urban also works 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.050
 this trick for next good and good what 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.160
 trick is this because it is the trick of 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.960
 duplicate vehicles only worthless without help 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.940
 the garage is here vale is a new 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.410
 garage and the truth is much easier 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.140
 what do we have to do then I recommend 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.080
 block as you see the environment that in 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.000
 this case the one that I'm going to duplicate with 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.280
 the journÃ©e and it's worth a pegasus vehicle 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.140
 that we asked and good before 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.930
 there are not any people who for example do this 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.940
 trick and good and tells me that it comes out 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.430
 the flicker but when he gets in 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.380
 the garage takes you out there are many cars worth 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.320
 and this is certainly very important that 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.060
 they are as blocked so to speak and 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.170
 if for example you see things does this 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.530
 flashing followed you put and it's worth osaka 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.930
 suddenly I do not know how to try one or two and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.540
 If you get out many times, try another 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.790
 car is worth to me look here the first 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.009
 I had it good I had not got it right 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.840
 There are times that you can get it right or not 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.120
 you can do well and now here in the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.760
 Second, it will be good for me 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.500
 as I say it is not that one hundred comes out 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.060
 a hundred times because the hundred 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.520
 a hundred times I'll make you 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.290
 Realistic does not come out but if you have to 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.480
 leave for example 80 percent 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.360
 because it's a pretty easy trick of 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.460
 to do is relatively simple and with 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.160
 this what you are going to be able to do is win 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.670
 up to 500,000 even a little more 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.350
 because then very easy for the simple 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.090
 fact that you are going to sell the leader 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.610
 then the next the one that you stay the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.830
 duplicate will not be worth anything but this to 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.440
 see is for good this environment forgiveness is 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.720
 to sell it and as I say it 's pretty 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.149
 easy just right when they start 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.490
 to go out flames worth just at that moment 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.290
 do not wait long, you get in quickly 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.390
 or getting out here this time has only 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.070
 given a screenshot and you give him to read that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.100
 it's a little bit, it's a little faster 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.140
 and notice that now it gets me into the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.220
 Garage garage has to have some 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.750
 free space very important and good 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.720
 little thing more the truth you have already 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.250
 seen at the beginning of the video how much it is worth 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 the car or when for how much I have 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.620
 sold for about 400 and a thousand thousand and no 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.909
 it was tuned to the maximum that is something very 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.670
 important because if it gets to be 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.670
 pulled to the max give you even a lot 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.680
 more pasta and little thing more kids 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.420
 Now you see I'm going to put this environment 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.890
 this piece of environment in the new 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.549
 garage new location that to me 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.709
 it looks pretty pretty good and like 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.019
 I think I think it's the best there is 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.390
 for now and nothing kids we hope that 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.160
 you liked the trick and you can not 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.110
 there you are seeing the two cars with a 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.269
 piece of like and sharing what already 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.680
 you know that it helps a lot 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.680
 I welcome you and see you soon
