00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
three years and still find the half

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
three years and still find the half
marathon<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.150> damaging<00:01:09.630> about<00:01:09.990> 50<00:01:10.320> bits<00:01:10.470> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560

marathon to be damaging about 50 bits in
the<00:01:10.680> time<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> marathon<00:01:12.090> has<00:01:12.330> been

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.670 
and I only do two kilometres a day on
average<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.569> got<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.959> build<00:03:43.109> up<00:03:43.290> slowly

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
average so you got to build up slowly

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.920 
average so you got to build up slowly
over<00:03:43.980> time<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:44.430> in<00:03:44.700> another<00:03:44.970> five<00:03:45.299> years<00:03:45.329> time

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
over time so in another five years time

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.800 
over time so in another five years time

been training here 15 20 years just

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.720 
been training here 15 20 years just
banging<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.340> out<00:04:45.490> 25<00:04:46.300> years<00:04:46.330> sometimes<00:04:47.010> so<00:04:48.010> and

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
banging it out 25 years sometimes so and

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.640 
banging it out 25 years sometimes so and
then<00:04:48.850> you<00:04:49.120> have<00:04:49.270> for<00:04:50.050> running<00:04:50.230> that<00:04:50.320> come<00:04:50.470> over

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
then you have for running that come over

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.500 
then you have for running that come over
here<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:50.920> try<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.220> do<00:04:51.370> like<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.790> one<00:04:52.240> month's

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
here and try and do like it one month's

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.790 
here and try and do like it one month's
training<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:53.050> wonder<00:04:53.230> why<00:04:53.320> they<00:04:53.410> get<00:04:53.500> stress

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
training and wonder why they get stress

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.370 
training and wonder why they get stress
fractures<00:04:54.190> in<00:04:54.280> their<00:04:54.430> shins

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
fractures in their shins

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.170 
fractures in their shins
so<00:04:56.380> we<00:04:56.470> got<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.680> understand<00:04:57.100> that<00:04:57.430> you<00:04:57.970> can't

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
so we got to understand that you can't

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.790 
so we got to understand that you can't
just<00:04:58.420> jump<00:04:58.480> in<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:58.930> Sun<00:04:59.110> and<00:04:59.350> be<00:04:59.470> disciplined

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
just jump in the Sun and be disciplined

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.100 
just jump in the Sun and be disciplined
for<00:04:59.980> a<00:05:00.070> couple<00:05:00.280> years<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.700> I<00:05:00.940> think<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.300> own<00:05:01.900> it

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
for a couple years and I think to own it

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.300 
for a couple years and I think to own it
it<00:05:02.200> doesn't<00:05:02.350> work<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.620> way<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:02.830> running

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
it doesn't work that way so running

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.940 
it doesn't work that way so running
takes<00:05:03.520> decades<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:04.240> build<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.840> up<00:05:04.930> decades

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
takes decades to build it up decades

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.490 
takes decades to build it up decades
give<00:05:06.400> yourself<00:05:06.730> 20<00:05:07.210> years<00:05:07.540> so<00:05:08.230> that's<00:05:08.350> why<00:05:08.440> you

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
give yourself 20 years so that's why you

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.350 
give yourself 20 years so that's why you
want<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.680> start<00:05:08.890> today<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.370> build<00:05:09.820> up<00:05:09.910> slowly

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
want to start today I build up slowly

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.290 
want to start today I build up slowly
slowly<00:05:10.750> slowly<00:05:10.870> every<00:05:11.740> year<00:05:11.980> build<00:05:12.880> up<00:05:13.030> slowly
