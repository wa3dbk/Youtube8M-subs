those switches that you pull up and down

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.890 
those switches that you pull up and down
you<00:03:14.550> have<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> turn<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.120> wheel<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.420> five

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
you have to turn the wheel to five

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.350 
you have to turn the wheel to five
o'clock<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:17.220> first<00:03:17.550> switch<00:03:17.880> you'll<00:03:18.120> pull

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
o'clock the first switch you'll pull

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.500 
o'clock the first switch you'll pull
down<00:03:18.569> one<00:03:19.290> as<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.130> we'll<00:03:20.370> pull<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.610> down<00:03:20.790> long

down one as and we'll pull it down long

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.600 
down one as and we'll pull it down long
time<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:22.590> you'll<00:03:22.770> go<00:03:23.010> over<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.370> last

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
time then you'll go over to the last

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.210 
time then you'll go over to the last
switch<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.180> pull<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.510> down<00:03:24.569> all<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:24.989> way<00:03:25.220> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
switch and pull it down all the way the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.180 
switch and pull it down all the way the
fog<00:03:26.400> comes<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.819> go<00:03:26.910> off<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.269> mix<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.569> noise

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
fog comes to go off the mix and noise

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.570 
fog comes to go off the mix and noise
then<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:30.030> by<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.870> way<00:03:31.050> after<00:03:31.830> this<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.310> need

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
then you by the way after this you need

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.120 
then you by the way after this you need
