three holding pins in the first few

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.770 
three holding pins in the first few
rounds<00:01:14.430> we're<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> stick<00:01:15.270> them<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.570> the

the disease testing that is all ready to
go<00:01:49.609> each<00:01:50.609> one<00:01:50.819> of<00:01:50.850> these<00:01:50.969> section<00:01:51.719> has<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> kick

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
go each one of these section has a kick

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.530 
go each one of these section has a kick
out<00:01:52.289> for<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.810 

food<00:01:59.540> and<00:01:59.690> water<00:01:59.840> has<00:02:00.050> been<00:02:00.140> taken<00:02:00.470> care<00:02:00.650> of

food and water has been taken care of

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.060 
food and water has been taken care of
now<00:02:01.820> trapping<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.110> next<00:02:03.380> step<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.800> we've

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
now trapping is the next step and we've

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.000 
now trapping is the next step and we've
got<00:02:04.310> bait<00:02:04.580> out<00:02:04.850> in<00:02:05.210> areas<00:02:05.840> where<00:02:06.110> we're<00:02:06.620> trying

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
got bait out in areas where we're trying

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.430 
got bait out in areas where we're trying
to<00:02:07.100> get<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.390> significant<00:02:08.390> group<00:02:08.510> of<00:02:08.690> L<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.170> start

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
to get a significant group of L to start

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.650 
to get a significant group of L to start
coming<00:02:09.860> feeding<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:10.790> that<00:02:11.000> bait<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:11.510> can

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
coming feeding on that bait so we can

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.930 
coming feeding on that bait so we can
put<00:02:11.810> up<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.990> growl<00:02:12.230> trap<00:02:12.590> get<00:02:13.340> those<00:02:13.520> animals

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
put up a growl trap get those animals

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.760 
put up a growl trap get those animals
trapped<00:02:14.290> will<00:02:15.290> load<00:02:15.440> them<00:02:15.500> into<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
trapped will load them into the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.260 
trapped will load them into the
livestock<00:02:16.130> trailer<00:02:16.460> take<00:02:16.820> them<00:02:16.940> over<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
livestock trailer take them over to the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.060 
livestock trailer take them over to the
holding<00:02:17.510> facility<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.170> then<00:02:18.770> they'll<00:02:18.950> be

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
holding facility and then they'll be
