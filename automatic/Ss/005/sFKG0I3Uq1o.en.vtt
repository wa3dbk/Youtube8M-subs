00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
that's the steak now I'm gonna try the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.359 
that's the steak now I'm gonna try the
chicken<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.440> looks<00:01:34.649> just<00:01:34.830> like<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.099> steak

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
chicken it looks just like the steak

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.020 
chicken it looks just like the steak
let's<00:01:35.880> hope<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.390> doesn't<00:01:36.690> taste<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.170> steak<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.339 

think<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> flavor<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.690> steak<00:01:42.899> Cantina

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
think the flavor of the steak Cantina

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.020 
think the flavor of the steak Cantina
burrito<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.860> better<00:01:44.069> than<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> chicken<00:01:44.640> this

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
burrito is better than the chicken this

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.180 
burrito is better than the chicken this
new<00:01:45.270> Cantina<00:01:45.630> power<00:01:45.899> menu<00:01:46.200> also<00:01:46.740> features<00:01:47.160> a

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
new Cantina power menu also features a

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.520 
new Cantina power menu also features a
few<00:01:47.640> bowls

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
few bowls

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.199 
few bowls
but<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> bowls<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.099> higher<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.490> calories<00:01:50.729> I'm

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
but the bowls are higher in calories I'm

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.059 
but the bowls are higher in calories I'm
guessing<00:01:51.599> that's<00:01:52.349> because<00:01:52.500> maybe<00:01:52.709> they<00:01:52.890> put

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
guessing that's because maybe they put

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.510 
guessing that's because maybe they put
rice<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.670> them<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.720> beans<00:01:55.110> I'm<00:01:55.440> not<00:01:55.590> sure<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.459> I

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
rice in them or beans I'm not sure but I

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.770 
rice in them or beans I'm not sure but I
just<00:01:56.700> wanted<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.000> give<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.390> lowdown<00:01:57.569> on

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
just wanted to give you the lowdown on

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
just wanted to give you the lowdown on
the<00:01:58.080> two<00:01:58.259> lowest<00:01:58.470> calorie<00:01:58.920> items<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.819> you<00:01:59.849> know

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the two lowest calorie items so you know
