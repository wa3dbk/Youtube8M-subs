00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
in this video we're going to be doing a

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.280 
in this video we're going to be doing a
taping<00:00:01.979> application<00:00:02.820> for<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> medial<00:00:03.750> tibial

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
taping application for a medial tibial

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.860 
taping application for a medial tibial
stress<00:00:04.350> syndrome<00:00:04.819> so<00:00:05.819> it's<00:00:06.270> another<00:00:06.420> term<00:00:06.750> for

stress syndrome so it's another term for

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.720 
stress syndrome so it's another term for
shin<00:00:07.230> splints<00:00:07.649> usually<00:00:08.490> when<00:00:08.610> they're

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730

get a variety that's down the inside of
the<00:00:14.370> shin<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:15.450> one's<00:00:15.690> more<00:00:15.929> involving<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the shin this one's more involving the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.070 
the shin this one's more involving the
posterior<00:00:16.980> tib<00:00:17.340> soleus<00:00:17.910> all<00:00:18.150> those<00:00:18.390> inner

follow it's right behind the bone okay
so<00:00:34.370> we're<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.460> use<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.700> tape<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.480> come<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
so we're gonna use a tape to come up the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.950 
so we're gonna use a tape to come up the
inside<00:00:37.590> right<00:00:38.309> along<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.629> there's<00:00:39.840> any

you'll be able to point where it hurts
what<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> put<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> correction<00:00:47.610> strip

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
what we know to put a correction strip

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.110 
what we know to put a correction strip
over<00:00:48.180> okay<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.770> first<00:00:50.100> piece<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.460> thing<00:00:53.120> some

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
over okay so first piece of thing some

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
over okay so first piece of thing some
people<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> come<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.989> under<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> heel

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
people like to come down under the heel

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.520 
people like to come down under the heel
as<00:00:56.340> long<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:56.670> you're<00:00:56.910> below<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.719> ankle<00:00:58.050> that's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
as long as you're below the ankle that's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.910 
as long as you're below the ankle that's
plenty

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
plenty

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.610 
plenty
okay

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.370 

I<00:01:10.030> like<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.180> round<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.510> edges<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.110> doesn't

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
I like to round the edges so it doesn't

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.200 
I like to round the edges so it doesn't
get<00:01:12.440> caught<00:01:12.710> on<00:01:12.920> my<00:01:13.040> socks<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.670> shoes<00:01:13.880> and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
get caught on my socks and shoes and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.750 
get caught on my socks and shoes and
clothes<00:01:14.480> the<00:01:17.110> way<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:18.260> tape<00:01:18.470> works<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:19.610> that

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
clothes the way that tape works is that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.450 
clothes the way that tape works is that
it<00:01:19.910> pulls<00:01:20.180> on<00:01:20.360> itself<00:01:20.720> okay<00:01:21.620> so<00:01:22.220> we're<00:01:22.370> going

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
it pulls on itself okay so we're going

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.030 
it pulls on itself okay so we're going
to<00:01:22.520> work<00:01:22.910> by<00:01:23.180> moving<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:24.170> structures<00:01:24.620> onto<00:01:25.010> a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
to work by moving the structures onto a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.590 
to work by moving the structures onto a
stretch<00:01:25.340> instead<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.820> stretching<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.300> tape

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
stretch instead of stretching the tape

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.270 
stretch instead of stretching the tape
that<00:01:27.350> way<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.560> don't<00:01:27.740> get<00:01:27.860> any<00:01:27.920> skin

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
that way you don't get any skin

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.990 
that way you don't get any skin
irritation<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.030> is<00:01:29.810> more<00:01:30.020> effective<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.760> for

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
irritation and is more effective so for

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.840 
irritation and is more effective so for
this<00:01:32.060> area<00:01:33.190> this<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.490> stretch<00:01:34.700> position

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
this area this is the stretch position

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.100 
this area this is the stretch position
so<00:01:35.390> basically<00:01:35.750> just<00:01:35.870> pulling<00:01:36.350> those<00:01:36.500> toes<00:01:36.800> up

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
so basically just pulling those toes up

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.920 
so basically just pulling those toes up
so<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:39.230> want<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.560> do<00:01:39.710> if<00:01:40.250> that's<00:01:40.520> uncomfortable

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
so we want to do if that's uncomfortable

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.420 
so we want to do if that's uncomfortable
because<00:01:41.930> this<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:42.470> tight<00:01:42.740> just<00:01:43.100> do<00:01:43.280> what

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
because this is so tight just do what

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.820 
because this is so tight just do what

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
you can do okay now trying to force this

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.560 
you can do okay now trying to force this
just<00:01:46.220> for<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.460> sake<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:50.210> go<00:01:50.450> ahead

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
and fold that last one to two inches

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.350 
and fold that last one to two inches

okay and that would be they get medial
tibial<00:03:38.760> stress<00:03:38.989> if<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.170> find<00:03:40.379> that<00:03:40.470> this

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
tibial stress if you find that this

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.890 
tibial stress if you find that this
isn't<00:03:40.860> enough<00:03:41.090> sometimes<00:03:42.090> it's<00:03:42.390> also<00:03:42.540> really

isn't enough sometimes it's also really

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.420 
isn't enough sometimes it's also really
good<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.170> combine<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.860> with<00:03:43.920> one<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.250> the
