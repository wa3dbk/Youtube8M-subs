00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.790
 is the project of the fractions here 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.860
 we have this little plate see you is that 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.950
 they are still talking to me not yet 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.949
 I played to see fractions but they do know 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.330
 let's say when I put here this 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.700
 plate 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.670
 this is one half and from the other truth 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.480
 it's a half and a half 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.029
 for this to work for me 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.160
 as easy as they have been done but for 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.590
 those who have bigger children 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.340
 I can see any size that I here 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.960
 I have explained in quarters also what 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.140
 can do with the white saucers 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.440
 I have a room there, I move it 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 I'm going to disappear a little bit 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.730
 here I have how many rooms there are here 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.059
 and others would be 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.600
 the rooms and that is equal to one half 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:09.250
 well that this project is very didactic 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.470
 for when it's time to understand and learn what 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.360
 what are 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.140
 the fractions on how do I do this 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.470
 trick the dish though simple here 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 I have 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.050
 also for what kind of dishes but not 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.080
 let's use tamos here I have so that 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.230
 more interesting an image of a 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.960
 pizza and then what we do is paste 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.970
 the hurry here and I have one 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.030
 previously stuck 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.920
 hold me the pizza and gwendolyn this 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:48.630
 white we occupy two saucers we occupy 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.610
 a scissors and the image and a pizza for 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.430
 that is more interesting to split the pizza 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.070
 truth we put the two dishes points 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.830
 and with the scissors 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.440
 calculated the center 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.180
 and very carefully see what I do 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.520
 an advantage is that these dishes are 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.860
 easy to cut 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:14.480
 I'm cutting 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.069
 and I have the center how many dishes part 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.310
 at the same time 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.120
 2 now you know, the two of them left me 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.459
 same the trick is in that I put 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.430
 one over the other and see how easy they are to cover 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.150
 how are the same the detail is that the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.150
 dish be equal 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:42.430
 here is to eat pizza and here we can 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.430
 say that someone 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.190
 how much date did someone eat 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.880
 in the middle of the pizza they see that it's 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.920
 sencillito very good and feels 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.730
 comfortable is easy or it is difficult to give 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.920
 return from dic 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.120
 there is something you 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.319
 the trick is the one that is above is the one that 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.319
 moves in this case the yellow if 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.599
 they get plates of different colors 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.480
 It is more striking but if not 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.340
 like a little white dot and a picture of 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.410
 pizza communities that you want 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.630
 do or if we say what they want 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.390
 to teach is just that it is a room that is 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.269
 a half or an eighth you do it in 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.970
 the house and so your videos approve easy 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.910
 with economic didactic material that 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.569
 have here are to learn I would 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.650
 I'm going to ask good if I'm three 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.590
 parts how many rooms there are here and is 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.530
 very well they count three quarters and so we 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.299
 will help to be able to explain with just 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.510
 move and you do exercises 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.459
 nice good girls with him you ask me 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.459
 who feels in a little while finished
