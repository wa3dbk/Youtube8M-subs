00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
have to let Infernape die I mean I

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.530 
have to let Infernape die I mean I
really<00:03:34.550> have<00:03:34.640> nothing<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.120> can<00:03:35.330> take<00:03:35.510> that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
really have nothing that can take that

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.750 
really have nothing that can take that
psychic<00:03:36.050> at<00:03:36.170> this<00:03:36.320> point<00:03:36.590> let<00:03:37.190> alone<00:03:37.400> two<00:03:37.640> of

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
psychic at this point let alone two of

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.250 
psychic at this point let alone two of
them<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.120> go<00:03:38.330> into<00:03:38.450> miss<00:03:38.600> Maggie's<00:03:38.960> hoping

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
them so I go into miss Maggie's hoping

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.840 
them so I go into miss Maggie's hoping
this<00:03:39.380> isn't<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.650> spec<00:03:39.950> Sam<00:03:40.280> because<00:03:40.610> then<00:03:40.760> they

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
this isn't a spec Sam because then they

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.070 
this isn't a spec Sam because then they
would<00:03:40.970> probably<00:03:41.060> be<00:03:41.300> able<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.540> ko<00:03:41.780> me<00:03:41.960> with

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
would probably be able to ko me with

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.440 
would probably be able to ko me with
psychic<00:03:42.500> again<00:03:42.740> so<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.160> blows<00:03:43.490> but<00:03:44.150> she<00:03:44.300> does

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
psychic again so that blows but she does

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.600 
psychic again so that blows but she does
switch<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.020> after<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.980> battle<00:03:46.070> she<00:03:46.340> told<00:03:46.520> me

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
switch and after the battle she told me

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.820 
switch and after the battle she told me
it<00:03:46.670> was<00:03:46.760> scarf<00:03:47.090> Azam<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.780> that's<00:03:48.170> pretty<00:03:48.530> what

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
it was scarf Azam so that's pretty what

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.990 
it was scarf Azam so that's pretty what
that's<00:03:49.040> pretty<00:03:49.220> much<00:03:49.310> why<00:03:49.490> she<00:03:49.700> switched

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
that's pretty much why she switched

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000 
that's pretty much why she switched
there<00:03:50.240> so<00:03:50.840> she<00:03:50.900> goes<00:03:51.320> into<00:03:51.470> Charizard<00:03:51.770> I'm

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010

there so she goes into Charizard I'm
gonna<00:03:52.160> go<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.400> Shadow<00:03:52.640> Ball<00:03:52.910> because<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.240> kind

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
gonna go to Shadow Ball because I kind

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.730 
gonna go to Shadow Ball because I kind
of<00:03:53.480> figure<00:03:53.690> she's<00:03:53.840> gonna<00:03:53.960> dragon<00:03:54.380> dance<00:03:54.560> this

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
of figure she's gonna dragon dance this

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.760 
of figure she's gonna dragon dance this
first<00:03:54.980> turn<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.340> she<00:03:55.460> does<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.590> now<00:03:57.590> let's

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
first turn and she does and now let's

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.170 
first turn and she does and now let's
use<00:03:57.800> red<00:03:57.950> health<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.550> I'm<00:03:58.790> thinking<00:03:59.090> she

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
use red health and I'm thinking she

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.310 
use red health and I'm thinking she
probably<00:03:59.210> gonna<00:03:59.510> use<00:03:59.630> like<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> fire<00:04:00.080> type

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
probably gonna use like the fire type

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.810 
probably gonna use like the fire type
move<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.620> go<00:04:00.770> in<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:00.950> right<00:04:01.070> period<00:04:01.340> but<00:04:01.670> she

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
move I go in the right period but she

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.510 
move I go in the right period but she
actually<00:04:02.000> use<00:04:02.240> roost<00:04:02.600> which<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.410> cool<00:04:03.710> move

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
actually use roost which is a cool move

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.580 
actually use roost which is a cool move
for<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:04.910> dragon<00:04:05.270> as<00:04:05.450> chars<00:04:05.720> when<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.960> suppose<00:04:06.260> but

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
for a dragon as chars when I suppose but

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
really helping us right period because

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.770 
really helping us right period because
right<00:04:10.880> Peters<00:04:11.150> still<00:04:11.270> going<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.510> be<00:04:11.570> able<00:04:11.660> to

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
the earthquake pretty much to get damage

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
the earthquake pretty much to get damage
because<00:04:16.580> he<00:04:16.670> doesn't<00:04:16.820> really<00:04:16.970> have<00:04:17.120> anything

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
because he doesn't really have anything

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.620 
because he doesn't really have anything
that<00:04:17.870> can<00:04:18.140> take<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.320> Stone<00:04:18.590> Edge<00:04:18.739> obviously

Terran what I really really should have

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.890 
Terran what I really really should have
done<00:04:37.490> was<00:04:37.699> earthquake<00:04:38.180> just<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.570> get<00:04:38.720> rid<00:04:38.840> of

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
done was earthquake just to get rid of

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.350 
done was earthquake just to get rid of
this<00:04:39.020> thing<00:04:39.260> but<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.800> just<00:04:40.220> don't<00:04:40.490> I<00:04:40.820> set<00:04:41.180> up<00:04:41.210> the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
this thing but I just don't I set up the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.590 
this thing but I just don't I set up the
leech<00:04:41.570> seed<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:43.760> pretty<00:04:44.090> much<00:04:44.150> do<00:04:44.449> this

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
leech seed and I pretty much do this

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.540 
leech seed and I pretty much do this
because<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.050> kind<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.590> wanted<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.919> like<00:04:46.400> I

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
because I kind of wanted to like I

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.250 
because I kind of wanted to like I
thought<00:04:46.699> she<00:04:46.880> might<00:04:47.030> switch<00:04:47.300> into<00:04:47.630> Alakazam

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
thought she might switch into Alakazam

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.659 
thought she might switch into Alakazam
and<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.620> leech<00:04:48.770> eat<00:04:48.949> a<00:04:48.979> lot<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.430> would<00:04:49.580> be

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
and the leech eat a lot and would be

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.490 
and the leech eat a lot and would be
useful<00:04:50.060> because<00:04:50.210> at<00:04:50.870> this<00:04:51.050> point<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.440> don't

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
useful because at this point I don't

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.590 
useful because at this point I don't
think<00:04:51.740> I'll<00:04:52.010> be<00:04:52.160> able<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.460> quite<00:04:52.790> 180<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.300> the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
think I'll be able to quite 180 of the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.810 
think I'll be able to quite 180 of the
Alakazam<00:04:54.169> with<00:04:54.410> my<00:04:54.590> Luke<00:04:54.800> ours<00:04:55.010> extreme<00:04:55.550> speed
