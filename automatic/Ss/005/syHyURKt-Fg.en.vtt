00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
little bit because I don't think this is

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.830 
little bit because I don't think this is
titanium<00:02:27.829> coated<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.820> think<00:02:29.329> it's<00:02:29.540> just

mind<00:04:03.400> if<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:03.970> has<00:04:04.239> g10<00:04:04.930> handle<00:04:04.959> or

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
mind if this has g10 handle or

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.000 
mind if this has g10 handle or

the inside of my EDC bag because the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.469 
the inside of my EDC bag because the
sheet<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.989> well<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.260> looks<00:04:20.950> good<00:04:21.910> it's<00:04:22.330> a

but it is much too large on the inside
really<00:04:33.370> buy<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:34.210> lot<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.590> much<00:04:36.220> too<00:04:36.820> big

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
you have to a little bit of force to get

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.250 
you have to a little bit of force to get
it<00:04:46.510> out<00:04:48.150> that's<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.330> only<00:04:49.539> thing<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:50.020> is

it out that's the only thing it is

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
pretty secure of course I wouldn't have

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.820

my I wouldn't I wouldn't mind if the

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
rattle was gone and it was you know

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.250 
rattle was gone and it was you know
snugly<00:04:59.979> in<00:05:00.130> there<00:05:00.430> instead<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.120> like<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:01.599> so

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
snugly in there instead of like this so

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.350 
snugly in there instead of like this so
I<00:05:02.320> will<00:05:02.380> not<00:05:02.620> carry<00:05:03.039> this<00:05:03.310> around<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.940> neck<00:05:04.150> as

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
I will not carry this around the neck as

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.870 
I will not carry this around the neck as
it<00:05:04.510> is<00:05:04.630> supposed<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:05.320> be<00:05:05.469> I<00:05:05.860> will<00:05:06.700> just

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
it is supposed to be I will just

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.870 
it is supposed to be I will just
in<00:05:08.150> my<00:05:08.360> bag<00:05:09.550> for<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.580> small<00:05:11.210> fixed<00:05:12.080> blade<00:05:12.820> that<00:05:13.820> I

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
in my bag for a small fixed blade that I

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.250 
in my bag for a small fixed blade that I
might<00:05:14.270> need<00:05:14.540> it<00:05:15.170> is<00:05:15.500> recurve<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:17.210> isn't<00:05:17.840> very

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
might need it is recurve it isn't very

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.890 
might need it is recurve it isn't very
sharp<00:05:18.680> from<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.130> factory<00:05:19.640> this<00:05:19.880> is<00:05:19.970> probably

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
sharp from the factory this is probably

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.960 
sharp from the factory this is probably
440<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.890> steel<00:05:23.770> I'm<00:05:24.770> not<00:05:25.100> really<00:05:25.340> sure<00:05:25.700> I'm<00:05:26.000> just

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
440 a steel I'm not really sure I'm just

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.970 
440 a steel I'm not really sure I'm just
I'm<00:05:28.970> just<00:05:29.270> thinking<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.500> is

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
I'm just thinking that it is

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.410 
I'm just thinking that it is
and<00:05:31.810> yeah<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:33.020> recurve<00:05:33.670> well<00:05:34.670> I<00:05:34.940> don't

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
and yeah the recurve well I don't

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.400 
and yeah the recurve well I don't
necessarily<00:05:35.660> mind<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.860> but<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.490> could<00:05:38.210> have

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
necessarily mind it but I could have

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.590 
necessarily mind it but I could have
gone<00:05:39.410> either<00:05:39.680> way<00:05:39.890> with<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.870> simple<00:05:43.600> light

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
gone either way with a simple light

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.990 
gone either way with a simple light
geometry<00:05:45.460> it's<00:05:46.460> hollow<00:05:46.670> grind<00:05:49.000> reasonably

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
geometry it's hollow grind reasonably

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.770 
geometry it's hollow grind reasonably
thin<00:05:50.270> behind<00:05:50.660> the<00:05:50.900> edge<00:05:51.080> not<00:05:51.620> too<00:05:51.980> thin<00:05:52.370> so<00:05:52.780> it

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
thin behind the edge not too thin so it

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.450 
thin behind the edge not too thin so it
is<00:05:54.080> sharp<00:05:54.590> and<00:05:55.450> I<00:05:56.450> have<00:05:56.930> some<00:05:57.410> very<00:05:58.010> nasty

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
is sharp and I have some very nasty

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.480 
is sharp and I have some very nasty
paper<00:05:58.940> here<00:05:59.360> this<00:06:00.080> really<00:06:00.740> nasty<00:06:00.950> and<00:06:01.310> I<00:06:01.430> don't

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
paper here this really nasty and I don't

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.490 
paper here this really nasty and I don't
think<00:06:01.730> it<00:06:02.030> will<00:06:02.180> cut<00:06:02.420> it<00:06:02.540> cleanly

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:19.240 

yeah<00:06:06.500> struggling<00:06:07.280> quite<00:06:07.820> a<00:06:07.970> bit<00:06:11.770> yeah<00:06:17.890> so<00:06:18.890> it's

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
yeah struggling quite a bit yeah so it's

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.280 
yeah struggling quite a bit yeah so it's
not<00:06:19.940> really<00:06:20.690> sharp<00:06:22.570> it's<00:06:23.570> kind<00:06:23.840> of<00:06:23.960> hard<00:06:24.140> to

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
not really sharp it's kind of hard to

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.370 
not really sharp it's kind of hard to
strap<00:06:25.010> with<00:06:25.280> the<00:06:25.310> recurve<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:26.750> but<00:06:27.200> I'll

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
strap with the recurve and but I'll

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.320 
strap with the recurve and but I'll
definitely<00:06:28.280> try<00:06:29.920> the<00:06:30.920> coating<00:06:31.370> I<00:06:31.550> think<00:06:31.880> does

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
definitely try the coating I think does

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.480 
definitely try the coating I think does
look<00:06:32.570> cool<00:06:32.810> now<00:06:32.840> that<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.620> wear<00:06:33.830> is<00:06:34.070> on<00:06:34.220> there

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
look cool now that the wear is on there

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.780 
look cool now that the wear is on there
even<00:06:35.330> if<00:06:35.450> it's<00:06:35.600> forced<00:06:37.240> for<00:06:38.240> 20<00:06:38.570> bucks<00:06:38.810> an<00:06:39.790> OK

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
even if it's forced for 20 bucks an OK

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.130 
even if it's forced for 20 bucks an OK
knife<00:06:41.060> but<00:06:41.480> nothing<00:06:41.930> more<00:06:42.200> really<00:06:43.300> I<00:06:44.300> wish<00:06:45.050> I

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
knife but nothing more really I wish I

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.530 
knife but nothing more really I wish I
could<00:06:45.320> have<00:06:45.410> handled<00:06:45.800> it<00:06:45.920> before<00:06:46.510> then<00:06:47.510> I

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
could have handled it before then I

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.300 
could have handled it before then I
definitely<00:06:48.020> would<00:06:48.650> not<00:06:48.860> have<00:06:49.100> bought<00:06:49.340> it<00:06:49.580> but

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
definitely would not have bought it but

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.250 
definitely would not have bought it but
sending<00:06:52.310> it<00:06:52.490> back<00:06:52.700> would<00:06:53.090> actually<00:06:53.750> cost<00:06:54.020> me

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
sending it back would actually cost me

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:01.660 
sending it back would actually cost me
more<00:06:54.470> money<00:06:54.680> and<00:06:56.620> I'm<00:06:57.620> just<00:06:57.860> going<00:06:58.040> to<00:06:58.070> keep<00:07:00.670> so

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670
