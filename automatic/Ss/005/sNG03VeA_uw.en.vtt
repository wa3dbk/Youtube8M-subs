00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.639
 here 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.049
 lives 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.049
 Euro 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.489
 the northern tangent 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:19.140
 her industry data and inspired design made her a must-have right from the start 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.999
 Classic among the expectations 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.039
 This start is actually 18 years back 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.760
 since 1991 the tangent in the Saxon Glashütte made 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.680
 which still stands at the nimbus of the legendary East German watchmaker 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.020
 faded into the game during the ddr era was to pick up again 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.950
 I had the idea for the design 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.690
 The Duesseldorf entrepreneur Roland Schwertner founded the company Mohr in 1990 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.740
 Must and still plays 50 thousand copies 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.190
 Of course, the quotes had to be movie 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.000
 take that lead 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.670
 and you should do what you new in Glashütte 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 connect with the pastor 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.100
 and therefore looking in old books and documents what it is in the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 Story of Josef Bücker 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.640
 Of course a lot of Detlef was a pocket watch new complications though 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.240
 gave also from the 30's designs of land 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 Dr 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.960
 was characterized by the time of the Bauhaus 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.900
 without that being consciously produced as this one eagle owl and at that time 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.090
 Songs were rather cheap signs of use for export 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.300
 at that time the first department was unseen by them and they had something like that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.610
 the captured bit of pity they lay as well as son borrow in the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.830
 Books like careless 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.640
 and maybe it was more relaxed, it hid me 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.230
 this reason the idea of ​​this clock 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.180
 but where that is actually nice if you only get it right 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.150
 seems clear 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.050
 since 1845 Germany's center for the production of world-class book 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.690
 but also at ddr times, watches were built here but almost exclusively 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.739
 simple models for the mass market 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.529
 Roland Schwertner was the first one in 1990, he came to the old glory of the town 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.119
 revive 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.400
 When he was with three employees at Fink he had to get his phone line 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:27.209
 Still with a takeaway part the clockworks you bought in the first one 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.699
 Years in Switzerland 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.769
 Today, 80 employees nearly reach the Tangente and their Alfa Mountain 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 completely yourself 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.510
 the heart of the tangent which for 120 euros is to host specialties such as 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.670
 a three quarter board they could stop streaks and sunshine 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:48.539
 prevented 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.329
 but again, form follows function 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.029
 That must be "Alpha Dog is just as straight-lined as the design 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.829
 is based 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.930
 the web handles very well 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.529
 nothing is superfluous not a few parts 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.179
 you would have to be all percent 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.930
 around 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.369
 technically see the problems 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:14.039
 Because the scorer has a work that is very reliable and knows too 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.729
 nothing breaks too fast 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:21.229
 the special editions remove the Hausmaus Graubrot Kreuzschwestern 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.430
 Instruction of the poppy Roth 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.289
 prove that the simple design likes to play during 8 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.989
 So you have to disappear and again about a new purchase 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.679
 thinking about Jule Klaus Schmitz are for leadership attempts, however 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.499
 unnecessarily the artist has already bought 25 tangent models 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.319
 The watch is much more than just a timepiece for him 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.580
 awareness 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.850
 being creative is relatively intellectual 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:58.359
 Let frippery out superfluous omission and, so to speak to the point 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.569
 get 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.229
 without 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:05.329
 or to be inhumane 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.669
 so 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.959
 Here, the head is taken and like a current form of humanism 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.220
 Of course, we must continue to work on this peace and constantly 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.009
 improve that is not the same here 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.810
 but enough the dream I believe remains for this aesthetic that is it will be 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.409
 that 's the advantage of class ca 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.110
 is not about modern 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.780
 Lanci is state of the art 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.780
 the individual models increase 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.059
 This should be passed from a clock at which time is trackless 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.560
 not known
