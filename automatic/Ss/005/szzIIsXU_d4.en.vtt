00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.119
 sfiga torino 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:45.000
 of stations and now as operator bettino 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:49.520
 there is no remedy really thanks that yes 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.520
 sees the topic from teleworking 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.790
 it is a pretty phenomenon 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:59.140
 widespread even if not actually 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.149
 there exists a complete a complex e 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.000
 complete with the legend lamentation 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.090
 as it would be desirable however for the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.340
 truth at least in his own 20 billion 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.530
 source on everyone there was something mania 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:17.050
 and we worked on this 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.240
 labor lawyers for the private sector 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.880
 on plan they decided the contacts with i 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.130
 however, accounts in the republic sector 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.470
 we have a precise point of reference 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.270
 on which we will invite the candidate as much as 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.460
 the canvases of beauty on the phenomenon a 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.520
 resell 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.690
 the league 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.690
 word better 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.170
 alessandra 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.950
 to put at the door of condemnation 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.200
 from English earthquake with everyone 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.200
 which means filters the work goes 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 at home the full-time timed cup 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.030
 partial 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 first of all it is not easy to define the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.270
 work but they are elements that it 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.800
 feature 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.690
 there is the distance between it can happen 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.150
 the company you belong to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.860
 flexibility more than anything else on the way to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.280
 carrying out teleworking e 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.500
 the interconnection and moreover the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.510
 telework categories 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.630
 we are talking about off line and online e 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.780
 tends one way line offline and stands for 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.480
 means that the worker transmits 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.000
 the data of the company to which it belongs e 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.660
 subsequently they are processed by the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.620
 online company means that there is 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.799
 a love contribution we can say 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.299
 an osmotic relationship between the company and the 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.140
 teleworkers there is an immediate exchange 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.000
 and direct when those lines he has 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.870
 from a relationship as one could be a 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.850
 that is, that within values ​​become 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.459
 elaborate that is what completes a 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.780
 programming and then subsequently one 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.880
 part of him handle more check 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.300
 looks and then the company 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.069
 regenerable said this we must say 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.330
 that the telework of the water on the way 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.760
 experimental this canelli to our 60s 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.200
 in the united states already then an expert 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.540
 of the jack nice sector 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.840
 thought well of good to the courts for 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.120
 put it commuting ie to say that second 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.650
 his theory was much better exposed 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.850
 prohibited think that people 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.680
 made this promise 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.470
 we have to request telework 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.510
 went through various stages about five 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.130
 phases throughout its evolution 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.830
 the first phase on that was that 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.890
 of enthusiasm that is to say they were all 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.860
 however, the story is still yellow 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.860
 in fact if in the personal computer lines 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.650
 the internet connection though 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.570
 at dinner and a part in moto2 our part 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.890
 a part that impotence but telework 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.330
 why the prof 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.070
 what I could see badly another 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.930
 part we lose, let's just say 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.630
 this is the reason still to understand 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.060
 what was really the part to speak 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.980
 positive of the terror but the part not 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.590
 do what equalized he thought well 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.810
 we make passes both to the river 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.970
 therefore deserves for health and also 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.340
 particular acors to stir me impact 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.520
 say increased sees conditional 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.560
 that someone citizen and to avoid the 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.170
 bondage to take the fun 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.730
 enteral subjected to commuting 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.380
 I continue the first real one 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.650
 need arose 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.970
 let's say in conjunction with the case 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.060
 of the commission to what in 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.570
 concurrent with the first shock 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.770
 oil company since 1973 cia both warn 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.610
 the need and the need to implement the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:54.520
 but later there was 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:57.129
 let's say a note though even if the 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.409
 phenomenon was much debated because it opens 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:02.319
 a parenthesis there was thought well that 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:05.020
 among them perhaps given only to women with 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.759
 one to be able to say a facilitation 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.069
 make a statement between the activity 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.780
 motor work activity word 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.729
 solution so we exploit drawn 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.210
 you had to be very careful 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.919
 isolation and marginalization 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.650
 for this reason, how much work do you do 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.289
 unleashed in terms of setbacks and 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:27.400
 unions and also in adopting with 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.770
 however they receive on much debated cadmium 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.419
 which if later proved useful 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:37.449
 this is the working approach 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.620
 areas mostly are 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:45.870
 all and the professions are finished 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:53.889
 workable so much so that initially 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:57.249
 report and we awaken it on exclusion 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.559
 entirely reading delays 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:03.669
 for which they are needed in the framework agreement of 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:05.559
 a 2004 sail shifted to all of us 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.529
 I hope that also recently there 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:11.799
 others are definitely new polo 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.889
 attempted sepulcher of the law of 

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:18.729
 stability itself was just not private 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:22.179
 other than the law 183 of 12 November 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:26.559
 of 2011 and we support light wool 

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:28.719
 from the framework agreement of the 70 a raise 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:29.409
 percent of the pain also launch because 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.839
 it is understood 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:35.110
 speaking in the last phase after the boom 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:37.479
 which according to me 99 that pronounces it 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.209
 let's try added the new million 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:44.110
 tele laboratory or two thirds 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:45.909
 stable in a stable form and a third that 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.709
 did not accustom us right inside did 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.559
 occasional and 16 million even 

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:51.759
 reflection the united states became aware 

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:54.219
 that terror is not like it used to be 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:57.339
 when you thought that theme in the como 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:59.169
 office small office but a maitre 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:00.560
 work thanks personal computer 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.320
 portable 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.960
 at home an audio tour waiting long 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.030
 from the seizure of a car you can see 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.250
 this internet cafe can be played 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.410
 even the lung are dealing in 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.930
 any place is no longer the home 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.210
 object hides the location outside 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.850
 company also another lucky year 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:24.370
 we have an interconfederal agreement if 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.370
 all is well that can pass 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.630
 thank you 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:48.509
 the commission punished the world of 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.509
 voters 110
