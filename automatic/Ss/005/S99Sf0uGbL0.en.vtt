going to go from five microns which is
this<00:00:23.939> whisk<00:00:24.210> right<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> three

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
this whisk right here we're the three

micron down to one micron which
incidentally<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:30.199> about<00:00:31.199> 12,000<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> water

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
incidentally is about 12,000 on a water

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.720

stone<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:34.110> started<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:35.040> what<00:00:35.579> we'll

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
stone so to get started here what we'll

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.440 
stone so to get started here what we'll
do<00:00:37.579> 5<00:00:38.579> micron<00:00:39.530> disk<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:41.300> live<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
do 5 micron disk on there live it a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.110 
do 5 micron disk on there live it a
little<00:00:42.600> bit<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.370> lubricant<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.760> soap<00:00:44.969> and

the machine do the work thank you what

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570 
the machine do the work thank you what
you<00:01:12.630> want<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.080> even<00:01:13.350> scratch<00:01:13.619> pattern<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you want is an even scratch pattern and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.969 
you want is an even scratch pattern and
you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:18.560> it's<00:01:19.560> getting<00:01:19.740> very

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you can see is that it's getting very

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.570 
you can see is that it's getting very
close<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:22.220> what<00:01:23.220> we'll<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:25.430> remove<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
close now what we'll do you remove the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.660 
close now what we'll do you remove the
five<00:01:26.790> micron<00:01:27.330> disk<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.799> down<00:01:28.979> through

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
five micron disk will go down through

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.370 
five micron disk will go down through
the<00:01:29.790> three<00:01:30.030> Mike<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.759> i<00:01:35.850> don't<00:01:36.060> use<00:01:36.240> any

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
the three Mike on and i don't use any

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:59.120 
the three Mike on and i don't use any
lubricant<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:13.830 

and<00:02:00.130> then<00:02:00.250> down<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.789> any<00:02:00.939> one<00:02:00.970> micron<00:02:12.840> just

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
and then down to any one micron just

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.800 
and then down to any one micron just
apply<00:02:14.290> light<00:02:14.530> pressure<00:02:21.269> yeah<00:02:22.269> this<00:02:22.540> plane

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
apply light pressure yeah this plane

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.500 
apply light pressure yeah this plane
iron<00:02:23.110> sharpened<00:02:23.620> down<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.280> near<00:02:25.060> finish

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
iron sharpened down to a near finish

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.440 
iron sharpened down to a near finish
near<00:02:25.900> mirror<00:02:26.110> finish<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:27.430> see<00:02:27.579> myself<00:02:27.900> too

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
near mirror finish I can see myself too

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.020 
near mirror finish I can see myself too
now<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.630> go<00:02:31.810> ahead<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.049> do<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.319> bevel

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
now you can go ahead and do the bevel

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.860 
now you can go ahead and do the bevel
