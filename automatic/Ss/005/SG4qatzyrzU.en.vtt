e-wrap fashion all the way around each

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.760 
e-wrap fashion all the way around each
peg<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.400> we've<00:01:29.549> got<00:01:29.700> four<00:01:30.060> we're<00:01:30.840> gonna<00:01:30.930> lift

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
peg so we've got four we're gonna lift

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.830 
peg so we've got four we're gonna lift
the<00:01:32.009> bottom<00:01:32.220> loops<00:01:32.549> over<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> top<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.540> knit

the bottom loops over the top to knit

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.649 
the bottom loops over the top to knit
over<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> now<00:01:35.369> we've<00:01:35.520> got<00:01:35.670> our<00:01:35.790> first<00:01:36.119> row<00:01:36.390> in

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
over and now we've got our first row in

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.899 
over and now we've got our first row in
ear<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.110> we're<00:01:37.740> gonna<00:01:37.829> work<00:01:38.159> our<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
ear up we're gonna work our way to the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
ear up we're gonna work our way to the
left<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:40.409> purl<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.500> right-handed<00:01:44.040> users

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
left in a purl so for right-handed users

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.249 
left in a purl so for right-handed users
it's<00:01:44.909> easier<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.540> work<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.049> direction

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
it's easier to work in this direction

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
it's easier to work in this direction
and<00:01:47.780> left<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.140> go<00:01:49.380> opposite<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.549> are

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and left just go opposite so we are

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.120 
and left just go opposite so we are
putting<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> working<00:01:55.079> strand<00:01:55.380> underneath

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
putting the working strand underneath

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.109 
putting the working strand underneath
our<00:01:56.369> loop<00:01:57.439> pull<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.740> loop<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.340> from<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
our loop pull that loop up from the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
our loop pull that loop up from the
bottom<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.659> you're<00:02:00.869> purling<00:02:01.350> from<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
bottom like you're purling from the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.209 
bottom like you're purling from the
ocean<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.930> lift<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.079> old<00:02:04.229> loop<00:02:04.530> off<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.070> put

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
ocean and lift the old loop off and put

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.999 
ocean and lift the old loop off and put
the<00:02:05.340> new<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.619> videos<00:02:07.979> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the new one on and I do have videos to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.119 
the new one on and I do have videos to
show<00:02:08.429> these<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.940> slower<00:02:09.179> motion<00:02:09.950> okay<00:02:10.950> now

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
show these in a slower motion okay now

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.230 
show these in a slower motion okay now
we<00:02:11.190> are<00:02:11.370> on

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
we are on

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.500 
we are on
our<00:02:12.300> next<00:02:12.750> row<00:02:13.130> we're<00:02:14.130> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.550> wrap<00:02:15.480> around

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
our next row we're going to wrap around

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.040 
our next row we're going to wrap around
twice<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:17.070> an<00:02:17.220> e-wrap<00:02:17.550> fashion<00:02:18.090> every<00:02:18.570> single

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
twice in an e-wrap fashion every single

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.690 
twice in an e-wrap fashion every single
peg<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.920> all<00:02:20.490> four<00:02:21.480> pegs<00:02:21.900> will<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.010> ear

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
peg so all four pegs will get to ear

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.400 
peg so all four pegs will get to ear
apps<00:02:24.000> around<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.720> you're<00:02:24.870> going<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.050> have

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
apps around so you're going to have

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
apps around so you're going to have
three<00:02:25.860> raps<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.580> each<00:02:27.120> peg<00:02:28.010> now<00:02:29.010> we're<00:02:29.250> going

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
three raps on each peg now we're going

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.630 
three raps on each peg now we're going
to<00:02:29.670> lift<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.360> bottom<00:02:30.750> loop<00:02:30.960> over<00:02:30.990> both<00:02:31.950> top

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
to lift the bottom loop over both top

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.930 
to lift the bottom loop over both top
loops<00:02:33.950> go<00:02:34.950> ahead<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.310> do<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.580> all<00:02:35.910> four

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
loops go ahead and do that on all four

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.220 
loops go ahead and do that on all four
pegs<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:37.980> connect<00:02:38.310> extra<00:02:39.230> zippy

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
pegs and you can connect extra zippy

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.280 
pegs and you can connect extra zippy
looms<00:02:40.470> or<00:02:40.800> use<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.490> another<00:02:41.730> loom<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.420> do

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
looms or use this on another loom and do

now when you pull this on down it's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.950 
now when you pull this on down it's
going<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.510> create<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:00.950> elongated<00:03:01.950> stitch

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
going to create that elongated stitch

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.260 
going to create that elongated stitch
now<00:03:03.960> we're<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.350> gonna<00:03:04.560> simply<00:03:04.830> go<00:03:05.700> back<00:03:05.910> and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
now we're just gonna simply go back and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.390 
now we're just gonna simply go back and
do<00:03:06.570> another<00:03:06.600> purl<00:03:07.260> row<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.220> gonna

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
do another purl row and this is gonna

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.480 
do another purl row and this is gonna
lock<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.120> extra<00:03:09.660> long<00:03:09.900> loop<00:03:11.300> now<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:13.080> can

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
lock in that extra long loop now you can

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.810 
lock in that extra long loop now you can
push<00:03:14.490> your<00:03:14.670> loops<00:03:14.910> up<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:16.070> pull<00:03:17.070> them<00:03:17.100> off<00:03:17.430> by

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
push your loops up and pull them off by

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.540 
push your loops up and pull them off by
using<00:03:18.300> your<00:03:18.510> fingers<00:03:18.990> or<00:03:19.380> using<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.890> tool<00:03:20.130> I

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
using your fingers or using the tool I

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.520 
using your fingers or using the tool I
was<00:03:21.510> showing<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.080> tool<00:03:22.260> but

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
was showing it with the tool but

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.880 
was showing it with the tool but
honestly<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.970> easier<00:03:24.330> with<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.660> purl<00:03:24.890> with

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
honestly it's easier with the purl with

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.380 
honestly it's easier with the purl with
your<00:03:26.040> hands<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.850> particular<00:03:27.300> one<00:03:27.750> so

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
your hands on this particular one so

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.050 
your hands on this particular one so
just<00:03:31.820> lift<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:33.260> bottom<00:03:34.260> loop<00:03:34.440> off<00:03:34.970> put<00:03:35.970> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
just lift that bottom loop off put the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.360 
just lift that bottom loop off put the
new<00:03:36.090> one<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:37.080> then<00:03:37.770> kind<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.010> pull<00:03:38.220> your

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
new one on and then kind of pull your

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.250 
new one on and then kind of pull your
tension<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.820> little<00:03:38.940> bit<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.930> don't<00:03:40.080> want<00:03:40.200> it

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
tension a little bit you don't want it

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.700 
tension a little bit you don't want it
too<00:03:40.440> tight<00:03:40.710> but<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.760> very<00:03:41.970> first<00:03:42.390> stitch

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
too tight but that very first stitch

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.790 
too tight but that very first stitch
make<00:03:43.710> sure<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.280> keep<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.210> nice<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.810> loose<00:03:46.380> so

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
make sure and keep it nice and loose so

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.850 
make sure and keep it nice and loose so
that<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.430> everything's<00:03:47.850> even<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:51.860> then

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
that you everything's even and then

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.080 
that you everything's even and then
you're<00:03:53.010> just<00:03:53.130> going<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.370> repeat<00:03:53.550> this<00:03:53.970> process

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
you're just going to repeat this process

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.500 
you're just going to repeat this process
with<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.430> double<00:03:56.430> e<00:03:56.640> wraps<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.390> way

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
with the double e wraps all the way

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.660 
with the double e wraps all the way
across<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.260> now<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.190> you've<00:03:59.370> got<00:03:59.550> that

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
across so now that you've got that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.600 
across so now that you've got that
locked<00:03:59.940> into<00:04:00.180> position<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.950> keep

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
locked into position you just keep

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.250 
locked into position you just keep
repeating<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:03.150> over<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.570> over<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.140> we're

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
repeating that over and over so we're

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.100 
repeating that over and over so we're
going<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.530> doubly<00:04:05.370> wrap<00:04:05.610> pegs<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.900> through

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
going to doubly wrap pegs one through

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.940 
going to doubly wrap pegs one through
four

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.050 

and<00:04:13.950> then<00:04:14.280> you're<00:04:14.400> gonna<00:04:14.490> lift<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.910> bottom

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
and then you're gonna lift the bottom

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.290 
and then you're gonna lift the bottom
loop<00:04:15.360> over<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.660> top<00:04:16.610> that<00:04:17.610> locks<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:22.010> and

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
loop over the top that locks that in and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:32.110 
loop over the top that locks that in and
lifts<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.390> very<00:04:24.600> top<00:04:24.900> loop<00:04:25.200> right<00:04:25.770> off

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.000
