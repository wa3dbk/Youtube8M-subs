00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.390 
place you can get to it is where it
comes<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.500> through<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> belly<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:40.400> so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
comes in through the belly here and so

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.440 
comes in through the belly here and so
if<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.729> come<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> comes

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
if I come in right in here so it comes

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.899 
if I come in right in here so it comes
across<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:46.140> across<00:01:46.340> here<00:01:47.340> pretty<00:01:47.520> much<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
across here across here pretty much and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.520 
across here across here pretty much and
then<00:01:48.149> from<00:01:48.450> about<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> starts<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> head

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
then from about here it starts a head

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.100 
then from about here it starts a head
over<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.180> right<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.659> or

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
over so I'm going to go right here or

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
over so I'm going to go right here or
took<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> most<00:01:52.619> shallow<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.310> maybe<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
took the most shallow I can maybe get it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.179 
took the most shallow I can maybe get it
and<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:54.990> sure<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.040> lift

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and I'm not sure I have it but and lift

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.069 
and I'm not sure I have it but and lift
that<00:01:56.250> foot<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:56.909> bit<00:01:57.329> no<00:01:58.049> that's

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that foot just a little bit no that's

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.749 
that foot just a little bit no that's
not<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> felt<00:01:59.040> where<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.430> where<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
not it but I felt where it was where it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.240 
not it but I felt where it was where it
is<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> little<00:02:00.600> more<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.920> little

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
is which is a little more in a little

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
is which is a little more in a little
more<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> side<00:02:02.850> okay<00:02:03.630> lift<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.990> leg

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
more to the side okay lift that leg

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.109 
more to the side okay lift that leg
again<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.649> bit<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.880> he

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
again a little bit there it is and he

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.950 
again a little bit there it is and he
can<00:02:06.149> feel<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.600> too

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
can feel it too

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080 
can feel it too
so<00:02:07.439> when<00:02:07.649> he<00:02:07.770> does<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.190> definitely<00:02:08.849> feel

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
so when he does that I definitely feel

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
so when he does that I definitely feel
it<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.420> then<00:02:09.959> what<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.009> hold

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it and then what you can do is hold

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.550 
it and then what you can do is hold
there<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.849> if<00:02:12.360> they<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.660> tolerate<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.319> go<00:02:13.530> a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
there and if they can tolerate it go a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.940 
there and if they can tolerate it go a
little

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
little

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.770 
little
deeper<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.819> go<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.300> go<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.599> deeper

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
deeper I can go and go a little deeper

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.400 
deeper I can go and go a little deeper
right<00:02:17.000> there<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.810> if<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.200> can

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
right there and and if you if you can

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.320 
right there and and if you if you can
tell<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.099> usually<00:02:20.220> tell<00:02:20.580> where<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:20.879> stop

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
tell you can usually tell where to stop

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.479 
tell you can usually tell where to stop
and<00:02:21.629> you'll<00:02:22.140> feel<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.560> tight<00:02:22.830> muscle<00:02:23.310> and

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
and you'll feel that tight muscle and

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.059 
and you'll feel that tight muscle and
it'll<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.599> be<00:02:24.780> there<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.349> let<00:02:25.590> them<00:02:25.800> relax

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
it'll just be there and let them relax

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.540 
it'll just be there and let them relax
into<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.540> takes<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:28.170> minute<00:02:28.950> or<00:02:29.310> two

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
into it and it takes a minute or two

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.120 
into it and it takes a minute or two
sometimes<00:02:30.209> as<00:02:30.390> many<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.750> three<00:02:31.140> usually<00:02:32.010> not

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
sometimes as many as three usually not

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.949 
sometimes as many as three usually not
more<00:02:32.400> not<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.640> much<00:02:33.090> usually<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.569> minute<00:02:33.840> or

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
more not that much usually a minute or

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.309 
more not that much usually a minute or
two<00:02:34.310> for<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.340> muscle<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.849> release<00:02:36.319> there

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
two for that muscle to release there

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.290 
two for that muscle to release there
goes<00:02:37.470> one<00:02:37.620> release<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.430> actually<00:02:38.670> feel

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
goes one release you can actually feel

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.199 
goes one release you can actually feel
the<00:02:40.260> tension<00:02:40.739> let<00:02:41.280> go<00:02:43.549> there<00:02:44.549> goes<00:02:44.730> some<00:02:44.970> more

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the tension let go there goes some more

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.820 
the tension let go there goes some more
okay<00:02:45.810> I'm<00:02:45.900> not<00:02:46.049> going<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.290> do<00:02:46.349> any<00:02:46.530> more<00:02:46.650> but

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
okay I'm not going to do any more but

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.559 
okay I'm not going to do any more but
that's<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> idea<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:47.790> hold<00:02:48.330> that

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
that's the idea you just hold that

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.720 
that's the idea you just hold that
pressure<00:02:48.930> until<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.410> releases<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.069> then<00:02:50.489> and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
pressure until it releases and then and

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.569 
pressure until it releases and then and
then<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.690> move<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.459> be

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
then you can move in and you have to be

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.069 
then you can move in and you have to be
really<00:02:53.790> careful<00:02:53.940> not<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.360> overdo<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.780> most

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
really careful not to overdo it most

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.720 
really careful not to overdo it most
people<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.500> only<00:02:55.590> tolerate<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.130> very<00:02:56.430> little

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
