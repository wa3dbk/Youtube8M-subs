it<00:01:12.470> feels<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.770> lot<00:01:12.890> like<00:01:13.190> my<00:01:13.430> drift<00:01:13.790> car<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.390> I'm

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
it feels a lot like my drift car and I'm

it feels a lot like my drift car and I'm
kind<00:01:15.080> of<00:01:15.110> practicing<00:01:15.649> some<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.130> drift

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429

techniques<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:16.940> I<00:01:17.000> would<00:01:17.179> use<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.570> my

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
techniques that I would use in my

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.830 
techniques that I would use in my
competition<00:01:18.350> car<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.979> I<00:01:19.100> got<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.340> say<00:01:19.520> it's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
competition car and I got to say it's

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.600 
competition car and I got to say it's
pretty<00:01:20.840> mind-boggling<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.649> me<00:01:21.830> how<00:01:22.070> realistic

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
pretty mind-boggling to me how realistic

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.999 
pretty mind-boggling to me how realistic
it<00:01:22.910> is<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:24.320> don't<00:01:24.350> have<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.679> pay<00:01:24.800> for<00:01:24.830> the

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
it is and I don't have to pay for the

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.780 
it is and I don't have to pay for the
dance<00:01:25.190> either

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.640 

that's<00:01:28.480> called<00:01:28.690> getting<00:01:28.990> too<00:01:29.170> close<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
that's called getting too close to the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
that's called getting too close to the
wall

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.940 

I<00:01:33.729> think<00:01:34.659> I<00:01:34.720> want<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:34.960> change<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.380> setup<00:01:35.740> of

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
I think I want to change the setup of

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.149 
I think I want to change the setup of
this<00:01:36.100> car<00:01:36.369> maybe<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.729> match<00:01:37.200> my<00:01:38.200> competition

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
this car maybe to match my competition

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.410 
this car maybe to match my competition
car<00:01:39.310> because<00:01:39.490> I've<00:01:39.580> learned<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.880> lot<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.210> three

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.060 
years of drifting the 350z and what it's
good<00:01:43.390> at<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:43.810> what<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.140> needs<00:01:44.380> in<00:01:44.560> order<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.920> be

car<00:02:00.130> around<00:02:00.220> shut<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.210> off<00:02:01.390> traction

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
car around shut that off traction

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.800 
car around shut that off traction
control<00:02:02.470> sorry<00:02:03.250> gotta<00:02:03.729> kill<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.299> then

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
control sorry gotta kill it and then

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.450 
control sorry gotta kill it and then
we've<00:02:04.960> got<00:02:04.990> some<00:02:05.259> pretty<00:02:05.409> sticky<00:02:05.890> tires<00:02:06.250> the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
we've got some pretty sticky tires the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.669 
we've got some pretty sticky tires the
racing<00:02:06.819> tires<00:02:07.000> are<00:02:07.240> much<00:02:07.390> stickier<00:02:07.780> than<00:02:08.229> the

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
racing tires are much stickier than the

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.380 
racing tires are much stickier than the
sports<00:02:09.160> tire<00:02:09.519> so<00:02:09.789> we'll<00:02:09.940> go<00:02:10.060> down<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.360> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
sports tire so we'll go down to the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.940 
sports tire so we'll go down to the
sports<00:02:10.780> tires<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.470> make<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.769> little

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
sports tires just to make it a little

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.090 
sports tires just to make it a little
bit<00:02:12.220> easier<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:13.090> slide<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.019> car<00:02:14.290> around<00:02:14.440> then

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
bit easier to slide this car around then

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.000 
bit easier to slide this car around then
you<00:02:15.280> can<00:02:15.400> actually<00:02:15.730> go<00:02:15.880> into<00:02:16.739> some<00:02:17.739> real

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
you can actually go into some real

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.920 
you can actually go into some real
driving<00:02:18.280> options<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.000> fine-tune<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
driving options and fine-tune the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.449 
driving options and fine-tune the
suspension<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.769> extremely

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
suspension and this is extremely

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.699 
suspension and this is extremely
important<00:02:22.000> if<00:02:22.060> you're<00:02:22.180> drifting<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.630> car<00:02:22.840> one

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
important if you're drifting a car one

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.750 
important if you're drifting a car one
thing<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:23.950> we've<00:02:24.190> learned<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.640> last

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
thing that we've learned in the last

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.780 
thing that we've learned in the last
three<00:02:25.120> years<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.540> drifting<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.900> 350z<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:26.830> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
three years of drifting a 350z is that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.580 
three years of drifting a 350z is that
it's<00:02:28.390> very<00:02:28.480> important<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.049> have<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.230> little<00:02:29.440> bit

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
it's very important to have a little bit

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.559 
it's very important to have a little bit
of<00:02:29.620> toe<00:02:29.890> in<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> rear<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.819> have<00:02:31.540> a

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
of toe in in the rear and have a

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.870 
of toe in in the rear and have a
slightly<00:02:31.900> softer<00:02:32.260> suspension<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.400> rear

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
slightly softer suspension in the rear

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880 
slightly softer suspension in the rear
of<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.239> suspension<00:02:34.569> also<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:35.739> kind

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
of the suspension also so it's it's kind

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.110 
of the suspension also so it's it's kind
of<00:02:35.950> cool<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.340> can<00:02:36.430> do<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.060> this

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
of cool that you can do that with this

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.150 
of cool that you can do that with this
particular<00:02:37.870> game

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.940 

when<00:02:44.790> drifting<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.390> cars<00:02:45.630> on<00:02:46.050> gran<00:02:46.440> turismo

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
when drifting the cars on gran turismo

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.470 
when drifting the cars on gran turismo
prologue<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.790> techniques<00:02:48.120> are<00:02:48.210> actually

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
prologue the techniques are actually

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
prologue the techniques are actually
very<00:02:48.750> similar<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.200> real<00:02:49.650> life<00:02:49.710> as<00:02:50.010> you'd

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
very similar to real life as you'd

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.550 
very similar to real life as you'd
expect<00:02:50.280> you've<00:02:51.000> got<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.390> handbrake<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
expect you've got a handbrake and the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.750 
expect you've got a handbrake and the
handbrake<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:52.890> great<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.340> entering<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
handbrake is great for entering the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
handbrake is great for entering the
turns<00:02:54.030> getting<00:02:54.660> sideways<00:02:55.020> right<00:02:55.470> off<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.770> bat

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
turns getting sideways right off the bat

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.590 
turns getting sideways right off the bat
so<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.850> then<00:02:57.000> dump<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.390> clutch<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
so that you can then dump the clutch and

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.270 
so that you can then dump the clutch and
slide<00:02:58.020> through<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.350> corner<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:59.070> also

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
slide through the corner you can also

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.580 
slide through the corner you can also
click<00:02:59.610> side<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.240> side<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.750> get<00:03:00.990> rotation

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
click side to side and get rotation

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.850 
click side to side and get rotation
through<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.770> point<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.160> way

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
through the point of that way

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.560 
through the point of that way
let<00:03:04.460> me<00:03:04.550> show<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.820> handbrake<00:03:05.180> technique

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
let me show you the handbrake technique

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.240 
let me show you the handbrake technique
to<00:03:05.960> initiate<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.440> corner<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:06.890> my<00:03:06.980> car<00:03:07.220> got

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
to initiate the corner and my car got

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.100 
to initiate the corner and my car got
this<00:03:07.490> big<00:03:07.730> hydraulic<00:03:08.120> handbrake<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.870> yank

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
this big hydraulic handbrake that I yank

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.590 
this big hydraulic handbrake that I yank
up<00:03:09.290> here<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:10.160> put<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.820> circle<00:03:11.210> button<00:03:11.330> and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
up here I just put the circle button and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.910 
up here I just put the circle button and
it<00:03:11.690> really<00:03:11.840> does<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.140> exact<00:03:12.440> same<00:03:12.470> thing

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
it really does the exact same thing

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.710 
it really does the exact same thing
we're<00:03:13.430> coming<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:13.790> locking<00:03:14.210> up<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.330> handbrake

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
we're coming in locking up the handbrake

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.930 
we're coming in locking up the handbrake
it's<00:03:15.170> lighting<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.620> car<00:03:15.800> sideways<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.520> now

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
it's lighting the car sideways and now

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.220 
it's lighting the car sideways and now
i'm<00:03:17.030> drifting<00:03:17.240> through<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.570> corner<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.020> kind

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
i'm drifting through the corner and kind

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.230 
i'm drifting through the corner and kind
of<00:03:18.290> exiting<00:03:18.770> out<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.760> other<00:03:19.850> thing<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.180> can

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
of exiting out the other thing you can

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.080 
of exiting out the other thing you can
use<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.750> circle<00:03:21.140> button<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:21.710> is<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.730> clutch

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
use the circle button for is a clutch

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.310 
use the circle button for is a clutch
kick<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.570> it's<00:03:23.660> something<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:24.050> have<00:03:24.230> to

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
kick and it's something that you have to

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.390 
kick and it's something that you have to
do<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:24.530> drifting<00:03:24.800> a<00:03:24.890> lot<00:03:25.040> if<00:03:25.160> you're<00:03:25.250> coming

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
do in drifting a lot if you're coming

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.770 
do in drifting a lot if you're coming
around<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.700> corner<00:03:25.940> let's<00:03:26.150> say<00:03:26.270> I'm<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.450> third

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
around the corner let's say I'm a third

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.690 
around the corner let's say I'm a third
gear<00:03:27.050> around<00:03:27.230> this<00:03:27.380> turn<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:28.280> want<00:03:28.460> to<00:03:28.550> rev

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
gear around this turn and I want to rev

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.160 
gear around this turn and I want to rev
up<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.970> engine<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.270> get<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.420> clutch<00:03:29.660> kick<00:03:29.870> I

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
up the engine and get a clutch kick I

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.960 
up the engine and get a clutch kick I
can<00:03:30.530> push<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.190> kicks<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.580> back<00:03:31.730> end

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
can push that and it kicks the back end

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.670 
can push that and it kicks the back end
out<00:03:32.120> just<00:03:32.660> like<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:32.959> real<00:03:32.990> life<00:03:33.170> it's<00:03:33.470> very

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
out just like in real life it's very

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.280 
out just like in real life it's very
cool<00:03:33.890> technique<00:03:34.340> in<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.850> real<00:03:35.030> drift<00:03:35.300> car<00:03:35.480> just

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
cool technique in a real drift car just

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.340 
cool technique in a real drift car just
like<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.890> game

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
like it is in the game

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.380 
like it is in the game
now<00:03:38.860> on<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.370> Eiger<00:03:39.760> track<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.180> I'm<00:03:40.270> on<00:03:40.360> now

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
now on the Eiger track that I'm on now

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.810 
now on the Eiger track that I'm on now
there's<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:41.050> couple<00:03:41.530> turns<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.340> they're

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
there's a couple turns that they're

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.870 
there's a couple turns that they're
perfect<00:03:43.330> for<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.990> flick<00:03:44.500> or<00:03:45.340> side<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.850> side

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
perfect for a flick or side to side

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.340 
perfect for a flick or side to side
weight<00:03:46.210> transfer<00:03:46.570> like<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.900> one<00:03:47.080> here<00:03:47.200> it's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
weight transfer like this one here it's

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.150 
weight transfer like this one here it's
a<00:03:47.440> right<00:03:48.240> left<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:50.200> naturally<00:03:50.860> starts

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
a right left and that naturally starts

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.420 
a right left and that naturally starts
the<00:03:51.280> car<00:03:51.460> into<00:03:51.820> a<00:03:51.850> big<00:03:52.120> drift<00:03:52.590> which<00:03:53.590> sometimes

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
the car into a big drift which sometimes

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.700 
the car into a big drift which sometimes
can<00:03:54.790> be<00:03:54.850> difficult<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.570> manage<00:03:55.780> but<00:03:56.140> just<00:03:56.620> like

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
can be difficult to manage but just like

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.050 
can be difficult to manage but just like
in<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:56.890> actual<00:03:57.220> car<00:03:57.490> with<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.700> little<00:03:57.850> bit<00:03:57.970> of

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
in the actual car with a little bit of

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.130 
in the actual car with a little bit of
practice<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.600> get<00:03:58.690> pretty<00:03:58.960> good<00:03:58.990> at<00:03:59.110> it

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
practice you get pretty good at it

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.170 
practice you get pretty good at it
all<00:04:00.770> right<00:04:00.920> now<00:04:01.069> we<00:04:01.130> find<00:04:01.430> ourselves<00:04:01.550> in

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
all right now we find ourselves in

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.980 
all right now we find ourselves in
that's<00:04:03.020> right<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.650> big<00:04:03.980> beautiful<00:04:04.160> Mustang

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
that's right a big beautiful Mustang

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.840 
that's right a big beautiful Mustang
look<00:04:05.990> at<00:04:06.170> her<00:04:06.290> she's<00:04:06.470> cherry<00:04:06.770> red<00:04:07.010> right<00:04:07.700> off

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
look at her she's cherry red right off

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.840 
look at her she's cherry red right off
the<00:04:07.880> lot<00:04:08.920> we're<00:04:09.920> going<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.100> drift<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.490> puppy

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
the lot we're going to drift this puppy

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.150 
the lot we're going to drift this puppy
now<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.569> Mustang<00:04:11.959> of<00:04:12.110> course<00:04:12.350> doesn't<00:04:12.890> quite

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
now the Mustang of course doesn't quite

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.580 
now the Mustang of course doesn't quite
have<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.400> balance<00:04:13.970> of<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.240> 350z<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.170> you'll

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
have the balance of the 350z and you'll

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.110 
have the balance of the 350z and you'll
feel<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:16.040> right<00:04:16.340> away<00:04:16.519> as<00:04:16.760> soon<00:04:16.790> as<00:04:17.030> you

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
feel that right away as soon as you

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.420 
feel that right away as soon as you
start<00:04:17.390> sliding<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:18.380> has<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.560> bunch<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.100> torque

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
start sliding it has a bunch of torque

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.220 
start sliding it has a bunch of torque
because<00:04:19.669> it's<00:04:19.940> got<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.209> v8<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.049> can

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
because it's got that v8 and so you can

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.230 
because it's got that v8 and so you can
get<00:04:21.380> away<00:04:21.470> with<00:04:21.769> spinning<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.700> tires<00:04:22.880> at<00:04:23.210> a

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
get away with spinning the tires at a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.260 
get away with spinning the tires at a
lower<00:04:23.419> rpm<00:04:23.930> but<00:04:24.680> it's<00:04:25.550> almost<00:04:25.790> like<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.120> back

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
lower rpm but it's almost like the back

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.690 
lower rpm but it's almost like the back
end<00:04:26.300> steps<00:04:26.750> out<00:04:26.930> easier<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.710> spins<00:04:28.190> quite

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
end steps out easier and it spins quite

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.370 
end steps out easier and it spins quite
a<00:04:28.730> bit<00:04:28.940> easier<00:04:29.300> than<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.600> other<00:04:29.720> car<00:04:29.990> because

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
a bit easier than the other car because

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.380 
a bit easier than the other car because
it<00:04:30.500> doesn't<00:04:30.770> have<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:30.890> balance<00:04:31.220> I've<00:04:32.030> slid

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
it doesn't have that balance I've slid

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.040 
it doesn't have that balance I've slid
these<00:04:32.650> Mustangs<00:04:33.650> around<00:04:33.950> in<00:04:34.070> real<00:04:34.250> life<00:04:34.430> and

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
these Mustangs around in real life and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.570 
these Mustangs around in real life and
this<00:04:36.050> is<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.260> pretty<00:04:36.620> good<00:04:36.800> representation<00:04:37.220> of

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
this is a pretty good representation of

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.460 
this is a pretty good representation of
what<00:04:37.669> they're<00:04:37.880> like<00:04:38.080> but<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.140> got<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.290> love

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
what they're like but you got to love

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.220 
what they're like but you got to love
the<00:04:39.560> torque<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:39.950> a<00:04:40.010> v8<00:04:40.630> sounds<00:04:41.630> good<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:42.080> feels

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
the torque of a v8 sounds good it feels

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.330 
the torque of a v8 sounds good it feels
good<00:04:42.410> even<00:04:43.220> on<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.550> game<00:04:43.790> and<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:45.800> makes<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.280> a

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
good even on the game and it makes it a

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.880 
good even on the game and it makes it a
good<00:04:46.430> practice<00:04:46.970> car<00:04:47.320> we're<00:04:48.320> up<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.530> some<00:04:48.710> big

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
good practice car we're up to some big

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.800 
good practice car we're up to some big
speed<00:04:49.220> we've<00:04:49.550> got<00:04:49.730> a<00:04:49.760> really<00:04:50.090> tight<00:04:50.450> corner

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
speed we've got a really tight corner

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
coming up the braking still has to be

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.070 
coming up the braking still has to be
done<00:04:52.880> very<00:04:53.120> early<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.450> then<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:53.690> can<00:04:53.840> hit<00:04:53.960> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
done very early and then you can hit the

and spin out in the way for the fans how

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.270 
and spin out in the way for the fans how
embarrassing<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:00.500> would<00:05:00.620> be<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.740> zero<00:05:01.010> run

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
embarrassing that would be a zero run

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.040 
embarrassing that would be a zero run
for<00:05:01.520> me<00:05:01.640> right<00:05:01.820> there<00:05:01.850> kind<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.600> like<00:05:02.720> riding<00:05:02.900> a

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
for me right there kind of like riding a

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.920 
for me right there kind of like riding a
