just a neat glitch they found one time

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.590 
just a neat glitch they found one time
that<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> thought<00:01:38.119> somebody<00:01:39.119> else<00:01:39.329> might<00:01:39.450> be

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that I thought somebody else might be

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179 
that I thought somebody else might be
able<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> try<00:01:39.990> i'm<00:01:40.049> not<00:01:40.259> sure<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.860> will<00:01:40.979> work

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
able to try i'm not sure if it will work

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.160 
able to try i'm not sure if it will work
with<00:01:41.430> other<00:01:41.729> three<00:01:42.060> yeses<00:01:42.479> i've<00:01:42.630> only<00:01:42.960> tried

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
with other three yeses i've only tried

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.240 
with other three yeses i've only tried
it<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.680> own<00:01:43.710> 3ds<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.860> could<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.159> be

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it on my own 3ds and it could just be

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.600 
it on my own 3ds and it could just be
one<00:01:47.729> thing<00:01:47.880> that's<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.619> about<00:01:49.619> y3<00:01:50.040> yes<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.460> i

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
one thing that's just about y3 yes but i

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149 
one thing that's just about y3 yes but i
think<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.450> should<00:01:51.750> work<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.170> other<00:01:52.320> 3<00:01:52.710> s's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
think that it should work on other 3 s's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.620 
think that it should work on other 3 s's
because<00:01:53.549> i<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> way<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> works<00:01:55.619> is

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
because i think that the way it works is

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
because i think that the way it works is
the<00:01:57.630> camera<00:01:57.930> tries<00:01:58.140> combining<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:59.399> kirby<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the camera tries combining for kirby a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
the camera tries combining for kirby a
choice<00:01:59.939> combining<00:02:00.540> them<00:02:02.030> white<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.829> red<00:02:04.829> of

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
choice combining them white and red of

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.940 
choice combining them white and red of
Mario's<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.780> glove<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> sleeve<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
Mario's a glove and sleeve and it that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410 
Mario's a glove and sleeve and it that
gets<00:02:08.160> pink<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.700> thinks<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.060> should<00:02:09.300> be

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
gets pink so it thinks that should be

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.800 
gets pink so it thinks that should be
showing<00:02:09.599> curvy<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.349> uh<00:02:10.670> when<00:02:11.670> you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
showing curvy and then uh when you

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.870 
showing curvy and then uh when you
put<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.560> bit<00:02:13.980> more<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.370> way<00:02:14.550> then<00:02:14.790> it

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
put it a bit more this way then it

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.339 
put it a bit more this way then it
combines<00:02:15.209> them<00:02:15.650> blue<00:02:16.650> yellow<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.690> red<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
combines them blue yellow and red the

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.890 
combines them blue yellow and red the
red<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.800> my<00:02:19.890> yoke<00:02:20.010> shirt<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.750> before<00:02:21.750> Marios

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.420 
button and that gets Pikmin I know
that's<00:02:26.459> just<00:02:26.520> my<00:02:26.790> take<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:29.310> yeah

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that's just my take on it so but yeah

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.970 
that's just my take on it so but yeah
this<00:02:29.730> should<00:02:30.000> be<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.959> glitch<00:02:31.260> that's<00:02:31.530> possible

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
this should be a glitch that's possible

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.240 
this should be a glitch that's possible
to<00:02:32.130> replicate<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:34.019> somebody<00:02:34.800> tell<00:02:34.920> me<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.130> this

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
to replicate so somebody tell me if this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.450 
to replicate so somebody tell me if this
works<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.640> their<00:02:35.849> system<00:02:36.269> also
