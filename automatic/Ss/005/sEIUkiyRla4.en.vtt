people cannot see it or involved or that

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.479 
people cannot see it or involved or that
you<00:00:52.480> cannot<00:00:52.660> reach<00:00:52.899> it<00:00:53.170> this<00:00:54.040> is<00:00:54.250> on<00:00:54.399> the

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
you cannot reach it this is on the

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.850 
you cannot reach it this is on the
ground<00:00:54.670> they<00:00:55.030> can<00:00:55.180> easily<00:00:55.570> blow<00:00:56.350> up<00:00:56.559> around

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
ground they can easily blow up around

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.149 
ground they can easily blow up around
you<00:00:57.219> thus<00:00:57.570> damaging<00:00:58.570> your<00:00:58.960> farm

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.050 

let's<00:01:04.670> go<00:01:04.789> up<00:01:04.850> here<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:05.149> look<00:01:05.449> at<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:06.069> arm

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.209 

this<00:01:11.060> concept<00:01:11.689> helps<00:01:12.079> lot<00:01:12.289> especially<00:01:12.500> when

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
this concept helps lot especially when

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.770 
this concept helps lot especially when
at<00:01:13.850> night<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:14.539> you<00:01:14.630> need<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.869> play<00:01:14.990> stuff<00:01:15.729> have

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
at night and you need to play stuff have

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.469 
at night and you need to play stuff have
wheat<00:01:17.780> or<00:01:17.990> such<00:01:18.289> on<00:01:18.469> survival<00:01:19.240> unless<00:01:20.240> you're

top of the wheat the glass of courses
above<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:26.899> so<00:01:27.079> Sun<00:01:27.500> can<00:01:27.709> let<00:01:27.859> in<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.340> Bob's<00:01:28.759> can

be kept out this is the main part of the
farm<00:01:37.700> as<00:01:38.329> I<00:01:38.569> said<00:01:38.689> it<00:01:38.899> can<00:01:39.020> be<00:01:39.110> much<00:01:39.289> larger

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
farm as I said it can be much larger

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.760

with<00:01:40.909> his<00:01:41.030> main<00:01:41.270> part<00:01:41.599> in<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.110> keeps<00:01:42.349> me<00:01:42.530> fine

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
with his main part in you keeps me fine

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.039 
with his main part in you keeps me fine
and<00:01:43.369> everything<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.789> good<00:01:45.399> but<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.840> can<00:01:47.959> also

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
and everything is good but it can also

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.410 
and everything is good but it can also
be<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.289> defense<00:01:48.619> mechanism<00:01:48.939> here's<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.149> sugar

mechanism that I'm discussing aren't in
I've<00:02:46.810> captured<00:02:47.170> mini-malls<00:02:47.830> with<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.220> and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
I've captured mini-malls with it and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:04.820 
I've captured mini-malls with it and
taking<00:02:49.360> their<00:02:49.540> leaked<00:02:49.800> more<00:02:50.820> back<00:02:51.820> glasses

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.070 

I<00:03:04.890> put<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> fence<00:03:05.880> around<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.540> let<00:03:06.810> me<00:03:06.930> know

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
I put a fence around it to let me know

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.330 
I put a fence around it to let me know
where<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.470> because<00:03:07.710> I've<00:03:07.800> fallen<00:03:08.040> and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
where it is because I've fallen and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.170 
where it is because I've fallen and
unfortunately<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.090> few<00:03:09.150> times<00:03:10.790> here's<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.940> CAC

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
unfortunately a few times here's the CAC

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.170 
unfortunately a few times here's the CAC
just<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> top<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.980> mob<00:03:14.220> will<00:03:14.490> walk

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
just the top of it the mob will walk

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.060 
just the top of it the mob will walk
around<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.750> or<00:03:15.840> fall<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.350> top<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.770> small

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
around it or fall the top of the small

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.160 
around it or fall the top of the small
ledge<00:03:17.340> into<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.240> it<00:03:18.630> will<00:03:18.720> damage<00:03:18.930> it

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
ledge into it and it will damage it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.890 
ledge into it and it will damage it
continuously<00:03:19.800> until<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.340> dies<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:21.000> sometimes

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
continuously until it dies and sometimes

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.050 
continuously until it dies and sometimes
though<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.260> will<00:03:22.410> fall<00:03:22.650> out<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.940> can

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
though it will fall out of it you can

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.520 
though it will fall out of it you can
collect<00:03:24.270> it<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.840> water<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.320> have

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
really helpful and you can build in

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.480 
really helpful and you can build in
these<00:03:35.970> small<00:03:36.180> mountains<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.840> really<00:03:37.370> just<00:03:38.370> to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
these small mountains to really just to
