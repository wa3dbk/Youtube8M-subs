00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
really tough decision to make and at

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.279 
really tough decision to make and at
that<00:01:31.159> point<00:01:31.429> five<00:01:32.390> weeks<00:01:32.659> before<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.140> end<00:01:33.259> of

big experience I was really sore towards

big experience I was really sore towards
the<00:03:10.330> end<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.380> could<00:03:11.440> feel<00:03:11.850> something<00:03:12.850> you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the end and I could feel something you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.650 
the end and I could feel something you
know<00:03:13.510> in<00:03:13.750> my<00:03:13.930> pelvis<00:03:14.560> region<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:15.100> was<00:03:15.220> I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
know in my pelvis region that was I

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.750 
know in my pelvis region that was I
could<00:03:16.660> feel<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.110> pain<00:03:17.320> there<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.430> was<00:03:18.550> just

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
could feel the pain there and I was just

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.949 
could feel the pain there and I was just
hoping<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:19.180> would<00:03:19.300> go<00:03:19.480> away<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:22.360> didn't<00:03:22.720> it

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
hoping it would go away and it didn't it

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.140 
hoping it would go away and it didn't it
turns<00:03:23.200> out<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.560> was<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:24.610> was<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.820> stress

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
turns out it was it was a stress

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.360 
turns out it was it was a stress
fracture<00:03:25.450> in<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.290> was<00:03:27.130> kind<00:03:27.340> of

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
fracture in that I was kind of

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.760 
fracture in that I was kind of
disappointing<00:03:27.970> obviously<00:03:28.840> because<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.590> meant

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
disappointing obviously because it meant

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
disappointing obviously because it meant
not<00:03:30.100> doing<00:03:30.459> any<00:03:30.610> running<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:33.430> six<00:03:33.670> to

not doing any running for for six to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.200 
not doing any running for for six to
eight<00:03:33.820> weeks

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
eight weeks

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.770 
eight weeks
you<00:03:35.690> know<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:38.000> let<00:03:38.210> you<00:03:38.330> learn<00:03:38.450> from<00:03:38.660> your

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
you know you let you learn from your

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.880 
you know you let you learn from your
mistakes<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.380> guess<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:40.480> something<00:03:41.480> that

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
mistakes I guess it's something that

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.430 
mistakes I guess it's something that
hopefully<00:03:42.940> hopefully<00:03:43.940> won't<00:03:44.140> reoccur<00:03:45.140> in<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
hopefully hopefully won't reoccur in the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.490 
hopefully hopefully won't reoccur in the
in<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.770> future<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.310> know<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.870> crack<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.350> uh

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
in the future you know the crack and uh

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.700 
in the future you know the crack and uh
you<00:03:48.740> know<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.040> lumbar<00:03:49.520> or<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.930> know<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.080> hip<00:03:51.380> or

can be career-ending injuries and I can

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.430 
can be career-ending injuries and I can
I<00:03:55.910> think<00:03:56.300> he<00:03:56.360> was<00:03:56.510> really<00:03:56.930> seriously

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
I think he was really seriously

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.570 
I think he was really seriously
contemplating<00:03:57.950> hanging<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.250> up<00:03:58.370> at<00:03:58.550> that

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
contemplating hanging it up at that

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.199 
contemplating hanging it up at that
point

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.390 

you<00:04:04.209> know<00:04:04.330> there's<00:04:04.590> often<00:04:05.590> these<00:04:05.709> moments<00:04:06.069> in

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
you know there's often these moments in

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.940 
you know there's often these moments in
in<00:04:07.270> training<00:04:07.930> where<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.380> just<00:04:08.590> kind<00:04:08.800> of<00:04:08.830> get

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
in training where you just kind of get

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.300

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
being at one with yourself and and

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.240

everything<00:04:25.990> around<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.530> just<00:04:26.560> kind<00:04:26.889> of<00:04:26.980> a

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
everything around you is just kind of a

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.990 
everything around you is just kind of a
blur<00:04:28.680> people<00:04:29.680> talk<00:04:29.889> about<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.490> know<00:04:30.580> hormone

release<00:04:31.300> dopamine<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:32.050> so<00:04:32.200> on<00:04:32.380> but<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.860> think

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
release dopamine and so on but I think

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.350 
release dopamine and so on but I think
it<00:04:33.190> running<00:04:33.610> just<00:04:33.729> gives<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.060> sense<00:04:34.240> of
