00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
shoot tip in the meristems I'm just

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.690 
shoot tip in the meristems I'm just
going<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.100> slide<00:01:48.670> my<00:01:49.030> scalp<00:01:49.780> or<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.049> razor<00:01:50.290> blade

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
going to slide my scalp or a razor blade

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.319 
going to slide my scalp or a razor blade
right<00:01:51.700> along<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:53.079> top<00:01:53.110> part<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.820> the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
cotyledon that I'm leaving on the plant

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.340 
cotyledon that I'm leaving on the plant
so<00:01:58.090> I've<00:01:58.240> removed<00:01:58.390> that<00:02:00.840> part<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.079> plant

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
so I've removed that part of the plant

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.639

and<00:02:02.649> I'm<00:02:02.740> just<00:02:02.920> going<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.240> take<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> quick<00:02:04.649> look

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
and I'm just going to take a quick look

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.480 
and I'm just going to take a quick look
to<00:02:05.680> make<00:02:05.920> sure<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.640> I<00:02:07.229> removed<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
to make sure that I removed the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.220 
to make sure that I removed the
cotyledons<00:02:10.230> meristem<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.330> after<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.720> have<00:02:13.960> an

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
cotyledons meristem and after I have an

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.350 
cotyledons meristem and after I have an
clean<00:02:14.590> cut<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.280> rootstock<00:02:15.580> I'm<00:02:15.940> going<00:02:16.209> to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
clean cut on the rootstock I'm going to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.649 
clean cut on the rootstock I'm going to
prepare<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.530> scion<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.159> I<00:02:18.519> want<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:19.060> make<00:02:19.299> a

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
prepare the scion and I want to make a

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.880 
prepare the scion and I want to make a
cut<00:02:20.019> about<00:02:20.590> five<00:02:20.980> millimeters<00:02:21.370> below

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
cut about five millimeters below

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.750 
cut about five millimeters below
at<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.270> same<00:02:25.510> angle

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.899 

so<00:02:30.629> now<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.840> want<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.170> match<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.400> two<00:02:32.580> cuts

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
so now I want to match up the two cuts

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.780 
so now I want to match up the two cuts
as<00:02:33.390> closely<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.080> possible<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:35.129> course<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.580> want

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
as closely as possible of course we want

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.100 
as closely as possible of course we want
to<00:02:35.879> align<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:38.060> vascular<00:02:39.060> tissue<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.840> it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
to align the vascular tissue so that it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.860 
to align the vascular tissue so that it
grows<00:02:40.319> together<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.459> then<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.239> need<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.599> place

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
grows together and then I need to place

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.039 
grows together and then I need to place
a<00:02:42.900> clip<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:44.129> grafting<00:02:44.580> clip<00:02:45.739> over<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:48.049> two

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
a clip the grafting clip over the two
