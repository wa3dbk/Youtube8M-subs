00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
like say to see how the range is like up

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.680 
like say to see how the range is like up
to<00:00:13.380> there<00:00:13.559> if<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.790> click<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.000> it'll<00:00:15.540> go

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
to there if you just click that it'll go

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
to there if you just click that it'll go
over<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.609> exploit<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.710> in

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
over but you can really exploit this in

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.800 
over but you can really exploit this in
like<00:00:20.220> very<00:00:20.580> different<00:00:20.939> ways<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.390> even<00:00:21.750> with

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
like very different ways like even with

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.800 
like very different ways like even with
larger<00:00:22.230> roles<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.970> there's<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> lot<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> secret

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
larger roles and there's a lot of secret

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.570 
larger roles and there's a lot of secret
but<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.560> went<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> secret<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.369> like

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
but like I went to a secret but like

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.339 
but like I went to a secret but like
these<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:27.180> nice<00:00:27.390> spots<00:00:27.750> where<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> ward

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
these really nice spots where the ward

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.019 
these really nice spots where the ward
will<00:00:28.500> trap<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> lot<00:00:29.010> further<00:00:29.250> than<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
will trap a lot further than that and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
will trap a lot further than that and
we'll<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:30.929> into<00:00:31.349> places<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.859> want<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.369> if

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
we'll go into places you want to like if

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.770 
we'll go into places you want to like if
I<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.149> actually<00:00:36.300> Trevor

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I do it here that will actually Trevor

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.160 
I do it here that will actually Trevor
travel<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> good<00:00:37.620> amount<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.860> distance<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
travel a good amount of distance and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.160 
travel a good amount of distance and
there's<00:00:40.170> multiple<00:00:40.590> spots<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.980> do<00:00:41.129> this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.910 

see<00:00:46.829> how<00:00:46.890> far<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.160> goes

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.380 

so<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.449> ward<00:00:51.750> over<00:00:52.019> there

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
so you can be here and ward over there

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.759 
so you can be here and ward over there
it's<00:00:54.390> kind<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.659> hard<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.019> it<00:00:55.170> over<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.379> but

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
it's kind of hard to do it over here but

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.189

look see how the ward I place it here
all<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> way<00:01:24.810> over<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.050> that's<00:01:25.289> look

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
all the way over there that's look

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.749 
all the way over there that's look
pretty<00:01:25.920> much<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.069> double<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.550> distance

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pretty much like double the distance

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.270 
pretty much like double the distance
almost<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.860> award<00:01:29.100> all

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the way over there can also do this

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.580 
the way over there can also do this
right<00:01:32.580> here<00:01:33.080> go<00:01:34.080> all<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.289> way<00:01:34.380> over<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> wall

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that's actually a very large distance

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.740 
that's actually a very large distance
and<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.350> helpful<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:53.359> but<00:01:54.359> many<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.689> these

and a very helpful one but many of these
spots<00:01:54.990> across<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.590> map<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.219> these<00:01:56.340> large

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
spots across the map what these large

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
spots across the map what these large
bowls<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:57.119> able<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> ward<00:01:57.750> over<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.049> this

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
bowls are able to ward over like this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.690 
bowls are able to ward over like this

because I also seen the LCS players do
it<00:02:52.050> because<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.680> don't<00:02:53.070> know<00:02:53.130> how<00:02:53.250> many<00:02:53.400> times

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
it because I don't know how many times

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.130 
it because I don't know how many times
when<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.120> down<00:02:54.270> river<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:55.080> you

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.290 
the dragon pit and they like check for
Wars<00:03:29.100> or<00:03:29.280> anything<00:03:29.550> they<00:03:29.700> won't<00:03:29.850> get<00:03:30.000> award

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
Wars or anything they won't get award

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.810 
Wars or anything they won't get award
but<00:03:30.870> say<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.890> when<00:03:32.340> they<00:03:32.430> sweep<00:03:32.700> this

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
but say so that when they sweep this

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.000 
but say so that when they sweep this
area<00:03:33.030> don't<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.080> dragon<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.590> awarded

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
area don't think the dragon is awarded

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.380 
area don't think the dragon is awarded
but<00:03:35.100> when<00:03:35.220> they<00:03:35.310> actually<00:03:35.520> go<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> do<00:03:35.970> dragon

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
but when they actually go to do dragon

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.360 
but when they actually go to do dragon
they<00:03:37.050> realize<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.830> it's<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.010> ward<00:03:38.190> at<00:03:38.250> all

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
they realize that it's in ward at all

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.070 
they realize that it's in ward at all
time<00:03:38.550> so<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:38.910> always<00:03:39.090> have<00:03:39.330> dragon<00:03:39.720> vision<00:03:39.959> as

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
time so we always have dragon vision as

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.090

usually keep it pink in here and it

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.300 
usually keep it pink in here and it
usually<00:04:20.900> lasts<00:04:21.259> a<00:04:21.440> couple<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.739> extra<00:04:22.039> minutes
