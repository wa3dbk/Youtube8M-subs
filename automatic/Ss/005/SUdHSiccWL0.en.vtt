00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.020 
then i'm going to remove it and then put
my<00:02:53.370> needle<00:02:53.580> through<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.300> middle

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.920 

so<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.690> just<00:03:00.020> keep

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.670 

putting<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.680> through<00:03:03.829> the<00:03:04.010> middle

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.369 

until<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.489> pretty<00:03:08.700> secure<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:10.109> was<00:03:10.230> really

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
until it's pretty secure it was really

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.039 
until it's pretty secure it was really
six-year<00:03:10.829> right<00:03:11.010> now<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:12.480> when<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.840> feel<00:03:12.989> that

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
six-year right now so when you feel that

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.830 
six-year right now so when you feel that
it's<00:03:13.319> secure<00:03:13.519> once<00:03:14.519> again<00:03:14.819> your<00:03:15.510> needle

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
it's secure once again your needle

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.979 
it's secure once again your needle
through<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.590> middle<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.790> back<00:03:17.909> coming<00:03:18.780> up

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
through the middle in the back coming up

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.729 
through the middle in the back coming up
from<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.349> front<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.599> then<00:03:21.599> catch<00:03:22.230> your

button

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.550 

and<00:03:26.680> then<00:03:26.920> bring<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.400> back<00:03:27.430> down

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.120 

the<00:03:31.099> next<00:03:31.400> step<00:03:31.580> is<00:03:31.819> using<00:03:32.270> this<00:03:32.420> pin<00:03:32.690> back

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130

doesn't have to be large this one is
pretty<00:03:36.920> small<00:03:37.280> about<00:03:37.819> an<00:03:37.970> inch<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:39.260> secure<00:03:39.709> it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
pretty small about an inch to secure it

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.690 
pretty small about an inch to secure it
come<00:03:42.380> back<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.770> your<00:03:42.890> needle<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.340> thread<00:03:43.400> at

the back of your brooch or your flower
oh<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:48.050> then<00:03:48.290> don't<00:03:48.530> pick<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> poke<00:03:49.130> yourself

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250

like<00:03:49.640> I<00:03:49.819> just<00:03:49.880> did<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.660> also<00:03:51.349> find<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:51.800> it's

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
like I just did I also find that it's

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.930 
like I just did I also find that it's
easier<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:53.420> sew<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.959> when<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.800> keep<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.640> clasp

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
easier to sew it when I keep the clasp

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.620 
easier to sew it when I keep the clasp
open<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.340> just<00:03:58.370> simply<00:03:59.030> show<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.269> this<00:03:59.420> way

maybe<00:03:59.959> it'll<00:04:00.170> be<00:04:00.200> easier<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:02.769> simply<00:04:03.769> come<00:04:04.010> up

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
maybe it'll be easier I simply come up

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.059 
maybe it'll be easier I simply come up
and<00:04:04.459> through<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.540> pin<00:04:05.840> back<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:07.600> crisscross
