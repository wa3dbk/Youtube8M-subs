00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 so I present myself colors to conch 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.450
 a book I wrote in 1992 which 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.019
 evokes the saint louis colors and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.570
 to which is attached a deck of cards that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.170
 allows us to sort of get 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.880
 to use his colors then there is 45 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.039
 or their 45 or their game is missing here and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.830
 it's 45 colors so 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.800
 a material version with red back and 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.870
 light out of a more material slope 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 you talk about ideas suggestions in 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.760
 blister and the bass hare can you 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.980
 to speak of experience of a lived experience 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.860
 so for example if I give a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 color show you how to see it the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.329
 orange color orange color 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.460
 orange in its version matter to us 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 talk about pleasure and in the version of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.260
 well will we talk about setting in motion 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.899
 of ability to get moving on the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 pleasure that is more subjective and the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.050
 movement that is also related to pleasure 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.850
 when we want something 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.850
 we go there and the movement if also the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.430
 dance and the joy of his way the joy is 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.860
 manifested by a movement if not if 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.610
 does not have the body we can talk about a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.140
 satisfaction 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.820
 we are happy or satisfied 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.610
 I give you another color oise to 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.869
 the color it has the lilac color in the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.520
 material version will tell us about a 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.530
 certain fatality in relation to things 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.600
 and to life while in this version 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.140
 light or recently that there is no 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 fatality 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.369
 nothing happens by chance 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.650
 is when one enters this 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.689
 we will realize that nothing 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.189
 Happens by chance only fatality 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.509
 does not exist per se 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.229
 so we mean that this version 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.909
 matter explains light does enter 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.340
 in the present fact of receiving at 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.860
 from the present observe the event 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.049
 and makes us perceive that we are not going 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.960
 talk about the ways when we are 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.689
 in the experience 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.240
 so how are we going to be saved 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.890
 of its colors for example we are 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.610
 in a situation that we have trouble 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.640
 to understand 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.460
 Well let's up to us 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.759
 let's go to the piggy bank 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.869
 I shot and then also like that the ideal 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.450
 if put in a bag 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.740
 we do not see it or like these but 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.150
 without really looking at where was left 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.080
 attract by energy for example from 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.020
 situation 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.870
 the situation is the following the greens 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.600
 will do a glass of beer france it's going 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.440
 tell us about traffic sharing 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.709
 fluid 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.910
 we are good and street with another 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.560
 person or with other people 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.380
 it's the color of friendship but it's 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.600
 also the color of the couple is the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.250
 torque that is both colors evoked 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.900
 that we are well we are happy 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.850
 a sum in a couple comes to us 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.510
 are open our heart is open 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.830
 another captures another cape is going to us 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.530
 talk about yellow the yellow will talk to us 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.830
 of this ability to show us being seen 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.310
 to be appreciated to be methodical and 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.650
 organized makes sense in our way of 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.570
 we express a third color the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.989
 indigo color the indigo color will us 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.750
 talk about the motivation to know what 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.430
 we want to know how we 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.290
 think things will evolve well 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.269
 what we want is also linked 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.250
 what we see is what I see 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.750
 that I'm going to realize such thing is this 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.670
 that I have the image of the thing that I have 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.320
 realized well it's called the 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.670
 motivation you see there are all 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.840
 kinds of chicken all kinds of sentences 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.790
 a kind of sense 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.750
 so when we do not want to see change 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.320
 his life and often we will say but 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.519
 what will they do 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.989
 what should I do 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.110
 what is the solution that I have 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.290
 adopt and well in the facts if I 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.829
 look at how works for example 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.959
 a GPS 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.820
 well if I want to go somewhere he 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.400
 I need to know where I am from 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.150
 so we're going to name it names not where is 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.090
 what I'm going for example I'm talking here 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.440
 I speak here and I would like to go there 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.209
 I would like to read and from where 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.260
 I leave that I speak for example of the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.320
 white the color white the white it's in 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.270
 somehow we erased a story 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.280
 in his life we ​​passed bridges 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.380
 we put a layer of white some 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.720
 so my mind my mind that the street of 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.140
 blanquette no we erased something 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.140
 of his life 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.550
 we are in the starting point and we are in 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.280
 the white the white page 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.570
 well we can say that for example I 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.190
 am in the white the blank page 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.960
 it's the beginning I do not know 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.570
 in which direction of the valais well 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.730
 if i know that simon start for 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.440
 go in the next color that is 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.140
 the gold color was throwing me and 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.900
 undertake to know that from there to there 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.730
 there are going to be stages in which i 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.100
 have passed because I will not be able to 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.590
 launch and succeed while I start 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.930
 with the blog you see that for 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.590
 initiate change it will have to 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.780
 against conserved that there are steps where 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.430
 I can pull step but I could 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.000
 also just understand the principle 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.920
 draws then see that the game of 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.200
 colors is a tool that can be 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.180
 practice by oneself and who is 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.460
 simply need to pull the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.410
 colors and especially to have a question 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.240
 when you have your question you 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.210
 can move forward 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.100
 you can find this book in 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.470
 color language dot net on then 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.330
 in the shop in the shop area 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.930

 will be able to find other languages 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.420
 colors took the space of 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.310

 and well you can also go in 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.920
 color language took they 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.460
 would have all the information about 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.970
