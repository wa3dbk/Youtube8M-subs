00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.549 
what's it called the mob spawner or the
spawning<00:00:55.949> method<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.059> game<00:00:57.239> uses

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
spawning method that this game uses

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.880 
spawning method that this game uses
alright<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.030> this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.930> torch<00:01:01.230> I'm

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
alright so this is a this is a torch I'm

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.780 
alright so this is a this is a torch I'm
pretty<00:01:02.370> sure<00:01:02.460> he<00:01:02.579> gives<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:02.940> 14<00:01:03.480> light<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.790> I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
pretty sure he gives all 14 light and I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.630 
pretty sure he gives all 14 light and I
what<00:01:06.540> moms<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:07.770> spawn<00:01:08.010> they

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
what moms do is when they spawn they

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760 
what moms do is when they spawn they
can't<00:01:08.909> spawn<00:01:09.060> within<00:01:09.330> 26<00:01:09.780> blocks<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
can't spawn within 26 blocks of you so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
can't spawn within 26 blocks of you so
I'm<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> use<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.450> advantage

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
I'm going to use this to my advantage

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.060 
I'm going to use this to my advantage
I'll<00:01:13.020> show<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.260> all<00:01:13.470> use<00:01:13.650> water<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
I'll show you all use water and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.440 
I'll show you all use water and
everything<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:15.030> uh<00:01:16.310> they<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.670> spawned<00:01:18.180> in

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
everything but uh they they spawned in

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.760 
everything but uh they they spawned in
about<00:01:19.580> seven<00:01:20.580> light<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.560> gives

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
about seven light so one and this gives

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.399 
about seven light so one and this gives
all<00:01:22.979> 14<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> every<00:01:24.000> block<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.570> minus<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.200> as

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
all 14 and every block it's minus one as

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.340 
all 14 and every block it's minus one as
you<00:01:25.680> guys<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.850> would<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.350> two

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you guys can see so it would be one two

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.719 
you guys can see so it would be one two
three<00:01:29.310> four<00:01:30.259> five<00:01:32.180> six<00:01:33.320> seven<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.220> from<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
three four five six seven so from that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.850 
three four five six seven so from that
I'm<00:01:36.570> off<00:01:36.900> screen<00:01:36.930> spawn<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.619> kind<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
I'm off screen spawn in this kind of

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.050 
I'm off screen spawn in this kind of
light<00:01:38.040> which<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.549> know<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.909> kind<00:01:39.030> of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
light which I know it's kind of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.749 
light which I know it's kind of
ridiculous<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.200> happens<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.130> lists

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
ridiculous but it happens and it lists

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
ridiculous but it happens and it lists
likely<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.930> farther<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.290> give<00:01:43.590> back<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
likely and the farther you give back and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.060 
likely and the farther you give back and
the<00:01:44.070> darker<00:01:44.369> gets<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.380> percentage<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the darker gets the more percentage of a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.060 
the darker gets the more percentage of a
chance<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.610> spawn<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:48.780> why<00:01:49.070> when

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
chance it will spawn so that's why when

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.020 
chance it will spawn so that's why when
I'm<00:01:50.159> finished<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.430> my<00:01:50.520> mouth<00:01:50.729> song<00:01:50.880> I'm

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
I'm finished with my mouth song I'm

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.190 
I'm finished with my mouth song I'm

pitch black and the more fly area that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
pitch black and the more fly area that
has<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.360> percentage<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.899> we'll<00:02:01.020> be

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
has the more percentage and we'll be

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.969 
has the more percentage and we'll be
able<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> spawn<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:04.200> did<00:02:04.590> three<00:02:04.829> high

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
able to spawn there and I did three high

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
able to spawn there and I did three high
so<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> move<00:02:05.939> better<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.659> when

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so they can move better because when

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.859 
so they can move better because when
they<00:02:07.140> jump<00:02:07.469> they<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.910> they<00:02:09.420> get<00:02:09.539> pretty<00:02:09.690> high

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
they jump they get they get pretty high

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.690 
they jump they get they get pretty high
up<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.259> air

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
up in the air

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.150 
up in the air
and<00:02:10.849> when<00:02:10.940> they<00:02:11.060> get<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.480> they<00:02:11.660> can't<00:02:11.900> really

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
and when they get to they can't really

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.449 
and when they get to they can't really
move<00:02:13.160> very<00:02:13.430> fast<00:02:13.670> all<00:02:14.660> right<00:02:14.780> anyway<00:02:15.650> uh<00:02:15.860> I

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459
