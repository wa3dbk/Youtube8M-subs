00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.659
 in paschal session 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.100
 ah 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.760
 thanks to 2k games that came to Barcelona 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.060
 we had the pleasure of trying during 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.840
 three hours in the final version of ibor 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.550
 a lot has been said about the game 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.640
 developed by the turtle beach 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.009
 creators of the left forget well then 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.510
 now let's talk even more as not 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.100
 we could capture screen image of 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.720
 game that we were trying the 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.550
 screenshots belong to the beta already 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.489
 available and videos that has 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.019
 directly provided 2k as all the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.610
 world knows by now this 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.470
 proposal puts us in the skin of four 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.110
 hunters who must finish with a 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.120
 monster each one of them responds 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.120
 to a class type trapper assault 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.280
 medical and support is fundamental the good 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.860
 Intendant players coordinating 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.750
 attacks and support in the mission if not 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.549
 we are sold to the monster and the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.280
 other dangers of the flora and fauna that 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.739
 turtle beach surrounds us already made us play 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.629
 as a team in de ford demonstrating what 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.699
 if we take our pot we die 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.560
 the few steps and allowed us also 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.409
 control the main infected 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 of the game in the online multiplayer 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.780
 in ivonne the same thing happens in addition to 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.409
 tutorial and the multiplayer mode we have 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.679
 I will also test a little 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.810
 individual without connection being the others 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.249
 three characters controlled by the cpu and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.079
 being able to control one or the other 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.840
 character playing the different 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.939
 directions of the kite is recommended 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.609
 put hours to the individual game before 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 to jump into multiplayer since all the 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.310
 progress and evolution of any of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.619
 the controllable characters 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.109
 that is, hunters and monsters do not 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.609
 will serve for online mode only 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.740
 going up in level and getting the 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.810
 objectives of each weapon it is possible to go 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.880
 unlocking the different characters 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.549
 up to three for each type of hunter 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.409
 Perez enhance weapons and there are also 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.360
 that put hours to get the three 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.360
 different forms of goliat monster 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.159
 kraken and spectrum in the experience that 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.899
 has offered us 2k games we have been able to 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.149
 see in action many of the 15 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.879
 characters to all but the fourth 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.200
 creature we say announced apart and that 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.690
 It will only be available in the pre-booking 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.129
 of the game and in the monster pack for this 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.629
 testing we had with the characters 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.000
 unlocked all weapons 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.220
 hyperx as well as the three evolutions of the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.870
 monster available each of the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.970
 twelve hunters have their own weapons 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.430
 and strategic actions to help 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.469
 your colleagues you have to be clear 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.390
 each player the assault is the one that can 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.849
 detect and attack the monster in front 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.230
 the trapper is the one that weakens support 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.569
 is the one that uses heavy weaponry to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.760
 help the assault and the doctor can heal 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.290
 to any of them we have a 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.730
 main weapon for each one 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.920
 special that refers to the type of 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.959
 character and two strategic actions 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.659
 assigned to the top buttons of the 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.250
 frame these last ones are spent when using them 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.560
 and they need a few seconds to 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.750
 recharge killing certain creatures 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.299
 we get timely improvements for that 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.680
 game the monster in turn counts 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.359
 with different states and we should 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.639
 feed him eating the other creatures 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.189
 of the planet to strengthen or recover 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.780
 the shield and evolve it by pressing 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.909
 the two triggers when we fill in the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.489
 corresponding level has a large 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.959
 resistance and devastating attacks the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.120
 three monsters have their strengths 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.250
 according to what we want speed of 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.680
 forceful movements of attack or 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.569
 resistance the different locations 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.030
 asier planet we visited we 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.189
 present extensive open maps and 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.169
 with different heights perfect for 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.469
 carry out different strategies of 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.449
 team 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.220
 the backpack propellant allows us 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.510
 ascend great heights or move 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.120
 quickly with an input 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.280
 perfect to dodge the monster 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.079
 You can also quickly scroll the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.879
 destroyer power of hunters should 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.459
 deploy yourself thoroughly with attacks 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.040
 coordinated or our effort will be in 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.780
 vain so this game depends a lot on 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.579
 with whom we play the rapport 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.730
 and communication with our colleagues 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.950
 hunters and whatever the fuck 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.390
 control the monster the action is 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.099
 constant thanks to the different 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.810
 creatures that attack hunters already 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.760
 the feeling of being the persecuted if 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.980
 we are the monster is a shooter 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.930
 different where you have to be clear as 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.180
 corner the enemy and here enemies 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.220
 we must eliminate first is not so 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.049
 frantic as the leford where we 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.879
 they attacked a lot of zombies without stopping 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.120
 while we try to get to the area 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.370
 safe in a linear mapping ivonne is 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.109
 more strategic and with very broad maps 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.850
 full of resources that know how to take advantage 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.470
 it's when we get to the showdown 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.560
 between the four hunters and the monster 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.880
 when and bolt shows all your cards 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.800
 It will be in February when he takes the sale to 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.229
 game when we will analyze it in 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.990
 depth of moment just indicate 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.560
 what and volks looks very good one of 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.330
