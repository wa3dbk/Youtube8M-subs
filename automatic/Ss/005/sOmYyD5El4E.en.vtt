00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.639
 hello on a Sunday and like every 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.559
 Sunday and Sunday institute claude 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.820
 onesta on all versions 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.400
 because today we will see how 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.480
 these spaces by emptying the case then the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.890
 cash what is it i'm going to be 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.140
 very simple it's a place where the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.790
 governments and what are files 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.710
 that are useful to an application for 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.539
 requirement they spend less time 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.750
 to go get two folders not I 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.619
 know the thing the file she wants by 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.570
 example on the internet 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.180
 take the example of firefox from 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.690
 any browser like visiting 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.250
 a page 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.600
 this page is cached your 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.320
 computer in which to download them on 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.630
 your computer 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.520
 and this one remains that could live 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.129
 like that when you re rose retype the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.100
 Same address as the page is faster 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.960
 loaded that if you manage a new one 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.079
 once left in class that still takes 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.820
 time yeah that's a little weird when 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.469
 wholesale caches to make it simple 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.940
 cash at the place holding for a place 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.809
 where are really tons tons of 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.430
 files that are useful to a 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.239
 application 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.550
 so here I can summarize enough 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.220
 just that sure we'll see a little bit 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.090
 how space knowing that style of 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 life of the caches little gained 2.1 to about 9 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.590
 10 gigas space or standby it's very 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.909
 interesting to start we will try 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.250
 to see that in May space are few 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.400
 released thanks to that then to do this 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.990
 you already make 6 in the finder 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.130
 as it is in the office 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.439
 you are going in will you pass a 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.390
 little stop button it will not be 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:37.420
 library you then click there 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.380
 a nice cash menu on how do you do 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:46.399
 y display the size of 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.789
 of the file so it has roughly 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.079
 go away almost an interesting gig 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.549
 is for you maybe it's more 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.750
 maybe less 75 and over so we 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.909
 go empty and there is no easier 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.869
 than that 2 to make teeth 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.860
 terminal utilitarian applications because 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.460
 it was good to terminale we are waiting 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.979
 that his charge 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.750
 and when it's good for you, make it Thursday 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.849
 an order who would like to put me 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.519
 I glue it you can copy paste to 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.709
 system thing that's actually it's true 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.480
 will it will go to the six caps 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.269
 can remove everything in it 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.400
 it's simply erasing the content of 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.220
 these caches you open the holidays and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.480
 of spring case hours waiting for him more 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.970
 or less long everything depends on the number of 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.349
 files that deleted and also good 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.660
 green of orders so there I could 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.610
 write an order if I want it 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.450
 a return I wanted to wait we checked 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:45.540
 if it worked well means we will 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.870
 mattia alto the library did 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.150
 as anti on cash and we will find who 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.410
 is 40 kg 8 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.290
 so basically what's left of the files 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.019
 that mac os x generals whose 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.489
 automatically entitled to 36 years the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.349
 next week for a racist one 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.920
 going to 36 very soon for the 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.920
 next video
