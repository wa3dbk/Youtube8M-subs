different<00:01:24.689> versions<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.409> limited

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
different versions of this limited

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.440 
different versions of this limited
edition<00:01:25.860> difference<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> packages<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
edition difference in the packages is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.910 
edition difference in the packages is
you<00:01:27.570> getting<00:01:27.720> different<00:01:28.020> little<00:01:28.439> figurines

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you getting different little figurines

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
you getting different little figurines
and<00:01:29.159> i<00:01:29.549> believe<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> music<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.360> different<00:01:30.479> in

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and i believe the music is different in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.420 
and i believe the music is different in
the<00:01:30.930> game<00:01:31.170> itself<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.740> allston<00:01:32.009> characters

the game itself in allston characters

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.560 
the game itself in allston characters
but<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.759> probably<00:01:32.909> basically<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> same

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
but it's probably basically the same

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.880 
but it's probably basically the same
game<00:01:33.840> different<00:01:34.049> music<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.680> different

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
game different music and different
characters<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.460> otherwise<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.030> same<00:01:36.329> there

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
characters but otherwise the same there

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.660 
characters but otherwise the same there
are<00:01:36.689> three<00:01:37.049> different
