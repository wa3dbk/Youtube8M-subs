all<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.370> engines<00:00:50.789> appeared<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> be

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
all the engines appeared to be

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.729 
all the engines appeared to be
functioning<00:00:51.899> correctly<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.530> time

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
functioning correctly at this time

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
functioning correctly at this time
normal<00:00:53.640> Bank<00:00:53.850> right<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.239> would<00:00:54.449> say<00:00:54.600> he's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
normal Bank right now would say he's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.689 
normal Bank right now would say he's
about<00:00:54.960> anywhere<00:00:55.320> from<00:00:55.440> 30<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> 45<00:00:56.280> degrees<00:00:56.579> of

about anywhere from 30 to 45 degrees of
Bank<00:00:56.730> nose<00:00:57.629> his<00:00:57.780> high<00:00:57.960> everything<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> looking

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
Bank nose his high everything is looking

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.150 
Bank nose his high everything is looking
good<00:00:58.949> right<00:00:59.280> now<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.649> this<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> typical

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
good right now and this is a typical

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.109 
good right now and this is a typical
maneuver<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.680> b-52s<00:01:04.680> crews<00:01:05.400> practice

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
maneuver that b-52s crews practice

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.890 
maneuver that b-52s crews practice
during<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.140> low<00:01:07.650> level<00:01:08.390> without<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> flaps

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
during a low level without the flaps

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.219 
during a low level without the flaps
though<00:01:10.490> now<00:01:11.490> he's<00:01:12.119> continuing<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> fly

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
though now he's continuing to fly

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
though now he's continuing to fly
everything<00:01:13.740> else<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.850> point

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
everything else right at this point

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.020 
everything else right at this point
appears<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:16.250> going<00:01:17.250> smoothly<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
appears to be going smoothly for the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.670 
appears to be going smoothly for the
crew<00:01:19.670> he's<00:01:20.670> starting<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.509> increase<00:01:22.170> his<00:01:22.409> bank

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
crew he's starting to increase his bank

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.999 
crew he's starting to increase his bank
angle<00:01:23.220> quite<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.150> now<00:01:24.590> huh<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> nose

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
angle quite a bit now huh but the nose

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.370 
angle quite a bit now huh but the nose
is<00:01:26.040> still<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:28.909> here<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.170> he's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
is still up and here you can see he's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.020 
is still up and here you can see he's
starting<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> Bank<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> angle<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.960> quite

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
starting to Bank the angle up quite

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.570 
starting to Bank the angle up quite
aggressively

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
aggressively

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.090 
aggressively
and<00:01:37.880> now<00:01:38.330> if<00:01:38.600> he<00:01:38.660> doesn't<00:01:38.930> maintain<00:01:39.260> the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
and now if he doesn't maintain the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.980 
and now if he doesn't maintain the
correct<00:01:40.340> flight<00:01:40.640> attitude<00:01:41.150> he's<00:01:41.540> gonna<00:01:41.720> start

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
correct flight attitude he's gonna start

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.920 
correct flight attitude he's gonna start
to<00:01:42.490> develop<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.610> quite<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.240> bit<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.480> a<00:01:44.540> sink<00:01:44.750> rate

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
to develop a quite a bit of a sink rate

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.290 
to develop a quite a bit of a sink rate
because<00:01:45.230> he<00:01:45.350> just<00:01:45.530> killed<00:01:45.800> his<00:01:45.980> lifts<00:01:46.580> by

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
because he just killed his lifts by

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.430 
because he just killed his lifts by
rolling<00:01:47.690> into<00:01:48.260> such<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.470> high<00:01:48.980> bank<00:01:49.370> angle

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
rolling into such a high bank angle

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.780 
rolling into such a high bank angle
right<00:01:51.440> now<00:01:51.590> he's<00:01:51.740> got<00:01:51.860> his<00:01:51.980> nose<00:01:52.160> down<00:01:52.370> now<00:01:52.580> if

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
right now he's got his nose down now if

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.220 
right now he's got his nose down now if
he<00:01:52.910> doesn't<00:01:53.180> start<00:01:53.330> rolling<00:01:53.630> out<00:01:53.720> pretty<00:01:54.020> soon

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
he doesn't start rolling out pretty soon

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.220 
he doesn't start rolling out pretty soon
he's<00:01:54.620> gonna<00:01:54.800> as<00:01:55.310> we<00:01:55.520> know<00:01:55.940> take<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:57.050> he's

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
he's gonna as we know take it in he's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.470 
he's gonna as we know take it in he's
developing<00:01:57.620> in<00:01:57.770> quite<00:01:57.980> a<00:01:58.010> sink<00:01:58.880> rate<00:01:59.060> at<00:01:59.270> this

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480

had anything to do with the crash

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.920 
had anything to do with the crash
because<00:02:39.380> right<00:02:39.590> now<00:02:39.820> he's<00:02:40.820> a<00:02:40.850> he<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.780> that

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
because right now he's a he that that

because right now he's a he that that
flight<00:02:42.260> attitude<00:02:42.850> he's<00:02:43.850> developed<00:02:44.480> too<00:02:44.540> much

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
flight attitude he's developed too much

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.670

of<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.900> sink<00:02:45.110> rate<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:46.100> recover<00:02:46.670> from<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.680> from

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
of a sink rate to recover from that from

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.890 
of a sink rate to recover from that from
that<00:02:48.709> flight<00:02:49.100> path<00:02:49.310> how<00:02:49.700> fast<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.330> he<00:02:50.390> going<00:02:50.660> at

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
that flight path how fast is he going at

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.870 
that flight path how fast is he going at
this<00:02:51.050> point<00:02:51.320> dude<00:02:51.560> well<00:02:51.800> it's<00:02:52.310> kind<00:02:52.820> of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
this point dude well it's kind of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.369 
this point dude well it's kind of
difficult<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.360> say<00:02:53.630> oh<00:02:55.060> my<00:02:56.060> god

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.979 

it's<00:03:01.379> difficult<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.129> say<00:03:02.340> how<00:03:02.750> fast<00:03:03.750> he<00:03:03.900> was

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
it's difficult to say how fast he was

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.990 
it's difficult to say how fast he was
going<00:03:05.180> with<00:03:06.180> flaps<00:03:06.510> down<00:03:07.099> at<00:03:08.099> least<00:03:08.340> uh

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.320 

tremendous<00:03:12.000> fireball<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.580> at<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.940> point

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
tremendous fireball so at that point

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.960 
tremendous fireball so at that point
where<00:03:15.900> he<00:03:15.959> got<00:03:16.080> banked<00:03:16.500> over<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:16.920> way<00:03:17.459> there

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
where he got banked over this way there

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.400 
where he got banked over this way there
was<00:03:18.060> no<00:03:18.209> way<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.420> put<00:03:18.630> him<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.810> pull<00:03:19.019> out<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.290> it

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
was no way to put him to pull out of it

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.729 
was no way to put him to pull out of it
and<00:03:19.819> if<00:03:20.819> that's<00:03:21.030> being<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.599> will<00:03:21.959> bank<00:03:22.290> with

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
and if that's being the will bank with

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.770 
and if that's being the will bank with
the<00:03:22.830> bank<00:03:23.040> angle<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.459> he<00:03:23.580> had<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.150> when<00:03:24.480> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the bank angle that he had and when the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.580 
the bank angle that he had and when the
nose<00:03:24.959> started<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.830> drop<00:03:27.260> increasing<00:03:28.260> his<00:03:28.319> bank

nose started to drop increasing his bank
angle<00:03:28.830> he<00:03:29.069> was<00:03:29.250> probably<00:03:29.630> from<00:03:30.630> what<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.840> can

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
angle he was probably from what I can
