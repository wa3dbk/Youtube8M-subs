come for and out of there now this is
the<00:01:03.780> updated<00:01:04.260> unit<00:01:04.710> they're<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> little<00:01:05.040> bit

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the updated unit they're a little bit

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.000 
the updated unit they're a little bit
different<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.700> some<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> earlier<00:01:06.450> units

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
different on some of the earlier units

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.140 
different on some of the earlier units
but<00:01:08.010> those<00:01:08.159> transmissions<00:01:08.820> were<00:01:08.939> known<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
but those transmissions were known to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.480 
but those transmissions were known to
give<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.600> more<00:01:09.630> problems<00:01:10.049> than<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
give a lot more problems than these and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
give a lot more problems than these and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
we're trying to catch a little bit of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
we're trying to catch a little bit of
early<00:01:13.170> maintenance<00:01:13.680> before<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.159> unit<00:01:14.460> here

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
early maintenance before this unit here

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
early maintenance before this unit here
falls<00:01:14.820> apart<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.900> starting<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> show

unit and hope for the best but you're
going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> start<00:01:26.520> by<00:01:26.640> removing<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.150> plug<00:01:27.450> let

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
going to start by removing this plug let

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.920 
going to start by removing this plug let
the<00:01:28.259> fluid<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.710> run<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.100> real<00:01:29.340> good<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
the fluid all run out real good and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.539 
the fluid all run out real good and
while<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.140> draining<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.189> we'll<00:01:32.400> come

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
while that's draining and we'll come

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300 
while that's draining and we'll come
around<00:01:32.670> I'm<00:01:33.030> gonna<00:01:33.119> check<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.479> CV<00:01:33.930> boots<00:01:34.310> on

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
around I'm gonna check these CV boots on

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
around I'm gonna check these CV boots on
both<00:01:35.520> sides<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> check<00:01:36.900> for

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
both sides I'm also going to check for

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
both sides I'm also going to check for
the<00:01:37.140> bearing<00:01:37.350> play<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.340> playing<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> tie-rod

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
the bearing play the playing the tie-rod

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.929 
the bearing play the playing the tie-rod
linkage<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> linkage<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
linkage which is the linkage that

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
linkage which is the linkage that
actually<00:01:42.299> turns<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> wheel<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.250> gonna

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
actually turns the wheel and I'm gonna

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
actually turns the wheel and I'm gonna
just<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:44.850> general<00:01:45.210> look<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.509> everything<00:01:45.750> up

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
just good general look for everything up

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.420
