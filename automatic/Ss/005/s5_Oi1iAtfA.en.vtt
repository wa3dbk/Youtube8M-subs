00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.859
 folders I will only choose one or the other 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.750

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.909

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.729
 if they can do it 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.260
 you may be thinking how 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.390
 clergy mod to call people because I'm 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.190
 of offer I will also explain it xddddd 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 good if you want to install the skin 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.240
 selector we must first of all open 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.550
 the folder called kernel of the folder 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.290
 skin selector not that of your san andreas and 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.600
 the files that are inside 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.260
 paste them into the kernel folder of your gta 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.260
 San Andreas 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.329
 although that is not all, then there is 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.829
 make a copy to the data folder of 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.290
 our gta san andreas 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.390
 and then paste it in the same gta since 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.700
 some files are important for the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.590
 Game function after making the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.510
 copy paste the files that have 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.819
 inside the data folder of the skin 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.799
 selector in the original data folder of 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.799
 your gta as I show it in the video 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.590
 and we give you copy and replace the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.590
 archive 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.810
 and ready you will have your skin selector no 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.269
 I recommend that you change your gta a lot 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.010
 the streets neighborhoods or new places already 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.010
 that can damage your skin selector 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.600
 I forgot to call people there 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.400
 just open the folder and all the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.380
 files that are within 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.570
 is copying them and then pasting them into the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.570
 cleo folder of our gta san andreas 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.730
 after copying and pasting you can play 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.730
 in his gta san andreas 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.890
