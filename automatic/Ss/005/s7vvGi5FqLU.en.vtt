00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.470
 the purification and arranged with logic that is realized is activated to eliminate 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.239
 of gaseous liquid bodies, foreign substances whose pollutants 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.659
 a process consisting of a series of planned actions of character takes place 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.659
 physical and biological mechanics 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.740
 water purification occupies a very broad spectrum of treatment 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.010
 urban sewage treatment of industrial waste 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.220
 a real alternative to traditional sewage treatment plants are the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.220
 phytodepuration plants 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.070
 phyto-purification is a natural purification system for waste water 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 civilians in the presence of soils and plants 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.270
 the purification system incorporates legislative decree number 152 of 11 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.010
 May 1999 and then in the decree law 152 of April 3, 2006 standard on the matter 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.950
 environmental with reference to small and very small communities 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.119
 size of treatment plant discharge with lower potential 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.340
 or equal 2000 of songs must be subjected to an appropriate treatment 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.259
 guarantees the compliance of the receiving water bodies 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:21.029
 rt quality tv tubes i have groundwater protection in the case of 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.279
 then the intent of this day's unloading into the ground 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:25.559
 this excursion 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:30.259
 and to make known the operating realities of purification 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:35.259
 it is in a sustainable environment in a natural context in the biological field 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:40.679
 realities that are actually actually realized in practice 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.999
 where it is that it has no purpose to a result 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.269
 this is what we will see today what the overview that will be done today 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.159
 has as its purpose this purpose of spreading 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.439
 and also to break a spear 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.349
 inner in function of these ipdb of these of this practice of these of 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.099
 this modality perhaps also little known or sometimes limited by 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.339
 beliefs 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.159
 which are not always correct 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.719
 or from past experiences that have had no outcome as to say 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.989
 for which his notes lyreco times this also happens this does not mean 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.660
 that should not work here here is a reality here they are 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.660
 eora we are ready to do our tour 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.839
 we are ticino the system that I am seeing undersized realized for 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.709
 800 equivalent inhabitants 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.869
 therefore the municipality has but to me it has correctly proceeded all the discharges 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.419
 in the off area 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.359
 and a new herry sewage pipeline has arrived in this area here where we have it 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.489
 the first phase of sedimentation, minimum rental of the grill and two 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.619
 imhoff tanks for the first sedimentation I read this point which 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.749
 grilled sedimented state passes inside the first two beds of 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:15.469
 horizontal flow phytodepuration extremely simple operation 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.400
 bed and 70 cm high there is a first area with very coarse gravel in 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.379
 a tube just five centimeters below the winrar distribution surface 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.210
 flor limewire distributed by this cracked tube in fruit or flows 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.199
 horizontally along the entire plant always below the surface of the gravel 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.020
 so you don't have to see anything at free range and now collected at the bottom by one 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.210
 piping placed on the bottom 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.699
 the pesado flow divided into two parts a part on the first bed a part on the 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.550
 second bed at the end outgoing 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.909
 I can go and see a tank of accumulation and relaunching phyto-purification 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.629
 vertical flow 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.460
 the planting was done with supplied be australis then it cancels marsh 

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:06.059
 and the plant that came into operation at the end of 2007 therefore in fact a year on 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:07.150
 operation 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.520
 eh eh you already see that in a year of operation gnv plant 4 plants 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.670
 square meter you can already see who does not have the facility under almost 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.669
 completely closed calafat mix 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:36.830
 b see to the phyto-purification plant of our dairy 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.630
 the problems are essentially drrr large volumes of water 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.059
 and a relatively light polluter charge and then hahaha is clear 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:51.639
 organic substance deriving from live washing of the plants in the dairy 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.649
 of terracotta webcam tanks evidence of both a place and so much of 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.830
 being able to speak have an abbot perhaps of your discharges taking into account 

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.519
 these two elements therefore run pope water quantity 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.980
 all in all here 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.219
 small business polluting load 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.209
 we looked for a different solution than those for purifiers 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:19.789
 activated sludge on the ground that experts here say they give you 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.009
 problems d 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.430
 proper operation for the fight against the club 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.430
 purse charge of ddt reticular substance 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:37.819
 chemist technical director of the ideas he designed 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:41.789
 now this phytodepuration plant of dicomano ancient king 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.520
 is a municipality of about 3500 equivalent inhabitants 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:49.839
 download goes up to 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:54.619
 brava 1999 directly in the version with the evening sing 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:59.539
 then download it without any treatment other than treatments 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.770
 primary hp is from every home 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.960
 and after that the peeling arrived. at a point with pool and unloaded 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.960
 directly into the river 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:17.419
 mosaic wakes up some as serious as the day ahead of milk 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:22.110
 that we transform so that today we transform 150 quintals of milk 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.319
 per day 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:26.579
 expekt iam 816 how many tons 

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:28.319
 ahahah of water
