who's in the game so now it to me that's

who's in the game so now it to me that's
going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> present<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
going to present and you know one of the

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.119 
going to present and you know one of the
situation<00:00:48.629> which<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.829> would<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.070> thought

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
situation which one would have thought

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.090 
situation which one would have thought
years<00:00:50.850> ago<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.600> Tom<00:00:52.260> Landry<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> one

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
years ago and Tom Landry was the one

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
years ago and Tom Landry was the one
that<00:00:53.280> basically<00:00:53.460> solved<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.329> when<00:00:54.629> he<00:00:54.719> had

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that basically solved this when he had

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
that basically solved this when he had
Craig<00:00:55.140> Morton<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> Roger<00:00:55.860> Staubach<00:00:56.160> he<00:00:56.579> had<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
Craig Morton and Roger Staubach he had a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.630 
Craig Morton and Roger Staubach he had a
similar<00:00:57.449> situation<00:00:58.100> guys<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.340> could<00:00:59.460> play

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
similar situation guys that could play

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.939 
similar situation guys that could play
it<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:00.899> thought<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.289> know<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
it we would have thought you know at a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
it we would have thought you know at a
different<00:01:02.309> level<00:01:02.460> than<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.940> Washington<00:01:03.660> has

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
different level than what Washington has

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810 
different level than what Washington has
at<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> same<00:01:04.199> time<00:01:04.409> guys<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.250> were<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.790> know

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
at the same time guys that were you know

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.340 
at the same time guys that were you know
one<00:01:06.210> guy<00:01:06.360> could<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.630> something<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.080> move<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
one guy could do something to move the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
one guy could do something to move the
team's<00:01:07.590> court<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.070> win<00:01:08.159> some<00:01:08.310> games<00:01:08.490> get<00:01:08.970> same

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
team's court and win some games get same

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
team's court and win some games get same
guy<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.900> eventually<00:01:10.250> Landry<00:01:11.250> had<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> come

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
guy but eventually Landry had to come

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.399 
guy but eventually Landry had to come
down<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.000> decision<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> stick<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
down to a decision and stick with it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
down to a decision and stick with it
make<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.250> basically<00:01:14.520> ship<00:01:14.790> Morton

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
make it and they basically ship Morton

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810 
make it and they basically ship Morton
off<00:01:15.979> after<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.189> having<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.580> kind<00:01:17.700> of

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
off after with having that kind of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
off after with having that kind of
knowledge<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.409> head<00:01:19.740> coach<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:20.610> into

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
knowledge as the head coach you go into

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
knowledge as the head coach you go into
this<00:01:20.939> season<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.470> guess<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> even

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this season and I guess this is even

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
this season and I guess this is even
without<00:01:23.520> saying<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.420> rebuilding<00:01:24.930> season

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
without saying it's a rebuilding season

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.170 
without saying it's a rebuilding season
but<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:26.070> guy<00:01:26.250> doesn't<00:01:26.610> play<00:01:26.729> particularly

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
but one guy doesn't play particularly

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.600 
but one guy doesn't play particularly
well<00:01:27.360> how<00:01:28.020> long<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> leash<00:01:28.650> does<00:01:28.920> anybody<00:01:29.340> have

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
well how long a leash does anybody have

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.359 
well how long a leash does anybody have
I<00:01:29.939> can't<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.140> long<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.500> can't<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I can't be very long and can't be and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.130 
I can't be very long and can't be and
can<00:01:32.729> these<00:01:32.909> quarterbacks<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.630> thinking<00:01:33.990> can

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
can these quarterbacks be thinking can

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.749 
can these quarterbacks be thinking can
they<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> mindset<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.189> they

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
they be in the mindset that they

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.460 
they be in the mindset that they
actually<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> play<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.140> game<00:01:37.170> they

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
actually are going to play a game they

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.929 
actually are going to play a game they
don't<00:01:37.590> play<00:01:37.799> well<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> next<00:01:38.310> guy<00:01:38.430> comes<00:01:38.610> in

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
don't play well the next guy comes in

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.520 
don't play well the next guy comes in
and<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> his<00:01:39.659> job<00:01:39.960> until<00:01:40.200> he<00:01:40.350> doesn't

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and it kind of his job until he doesn't

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
and it kind of his job until he doesn't
play<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.799> mean<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.729> doesn't<00:01:42.000> seem<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> me<00:01:42.329> that

play I mean it doesn't seem to me that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.580 
play I mean it doesn't seem to me that
anybody's<00:01:42.750> really<00:01:42.899> separating<00:01:43.470> themselves

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
anybody's really separating themselves

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.530 
anybody's really separating themselves
here<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.759> into<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> game<00:01:45.299> the

does<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> difference<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.570> or

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
does it make a difference if you know or

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.050 
does it make a difference if you know or
not<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.220> don't<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.030> have

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
not I don't think so because you do have

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
not I don't think so because you do have
two<00:01:51.360> guys<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.380> play<00:01:52.560> play<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
two guys that one they play play at the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.069 
two guys that one they play play at the
same<00:01:53.070> level<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.520> think<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
same level I think just go in you the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.190 
same level I think just go in you the
guys<00:01:55.259> named<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.920> go

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.259
