 what you require for this dish 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.969
 how good is delicious it can be 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.640
 a vegetarian option if you do not have 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.710
 you want to eat meat you can fill it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.469
 just the vegetable and it's going to be 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 delicious and a little bit of cheese is going to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.719
 contribute outbreak 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.750
 so neither the portovelo are these 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:10.140
 Wonderful mushrooms of Italian origin 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.479
 that are super big are super fleshy 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.960
 in fact they have been compared with the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.110
 red meat there are portovelo hamburgers 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.289
 that the truth if they simulate good is one of 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.990
 the most meaty vegetables you can 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.960
 call are firm when it comes to cooking 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.720
 they become soft and delicious 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.210
 then what we are going to do is 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.750
 fill it in here we have one that look 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.360
 let's remove the spores are here 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.990
 inside are the spores when the fungus 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.350
 opens the notice that has the spores 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.970
 in the forest and then they reproduce the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.740
 true that nature is a 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.080
 wonder then we are going to remove it 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.209
 that part darkens a lot at the time of 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.280
 cook but that's not why I 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.979
 we remove what we are doing is a 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.590
 little space to fit our 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.920
 stuffing if you do not want it to be meat 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.050
 It may also be chicken turkey meat you 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.860
 you can put tuna too and it would be 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.170
 super rich then there we have already 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.900
 our ports of the clean ones we are going to 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.230
 make the filling 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.319
 a little olive oil will 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.760
 add lean ground beef that means 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.209
 zero fat nothing 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.189
 nothing fat if you go to the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.640
 supermarket what I recommend what 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:38.670
 I ask the butcher to grind 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.430
 the meat because if you take the one 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.370
 have already there in the supermarket so 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.890
 general grind fat always remember 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.569
 that the big stores what they want 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.750
 is to have a little more profit 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.150
 then add some fat today 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.849
 they are winning but if you want them 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.430
 win them because I think I can 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.549
 ask to die for example pulp 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.370
 ball the ball pulp has nothing of 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:09.239
 Fat returns to you moulin 500 grams 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.670
 and already you in house it divides it and in a 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.150
 future can make burgers can 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.450
 do the feat some pasta with meat 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.510
 then try to ask for it 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.670
 grinds the meat to be given nothing 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.370
 of fat we are going to add a little bit of 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.730
 Salt 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.680
 well good delicious does not require you 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.440
 the fat that you have that you need 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.569
 fat that's why you will not know good at 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.480
 I think that you can 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.280
 season as we are going to do and 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.310
 do not miss the fat that fat 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.709
 animal that harms both our 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.290
 health then let's add onion 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.049
 let's start to taste and already smell 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:58.940
 delicious the study we are going to put garlic 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:02.049
 can you really true sat 8 thanks guys 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:07.040
 they already woke up truth let's put 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:09.890
 tomato pepper red pepper 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.170
 green, there's no problem, green always 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.730
 it's cheaper but there are times when one 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.519
 goes to the supermarket and is in the same 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.299
 price and I buy the red I think 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.570
 much more sweet cited then there go 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.010
 Taking flavor and color we will add a 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.880
 little tomato puree 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.280
 and look sometimes put bread crumbs let's 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.650
 cure the wheat germ that you already know 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.220
 the germ of wheat is very rich and look is 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.050
 almost identical to bread crumbs and their children 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.540
 they will find out and is putting them 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.280
 something wonderful in the food I 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.040
 you can put all the wheat germ 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.590
 you tell him why it's a wonder 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.500
 of nature you can find it in 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.290
 the health food stores or within the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.230
 supermarket in the area where they sell 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.650
 all food supplements and 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.200
 Look how thick you already saw how thick it is 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.140
 the east agent of the wheat germ that 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.120
 does this work for us then 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.620
 we put a little parsley 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.250
 cool since you can put it 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.949
 and you can put him oregano pepper 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.110
 you can put basil whatever you like the 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.960
 salsita can also bathe on a 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.270
 pasta that looks like an integral pasta 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.540
 Now that he is taking good care of himself 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.419
 then stuffing ready let's take 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.180
 our portovelo you see how big 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.960
 are the truth that with one is going to stay 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:44.110
 satisfied his diner and it is the food 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.300
 different I think that is original they are 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.389
 economic to eurosport or fast like this 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.789
 season there is a lot of cold they give themselves the 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.740
 cold in the humidity so take advantage and 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.539
 buy the neighbors bought that not 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.880
 we know how to prepare them as I give 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:02.330
 an option that makes 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.120
 I'm going to nothing more than rich and we're going to 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.240
 refine with a little bit of cheese 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.800
 Parmesan and goat cheese 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.919

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.780
 there is this is goat cheese if not 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.900

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.740
 little bit of goat, put it on and go 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.650
 remember me of how rich it is 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.659
 anointed that it has been very good we put a 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.500
