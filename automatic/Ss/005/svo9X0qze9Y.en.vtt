00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.940 
interesting parts in it so that people
can<00:02:02.310> manipulate<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.969> or<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.479> change<00:02:03.689> it

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
can manipulate it or we can change it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.469 
can manipulate it or we can change it
why<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.159> bring<00:02:05.280> back<00:02:05.549> Blood<00:02:06.060> Gulch<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
why don't we bring back Blood Gulch and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.029 
why don't we bring back Blood Gulch and
carve<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> all<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.140> into<00:02:07.289> pieces<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
carve it all up into pieces so that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.150 
carve it all up into pieces so that
people<00:02:08.820> can<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.780> start<00:02:10.020> manipulating<00:02:10.320> it<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
people can and start manipulating it and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.880 
people can and start manipulating it and
interesting<00:02:11.640> ways<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.120> then<00:02:12.900> sanctuary<00:02:13.680> was

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
interesting ways and then sanctuary was

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.770 
interesting ways and then sanctuary was
the<00:02:14.010> other<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.420> cage

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
the other one the cage

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.470 
the other one the cage
paradiso<00:02:18.040> that's<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.280> Chad<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:19.910> playing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
paradiso that's just Chad and I playing

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.360 
paradiso that's just Chad and I playing
with<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.690> map<00:02:20.930> editor<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.560> actually<00:02:21.920> building

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
with a map editor and actually building

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.180 
with a map editor and actually building
cool<00:02:23.090> maps<00:02:23.420> within<00:02:24.080> forge<00:02:24.380> world<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.890> mean<00:02:25.100> we

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
cool maps within forge world I mean we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.070 
cool maps within forge world I mean we
were<00:02:25.250> doing<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.610> exactly<00:02:25.790> how<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.840> fans

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
were doing that exactly how the fans

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.430 
were doing that exactly how the fans
would<00:02:27.200> do<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:29.870> definitely<00:02:29.990> looked<00:02:30.320> at

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
would do that we definitely looked at

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.470 
would do that we definitely looked at
what<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.680> did<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:30.890> Halo<00:02:31.100> 3<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.610> said<00:02:32.210> what<00:02:32.360> can

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
what we did in Halo 3 and said what can

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.330 
what we did in Halo 3 and said what can
we<00:02:32.570> learn<00:02:32.660> from<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.080> it's<00:02:33.860> one<00:02:34.100> thing<00:02:34.280> to

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
we learn from this it's one thing to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.610 
we learn from this it's one thing to
build<00:02:34.610> just<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.270> stunning<00:02:36.050> amount<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.470> Matt

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
build just a stunning amount of Matt

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.460 
build just a stunning amount of Matt
variants<00:02:37.100> but<00:02:37.490> like<00:02:38.090> nobody<00:02:38.690> was<00:02:38.990> expecting

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
variants but like nobody was expecting

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.080 
variants but like nobody was expecting
for<00:02:39.740> George<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.100> don't<00:02:40.130> think<00:02:40.370> like<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.820> was

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
for George I don't think like that was

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.770 
for George I don't think like that was
just<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.360> completely<00:02:41.720> whoa<00:02:42.460> what<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.780> Rube

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
just a completely whoa what the Rube

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.330 
just a completely whoa what the Rube
Goldberg<00:02:45.020> machines<00:02:45.620> yeah<00:02:45.890> those<00:02:46.160> are

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
Goldberg machines yeah those are

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.340 
Goldberg machines yeah those are
everywhere<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:49.360> Halo<00:02:50.360> 3<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.840> was<00:02:50.990> cool<00:02:51.320> that

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
everywhere in Halo 3 it was cool that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.870 
everywhere in Halo 3 it was cool that
you<00:02:51.710> can<00:02:51.800> move<00:02:51.950> things<00:02:52.160> around<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.790> was

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
you can move things around but it was

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.350 
you can move things around but it was
still<00:02:53.090> kind<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.420> clunky<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.340> we're<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.490> we

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
still kind of clunky and we're like we

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.720 
still kind of clunky and we're like we
have<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.690> make<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.020> better<00:02:57.490> what<00:02:58.490> are<00:02:58.610> some

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
have to make this better what are some

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.920 
have to make this better what are some
of<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.820> tricks<00:02:59.030> at<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.330> communities<00:02:59.780> using

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
of the tricks at the communities using

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.980 
of the tricks at the communities using
and<00:03:00.260> how<00:03:01.250> can<00:03:01.670> we<00:03:01.850> make<00:03:02.060> those<00:03:02.270> not<00:03:02.510> be<00:03:02.660> tricks

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
and how can we make those not be tricks

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.190 
and how can we make those not be tricks
and<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.440> make<00:03:03.560> those<00:03:03.710> be<00:03:03.860> tools<00:03:04.510> we<00:03:05.510> we<00:03:05.990> took

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
and just make those be tools we we took

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.710 
and just make those be tools we we took
that<00:03:06.530> stuff<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.220> made<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.300> like<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.480> real

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
that stuff and made it like a real

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.050 
that stuff and made it like a real
feature<00:03:08.990> there's<00:03:09.500> normal<00:03:09.920> phased<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.700> fixed

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
feature there's normal phased and fixed

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.330 
feature there's normal phased and fixed
so<00:03:11.600> normal<00:03:11.960> is<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.170> Kayla<00:03:12.650> freestyle<00:03:13.220> you

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
so normal is the Kayla freestyle you

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.710 
so normal is the Kayla freestyle you
know<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.640> bumps<00:03:13.910> into<00:03:13.970> stuff<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.540> let<00:03:14.690> it

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
know it bumps into stuff and you let it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.540 
know it bumps into stuff and you let it
go<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.170> falls<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.710> ground<00:03:15.740> and<00:03:16.190> moves

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
go it falls to the ground and moves

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.570 
go it falls to the ground and moves
around<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.880> stuff<00:03:17.080> fixed<00:03:18.080> is<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:19.130> same<00:03:19.340> thing

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
around the stuff fixed is the same thing

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.220 
around the stuff fixed is the same thing
except<00:03:20.090> when<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.330> let<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.570> go<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.959> stays

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
except when you let it go it stays

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.130 
except when you let it go it stays
exactly<00:03:21.470> where<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:22.010> was<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:23.000> then<00:03:23.300> phase<00:03:23.750> is

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
exactly where it was and then phase is

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.949 
exactly where it was and then phase is
the<00:03:24.470> coolest<00:03:24.790> because<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:26.180> means<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.540> while

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
the coolest because it means that while

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.120 
the coolest because it means that while
you're<00:03:27.110> editing<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.440> object<00:03:27.770> it's<00:03:27.950> not

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
you're editing the object it's not

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.070 
you're editing the object it's not
actually<00:03:28.550> your<00:03:28.610> acting<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.970> environment<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
actually your acting the environment you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.229 
actually your acting the environment you
can<00:03:30.230> put<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.590> through<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.040> wall<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.700> can<00:03:31.820> put<00:03:32.120> it

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
can put it through a wall you can put it

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.900 
can put it through a wall you can put it
you<00:03:32.840> know<00:03:32.959> through<00:03:33.230> other<00:03:33.410> objects<00:03:33.910> which

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
you know through other objects which

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.090 
you know through other objects which
changed<00:03:35.720> everything<00:03:36.260> for<00:03:36.290> Forge<00:03:36.770> like

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
changed everything for Forge like

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.060 
changed everything for Forge like
immediately<00:03:37.670> it's<00:03:38.540> much<00:03:38.840> easier<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:39.500> build<00:03:39.920> a

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
immediately it's much easier to build a

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.820 
immediately it's much easier to build a
ford<00:03:40.280> space<00:03:40.520> there's<00:03:41.150> snaps<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.080> rotates<00:03:42.530> and

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
ford space there's snaps and rotates and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.460 
ford space there's snaps and rotates and
degrees<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.120> units<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:45.170> can<00:03:45.350> move

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
degrees and and units that you can move

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.850 
degrees and and units that you can move
things<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:45.920> can<00:03:46.040> be<00:03:46.130> very<00:03:46.310> precise<00:03:47.860> the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
things you can be very precise the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.710 
things you can be very precise the
camera<00:03:49.100> controls<00:03:49.459> it's<00:03:50.209> actually<00:03:50.600> really

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
camera controls it's actually really

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.360 
camera controls it's actually really
good<00:03:50.840> for<00:03:51.140> object<00:03:51.530> placement<00:03:51.709> because<00:03:52.010> like

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
good for object placement because like

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.979 
good for object placement because like
little<00:03:52.640> touches<00:03:53.180> on<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.480> stick<00:03:53.750> don't
