00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 to 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.970
 very well we continue in our house 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:14.640
 working with the team application 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:18.870
 to decorate the clear juice being the 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.430
 adequate to be able to arm what 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.100
 we found techniques with black polka dots 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.560
 with small white spots and prayers 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.420
 all type of size came in handy 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.830
 out again to sell it 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.800
 good thing is that people love it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.440
 he always likes the bathroom game 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 little bit new the hunger bath that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.829
 fortunately it is something that has not happened 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.589
 never fashionable so do not worry 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.609
 well here what we do that we're going to 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:47.300
 iron the physics ok to be able to 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.300
 apply them 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.480
 both on the terminal side and the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.480
 next to the score 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.000
 and now 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.449
 in this way we already have 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.930
 the change point will go down and now we have 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.480
 the little one here 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.980
 how we go well with our hands 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.980
 that was the way 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.030
 the body 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.289
 and the part of the face 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.829
 and it comes here 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.039
 and between the two applications very well 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.880
 once we have that prepared 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.740
 notice that I'm going to bring the lid that 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.200
 talk about where it will be supported in the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.069
 applications that I'm using it in 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.130
 this moment I'm using piquÃ© milrayas 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.890
 which is what we formerly 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.479
 we used to make the dolls by 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.250
 example of the causes of babies is 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.920
 that gets the one that has something where 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.750
 they have west and lie to me enough to 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.640
 be able to work with these pieces then 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.099
 I took the measure of cardboard from the coast 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.750
 from the box from us or brought me the 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.870
 client a newspaper with the measure 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.390
 drawing what is the part of the concerta 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.830
 perfectly here 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.240
 and now they are going to see here 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.240
 with the brand 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.940
 in this way and bring the colored fabric 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.940
 green which is what the graph will be 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.460
 I do two things first cut the cloth 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.500
 green to the size of the rectangle of the 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.310
 layer of the pose like you're seeing me in 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.590
 this precise moment 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.520
 at game scale for the field that already 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.010
 I will be 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.700
 I use the pattern or the same way 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.700
 curve 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.620
 with a movement 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.849
 now we support this for here and then 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.670
 there we already have that in the green piece that 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.410
 will go where our support will go 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.670
 bit 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.520
 as also as unique and then that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.250
 did this this should go inward 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.250
 here is going to really fix that there 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.980
 there is always the question and here 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.090
 I can do it for what also not 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.860
 it stopped that they have done it in several 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.830
 opportunities suddenly I'm going to 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.150
 leave gothic a little wrinkled one 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.730
 will teach you with great love 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.050
 details true then here 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.050
 what they have to love 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.810
 that is, the Basque culture 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.290
 this piece here or directly goes to the 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.290
 planchita 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.360
 there's been 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.010
 gracefully resist it so that he repeats it 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.590
 for the action 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.919
 Let's see 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.260
 and then the skin was nice ironed 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.540
 when he did that, he turns around here 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.070
 Oh 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.070
 they put a pin 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.060
 and batea makes a password to marc bueno 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.340
 to youtube as you want to place it in the 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.440
 main piece that is the lid the 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.910
 concerta what are you doing I'm going to 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.750
 here make a small up to 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.750
 I go nothing else 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.800
 ok and then take the machine with thread 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.180
 green and still know out once 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.680
 they have prepared the bar for 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.539
 place the little bit is not as in the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.460
 air you understand because if it does not remain as 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.009
 in the middle of a white cloth look 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.800
 What a shot the little flower receives 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.009
 you can see perfectly the grass that I read 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.690
 also that starts here passes and goes up and 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.919
 well, the two look perfectly 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:35.800
 colors that our our game has 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.740
 bathroom is not all the same and the truth 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.080
 like another touch now take the little 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.520
 do not put it very right but put it 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.770
 with a little bit of grace a little bit of 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.710
 movement and they will place it here 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.710
 above the have 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.250
 place it, sorry, always be careful 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.530
 that not to put it neither very up here nor very 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.510
 finished but always look for a place 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.730
 remembering that you have to place the 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.020
 factory have to place all the 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.530
 things here 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.260
 there is as always I tell them they are going to 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.360
 place the corresponding rentals 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:16.340
 here because before going to the machine 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.340
 you must empty 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.380
 now 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.830
 there it is once you have these and 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.210
 They can also take advantage of once 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.620
 life as it does and what they are going to do 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.590
 the embroidery of 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:38.220
 of the antennas there where I'm going to put 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.199
 a button then very well here has the 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.680
 first part is a seek the part of the 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.680
 tank 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.790
 I have it here 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:55.190
 and always I prepare both the 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.950
 very good time and you can 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.140
 coffee they take you from the part of your house 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.430
 you really do not do it 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.250
 on the canvas because the French 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.900
 quick water or these masks that 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.360
 you can not see the fabric to draw 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.370
 they will surely stain the work 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.400
 color on solvents or paper 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.860
 on a newspaper he draws it and it is 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.860
 the newspaper is what will serve you 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.610
 mold to decorate 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:25.070
 your bathroom but if you want a table because the 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:28.130
 mind you do not know why black to 23 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.780
 with 52 as the guide says make a cut 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.930
 while I prepare you are the same 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.930
 what
