bring it to the elders the elders are

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.319 
bring it to the elders the elders are
creatures<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.430> guess<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:30.090> from<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
creatures that I guess we're from a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.230 
creatures that I guess we're from a
really<00:01:30.840> long<00:01:31.049> time<00:01:31.350> ago<00:01:31.619> before<00:01:32.240> humankind

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
really long time ago before humankind

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.990 
really long time ago before humankind
was<00:01:33.990> existent<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.799> they<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> bring<00:01:35.970> back

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
was existent and they want to bring back

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.179 
was existent and they want to bring back
all<00:01:36.299> these<00:01:36.479> terrible<00:01:36.750> monsters<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> beasts

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
all these terrible monsters and beasts

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
all these terrible monsters and beasts
from<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> past<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.210> from<00:01:39.390> ancient<00:01:39.600> times<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
from the past and from ancient times and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.660 
from the past and from ancient times and
rule<00:01:40.590> over<00:01:40.619> earth<00:01:41.040> again

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
rule over earth again

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
rule over earth again
so<00:01:42.479> that's<00:01:42.659> basically<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> book<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.799> do

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
so that's basically what the book can do

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.760 
so that's basically what the book can do
and<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.759> give<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.659> mortal<00:01:46.049> life<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and it can give them a mortal life and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
and it can give them a mortal life and
some<00:01:47.250> people<00:01:47.549> are<00:01:47.640> mortal<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.360> they<00:01:49.020> get

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
some people are mortal but they get

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.620 
some people are mortal but they get
granted<00:01:49.649> by<00:01:49.770> dark<00:01:50.220> elders<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.820> elders<00:01:51.210> but

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
granted by dark elders and elders but

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
granted by dark elders and elders but
Nicholas<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.320> para<00:01:52.530> Mela<00:01:52.710> para<00:01:53.430> Nell<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
Nicholas and para Mela para Nell are a

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.209 
Nicholas and para Mela para Nell are a
special<00:01:54.329> case<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:55.590> makes<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.920> book<00:01:56.159> so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
special case so what makes this book so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.340 
special case so what makes this book so
different<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:58.049> has<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> lot<00:01:59.219> of<00:02:00.350> real

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
different is that it has a lot of real

everyone has these auras around them so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.460 
everyone has these auras around them so
it's<00:02:33.239> basically<00:02:33.569> like<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.810> glowing<00:02:34.290> light

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
they are and such and so these twins

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
because their gold and silver pure auras

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.059 
because their gold and silver pure auras
are<00:03:02.519> really<00:03:02.970> strong<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.690> they<00:03:04.440> want<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.800> train

have to read the book to find out so
that's<00:03:15.360> basically<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.810> little<00:03:16.019> synopsis<00:03:16.319> on

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
that's basically a little synopsis on

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.830 
that's basically a little synopsis on
the<00:03:16.739> story<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.250> story<00:03:17.519> was<00:03:17.700> action-packed<00:03:18.329> it

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the story the story was action-packed it

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.900 
the story the story was action-packed it
was<00:03:19.170> filled<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.590> cool<00:03:19.920> mythological<00:03:20.640> beasts

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
was filled of cool mythological beasts

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.150 
was filled of cool mythological beasts
the<00:03:21.239> characters<00:03:21.959> were<00:03:22.140> really<00:03:22.410> developed

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the characters were really developed

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.210 
the characters were really developed
great<00:03:23.850> emotion<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.709> wonderful<00:03:25.709> mutual

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
great emotion a wonderful mutual

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.949 
great emotion a wonderful mutual
connection<00:03:26.760> between<00:03:26.880> twins<00:03:27.329> because<00:03:27.780> it's

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
connection between twins because it's

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.530 
connection between twins because it's
hard<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.680> sometimes<00:03:28.980> convey<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.760> in<00:03:30.060> through

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
hard to sometimes convey that in through

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.840 
hard to sometimes convey that in through
words<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.980> think<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.730> relationship

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
words and I think that the relationship

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.930 
words and I think that the relationship
between<00:03:33.299> all<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> characters<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.440> really

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
between all the characters is really

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.449 
between all the characters is really
done<00:03:35.940> well<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.570> book<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:38.070> through<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
done well in this book and through the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.280 
done well in this book and through the
whole<00:03:38.640> series<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:42.510> would<00:03:43.109> give

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
whole series I think that I would give

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.979 
whole series I think that I would give
this<00:03:43.410> book<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.739> 4<00:03:44.010> out<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.340> 5<00:03:44.640> stars<00:03:45.180> really<00:03:45.690> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
this book a 4 out of 5 stars really it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.229 
this book a 4 out of 5 stars really it
was<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.140> great<00:03:46.230> book<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.430> not<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.820> best

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
was a great book but it's not the best

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.650 
was a great book but it's not the best
that<00:03:48.600> I've<00:03:48.750> read<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.320> was<00:03:49.470> really<00:03:49.769> good<00:03:50.660> so

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
that I've read but it was really good so

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.560 
that I've read but it was really good so
that<00:03:51.690> as<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.859> said<00:03:52.920> before<00:03:53.160> it's<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.700> 5<00:03:54.060> out<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.359> 6

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
that as I said before it's a 5 out of 6

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.150 
that as I said before it's a 5 out of 6
series<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.320> is<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.680> first<00:03:55.950> one<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
series so this is the first one the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.490 
series so this is the first one the
alchemist<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:57.359> second<00:03:57.750> one<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.140> called<00:03:58.170> the
