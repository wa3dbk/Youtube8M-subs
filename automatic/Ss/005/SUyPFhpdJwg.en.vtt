00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 The race is here in my workshop . 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 Friend Leandro Romera in reply 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.740
 we will start a new phase - 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.820
 performance let's talk to you today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.820
 about connections 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.610
 the king sears 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.160
 today we will talk about the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.860
 known high pressure connections in the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.860
 market as connections 0 team 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.690
 the metal now if it has the longest line of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.039
 Connections in Brazil 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.860
 this has connection from all angles 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.160
 both of the straight connection to the connection 180 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.100
 degrees and also in all sizes of the 4 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.579
 nal 16 also has a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.190
 metal horse exclusivity that the connection 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:06.030
 straight with the males exit this here is 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.100
 avoids much rework and makes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.670
 the installation of some parts 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 of the cars and the connection 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.040
 metal if it has a quality of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.400
 anodizing you can not find in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.500
 other connections in Brazil what this 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 represents for you represents a 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.759
 durability of a connection that it will 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.280
 stay pretty much longer in the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.020
 safe from your car to accompany the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.850
 metal horse connection line 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.799
 We have the line of hoses of 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.590
 high pressure which are also produced 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.479
 by the metal hours both in nylon and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.400
 People call her super light because 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 they reduce a lot of weight especially in 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.899
 race cars because you have a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.200
 need to earn a reduction in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.450
 weight in stainless steel and also 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.070
 has a durability and excellent 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.500
 what do you look for the galley? 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.280
 because it gives a nice look to the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.280
 cars 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.619
 Good, we'll talk about the others. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.500
 connecting parts in the next programs 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.110
 but this is the basis of the connection from there to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.899
 ahead you are following is knowing the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.610
 this world of metal wars connection
