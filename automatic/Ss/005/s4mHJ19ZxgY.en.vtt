in<00:02:52.890> saying<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.400> Canadian<00:02:53.790> people<00:02:53.940> are<00:02:54.120> good

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
in saying that Canadian people are good

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.760 
in saying that Canadian people are good
people<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.810> expect<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> same<00:02:55.410> from<00:02:55.470> them

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
people so I expect the same from them

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.400 
people so I expect the same from them
and<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:57.270> think<00:02:57.570> they'll<00:02:57.870> fit<00:02:57.990> in<00:02:58.140> with<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
and and I think they'll fit in with the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.680 
and and I think they'll fit in with the
Swedes<00:02:58.680> here<00:02:58.920> because<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.580> think<00:03:00.270> Swedes<00:03:00.510> are<00:03:00.630> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
Swedes here because I think Swedes are a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.970 
Swedes here because I think Swedes are a
lot<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:00.990> canadians<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.650> fact<00:03:01.860> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
lot like canadians and the fact that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.130 
lot like canadians and the fact that
they're<00:03:02.220> easy<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.690> know<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.110> very

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
they're easy to get to know and very

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.520 
they're easy to get to know and very
humble<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.490> think<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:06.390> all<00:03:07.260> put<00:03:07.440> those

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
humble and so I think I all put those

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.800 
humble and so I think I all put those
high<00:03:07.709> expectations<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.490> them<00:03:08.640> too<00:03:08.820> is<00:03:09.270> it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
high expectations on them too is it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.199 
high expectations on them too is it
funnier<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> Canadian<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:12.090> have

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
funnier for you as a Canadian to have

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.210 
funnier for you as a Canadian to have
more<00:03:12.480> Canadians<00:03:13.110> in<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> team<00:03:13.620> or<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.950> doesn't

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
more Canadians in the team or it doesn't

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.190 
more Canadians in the team or it doesn't
it<00:03:14.400> matter<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:15.000> don't<00:03:15.570> think<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.780> matters<00:03:15.870> I

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
it matter I don't think it matters I

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.810 
it matter I don't think it matters I
