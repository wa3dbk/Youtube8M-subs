00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that this also has to cut out for the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.049 
that this also has to cut out for the
headphone<00:00:45.450> jack<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.160> power<00:00:47.160> supply<00:00:47.640> on

headphone jack and the power supply on

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.630 
headphone jack and the power supply on
the<00:00:48.239> bottom<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:49.950> does<00:00:50.370> not

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the bottom now this actually does not

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.459 
the bottom now this actually does not
have<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> cutout<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> power<00:00:51.780> button<00:00:52.050> or

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
have a cutout for the power button or

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.290 
have a cutout for the power button or
doesn't<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> volume<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
doesn't have one for the volume up and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.910 
doesn't have one for the volume up and
down<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.110> alright<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:55.530> this

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
down but that's alright because this

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
down but that's alright because this
does<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.760> distort<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.050> buttons<00:00:58.440> us

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
does not actually distort the buttons us

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.420 
does not actually distort the buttons us
at<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> next<00:01:00.870> case<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
at all so the next case I have is this

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.149 
at all so the next case I have is this
case<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.170> bumper<00:01:04.650> which

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
case right here it's a bumper which

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.010 
case right here it's a bumper which
actually<00:01:05.400> comes<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.540> screen<00:01:06.689> protector

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
actually comes with a screen protector

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually comes with a screen protector
when<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> order<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> basically<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
when you order it and basically all of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
when you order it and basically all of
this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.619> standard<00:01:11.040> bumper<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.640> your

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
this is just a standard bumper for your

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
this is just a standard bumper for your
phone<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.450> only<00:01:12.990> protects<00:01:13.470> around<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> edges

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
phone it only protects around the edges

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.520 
phone it only protects around the edges
and<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.729> course<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:15.360> gives<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.900> nice<00:01:16.080> lip

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and of course it also gives a nice lip

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.350 
and of course it also gives a nice lip
right<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.430> drop<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> won't

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
right here so if you drop it it won't

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.690 
right here so if you drop it it won't
crack<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> screen<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.830> also<00:01:20.009> has<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
crack the screen it also has all the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789 
crack the screen it also has all the
cutouts<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.240> everything<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:21.960> well<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
cutouts for everything as well like the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.370 
cutouts for everything as well like the
last<00:01:23.009> case<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:24.299> does<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> cutoff

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
last case this does not have the cutoff

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.990 
last case this does not have the cutoff
and<00:01:25.560> volume<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.250> down<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.790> power

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and volume up and down and the power

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.670 
and volume up and down and the power
like<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> other<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:27.930> does<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.619> said

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
like the other one does but like I said

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.760 
like the other one does but like I said
it<00:01:29.159> does<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.610> distort<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.390> power<00:01:30.990> button<00:01:31.380> at

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it does not distort the power button at

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
it does not distort the power button at
all<00:01:32.689> this<00:01:34.220> comes<00:01:35.220> only<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.790> black<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.479> believe

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
all this comes only in black I believe

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
all this comes only in black I believe
and<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> last<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.890> actually<00:01:38.070> comes<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.820> black

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and the last one actually comes in black

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.630 
and the last one actually comes in black
white<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.409> pink<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.400> if<00:01:41.460> you're

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
white and in pink so if you're

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
white and in pink so if you're
interested<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.180> getting<00:01:42.329> those<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:43.020> any<00:01:43.229> other

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
side next case I have is their most

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.229 
side next case I have is their most
rugged<00:03:18.540> case<00:03:19.019> it's<00:03:19.470> very<00:03:20.400> durable<00:03:20.820> and

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
rugged case it's very durable and

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.729 
rugged case it's very durable and
protected<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.230> snaps<00:03:22.950> right<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:25.560> is

actually<00:03:25.920> my<00:03:26.340> favorite<00:03:26.580> case<00:03:27.030> because<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.540> has

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
actually my favorite case because it has

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.100 
actually my favorite case because it has
a<00:03:28.170> built-in<00:03:28.739> spins<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:32.510> allows<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.840> for

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
a built-in spins to it allows you for

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.860 
a built-in spins to it allows you for
that<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.920> also<00:03:35.190> very<00:03:35.580> durable<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.720> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
that it's also very durable but it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.960 
that it's also very durable but it
doesn't<00:03:37.140> give<00:03:37.260> much<00:03:37.560> wit<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.370> phone<00:03:38.670> so

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
doesn't give much wit to the phone so

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.970 
doesn't give much wit to the phone so
it's<00:03:39.120> very<00:03:39.330> protective<00:03:40.110> but<00:03:40.470> doesn't<00:03:40.830> make

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
it's very protective but doesn't make

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.310 
it's very protective but doesn't make
you<00:03:41.100> phone<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.340> little<00:03:41.610> bulky<00:03:41.820> at<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:43.170> has

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320
