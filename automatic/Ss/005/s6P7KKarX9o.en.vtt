00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.410 
but you know we obviously made some
mistakes<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.830> no<00:01:33.830> not<00:01:34.580> just<00:01:34.760> defensively<00:01:35.240> but

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
mistakes and no not just defensively but

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.480 
mistakes and no not just defensively but
also<00:01:35.570> offensively<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.380> not<00:01:36.500> converting<00:01:36.920> more

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
also offensively and not converting more

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.330 
also offensively and not converting more
chances<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.000> take<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.050> game<00:01:39.200> away<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:39.500> you

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
chances to take the game away so you

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.980 
chances to take the game away so you
know<00:01:40.460> we'll<00:01:40.850> go<00:01:41.000> back<00:01:41.180> we're<00:01:41.630> going<00:01:41.750> back<00:01:41.960> to

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
know we'll go back we're going back to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.760 
know we'll go back we're going back to
to<00:01:42.500> practice<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.910> know<00:01:44.000> hopefully<00:01:44.770> keep

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
to practice and you know hopefully keep

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.590 
to practice and you know hopefully keep
improving<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.220> watch<00:01:46.370> video<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.030> now<00:01:47.570> I

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
improving and watch video and now I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.940 
improving and watch video and now I
thought<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.900> was<00:01:47.990> still<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.260> good<00:01:48.320> game<00:01:48.590> well

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
thought it was still a good game well

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.990 
thought it was still a good game well
obviously<00:01:49.100> we<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.400> things<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.640> work<00:01:49.670> on<00:01:49.940> but

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
obviously we have things to work on but

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.670 
obviously we have things to work on but
you<00:01:50.420> know<00:01:50.479> always<00:01:51.020> disappointed<00:01:51.500> with<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
you know always disappointed with the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.370 
you know always disappointed with the
tie<00:01:51.830> not<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.160> wimp<00:01:52.479> there's<00:01:53.479> been<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.960> few<00:01:54.110> goals

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
tie not a wimp there's been a few goals

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.999 
tie not a wimp there's been a few goals
consider<00:01:54.800> now<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.040> last<00:01:55.520> q<00:01:55.910> games<00:01:56.979> after<00:01:57.979> a

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
consider now the last q games after a

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.240 
consider now the last q games after a
very<00:01:58.400> stable<00:01:58.850> defending<00:01:59.450> why<00:02:00.140> is<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.290> you

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
very stable defending why is that you

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.969 
very stable defending why is that you
know<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.610> think<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:04.030> don't<00:02:05.030> know<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.150> think<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:06.259> lot

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
know I think I don't know I think a lot

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.790 
know I think I don't know I think a lot
of<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:07.729> know<00:02:07.899> maybe<00:02:08.899> us<00:02:09.110> being<00:02:09.410> smarter

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
of it you know maybe us being smarter

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.620 
of it you know maybe us being smarter
we've<00:02:10.580> been<00:02:10.670> talking<00:02:11.030> about<00:02:11.060> defensive

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
we've been talking about defensive

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.110 
we've been talking about defensive
transition<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:12.170> lot<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:13.400> think<00:02:13.520> that's<00:02:13.880> a

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
transition a lot and I think that's a

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.790 
transition a lot and I think that's a
lot<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.630> tutor<00:02:15.020> are<00:02:15.290> really

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
lot of tutor are really

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.380 
lot of tutor are really
counter-attacking<00:02:16.400> against<00:02:16.850> us<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.300> have

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
counter-attacking against us and we have

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.720 
counter-attacking against us and we have
to<00:02:17.510> be<00:02:17.630> maybe<00:02:18.230> smarter<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.950> aspect<00:02:19.340> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
to be maybe smarter in that aspect and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.810 
to be maybe smarter in that aspect and
in<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:21.500> stopping<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.070> before<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.489> happens

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
in in stopping that before it happens

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.690 
in in stopping that before it happens
and<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.019> know<00:02:24.280> obviously<00:02:25.280> we're

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
and so but you know obviously we're

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.970 
and so but you know obviously we're
gonna<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.660> know<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:26.930> i<00:02:27.019> said<00:02:27.230> before<00:02:27.350> you
