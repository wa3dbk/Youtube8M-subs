00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.960
 you can see here all the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.020
 ingredients so you will need to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.940

 will be much easier for you 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:54.220
 we start by preheating his oven to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.560
 180 Â° is that we then give up a glass 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.870
 graduated to get 10 centilitres of 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.870
 the east that we pour into a saucepan 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.890
 using a scale we add the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.479
 150 grams that we obviously put in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.479
 the pan to melt it 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.390
 comes the moment to melt the 200 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.000
 g of carambar so 25 pieces as I 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:29.670
 you said that we add to our 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.159
 mixture of milk and butter is left 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.250
 simmer everything while stirring 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.070
 time meanwhile we are preparing the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.520
 dough in a big salad bowl imitating 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:51.350
 the 75 g of flour the 150 g of sugar 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:54.350
 the 75 g of cornflour and the 3rd one is mixed 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.350
 vigorously 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.250
 and we will slowly add 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.590
 therefore the mixture of butter and milk 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.590
 carambars once it's melted 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.080
 once everything is mixed on 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.450
 gets a nice caramel color paste 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.280
 smooth and without lumps especially 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.049
 be careful with this little detail 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.299
 the muffins are much better for 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.829
 cooking these delicious muffins 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.079
 we're going to need muffin cups 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.560
 and two little crates is always a 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.540
 man son 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.440
 everything comes from the shops centers 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.180
 agreement for me once the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.940
 boxes arranged in the molds 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.230
 we pour our paw to the brim 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.230
 but not too much 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.660
 the biggest fan of my cooking is 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.990
 Of course, a blankie that delights to lick the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.910
 bottom of the salad bowl without abusing of course 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.010
 and go for cooking 20 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.530
 baked minutes be careful not to you 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.150
 burn now we pass the recipe for 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.850
 drink a smoothie with red berries 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.760
 so we need some fruit 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.160
 red and yoghurt ice cream as well as a 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.810

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.500
 the front this if you choose the option 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.450

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.180
 red fruits in the blender as well as 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.600
 about 3 tablespoons yoghurt 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.700
 finally frozen yogurt that are the 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.560

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.540
