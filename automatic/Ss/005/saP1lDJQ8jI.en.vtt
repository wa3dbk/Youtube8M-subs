the multiplayer snipers that would be in

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
the multiplayer snipers that would be in
call<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> duty<00:01:18.390> ghosts<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.439> weapon<00:01:19.860> was

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
call of duty ghosts so this weapon was

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.580 
call of duty ghosts so this weapon was
designed<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.759> hungary<00:01:21.240> by<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> manufacturers

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
designed in hungary by the manufacturers

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
designed in hungary by the manufacturers
siro<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.670> about<00:01:23.939> 112<00:01:24.810> centimetres

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
siro now it is about 112 centimetres

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.060 
siro now it is about 112 centimetres
long<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.740> weighs<00:01:26.810> 11.5<00:01:27.810> kilograms<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
long and weighs 11.5 kilograms it's a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.010 
long and weighs 11.5 kilograms it's a
semi-automatic<00:01:29.759> weapon<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> rate<00:01:30.720> fire

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
semi-automatic weapon and the rate fire

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
semi-automatic weapon and the rate fire
is<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.159> documented<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
is not actually very well documented and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.880 
is not actually very well documented and
so<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> wasn't<00:01:33.960> able<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.200> find<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.740> this

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
so I wasn't able to find out what this

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
so I wasn't able to find out what this
snipers<00:01:35.430> rate<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.820> fire<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> matter

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
snipers rate of fire is and as a matter

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
snipers rate of fire is and as a matter
of<00:01:37.079> fact<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.530> does<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.159> sniper<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
of fact it does look like this sniper is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.359 
of fact it does look like this sniper is
pretty<00:01:39.390> much<00:01:39.509> unknown<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.979> internet<00:01:41.340> even

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
pretty much unknown on the internet even

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.370 
pretty much unknown on the internet even
and<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> me<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.509> says<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.990> infinity

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and so to me that says that infinity

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.080 
and so to me that says that infinity
would<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> lot<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> creative<00:01:44.399> license

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
would have got a lot of creative license

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.350 
would have got a lot of creative license
to<00:01:45.780> change<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> modify<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.829> sniper<00:01:47.280> quite<00:01:47.970> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
to change and modify the sniper quite to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
to change and modify the sniper quite to
their<00:01:48.540> specific<00:01:48.899> needs<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.649> standards<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
their specific needs and standards to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.249 
their specific needs and standards to
fill<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> gaps<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> other<00:01:52.049> three

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
fill the gaps that the other three

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.260 
fill the gaps that the other three
snipers<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:53.399> however<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.090> mag

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
snipers don't take up however the mag

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.929 
snipers don't take up however the mag
size<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.020> weapon<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.710> five<00:01:56.310> rounds<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
size of this weapon is five rounds and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.030 
size of this weapon is five rounds and
due<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.479> specific<00:01:57.990> design<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> weapon

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
due to the specific design of the weapon

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.889 
due to the specific design of the weapon
it's<00:01:59.399> been<00:01:59.610> built<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.750> really

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
it's been built to have really really

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.359 
it's been built to have really really
low<00:02:01.170> recoil<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> things

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
low recoil that is one of the things

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.889 
low recoil that is one of the things
that<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> actually<00:02:02.820> champions<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.780> has

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
that it actually champions that it has

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.080 
that it actually champions that it has
one<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> lowest<00:02:04.350> ricos<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.250> sniper<00:02:05.640> so

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
one of the lowest ricos of a sniper so

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.039 
one of the lowest ricos of a sniper so
if<00:02:06.149> we're<00:02:06.329> looking<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.689> something<00:02:06.840> like

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
if we're looking for something like

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
if we're looking for something like
special<00:02:07.560> features<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.280> gun<00:02:08.489> might

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
special features that this gun might

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.130 
special features that this gun might
have<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.970> would<00:02:09.149> definitely<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> has

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
have it would definitely be that it has

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
have it would definitely be that it has
low<00:02:10.410> recoil<00:02:10.709> now<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.730> an<00:02:11.849> extremely

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
low recoil now this is an extremely

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.610 
low recoil now this is an extremely
powerful<00:02:12.629> weapon<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
powerful weapon and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.559 
powerful weapon and
it's<00:02:13.830> not<00:02:14.040> known<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.280> its<00:02:14.610> amazing<00:02:15.180> accuracy

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
it's not known for its amazing accuracy

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.009 
it's not known for its amazing accuracy
it<00:02:16.080> will<00:02:16.349> shoot<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:17.030> 1600<00:02:18.030> meters<00:02:18.480> which<00:02:18.900> is

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
it will shoot up to 1600 meters which is

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.600 
it will shoot up to 1600 meters which is
plenty<00:02:19.230> big<00:02:19.440> enough<00:02:19.590> i'm<00:02:19.950> guessing<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:20.459> any

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
plenty big enough i'm guessing for any

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.759 
plenty big enough i'm guessing for any
call<00:02:20.909> of<00:02:21.000> duty<00:02:21.269> mapping<00:02:21.720> call<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.080> duty<00:02:22.290> ghosts

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
call of duty mapping call of duty ghosts

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.140 
call of duty mapping call of duty ghosts
so<00:02:23.069> that's<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.489> we<00:02:23.670> know<00:02:23.790> about<00:02:23.909> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
so that's all that we know about the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.789 
so that's all that we know about the
link<00:02:24.390> sniper<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.019> i've<00:02:25.140> said<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.560> quite

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
link sniper and as i've said it is quite

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.190 
link sniper and as i've said it is quite
a<00:02:25.830> shy<00:02:26.159> animal<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.090> way<00:02:27.299> we<00:02:27.629> haven't<00:02:27.870> seen<00:02:28.080> much

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
a shy animal so way we haven't seen much

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.539 
a shy animal so way we haven't seen much
of<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.709> internet<00:02:29.010> don't<00:02:29.220> know<00:02:29.340> really

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
of it on the internet don't know really

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.580 
of it on the internet don't know really
much<00:02:29.790> about<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.360> at<00:02:30.450> all<00:02:30.629> may<00:02:31.110> giving<00:02:31.379> finney
