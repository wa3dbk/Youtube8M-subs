actually<00:03:55.780> thinking<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.500> can<00:03:56.709> put<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:56.980> deadline

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
actually thinking I can put the deadline

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.210 
actually thinking I can put the deadline
up<00:03:57.790> until<00:03:58.239> something<00:03:58.930> like<00:03:58.959> July<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.739> Turkish

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
up until something like July the Turkish

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.370 
up until something like July the Turkish
that's<00:04:00.489> actually<00:04:00.850> my<00:04:01.120> birthday<00:04:01.180> july<00:04:01.870> tertius

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
but if the deadline was delighted I

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.600 
but if the deadline was delighted I
wouldn't<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.019> stopped<00:04:05.290> see<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:06.190> give<00:04:06.430> out<00:04:06.580> a
