00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.500
 good to everyone I'm anna martinelli in 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.890
 twitter and nothing here I have finished 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.910
 bring 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.510
 The Samsung Galaxy S 5 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.730
 good the box 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.460
 I think it keeps the patterns the pattern 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 of this imitation of wood similar to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.990
 the previous the s4 and other products and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.439
 nothing come to boxing this time has 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.600
 liked the seals worth in case 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.600
 the other time a little 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.320
 until the telefonito 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.240
 and we are going to remove the plastics 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.820
 well my first impression is that it is 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.469
 pretty light to see the battery is missing 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.769
 but our attention on the 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.769
 terminal that for me is quite large 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.280
 good as you see is white you tried 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.950
 zoom in so you can see the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 This pattern of deposits 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.740
 holes 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.350
 it sensors cameras loudspeaker 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.369
 famous tapita 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.369
 I do not think it is like that 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.980
 someone 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980
 buttons 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.659
 headphone jack from above 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.060
 do not 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.290
 and let's see what else he brings here 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.570
 the little books that we never read 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:57.510
 and also headphones with heads 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.510
 of changeable the charger 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.040
 mother 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.259
 a little bit like that on white paper 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.070
 the power cord and effectively 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.070
 what is the battery 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.610
 that now right away then open the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.430
 phone would arrange me to mount it already 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.769
 start it 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.810
 and nothing then as we go 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.959
 trying them we will be counting our 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.500
 prints of the screen and everything 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.810
 the rest 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.220
 Stay tuned because we will be publishing 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.490
 little things either in post mode or in 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.930
 some other video is worth it and nothing because we 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.930
 See you later
