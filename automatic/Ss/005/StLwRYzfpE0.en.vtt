00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.860
 D major is a triad chord formed by 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.300
 the fundamental major third and fifth 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.450
 fair 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.700
 to build the agreed we will place 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.670
 index finger on third string second 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.580
 fret note the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.320
 finger heart on first rope second 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.260
 fret note do sharp 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.300
 and ring finger on second string third 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.090
 fret note re 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.650
 the fourth string is played the air is not 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.440
 re is the fundamental bass of the chord 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.270
 the fifth and sixth string should not 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.730
 touch 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.160
 in a frontal view we see as the finger 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.070
 thumb peeks slightly on the part 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.710
 upper back of the mast in this 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.620
 Agreed to avoid low positions of the thumb 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.100
 that will raise your wrist and generate you 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.100
 instability 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.590
 also pay attention so that the 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.470
 thumb do not take a position too 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.780
 elevated in any case will be the size of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.590
 your hand that leads you to find the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.590
 more natural position 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.000
 in a back view we see a 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.910
 comparative finger placement 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 thumb in the minor chords of 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.320
 seventh and re 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 re minor 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.010
 re 7a 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.940
 re 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.940
 re 7a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.220
 re 7a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.220
 re minor 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.490
 re 7a 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.340
 re 7a 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.880
 re 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.780
 re 7a 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.780
 re minor 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.909
 practice construction several times 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.040
 of the chord and soon the hand will build 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.960
 the footprint in block before stepping 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.960
 remember to step on and relax 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.410
 he plays the arpeggio three times 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.660
 raised in the video with the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.990
 fingerings that we propose you the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.860
 first index and middle ring thumb 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.740
 half index and finally strum the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.220
 second thumb index medium 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.220
 annular mean index 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.380
 one 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.670
 i 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.140
