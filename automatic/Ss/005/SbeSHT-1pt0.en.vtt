about that a little bit later you I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950 
about that a little bit later you I
could<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> worry<00:01:35.369> about<00:01:35.520> your

could have to worry about your

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.470 
could have to worry about your
about<00:01:37.650> your<00:01:37.860> head<00:01:38.340> being<00:01:38.580> squeezed<00:01:39.060> or

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
about your head being squeezed or

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.020 
about your head being squeezed or
whatever<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.440> that<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.220> where<00:01:41.670> I'm<00:01:41.760> pointing

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
whatever and that is where I'm pointing

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.210 
whatever and that is where I'm pointing
that<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.050> puts<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.800> is<00:01:43.980> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
that is where it puts and that is the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.850 
that is where it puts and that is the
microphone<00:01:44.850> right<00:01:45.210> there<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:52.140> basically<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
microphone right there so basically the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.560 
microphone right there so basically the
charge<00:01:53.160> it's<00:01:53.430> very<00:01:53.640> simple<00:01:54.120> you<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.240> take

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
charge it's very simple you just take

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.360 
charge it's very simple you just take
that<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.900> thing<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:56.130> hard

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
that little thing out is a little hard

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.660 
that little thing out is a little hard
to<00:01:56.640> take<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.910> out<00:01:57.270> once<00:01:58.230> it's<00:01:58.440> in<00:01:58.590> there<00:01:58.830> but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
to take that out once it's in there but

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.750 
to take that out once it's in there but
once<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.330> get<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.600> fingernail<00:02:01.080> in<00:02:01.320> there

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
once you get your fingernail in there

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.400 
once you get your fingernail in there
you're<00:02:02.760> able<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.030> take<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> mini<00:02:03.630> USB<00:02:03.840> that's

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
you're able to take the mini USB that's

and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.179> think<00:02:09.959> within<00:02:10.140> two<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.470> three<00:02:10.619> hours<00:02:10.830> I

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and I think within two or three hours I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.060 
and I think within two or three hours I
know<00:02:12.240> as<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:13.200> were<00:02:13.320> all<00:02:13.470> right

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
know as they were all right

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.980 
know as they were all right
it<00:02:14.220> could<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> little<00:02:14.760> less<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:15.660> all

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
it could be a little less but that's all

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.320 
it could be a little less but that's all
it<00:02:16.290> took<00:02:16.440> me<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.880> figure<00:02:17.880> out<00:02:18.090> they<00:02:18.270> were

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
it took me to figure out they were

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.380 
it took me to figure out they were
charged<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.920> basically<00:02:20.550> compared<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.240> my

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
