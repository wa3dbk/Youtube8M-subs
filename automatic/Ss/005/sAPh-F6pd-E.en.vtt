00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it'll be really quick and easy because

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
it'll be really quick and easy because
I'm<00:00:34.140> only<00:00:34.290> bringing<00:00:34.530> carry-on<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.610> me

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I'm only bringing carry-on with me

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.150 
I'm only bringing carry-on with me
because<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.020> said<00:00:37.079> only<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> week<00:00:37.950> long

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
because like I said only for a week long

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.540 
because like I said only for a week long
and<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.390> across<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.079> border<00:00:40.520> so<00:00:41.520> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and it's just across the border so I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.770 
and it's just across the border so I
don't<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> worry<00:00:42.719> about

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
don't really have to worry about

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
bringing too much stuff with me because

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.700 
bringing too much stuff with me because

Blazers when I'm packing my blazer I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.910

like to turn it inside out because I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.380

find that that prevents it from
wrinkling<00:02:47.690> too<00:02:48.110> much<00:02:48.319> while<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:48.799> in<00:02:48.980> my
