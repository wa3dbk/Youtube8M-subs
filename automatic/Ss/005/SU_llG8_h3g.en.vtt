00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
lesions removed units or do you just

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.340 
lesions removed units or do you just
list<00:00:37.710> each<00:00:38.070> lesion<00:00:39.030> separately<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> 59

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

modifier<00:00:40.590> I've<00:00:41.040> seen<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> both<00:00:41.579> ways<00:00:41.850> I'm

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
modifier I've seen it both ways I'm

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.869 
modifier I've seen it both ways I'm
thinking<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.620> using<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.040> units<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.520> not<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
thinking of using the units and not the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.860 
thinking of using the units and not the
modifier<00:00:45.300> ok<00:00:45.510> let<00:00:45.690> me<00:00:45.719> turn<00:00:46.050> there<00:00:46.379> 1<00:00:46.620> 7<00:00:47.870> okay

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
modifier ok let me turn there 1 7 okay

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.790 
modifier ok let me turn there 1 7 okay
so<00:00:49.820> here<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.300> where<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> bubbling<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so here we see where the bubbling and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.110 
so here we see where the bubbling and
highlighting<00:00:52.890> helps<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> have

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
highlighting helps and what I have

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
highlighting helps and what I have
highlighted<00:00:54.329> after<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> semicolon<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.469> first

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
highlighted after the semicolon is first

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.490 
highlighted after the semicolon is first
lesion<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> indented<00:00:58.050> code<00:00:58.260> says

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
lesion and then the indented code says

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.849 
lesion and then the indented code says
second<00:00:58.920> through<00:00:59.160> 14<00:00:59.730> okay<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
second through 14 okay and because it

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.710 
second through 14 okay and because it
uses<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.430> word<00:01:02.460> each<00:01:03.860> if<00:01:05.240> you<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.479> let's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
uses the word each if you have let's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.490 
uses the word each if you have let's
just<00:01:06.960> say<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.380> example<00:01:07.490> 12<00:01:08.490> lesions<00:01:08.970> total<00:01:09.659> 1

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
just say for example 12 lesions total 1

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.219 
just say for example 12 lesions total 1
700<00:01:11.070> o<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.479> you'll<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
700 o will be what you'll use for the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.100 
700 o will be what you'll use for the
first<00:01:13.409> lesion<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.700> 1<00:01:14.939> 700<00:01:15.420> 3<00:01:15.930> you'll

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
first lesion and then 1 700 3 you'll

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.030 
first lesion and then 1 700 3 you'll
report<00:01:16.560> times<00:01:17.040> 11<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.780> come<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
report times 11 to come up with the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.499 
report times 11 to come up with the
individual<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:20.850> how<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.060> would<00:01:21.299> do

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
individual and so that's how I would do

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.910 
individual and so that's how I would do
it<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.630> put<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.840> 11<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.810> column<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.710> far

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it I put it 11 in that column now as far

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
it I put it 11 in that column now as far
as<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.220> 59<00:01:26.790> goes<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:30.450> would<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> pair

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
as the 59 goes that would be a pair

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.910 
as the 59 goes that would be a pair
preference<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.490> guess<00:01:36.710> because<00:01:37.710> you're<00:01:37.829> going

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
preference I guess because you're going

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.530 
preference I guess because you're going
to<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.100> them<00:01:38.189> listed<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.670> unit<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
to have them listed as unit so if you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.020 
to have them listed as unit so if you
just<00:01:39.720> had<00:01:39.900> 2<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.159> one<00:01:41.400> unit<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> 1

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
just had 2 and you have one unit of 1

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.520 
just had 2 and you have one unit of 1
700<00:01:42.479> oh<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.350> unit<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.759> 1<00:01:44.759> 700<00:01:45.210> 3<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.990> don't

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
700 oh and one unit of 1 700 3 I don't

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.710 
700 oh and one unit of 1 700 3 I don't
think<00:01:46.590> 59<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.579> apply<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.479> it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
think 59 would really apply because it's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.590 
think 59 would really apply because it's
an<00:01:48.810> add-on<00:01:49.049> code<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.180> unless<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
an add-on code so you know unless the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.090 
an add-on code so you know unless the
payer<00:01:51.810> has<00:01:51.930> specifically<00:01:52.439> told<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
payer has specifically told you to do a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.460 
payer has specifically told you to do a
different<00:01:53.700> way<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.119> don't<00:01:54.540> think<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:55.079> it's

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
different way I don't think it's it's

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.440 
different way I don't think it's it's
necessary<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:58.340> that's

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
necessary you know to do that but that's

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.760 
necessary you know to do that but that's
you<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.570> I'm<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> coding<00:02:01.200> world<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you know I'm in the coding world not the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310 
you know I'm in the coding world not the
billing<00:02:02.070> world<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.360> mileage<00:02:03.630> might<00:02:04.290> vary

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
billing world so your mileage might vary

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.490

there<00:02:05.329> you<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.509> anyone<00:02:06.689> has<00:02:07.259> any<00:02:07.409> other

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
chat box and the board exam
I<00:02:13.590> doubt<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> Jews<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.340> 59<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.330> case<00:02:15.569> oh

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I doubt the Jews of 59 in that case oh

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.309 
I doubt the Jews of 59 in that case oh
and<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.770> asked<00:02:17.040> about<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.340> Oh<00:02:17.370> Oh<00:02:17.459> for<00:02:18.319> that

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
and you asked about the Oh Oh for that

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.240 
and you asked about the Oh Oh for that
is<00:02:19.680> when<00:02:20.130> once<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.700> hit<00:02:21.090> 15<00:02:21.780> or<00:02:21.959> more<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:23.099> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
is when once you hit 15 or more then you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.440 
is when once you hit 15 or more then you
