 see from the studios creation last 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.360
 shutter all this on this date so we 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
 starts right away by the first 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.690
 is the first you can imagine 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.070
 do not change a team that wins or 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.750
 habits and actually the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.670
 creation of the studio at the origin of the game 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.830
 which surprises the famous studio dice 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.420
 digital illusions creative entertainment 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.099

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 belonging to electronic arts this created in 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.059
 1992 he moved to the world is 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.730
 developed by taking out his first game 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.170
 young man a bourgeois and this good ok 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.610
 it's not so sometimes they are but at 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.660
 this time do you doubt that he 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.379
 were not there yet games like the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.239
 witcher 3 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.730
 from thread to needle wauwil to expression 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.530
 god the studio continued to produce 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.030
 games such as sports games 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.500
 adaptations of animation films or 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.170
 still course games until you get there 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.750
 finally to the holy grail battlefield 1940 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.340
 not being released in 1942 but in 2002 this 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.660
 first person shooter more 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.370
 commonly called in life jargon 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.899
 rugby caf ps takes place in a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.580
 marine world of the second war 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.350
 world history to compete well 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.240
 the call of duty saga 4 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.799
 apart from the south - the first call of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.280
 the releases in years later at the time 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.260
 for me 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.960
 precursor of arcade style fps but 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.729
 realistic battlefield 1942 before all summer 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 designed for multiplayer ship to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.210
 board of tank planes aircraft 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.040
 allies or axes to find the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.450
 heart of a faithful representation of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.909
 some battles of the second war 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.549
 worldly which brings us to the opposite 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.079
 who is battlefield 2142 this battle son 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.780
 unknown to the general public did indeed 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.229
 existed on pc battlefield 2142 too 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.549
 called bs 2142 at most rarely btf 2142 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.350
 thank you to the teams for all it's 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.730
 surely there is a fps like 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.980
 always put our places in gives 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.200
 of the 22nd century during a new era 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.430
 cooler or oloffson to notebooks on 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.510
 wants to relocate a little bit in the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.220
 scenario of the game after more than one 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.300
 hundred years of debate and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.160
 disagreement about global warming 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.450
 climate governments of the world 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.610
 hard to admit the truth 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.690
 a new ice age arrived here 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.220
 it's still the height that the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.260
 global warming causes a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.150
 new glacial era brief release on the 20th 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.010

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.530
 whoever reported the worst grade with 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.810

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.760

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.440
 the mini series most appreciated by 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.030
 young battlefield bad company fans 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.980
 neglected on pc because yes it is not 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.450
 released on pc he went to do you 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.330
 cook a fried egg but pulled out all 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.890
 even on xbox 360 and playstation 3 on the 26th 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.300
 June 2008 this battlefield puts us in 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.040
 the skin of a hot- headed team 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.690
 service of our beautiful homeland but 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.970
 especially for gold bullion at the end 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.740
 issue a rather the money the homeland 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.330
 so we find our good old 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.790
 group leader sergeant redford 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.160
 other sweetwater technicians and our 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.810
 explosives expert on call but that 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.520
 beautiful nostalgia hiding something 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.770
 even bigger the graphical engine 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.930

 the new frostbite graphics engine 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.300
 adds a lot of new stuff to the 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.160
 youth series at the management level 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.570
 of sound everything is much better you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.959
 sound an explosion in front of you 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.610

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.600
 good you can finally destroy the walls 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.860
 buildings a destructible universe 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.570

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.870
 repetitive we start to know the 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.370
 song is fine there I will not you 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.380
 talk about battlefield bad company 2 but 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.420
 rather the battlefield bad company dlc 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.550
 This is Vietnam, which is for the 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.480
 blow a bridel it's mostly deadlines 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.830
 it was possible to see during the 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.750
 years in the fps such as call of 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.640
 duty or another how much offers you 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.160
 almost a new game because yes for 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.690
 once the whole world of the game changes on 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.520
 goes from a modern war to a war 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.470
 from vietnam with over an hour and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.820
 some Chinese rock music 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.960
 guy says fewer species comments 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.030
 even though I'm not the only one to 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.590
 overkilled this dlc we will spend on 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.820
 battlefield 3 and 4 I think you 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.200
 know pretty well this game for 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.520
 add a new layer and 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.710
 now what interests us is 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.300
 especially the last part of battlefield 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.280
 because you must know but this one 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.740
 is not realized by intel bat him 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.240
 the armed an exit on March 19, 2015 has 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.220
 changed the saga face with a 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.540
 thematic of police versus thief a 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.990
 cool wind that really makes 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.120
 pleasure 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.310
 developed by visceral games which already has 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.100
 to his painting the saga dead space the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.660
 simpson the game the saga 007 or the 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.729
 lord of the rings this studio is attacking 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.470
 with big especially with the exit 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.390
 next from star wars battlefront because 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.960
 that yes screw ermine help at the level of 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.700
 development 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.320
 this studio starts seriously windy 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.540
 the ups and downs and the risks of doing 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.280
 a lot of noise in the years 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.290
 keep it short you'll understand it beat it 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.330
 the son is not 4 I would put games 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.740
 in every way saga and that's how 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.210
 ends the epic but I still have 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.800
 still a question to ask yourself 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.730
 who do you think that dolls of 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.380
