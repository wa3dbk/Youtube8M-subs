00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.819 
know what it is but getting back to the
point<00:02:00.229> either<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:02.299> technology<00:02:03.109> exists

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
point either the the technology exists

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.760 
point either the the technology exists
which<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.159> believe<00:02:04.959> or<00:02:05.959> they<00:02:06.259> would<00:02:06.409> give<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.590> to

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
which I believe or they would give it to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.369 
which I believe or they would give it to
us<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.159> we<00:02:07.490> treat<00:02:08.000> them<00:02:08.179> like<00:02:08.379> family

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
us if we treat them like family

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.130 
us if we treat them like family
neighbors<00:02:10.180> and<00:02:11.180> collaborators<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.080> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
neighbors and collaborators and the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.680 
neighbors and collaborators and the
cosmos<00:02:12.650> instead<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.310> as<00:02:13.730> enemies<00:02:14.299> that<00:02:14.510> they

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
cosmos instead of as enemies that they

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.190 
cosmos instead of as enemies that they
were<00:02:14.829> originally<00:02:15.829> designated<00:02:16.569> then<00:02:17.569> I

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
were originally designated then I

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.380 
were originally designated then I
there's<00:02:19.130> no<00:02:19.280> doubt<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.849> we<00:02:19.970> could<00:02:20.150> change

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
there's no doubt that we could change

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.870 
there's no doubt that we could change
the<00:02:20.630> system<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.049> 10<00:02:21.230> years<00:02:21.500> which<00:02:22.459> is<00:02:22.640> about

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
the system in 10 years which is about

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.809 
the system in 10 years which is about
what<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.599> do<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.530> we<00:02:25.430> change<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
what we have to do if we change the

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.240 
what we have to do if we change the
banking<00:02:26.120> system<00:02:26.480> too<00:02:26.829> so<00:02:27.829> we've<00:02:27.980> got<00:02:28.129> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
banking system too so we've got the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.599 
banking system too so we've got the
money<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.549> order<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.970> be<00:02:29.090> able<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.299> do<00:02:29.450> it
