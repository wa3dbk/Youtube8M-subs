00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.510
 hello welcome to techno ivÃ¡n today we are going 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.600
 to make a debate about is better a 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.519
 wired mouse or wireless mouse 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.019
 wireless is a mouse that communicates 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.570
 with the chip is that we're seeing 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.030
 here everything was plugged into the computer 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.329
 and it's what the mouse waves waves without 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.309
 need to carry cables and something in the 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.489
 another side we have the typical mouse of 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.089
 all life with cable that plugs 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.460
 also in the usb port you think it's 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.130
 best wireless with cable my opinion 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.860
 personal is if you have a laptop and what 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.190
 you get enough from home is more practical 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.960
 buy the the wireless because what 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.260
 you can use anywhere 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.610
 that's also the bad thing about the wireless 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.450
 is that you have to be changing the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.330
 batteries in nothing I think every month or two 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.490
 months depends on how you use it later 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.310
 if you have a fixed computer at home it is 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.250
 better that you use a mouse with cable already 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.880
 that you have to change the batteries and nothing and 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.259
 if it's still better for the tower 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.570
 Of course there are also people who in a 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.000
 tower also prefers the wireless or 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.070
 upside down 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.480
 my personal opinion I have already said that 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.490
 it's wireless laptop and tower 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.670
 wired the pros and cons of 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.830
 wireless pros that you can like 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.890
 we have said take anywhere without 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.630
 no hassle and cons we have 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.010
 to be changing the batteries every time 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.810
 I know how much later in monkey this one would not have 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.270
 in theory no cons 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.910
 that's why it's still clear if you want to have a 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.250
 study table or something more ordered and not 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.470
 you want me to have wires it 's better the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.010
 wireless but let's go if it's a 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.160
 desktop a fixed will not matter to have a 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.250
 mouse keyboard cable the theme of 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.720
 brands good wireless brands 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.620
 I recommend you remove it 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.360
 hp I have a wireless hp mouse that 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.410
 it's pretty good in the piles already 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.770
 last a moment that usually last a month 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.750
 and half the batteries to the hp but it's also 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.750
 very good brand for mice 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.819
 the wireless ferris wheel would do the same 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.459
 any brand because it does not require 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.150
 so many requirements that we are seeing the 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:03.139
 image is a lenovo that is little seen not 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.319
 there are usually many lenovo mice but 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:09.730
 it would be the same a crazy guy left a hp 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.500
 any brand worth enough 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.620
 well, this has been today's video 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.000
 put me in the comments if you prefer 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.650
 the wireless or the cable and 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.650
 nothing we see in the next video
