00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
that these body scanners are too

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.350 
that these body scanners are too
invasive<00:01:57.070> there's<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.130> lack<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.369> privacy<00:01:58.759> and

what's<00:02:02.960> your<00:02:03.170> reaction<00:02:03.909> well<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:04.939> think<00:02:05.360> that

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
what's your reaction well I think that

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.740 
what's your reaction well I think that
we<00:02:06.229> should<00:02:06.259> indeed<00:02:06.830> be<00:02:07.220> very<00:02:07.700> vigilant<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
we should indeed be very vigilant in

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.670 
we should indeed be very vigilant in

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.490 
relation to such technology and I should
make<00:02:12.829> a<00:02:12.859> nuance<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.239> did<00:02:14.419> not<00:02:14.569> approve

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.490 
this and what did you see that you liked
that<00:02:49.370> didn't<00:02:50.000> give<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.209> much<00:02:50.540> concern<00:02:51.170> about

that didn't give you much concern about

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.790 
that didn't give you much concern about
the<00:02:52.100> privacy<00:02:52.520> issue<00:02:52.820> I<00:02:53.380> wouldn't<00:02:54.380> use<00:02:54.590> the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
the privacy issue I wouldn't use the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.580 
the privacy issue I wouldn't use the
word<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:55.190> at<00:02:55.520> all<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:56.120> think<00:02:56.630> we<00:02:57.110> would<00:02:57.530> all

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590

word like at all I think we would all
agree<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:58.430> it's<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.090> very<00:02:59.330> sad<00:02:59.630> state<00:03:00.080> of

agree that it's a very sad state of

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.310 
agree that it's a very sad state of
affairs<00:03:03.459> we<00:03:04.459> have<00:03:04.760> challenged<00:03:05.450> katse<00:03:06.080> in

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
affairs we have challenged katse in

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.990 
affairs we have challenged katse in

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
must be met to ensure privacy the first

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.040 
must be met to ensure privacy the first
one<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.140> we've<00:03:15.470> asked<00:03:15.920> them<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:17.090> make<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.810> case

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
one is we've asked them to make the case

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.800 
one is we've asked them to make the case
for<00:03:18.350> why<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.800> is<00:03:19.190> necessary<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:20.090> they<00:03:20.570> did

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
for why this is necessary and they did

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.039 
for why this is necessary and they did
put<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.350> us<00:03:21.380> at<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.340> analysis<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:23.360> they<00:03:23.870> had

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
put to us at the analysis that they had

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.009 
put to us at the analysis that they had
done<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.739> basis<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.450> intelligence<00:03:26.450> that

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
done on the basis of intelligence that

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.940 
done on the basis of intelligence that
led<00:03:27.080> them<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:28.480> conclusion<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:29.959> there<00:03:30.739> was

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
led them to conclusion that there was

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.210 
led them to conclusion that there was
indeed<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.430> threat<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.180> nonmetallic

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
indeed a threat of nonmetallic

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.770 
indeed a threat of nonmetallic
explosives<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.850> could<00:03:35.060> be<00:03:35.180> detected<00:03:35.330> by

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
explosives that could be detected by

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.229 
explosives that could be detected by
this<00:03:35.959> technology<00:03:36.610> secondly<00:03:37.610> we've<00:03:37.880> asked

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
this technology secondly we've asked

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.130 
this technology secondly we've asked
them<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.510> ensure<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:40.250> measure<00:03:41.030> would<00:03:41.900> be

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
them to ensure that the measure would be

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.979 
them to ensure that the measure would be
strictly<00:03:42.739> proportionate<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.390> security

strictly proportionate to the security

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.710 
strictly proportionate to the security
need<00:03:45.290> hence<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.820> fact<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.299> it<00:03:47.690> is

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
need hence the fact that it is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.920 
need hence the fact that it is
exclusively<00:03:48.410> for<00:03:48.980> secondary<00:03:49.579> search<00:03:50.090> we've

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
exclusively for secondary search we've

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.740 
exclusively for secondary search we've
also<00:03:51.170> asked<00:03:51.980> them<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.579> assure<00:03:53.120> say<00:03:53.450> would<00:03:53.720> be

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
also asked them to assure say would be

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.140 
also asked them to assure say would be
effective<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.769> they<00:03:54.799> did<00:03:55.130> show<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.579> us<00:03:55.850> how

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
effective and they did show to us how

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.690 
effective and they did show to us how
the<00:03:56.209> machines<00:03:56.780> can<00:03:57.140> detect<00:03:57.590> explosive<00:03:58.579> that
