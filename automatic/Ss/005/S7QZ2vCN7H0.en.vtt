you just took so here you go your

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.310 
you just took so here you go your
measurements<00:00:13.059> and<00:00:13.240> here<00:00:13.780> you've<00:00:13.959> got<00:00:14.139> your

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
measurements and here you've got your

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.260 
measurements and here you've got your
east<00:00:14.500> column<00:00:14.980> and<00:00:15.160> we're<00:00:15.460> going<00:00:15.669> to<00:00:15.759> add<00:00:15.910> in

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
east column and we're going to add in

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.510 
east column and we're going to add in
the<00:00:16.390> ease<00:00:16.660> that<00:00:16.990> we<00:00:17.770> need<00:00:17.950> for<00:00:18.130> you<00:00:18.250> for<00:00:18.460> the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
the ease that we need for you for the

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.370 
the ease that we need for you for the
pattern<00:00:18.880> for<00:00:19.300> this<00:00:19.450> one<00:00:19.599> I'm<00:00:19.689> using<00:00:19.869> half<00:00:20.200> an

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
pattern for this one I'm using half an

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.519 
pattern for this one I'm using half an
inch<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.579> bust<00:00:22.060> and<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.390> waist<00:00:22.689> I'm<00:00:23.349> not

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
inch for the bust and the waist I'm not

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.529 
inch for the bust and the waist I'm not
adding<00:00:23.680> any<00:00:23.949> measure<00:00:24.250> any<00:00:24.580> ease<00:00:24.849> whatsoever

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
adding any measure any ease whatsoever

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.740 
adding any measure any ease whatsoever
to<00:00:25.810> need<00:00:25.990> the<00:00:26.140> vertical<00:00:26.590> measurements<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:28.689> I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
to need the vertical measurements then I

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.169 
to need the vertical measurements then I
add<00:00:28.929> the<00:00:29.170> measurement<00:00:29.679> plus<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.220> ease<00:00:30.400> gives

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
add the measurement plus the ease gives

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.049 
add the measurement plus the ease gives
me<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.420> total<00:00:31.599> that<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.470> divide<00:00:32.860> by<00:00:33.190> any<00:00:33.760> number

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
me the total that I divide by any number

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.479 
me the total that I divide by any number
that's<00:00:34.570> in<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.750> /<00:00:35.110> column<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:36.160> I<00:00:36.250> get<00:00:36.400> the

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
that's in the / column and I get the

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.210 
that's in the / column and I get the
final<00:00:36.850> measurement<00:00:37.150> so<00:00:37.809> you'll<00:00:38.710> notice<00:00:39.010> that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
final measurement so you'll notice that

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.660 
final measurement so you'll notice that
none<00:00:39.699> of<00:00:39.729> the<00:00:40.000> vertical<00:00:40.449> measurements<00:00:40.960> get

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
none of the vertical measurements get

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.759 
none of the vertical measurements get
divided<00:00:42.670> those<00:00:43.269> are<00:00:43.540> all<00:00:43.659> whole<00:00:44.199> measurements

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
divided those are all whole measurements

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.259 
divided those are all whole measurements
but<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.040> horizontal<00:00:45.369> one<00:00:45.790> because<00:00:46.059> they<00:00:46.150> go

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
but the horizontal one because they go

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.060 
but the horizontal one because they go
all<00:00:46.479> the<00:00:46.600> way<00:00:46.629> around<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.080> body<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.830> need<00:00:47.949> to

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
all the way around the body you need to

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.829 
all the way around the body you need to
be<00:00:48.159> divided<00:00:48.580> by<00:00:48.699> four<00:00:49.089> if<00:00:49.360> they're<00:00:49.510> like<00:00:49.629> the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
be divided by four if they're like the

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.619 
be divided by four if they're like the
bust<00:00:50.409> and<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:50.769> waist<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.369> hips<00:00:51.610> but<00:00:52.449> for

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
bust and the waist and the hips but for

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.500 
bust and the waist and the hips but for
shoulders<00:00:53.019> only<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.409> divide<00:00:53.680> by<00:00:53.830> half<00:00:54.010> we're

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
shoulders only we divide by half we're

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.020 
shoulders only we divide by half we're
creating<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.750> one<00:00:56.049> quarter<00:00:56.619> of<00:00:56.799> a<00:00:56.949> pattern<00:00:57.339> so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
creating a one quarter of a pattern so

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.969 
creating a one quarter of a pattern so
this<00:00:58.360> is<00:00:58.510> what<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:58.780> finished<00:00:59.290> house<00:00:59.470> will

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
this is what the finished house will

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.520 
this is what the finished house will
look<00:01:00.010> like<00:01:00.479> you'll<00:01:01.479> see<00:01:01.510> here's<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.170> front

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
look like you'll see here's the front

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.899 
look like you'll see here's the front
we're<00:01:03.100> creating<00:01:03.489> 1/4<00:01:04.239> 1/2<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.199> front<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
we're creating 1/4 1/2 of the front and

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.090 
we're creating 1/4 1/2 of the front and
then<00:01:07.090> we're<00:01:07.270> creating<00:01:07.720> 1/2<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.530> back<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
then we're creating 1/2 of the back so

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.639 
then we're creating 1/2 of the back so
to<00:01:12.460> do<00:01:13.000> pattern<00:01:13.299> drafting<00:01:13.780> what<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:14.289> use<00:01:14.469> some

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
to do pattern drafting what you use some

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.029 
to do pattern drafting what you use some
