so<00:00:15.680> titanium<00:00:16.680> chronograph<00:00:17.130> that's<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.430> name

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
so titanium chronograph that's the name

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.880 
so titanium chronograph that's the name
of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.730> watch<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.420> titanium<00:00:19.020> chronograph<00:00:19.529> I

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
of the watch the titanium chronograph I

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.679 
of the watch the titanium chronograph I
guess<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.789> means<00:00:20.910> they're<00:00:21.119> not<00:00:21.150> allowed<00:00:21.539> to

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
guess that means they're not allowed to

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.130 
guess that means they're not allowed to
release<00:00:21.960> any<00:00:22.289> other<00:00:22.619> titanium<00:00:23.279> chronographs

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
release any other titanium chronographs

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.200 
release any other titanium chronographs
without<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> risk<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.560> having<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.099> a

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
without the risk of having to have a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.849 
without the risk of having to have a
confusion<00:00:27.210> among<00:00:27.930> their<00:00:28.109> consumer<00:00:28.470> base<00:00:28.500> of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
confusion among their consumer base of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.880 
confusion among their consumer base of
which<00:00:29.340> titanium<00:00:29.939> chronograph<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.480> mean

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
which titanium chronograph do you mean

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.319 
which titanium chronograph do you mean
but<00:00:31.890> aside<00:00:32.399> from<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.759> sort<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.059> merely

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
but aside from the sort of merely

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479 
but aside from the sort of merely
descriptive<00:00:33.750> name<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.440> really<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.340> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
descriptive name I really like this

i've<00:00:39.450> personally<00:00:40.110> reviewed<00:00:40.710> myself<00:00:41.270> it's<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
i've personally reviewed myself it's a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.869 
i've personally reviewed myself it's a
smaller<00:00:42.960> German<00:00:43.440> brand<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.280> tends<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.730> focus

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
smaller German brand that tends to focus

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
on I would call them higher value pieces

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.610 
on I would call them higher value pieces
meaning<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.239> expensive<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.410> less

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
meaning not expensive but but less

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.840 
meaning not expensive but but less
expensive<00:00:49.649> watches<00:00:50.280> where<00:00:50.610> they're<00:00:50.760> trying

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.189 
they sort of play with some core iconic
designs<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.120> mix<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
designs kind of mix it up a little bit I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.260 
designs kind of mix it up a little bit I
wouldn't<00:00:58.710> say<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> they're<00:00:59.370> their<00:00:59.789> pieces

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
wouldn't say that they're their pieces

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.630 
wouldn't say that they're their pieces
are<00:01:00.600> extremely<00:01:01.020> original<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.520> they

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
are extremely original but what they

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
are extremely original but what they
lack<00:01:02.670> perhaps<00:01:03.329> some<00:01:03.449> originality<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.290> think

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
lack perhaps some originality I think

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.990 
lack perhaps some originality I think
they<00:01:04.769> make<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> lot<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.580> sort<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> like

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
they make up for a lot and sort of like

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
they make up for a lot and sort of like
value<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> price<00:01:06.570> ratio<00:01:07.220> good<00:01:08.220> detail<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
let's put it on you can see that this is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.890 
let's put it on you can see that this is
sort<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> larger<00:01:24.299> side<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
sort of on the larger side of the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.770 
sort of on the larger side of the
spectrum<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.729> wear<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> like

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to sort of thick leather strap here I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
to sort of thick leather strap here I
like<00:01:30.780> how<00:01:31.170> its<00:01:31.350> tapered<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
like how its tapered I like that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.359 
like how its tapered I like that
titanium<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.540> buckle<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.250> that's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
titanium a buckle so there it is that's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
titanium a buckle so there it is that's
it<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> wrist<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.210> titanium<00:01:36.750> chronograph

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
it on the wrist the titanium chronograph

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.319 
it on the wrist the titanium chronograph
there's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> few<00:01:37.560> versions<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:39.180> one

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
there's a few versions of it this one

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
there's a few versions of it this one
has<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.079> guess<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.560> titanium<00:01:41.009> colored

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520

if you look at the bezel it's clearly

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.380 
if you look at the bezel it's clearly

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and then they branched out a little bit

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.270 
and then they branched out a little bit
as<00:03:40.650> well<00:03:41.660> like<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.780> said<00:03:42.840> for<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.350> money<00:03:43.620> which

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280
