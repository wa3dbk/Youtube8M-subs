masking<00:02:29.930> job<00:02:30.200> but<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.380> doesn't<00:02:30.860> matter<00:02:30.980> this

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
masking job but that doesn't matter this

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.630 
masking job but that doesn't matter this
is<00:02:31.489> actually<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.780> bottom<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.800> tank<00:02:34.100> what

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
is actually the bottom of the tank what

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.490 
is actually the bottom of the tank what
I've<00:02:34.730> done<00:02:34.970> here<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.420> turn<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.930> tank<00:02:36.170> over

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
I've done here is turn the tank over

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.699 
I've done here is turn the tank over
this<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.670> open<00:02:38.150> top<00:02:38.570> I'm<00:02:38.930> looking<00:02:39.410> into

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
this is the open top I'm looking into

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.819 
this is the open top I'm looking into
that<00:02:40.070> now<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:40.940> I've<00:02:41.390> got<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.870> facing<00:02:42.500> down

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
that now and I've got that facing down

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.949 
that now and I've got that facing down
and<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.190> reason<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.610> when<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.820> do<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.390> painting

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
and the reason is when I do the painting

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.729 
and the reason is when I do the painting
back<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.890> forth<00:02:46.160> with<00:02:46.519> my<00:02:46.810> krylon<00:02:47.810> blue<00:02:48.320> I

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
back and forth with my krylon blue I

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.350 
back and forth with my krylon blue I
don't<00:02:49.310> want<00:02:49.519> any<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.860> aerosol<00:02:51.860> paint<00:02:52.820> to

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
don't want any of the aerosol paint to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.470 
don't want any of the aerosol paint to
get<00:02:53.540> into<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.890> tank<00:02:55.220> itself<00:02:55.670> because<00:02:56.360> it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
get into the tank itself because it

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.150 
get into the tank itself because it
might<00:02:56.630> stick<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.200> sides<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.680> obscure<00:02:58.130> the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
might stick to the sides and obscure the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.789 
might stick to the sides and obscure the
view<00:02:58.540> essentially<00:02:59.540> we<00:02:59.810> want<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.140> do<00:03:00.320> just<00:03:00.620> this

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
view essentially we want to do just this

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.090 
view essentially we want to do just this
one<00:03:01.360> panel<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:02.989> will<00:03:03.200> be<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.500> back<00:03:03.739> of<00:03:03.980> the

to start off farther away until you get

to start off farther away until you get
the<00:03:54.420> hang<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.260> you're<00:03:55.379> going<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.560> have

to make many many passes back and forth

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.300 
to make many many passes back and forth
20<00:03:59.069> 30<00:03:59.610> 40<00:04:00.209> passes<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.959> lot<00:04:01.349> of<00:04:01.410> passes<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.069> in

20 30 40 passes a lot of passes and in

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.280 
20 30 40 passes a lot of passes and in
the<00:04:02.400> end<00:04:02.580> you'll<00:04:02.790> have<00:04:03.030> what<00:04:03.810> amounts<00:04:04.260> to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the end you'll have what amounts to

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.030 
the end you'll have what amounts to
several<00:04:05.010> coats<00:04:05.569> three<00:04:06.569> four<00:04:06.870> five<00:04:07.140> six<00:04:07.590> coats

several coats three four five six coats

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.820 
several coats three four five six coats
and<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.430> can<00:04:08.580> even<00:04:08.730> let<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.630> dry<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.080> little<00:04:10.560> bit

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
and you can even let it dry a little bit

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.430 
and you can even let it dry a little bit
between<00:04:11.190> coats<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:12.540> have<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.840> be<00:04:12.959> patient

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
between coats you have to be patient

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.900 
between coats you have to be patient
when<00:04:13.530> you're<00:04:13.590> doing<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.069> but<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.400> whole<00:04:14.550> job

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
when you're doing this but the whole job

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.900 
when you're doing this but the whole job
I<00:04:15.269> mean<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.870> won't<00:04:15.959> take<00:04:16.260> more<00:04:16.530> than<00:04:16.739> 10<00:04:17.430> or<00:04:17.549> 15

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
I mean it won't take more than 10 or 15

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.199 
I mean it won't take more than 10 or 15
minutes<00:04:18.359> including<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:20.400> work<00:04:20.880> with<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
minutes including the the work with the

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.450 
minutes including the the work with the
newspaper<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.169> very<00:04:22.380> easy<00:04:22.680> step<00:04:22.889> and

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
newspaper so it's a very easy step and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.550 
newspaper so it's a very easy step and
we'll<00:04:24.150> leave<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.930> figure<00:04:25.080> out<00:04:25.350> how

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
we'll leave it to you to figure out how

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.920 
we'll leave it to you to figure out how
to<00:04:25.590> do<00:04:25.889> that<00:04:26.160> if<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.700> worst<00:04:26.880> happens<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.810> it

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
to do that if the worst happens and it

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.640 
to do that if the worst happens and it
it<00:04:28.500> runs<00:04:28.889> it's<00:04:29.430> not<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.850> end<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.240> world<00:04:30.650> it

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
it runs it's not the end of the world it

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.250 
it runs it's not the end of the world it
just<00:04:31.710> looks<00:04:32.220> better<00:04:32.400> if<00:04:32.669> it's<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:33.000> nice<00:04:33.260> smooth

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
just looks better if it's a nice smooth

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.980 
just looks better if it's a nice smooth
uniform<00:04:34.830> painted<00:04:35.669> surface<00:04:36.150> when<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.510> finish

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
uniform painted surface when you finish

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.370 
uniform painted surface when you finish
and<00:04:37.229> what<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.800> can<00:04:37.950> also<00:04:38.100> do<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:39.169> if<00:04:40.169> you're

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
and what you can also do is if you're

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.200 
and what you can also do is if you're
not<00:04:40.410> sure<00:04:40.860> if<00:04:41.010> it's<00:04:41.160> working<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.790> can<00:04:41.970> turn

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
not sure if it's working you can turn

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.600 
not sure if it's working you can turn
the<00:04:42.510> tank<00:04:42.840> around<00:04:43.590> like<00:04:43.889> this<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.280> sort<00:04:44.520> of

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
the tank around like this and sort of

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.409 
the tank around like this and sort of
look<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.020> see<00:04:46.650> if<00:04:47.310> there's<00:04:47.639> any<00:04:47.910> light

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
look in and see if there's any light

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.520 
look in and see if there's any light
spots<00:04:48.900> showing<00:04:49.440> through<00:04:50.210> your<00:04:51.210> painted<00:04:52.139> panel

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
spots showing through your painted panel

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.719 
spots showing through your painted panel
and<00:04:52.650> that<00:04:52.770> will<00:04:52.919> tell<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.400> you<00:04:53.520> need

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
and that will tell you that you need

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.379 
and that will tell you that you need
more<00:04:54.360> pink<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.710> think<00:04:55.919> we're<00:04:56.070> just<00:04:56.100> about

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
more pink and I think we're just about

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.010 
more pink and I think we're just about
covered<00:04:57.389> that<00:04:57.919> topic<00:04:59.389> about<00:05:00.389> as<00:05:00.510> much<00:05:00.720> as<00:05:00.870> we

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
covered that topic about as much as we

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.500 
covered that topic about as much as we
need<00:05:01.229> to<00:05:01.289> so<00:05:01.710> go<00:05:02.400> ahead<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.700> assuming<00:05:03.419> you

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
need to so go ahead and assuming you

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.029 
need to so go ahead and assuming you
have<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.870> components<00:05:04.440> go<00:05:04.470> ahead<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:04.860> paint

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
have the components go ahead and paint

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.640 
have the components go ahead and paint
the<00:05:05.220> back<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.550> your<00:05:05.669> tank<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.539> let<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.080> dry

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
the back of your tank and let it dry

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.370 
the back of your tank and let it dry
overnight<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:09.330> next<00:05:09.600> step<00:05:09.810> after<00:05:10.110> that

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
overnight and the next step after that

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.100 
overnight and the next step after that
is<00:05:11.010> putting<00:05:11.789> in<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.150> sand<00:05:12.479> bed<00:05:12.780> and

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
is putting in the sand bed and

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.040 
is putting in the sand bed and
assembling<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.460> reef<00:05:14.700> structure<00:05:15.330> once<00:05:15.780> those

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
assembling the reef structure once those

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.550 
assembling the reef structure once those
are<00:05:16.080> in<00:05:16.410> we<00:05:17.100> can<00:05:17.340> get<00:05:17.520> back<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.000> our<00:05:18.560> instant

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
are in we can get back to our instant

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.680 
are in we can get back to our instant
ocean<00:05:19.889> we<00:05:20.130> can<00:05:20.310> mix<00:05:20.550> up<00:05:20.700> our<00:05:20.910> instant<00:05:21.389> ocean

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
ocean we can mix up our instant ocean

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.039 
ocean we can mix up our instant ocean
and<00:05:21.840> add<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:23.479> seawater<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.800> tank
