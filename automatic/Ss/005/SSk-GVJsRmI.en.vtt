 how can I make it up to you 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.260
 it's like the head on the table and says things without meaning 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
 the pandorines 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.860

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.790

 I don't know if it happens to you too 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.709
 but I often wonder what drives people to exchange information 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.579
 how come you say this need to return an object to another person 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.939
 perhaps because feelings are not visible 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.379
 from me 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.360

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.329
 what you can 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.599

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.479
 who can say a revelation. reaction film looks inside you 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.139

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.139
