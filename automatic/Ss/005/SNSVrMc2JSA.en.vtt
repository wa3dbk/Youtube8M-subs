gloves and at the start I thought there

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.449 
gloves and at the start I thought there
was<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> bad<00:02:45.780> idea<00:02:45.810> because<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.860> tried<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.220> clench

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
was a bad idea because I tried to clench

my fist and punch away a few shots
however<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.769> finger<00:02:50.400> saves<00:02:50.610> were<00:02:50.760> really<00:02:51.330> very

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
however a finger saves were really very

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.660 
however a finger saves were really very
rigid<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.500> prevented<00:02:53.069> me<00:02:53.220> from<00:02:53.250> clenching

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
rigid and it prevented me from clenching

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.570 
rigid and it prevented me from clenching
my<00:02:53.819> fists<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:55.050> start<00:02:55.379> however<00:02:56.220> after

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
my fists and the start however after

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.030 
my fists and the start however after
just<00:02:57.209> one<00:02:57.510> or<00:02:57.659> two<00:02:57.690> with<00:02:58.050> trainings<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.860> one

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
just one or two with trainings and one

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.399 
just one or two with trainings and one
or<00:02:59.129> two<00:02:59.220> days<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.430> usage<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.989> realize

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
or two days of usage you you realize

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.960 
or two days of usage you you realize
that<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.860> thing<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.159> say<00:03:02.280> start<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.640> get<00:03:02.790> more

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
that the thing to say start to get more

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.119 
that the thing to say start to get more
flexible<00:03:03.510> forward<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.800> clench<00:03:05.069> your

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.559 
really enjoy these pair of gloves
because<00:03:29.069> it<00:03:29.340> makes<00:03:29.519> me<00:03:29.670> stand<00:03:29.940> out<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.330> pitch

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
because it makes me stand out on a pitch

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.050 
because it makes me stand out on a pitch
you<00:03:30.870> don't<00:03:31.110> really<00:03:31.920> see<00:03:32.099> people<00:03:32.129> having<00:03:32.760> these

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
you don't really see people having these

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.520 
you don't really see people having these
lot<00:03:33.299> of<00:03:33.390> prints<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.900> their<00:03:34.080> gloves<00:03:34.349> and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
lot of prints on their gloves and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.050 
lot of prints on their gloves and
therefore<00:03:35.159> it<00:03:35.250> makes<00:03:35.400> me<00:03:35.580> feel<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:36.000> of

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
therefore it makes me feel kind of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.470 
therefore it makes me feel kind of
unique<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.659> that<00:03:36.690> sense<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.090> my<00:03:39.209> first

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
unique in that sense this is my first

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.180 
unique in that sense this is my first
time<00:03:39.659> using<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.140> row<00:03:40.349> finger<00:03:40.680> cut<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.040> was

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
time using a row finger cut it was

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.250 
time using a row finger cut it was
really<00:03:41.610> an<00:03:41.700> eye-opening<00:03:42.269> experience<00:03:42.299> for<00:03:42.930> me

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
really an eye-opening experience for me

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.399 
really an eye-opening experience for me
and<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.330> say<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.810> was<00:03:45.930> an<00:03:46.080> amazing

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
and I have to say that it was an amazing

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.280 
and I have to say that it was an amazing
experience<00:03:46.709> in<00:03:47.250> its<00:03:47.400> sense<00:03:47.640> I've<00:03:48.450> usually<00:03:48.989> use

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
experience in its sense I've usually use

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.890 
experience in its sense I've usually use
negative<00:03:49.590> cut<00:03:50.010> gloves<00:03:50.340> or<00:03:50.549> flat<00:03:51.330> gloves

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
negative cut gloves or flat gloves

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.500 
negative cut gloves or flat gloves
however<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.739> wrong<00:03:52.950> finger<00:03:53.159> cut<00:03:53.459> has<00:03:53.730> kind<00:03:54.390> of

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
however the wrong finger cut has kind of

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.119 
however the wrong finger cut has kind of
been<00:03:54.689> my<00:03:54.900> new<00:03:55.140> favorite<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:55.890> sense

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
been my new favorite in that sense

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.539 
been my new favorite in that sense
because<00:03:56.909> of<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.360> amount<00:03:57.629> later<00:03:57.989> x<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.980> on

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
because of the amount later x that is on

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.300 
because of the amount later x that is on
the<00:03:59.700> ball<00:03:59.909> you<00:04:00.330> can<00:04:00.510> really<00:04:00.689> feel<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.439> maximum

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
the ball you can really feel the maximum

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.580 
the ball you can really feel the maximum
contact<00:04:02.939> between<00:04:03.239> your<00:04:03.780> gloves<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.409> ball

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
contact between your gloves and the ball

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.920 
contact between your gloves and the ball
and<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.159> makes<00:04:05.430> shot<00:04:05.730> stopping<00:04:06.120> much<00:04:06.330> easier

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
and this makes shot stopping much easier

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.570 
and this makes shot stopping much easier
this<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.650> coupled<00:04:08.069> with<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.340> four

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
this is coupled with the four

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.729 
this is coupled with the four
millimeters<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.239> supreme<00:04:09.840> grip<00:04:10.110> latex<00:04:10.530> which

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
millimeters of supreme grip latex which

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.250 
millimeters of supreme grip latex which
is<00:04:10.890> really<00:04:11.280> supreme<00:04:12.239> in<00:04:12.450> its<00:04:12.629> grip<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.989> lives

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
is really supreme in its grip it lives

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.619 
is really supreme in its grip it lives
up<00:04:13.439> to<00:04:13.500> its<00:04:13.769> name<00:04:13.890> as<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.819> can<00:04:14.970> see<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.180> really

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
up to its name as you can see I really

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.050 
up to its name as you can see I really
make<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.139> best<00:04:16.440> saves<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:16.949> my<00:04:17.489> goalkeeping

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060

career and
really<00:04:19.659> find<00:04:19.900> myself<00:04:20.169> catching<00:04:20.470> more<00:04:20.859> balls

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
really find myself catching more balls

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:31.999 
really find myself catching more balls
rather<00:04:21.609> than<00:04:21.729> paring<00:04:22.300> them

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:54.750 

I<00:04:33.889> think<00:04:34.889> okay

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.090
