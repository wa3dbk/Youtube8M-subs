00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 "Cancer as an Autoimmune Disease" 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.050
 When people receive a transplanted organ, such as a heart or kidney, 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.960
 they must be given immunosuppressive drugs, 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.660
 to avoid rejecting the new body. 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.880
 What do you think will happen to the rate of occurrence 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.790
 cancers in people who have artificially suppressed immunity? 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.820
 In some cancers, such as skin cancer, 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.970
 risk increases. 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.470
 This supports the so-called immune surveillance hypothesis, 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.480
 the idea that our immune system serves 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.420
 as a natural defense system for cancer control. 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.260
 This could explain why our immune system is getting older 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.719
 while our cancer risk increases. 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.750
 Here is a video showing the immune system in action. 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.280
 The large oval cell in the middle is the cervical cancer cell. 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.019
 The small round cells are our T-cells supplying the "poison pill," 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.159
 triggers the self-destructive mechanism of cancer cells. 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.620
 And then we can say goodbye to cancer. 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.590
 It is apoptosis, or programmed cell death, 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.000
 which I talk about very often in my videos. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.690
 Note that the so-called renaissance of the cancer surveillance hypothesis 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.190
 more than ten years ago. 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.720
 The problem with this theory is that for some cancers 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.850
 on the contrary, the risk of immunosuppression decreases. 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.590
 Your kidney cancer risk may increase after kidney transplantation 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.080
 but your risk of breast cancer will decrease. 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.430
 Also, the risk of rectal cancer falls. 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.240
 Why should immunosuppressed people have less cancer? 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.290
 This has led to the emergence of a new theory, the downside of the theory of immune surveillance 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.740
 over cancer. It is worth the idea that in a sense it can 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.870
 "Cancer is considered an autoimmune disease." 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.580
 You know, the only reason the immune system is at all capable 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.160
 recognize cancer cells from healthy cells 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.170
 is that tumors are manifested by foreign-looking antigens 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.769
 (immunostimulatory molecules). 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.530
 Why do tumors do that? 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.320
 Why would cancer cells draw attention to each other, waving a red flag 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.120
 and basically lured their enemies? 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.230
 We think it's because cancer tends to flourish 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.290
 in an environment with low inflammation. 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.580
 There are many examples of chronic inflammation leading to cancer, 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.750
 for example, ulcerative colitis leading to colon cancer, 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.330
 chronic inflammation of the pancreas leading to pancreatic cancer 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.450
 chronic liver inflammation leading to liver cancer 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.450
 and inflammation of the stomach leading to stomach cancer. 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.640
 Often, inflammation, a reaction of the immune system, may 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.770
 to serve cancer. 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.470
 By stimulating the immune response, cancer produces its own inflammation, 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.330
 which can stimulate angiogenesis 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.210
 to increase the blood supply to the tumor, which accelerates its growth. 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.470
 So the curve can look like this. 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.520
 Low levels of inflammation stimulate cancer growth. 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.550
 However, if the immune system reaches full strength, 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.570
 on the contrary, it can destroy the tumor and slow its growth. 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.600
 This may explain the secrets surrounding Kaposi's sarcoma, 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.530
 cancer affecting people with AIDS. 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.870
 When you start treating AIDS and the immune system begins to recover, 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.170
 You can actually see an increase in cancer incidence. 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.390
 So what are the nutritional consequences of this new autoimmune theory of cancer? 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.969
 We'll know next time, don't miss it.
