00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
down to business or I don't think

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.490 
down to business or I don't think
anything<00:01:39.620> to<00:01:39.740> change<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.700> regards<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:44.500> speed

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
anything to change in regards to speed

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.650 
anything to change in regards to speed
for<00:01:45.620> Johnny<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:45.950> seeing<00:01:46.160> their<00:01:46.370> work<00:01:47.300> is<00:01:47.450> hard

for<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.230> team<00:01:48.380> as<00:01:48.500> possible<00:01:48.710> I<00:01:49.040> think<00:01:49.690> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
for the team as possible I think the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.030 
for the team as possible I think the
interesting<00:01:50.930> thing<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.560> you're<00:01:51.680> both<00:01:51.860> in

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
that like that same position you're both

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.870 
that like that same position you're both
in<00:01:53.690> you<00:01:53.900> know<00:01:53.990> you're<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:54.590> as<00:01:54.710> LOX<00:01:55.010> I<00:01:55.220> mean<00:01:55.340> how

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
in you know you're in as LOX I mean how

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.580 
in you know you're in as LOX I mean how
this<00:01:56.060> lack<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.540> relationship<00:01:57.080> manifest

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
this lack in the relationship manifest

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.410 
this lack in the relationship manifest
itself<00:01:57.920> when<00:01:58.130> when<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.910> training<00:01:59.240> pitch

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
Washington he can tell the physicality

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.050 
Washington he can tell the physicality
and<00:03:12.050> when<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:12.950> games<00:03:13.190> have<00:03:13.340> Africa<00:03:13.730> skal<00:03:13.910> and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
and when that games have Africa skal and
