00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
understand about them is they're a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.310 
understand about them is they're a
little<00:00:54.149> different<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> regular<00:00:54.750> round

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
little different than a regular round

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.750 
little different than a regular round
brush<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.010> boar<00:00:56.250> bristle<00:00:56.579> brushes

before you probably know what I'm
talking<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> thing<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.270> about

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
talking about but the thing I like about

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.880 
talking about but the thing I like about
is<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> hundred<00:01:01.050> percent<00:01:01.140> boar<00:01:01.500> bristle

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
is it's a hundred percent boar bristle

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.740 
is it's a hundred percent boar bristle
takes<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> static<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> hair<00:01:03.539> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
takes a static right out of the hair and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.660 
takes a static right out of the hair and
it<00:01:04.110> grips<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> hair<00:01:04.890> more<00:01:05.189> than<00:01:05.400> you've<00:01:05.519> ever

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
