nike we call it drag on 2x it's an
evolution<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> where<00:01:18.299> we've<00:01:18.450> been<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
evolution of where we've been in the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
evolution of where we've been in the
past<00:01:18.869> where<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.280> red<00:01:20.460> that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
past where you see actually the red that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.520 
past where you see actually the red that
we<00:01:20.670> popped<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.270> color<00:01:21.780> pop<00:01:21.990> down<00:01:22.170> over<00:01:22.380> here

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
we popped out color pop down over here

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
we popped out color pop down over here
that's<00:01:23.009> actually<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.460> more<00:01:23.670> harder<00:01:24.090> durometer

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that's actually a more harder durometer

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.410 
that's actually a more harder durometer
urethane<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.979> provides<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.610> durability<00:01:27.060> for

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
urethane so provides more durability for

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
urethane so provides more durability for
these<00:01:27.540> specific<00:01:27.990> drag<00:01:28.259> areas<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.189> shoe<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
these specific drag areas in the shoe so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
these specific drag areas in the shoe so
we<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.299> protect<00:01:30.509> Rafa's<00:01:31.439> foot<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
we can really protect Rafa's foot and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.890 
we can really protect Rafa's foot and
make<00:01:32.400> sure<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> protected<00:01:33.450> over<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
make sure that is protected over the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
breathability for rafa and then the big

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.730

while<00:02:52.360> he's<00:02:52.480> playing<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.980> may<00:02:54.190> notice<00:02:54.580> here

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
while he's playing you may notice here

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.390 
while he's playing you may notice here
some<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.600> mesh<00:02:55.990> engineered<00:02:56.650> pattern<00:02:57.160> in

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
some of this mesh engineered pattern in

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.860 
some of this mesh engineered pattern in
the<00:02:57.430> background<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.210> surface<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
the background in the surface of the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.140 
the background in the surface of the
fabric<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.950> everywhere<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> see<00:03:01.000> this

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
fabric so everywhere that you see this

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.780 
fabric so everywhere that you see this
mesh<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:02.200> actually<00:03:02.650> taking<00:03:03.220> weight<00:03:03.460> out<00:03:03.730> of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
mesh is actually taking weight out of

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.310 
mesh is actually taking weight out of
the<00:03:04.060> garment<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.570> creating<00:03:05.200> more

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
the garment and creating more

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.770 
the garment and creating more
breathability<00:03:05.800> for<00:03:06.220> office<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:06.850> essentially

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
breathability for office so essentially

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.670 
breathability for office so essentially
it's<00:03:07.930> all<00:03:08.110> over<00:03:08.410> ventilation<00:03:09.330> 360-degree

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
it's all over ventilation 360-degree

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.200 
it's all over ventilation 360-degree
rafa<00:03:11.680> short<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> great<00:03:12.610> story<00:03:13.000> of

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
rafa short is a great story of

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
important element is the fabric so the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.900 
important element is the fabric so the

get<00:03:43.990> you'll<00:03:44.530> see<00:03:44.740> that<00:03:44.890> this<00:03:45.040> front<00:03:45.400> closure

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
get you'll see that this front closure

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.930 
get you'll see that this front closure
wraps<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:47.200> little<00:03:47.710> bit<00:03:47.830> over<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> side<00:03:48.670> and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
wraps a little bit over to the side and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.110 
wraps a little bit over to the side and
it's<00:03:49.510> very<00:03:49.840> low<00:03:50.080> profile<00:03:50.590> we<00:03:51.400> have<00:03:51.550> a<00:03:51.580> Velcro

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
it's very low profile we have a Velcro

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.270 
it's very low profile we have a Velcro
closure<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.840> then<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.350> hook<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.800> bar<00:03:53.950> for

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
closure and then a hook and bar for

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.550 
closure and then a hook and bar for
extra<00:03:54.670> security<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.480> then<00:03:55.960> looking<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.410> the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
extra security and then looking to the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.710 
extra security and then looking to the
back<00:03:56.800> we've<00:03:57.490> really<00:03:57.850> built<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.240> some<00:03:58.510> nice

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
back we've really built in some nice

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.280 
back we've really built in some nice
elements<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.770> as<00:04:00.180> low<00:04:01.180> profile<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.020> again

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
elements and as low profile and again

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.590 
elements and as low profile and again
zero<00:04:02.620> distraction<00:04:03.280> as<00:04:03.400> possible<00:04:04.030> we've

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
zero distraction as possible we've

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.780 
zero distraction as possible we've
bonded<00:04:04.900> three<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.680> critical<00:04:06.160> seams<00:04:06.490> on

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
bonded three of the critical seams on

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.280 
bonded three of the critical seams on
the<00:04:06.940> scar

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
the scar

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.770 
the scar
and<00:04:07.439> so<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.010> side<00:04:08.280> seams<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> back<00:04:09.390> yoke

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
and so the side seams in the back yoke

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.259 
and so the side seams in the back yoke
and<00:04:10.019> what<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.920> has<00:04:11.099> intended<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.730> do<00:04:11.909> is<00:04:12.120> to

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
and what this has intended to do is to

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.270 
and what this has intended to do is to
almost<00:04:12.629> create<00:04:13.049> an<00:04:13.140> invisible<00:04:13.469> mark<00:04:14.010> where

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
almost create an invisible mark where

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.279 
almost create an invisible mark where
there<00:04:14.430> would<00:04:14.519> normally<00:04:14.969> be<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.359> thread<00:04:16.079> and

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
there would normally be a thread and

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.710 
there would normally be a thread and
stitching<00:04:16.979> marks<00:04:17.280> coming<00:04:17.489> through<00:04:17.910> we've

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
stitching marks coming through we've

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.949 
stitching marks coming through we've
also<00:04:19.039> reinforced<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.609> critical<00:04:21.120> seams<00:04:21.419> with

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
also reinforced the critical seams with

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.090 
also reinforced the critical seams with
some<00:04:22.289> gorilla<00:04:23.160> gretna<00:04:23.550> bonding
