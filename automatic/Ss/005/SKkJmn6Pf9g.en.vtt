00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 so hello people we come together yes 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.080
 small video of such minecraft 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:16.049
 The figures you can buy at saturn 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:19.920
 and here with my friend with the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:25.310
 we begin with a diamond day deep 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.420
 good if i buy those in saturn then 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 that cost about a little 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.670
 packet with such a figure block and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.579
 which can even buy them as 990 and 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.250
 then there are also such big packs with 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:49.950
 impression and next to the cost so until 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:52.700
 20 euros one is here hard did 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.700
 focus 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.899
 So just throw it away 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.090
 So here's this diamond blog 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.739
 of course, in 3d and may give 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.970
 if you notice the office so right now 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.159
 here, too, a bit that's it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.380
 So it's a bit like that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.110
 So stick out of style as you can 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.670
 also everything break down so it even lacks 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.460
 you can also hang on it and or 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.869
 again here and then 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.979
 you can join in the bright one here 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.979
 that's all else 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:32.720
 then then showed once with the sword 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:39.030
 He sees you approaching later and you can see them 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:43.200
 hand as well a small clamp was partly 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:49.619
 times then I can top with so little 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.369
 clawed so yes then the flown so 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:58.080
 then a holding golem 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:00.539
 oh so I've been doing so here 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:07.440

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:09.660
 I can film better here in the back 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.300
 is still such a small one 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.430
 There is a description you see here 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.299
 such a cheap and sigrid damm and 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.030
 a more we have here here first 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.790

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.290
 has stuck times why cute goal 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.720
 in the head so that has here in addition 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.630
 a flower that's really like 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.160
 in the game when you killed the gang 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.260
 Of course he can do that too 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.459
 I'll take it because the flower is still in it 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.810
 do other hand like that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.709
 why do we do that I can Yes 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.380

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.820
 I can do it now so yes 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.070
 just to travel here 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:09.090
 block and not cardboard like me 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:12.120
 first thought so and you could 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.390
 if you have a game so here is a house 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.390

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.630
 i also have the video channel her 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.739
 you absolutely had to have the plot 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.260

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:43.170
 Here we show the profile picture so there 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:47.660
 one now sees the michael opitz is 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.660
 a channel must necessarily check times 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:57.350
