you<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.940> what's<00:01:03.149> running<00:01:03.359> bad<00:01:03.870> money<00:01:04.170> inside

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
you know what's running bad money inside

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.679 
you know what's running bad money inside
that<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> p7<00:01:06.860> okay<00:01:08.119> here's<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> front<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.600> the

that a p7 okay here's the front of the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.350 
that a p7 okay here's the front of the
box<00:01:10.399> has<00:01:11.399> a<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:12.030> apt<00:01:12.450> eighty<00:01:13.020> tweeters<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.360> for

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
box has a to apt eighty tweeters and for

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.620 
box has a to apt eighty tweeters and for
more<00:01:15.810> eminence<00:01:16.530> may<00:01:17.310> time<00:01:19.969> alright<00:01:20.969> so<00:01:21.360> seems
