you can either air dry and just put your
hand<00:04:18.299> up<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.630> or<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:19.080> can<00:04:19.140> sit<00:04:19.470> under<00:04:19.590> your

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
hand up on it or you can sit under your

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.240 
hand up on it or you can sit under your
hooded<00:04:20.130> dryer<00:04:21.140> decisions<00:04:22.140> decisions<00:04:22.410> which

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
hooded dryer decisions decisions which

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.050 
hooded dryer decisions decisions which
should<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.610> do

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
should I do

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.060 
should I do
I<00:04:25.730> think<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.820> dryer<00:04:27.060> wins<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:28.740> now<00:04:28.860> I'm<00:04:28.950> going

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
I think the dryer wins so now I'm going

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.680 
I think the dryer wins so now I'm going
to<00:04:29.130> sit<00:04:29.310> under<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.580> dryer<00:04:29.610> for<00:04:30.150> about<00:04:30.210> an<00:04:30.540> hour

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
to sit under the dryer for about an hour

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.660 
to sit under the dryer for about an hour
30<00:04:31.050> minutes<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.770> first<00:04:32.040> I'm<00:04:32.280> going<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.490> switch

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
30 minutes but first I'm going to switch

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.909 
30 minutes but first I'm going to switch
my<00:04:32.700> hair<00:04:33.030> with<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.260> heat<00:04:34.260> protectant

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.950 

so<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.669> is<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:37.909> takedown<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.599> it's<00:04:38.749> pretty

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
so this is the takedown and it's pretty

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.239 
so this is the takedown and it's pretty
simple<00:04:41.229> now<00:04:42.229> pay<00:04:42.409> attention<00:04:42.439> to<00:04:42.889> how<00:04:43.099> I'm

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:43.249 
simple now pay attention to how I'm

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.869 
simple now pay attention to how I'm
taking<00:04:43.610> them<00:04:43.699> out

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:45.879 
taking them out

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.429 
taking them out
I'll<00:04:46.879> rival<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.479> like<00:04:47.629> that<00:04:47.779> just<00:04:47.990> so<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.259> hair

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439 
I'll rival it like that just so the hair

00:04:48.439 --> 00:05:01.089 
I'll rival it like that just so the hair
can<00:04:48.590> keep<00:04:48.740> its<00:04:48.919> coil<00:04:59.529> now<00:05:00.529> my<00:05:00.710> hair<00:05:00.889> is<00:05:00.979> all

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
can keep its coil now my hair is all

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.709 
can keep its coil now my hair is all
done<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:01.550> I'm<00:05:01.610> just<00:05:01.789> pulling<00:05:02.090> under<00:05:02.300> hair<00:05:02.479> so

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
done and I'm just pulling under hair so

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.719 
done and I'm just pulling under hair so
it<00:05:02.840> can<00:05:02.960> be<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.080> little<00:05:03.319> bit<00:05:03.409> longer<00:05:03.729> the

it can be a little bit longer the

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.570 
it can be a little bit longer the
shrinkage<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.539> devil<00:05:06.099> and<00:05:07.099> you<00:05:07.219> just<00:05:07.430> want

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
shrinkage is the devil and you just want

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.820
