 Greatly divide cheek cheek in the first night and the first lesson ppabam ppabam ppabam 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.710
 Now you can remember to drive that lead so the code is now a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.949
 I'll take the code and I'll start. 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.180
 In this case , because there is not much 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:38.219
 Because it's the soft strut that cuts in .

 Real and very weak 2 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.790
 The first expansion of its strong and weak response ever hear sounds that contrast so 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.450
 I have to make a difference. I'm weak. I 'm weak. I have a difficult difference.

 It's a strum that goes in this way, so it's a lot 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.940
 I can use it. 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:06.250
 I can use 16 bit once everywhere, basically slow there 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.250

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.939
 Did that have a rich hearty rhythm going so slow 16-bit, so it 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:55.159
 You have to practice a lot. 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.939
 Particular attention is a reminder always said this time so hard to make time tomorrow.

 I do not think there will be any acceleration or deceleration in the interval between them. 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.030
 You can practice a lot to get the rhythm out.
