 that attack you from afar because they know that 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.560
 if you get a little closer, blow them if you 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.880

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 and this one never 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.720

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.819
 already saw that everything can be done with effort 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.680
 and dedication and I was getting closer to that 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.390
 skeleton was super strong and I do not know 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.219
 since when to climb the stairs 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.650
 you grow three meters and seven wide the 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.540
 chest so much but good also that subject 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.489
 I understand that the skeletons are 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.079
 undead and everything you can not therefore 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.459
 That 's how I understand what I do not 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.890
 understand or where they get their cojones 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.870
 that is to say they revive with arc or that 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.819
 Well, this man who bobby and jr cabo 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.920
 you say hear you want to buy a book 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.569
 a bookstore or a bookshelf sir 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.510
 Kamov and is the wooden shelf solution 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.489
 five million euros and would lose six 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.280
 million euros this stick bathed in 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.989
 wood eight thousand trillion euros like 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.669
 always the prices plus payments teach 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.409
 what bobby mark sir that bobby this 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:59.010
 background I tell you, I say, serving the 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.150
 extending 329,9 brand güímar that is not 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.829
 responsible for possible 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.629
 explosions of objects or useless 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.639
 of them good this was weird but 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.200
 I think it explains the arch but now 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.329
 I have another doubt because the others 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.489
 skeletons the level ones use sword and 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.079
 no arch you have to ask maybe 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.450
 maybe between dying he's doing here 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.700
 you very something that I'm working on is 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 Mr. Jhony true that I in and not I 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:29.070
 nor sir can we do a few 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:31.140
 that does not answer the question of why 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.180
 is being a skeleton not to use all 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.760
 Look, I explain very well that with them 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.560

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:54.170
