00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
about things like trying to get that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.670 
about things like trying to get that
that<00:00:44.820> dose<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.450> during<00:00:45.840> school<00:00:46.050> time<00:00:46.350> just

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that dose in during school time just

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290 
that dose in during school time just
isn't<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> work<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
isn't going to work I think one of the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
isn't going to work I think one of the
unique<00:00:48.510> things<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.809> childrens<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.980> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
unique things about childrens is that we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.880 
unique things about childrens is that we
do<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.280> best<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.969> avoid<00:00:51.059> transplant<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> if

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
do our best to avoid transplant and if

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.319 
do our best to avoid transplant and if
you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:54.059> undergo<00:00:54.960> treatment<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:56.329> receive

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
you can undergo treatment or receive

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
you can undergo treatment or receive
some<00:00:57.539> sort<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.750> medication<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.649> avoid<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
some sort of medication that can avoid a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
some sort of medication that can avoid a
transplant<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.760> understand<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.780> it's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
transplant we understand for that it's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
transplant we understand for that it's
out<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> our<00:01:01.530> shoulders<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.460> protect<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
out and our shoulders to protect the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
out and our shoulders to protect the
patient<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:04.159> any<00:01:05.159> undue<00:01:05.869> events<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.140> I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
patient from any undue events and I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130 
patient from any undue events and I
think<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.640> always<00:01:08.820> take<00:01:09.299> extra<00:01:09.659> care<00:01:09.840> making

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
think we always take extra care making

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.130 
think we always take extra care making
sure<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.619> his<00:01:10.979> patient<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.689> right

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
sure that his patient is at the right

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
sure that his patient is at the right
point<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> their<00:01:14.010> life<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
point in their life to get that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.359 
point in their life to get that
transplant<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
transplant I think that one of the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
transplant I think that one of the
fundamental<00:01:18.000> missions<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.020> Children's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

so in a more innovative fashion

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.280 
so in a more innovative fashion
transplantation<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.170> than

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
transplantation I think more than

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.530 
transplantation I think more than
anything<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.030> multidisciplinary<00:01:33.030> service

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
anything is a multidisciplinary service

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.330 
anything is a multidisciplinary service
none<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> us<00:01:34.350> could<00:01:34.560> function<00:01:34.770> without<00:01:35.040> they

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
none of us could function without they

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760 
none of us could function without they
