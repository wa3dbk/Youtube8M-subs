it's<00:01:56.090> not<00:01:56.329> as<00:01:56.420> refined<00:01:56.720> although<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.829> has<00:01:58.220> it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
it's not as refined although it has it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.270 
it's not as refined although it has it
has<00:01:59.060> items<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.170> were<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.500> little<00:02:01.009> bit<00:02:01.250> more

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
has items that were a little bit more

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.740 
has items that were a little bit more
random<00:02:01.970> because<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.450> came<00:02:02.569> in<00:02:02.750> cards<00:02:04.750> anything

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
random because it came in cards anything

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.839 
random because it came in cards anything
they<00:02:06.470> didn't<00:02:06.679> do<00:02:06.740> anything<00:02:06.950> but<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.399> one

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
they didn't do anything but the one

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.219 
they didn't do anything but the one
thing<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.149> thought<00:02:08.330> was<00:02:08.450> always<00:02:08.780> interesting

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
thing I thought was always interesting

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.199 
thing I thought was always interesting
as<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.440> can<00:02:09.560> at<00:02:09.649> least<00:02:10.190> punch<00:02:10.580> him<00:02:10.729> away<00:02:10.940> I

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
as you can at least punch him away I

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.110 
as you can at least punch him away I
don't<00:02:11.989> know<00:02:12.080> if<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.230> could<00:02:12.349> do<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:13.760> I

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
don't know if you could do that like I

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.059 
don't know if you could do that like I
know<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.840> could<00:02:14.989> pick<00:02:15.170> them<00:02:15.260> up<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.590> throw

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
know you could pick them up and throw

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.740 
know you could pick them up and throw
them<00:02:16.099> but<00:02:16.430> actually<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.120> depends<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.569> what

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
them but actually it depends on what

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.360 
them but actually it depends on what
item<00:02:18.080> because<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.440> could<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:18.860> because<00:02:19.250> you

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
item because you could you because you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.360 
item because you could you because you
can<00:02:19.489> even<00:02:19.640> counter<00:02:20.000> items<00:02:21.069> okay<00:02:22.099> well

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
can even counter items okay well

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.210 
can even counter items okay well
regardless<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.450> idea<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.870> each<00:02:24.290> digimon<00:02:24.980> has

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
regardless the idea is each digimon has

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.009 
regardless the idea is each digimon has
a<00:02:25.250> mean<00:02:25.760> did<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.000> pollution<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.720> highest

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
a mean did you pollution the highest

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.289 
a mean did you pollution the highest
version<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.709> go<00:02:27.860> up<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.549> it's<00:02:29.120> like<00:02:29.269> a

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
version it can go up to and it's like a

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.120 
version it can go up to and it's like a
super<00:02:29.690> power<00:02:29.720> boost<00:02:30.290> for<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.590> short<00:02:30.769> amount<00:02:30.980> of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
super power boost for a short amount of

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.640 
super power boost for a short amount of
time<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.510> transformation<00:02:33.200> reminds<00:02:33.470> me

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
time and the transformation reminds me

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.530 
time and the transformation reminds me
is<00:02:33.739> like<00:02:33.890> Power<00:02:34.160> Stone<00:02:34.489> but<00:02:34.700> crappy<00:02:35.000> well

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
is like Power Stone but crappy well

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.809 
is like Power Stone but crappy well
that's<00:02:35.780> why<00:02:35.930> even<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.349> powers<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.489> get

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
that's why even the powers that you get

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.830 
that's why even the powers that you get
when<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.890> transform<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.160> like<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:41.299> still

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
when you transform it's like you still

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.630 
when you transform it's like you still
you<00:02:42.290> know<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.470> can<00:02:42.709> loosen<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.250> as<00:02:43.400> quick

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
you know you can loosen just as quick

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.330 
you know you can loosen just as quick
like<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.239> using<00:02:44.540> its<00:02:45.140> main<00:02:45.530> strong<00:02:46.069> one

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
like you can using its main strong one

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.500 
like you can using its main strong one
again<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.850> know<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.120> like<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.299> boss

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
again you know it's like a boss

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.539 
again you know it's like a boss
Christmas<00:02:48.049> yeah<00:02:48.440> that's<00:02:48.739> very<00:02:48.769> power<00:02:49.100> stoners

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
and then it's like I don't know the heat

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.740 
and then it's like I don't know the heat
the<00:02:52.220> heat<00:02:52.430> meters<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.209> where<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.630> actually

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
the heat meters like where it actually

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.599 
the heat meters like where it actually
it's<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:54.530> like<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:55.310> off<00:02:57.130> they're<00:02:58.130> more<00:02:58.400> than

it's it's like so off they're more than

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.910 
it's it's like so off they're more than
that<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:59.000> off<00:02:59.150> everything<00:02:59.810> yes<00:03:00.170> no<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.470> mean

one<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> huge<00:03:15.660> problems<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.620> game

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
one of the huge problems with this game

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.449 
one of the huge problems with this game
is<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.959> like<00:03:18.959> when<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.200> get<00:03:19.290> hit<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.250> hole

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
is that like when you get hit the hole

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.790 
is that like when you get hit the hole
you<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.360> watch<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.870> entire<00:03:21.990> hit

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
you have to watch the entire hit

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.290 
you have to watch the entire hit
animation<00:03:23.490> before<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.150> continue

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
animation before you can continue

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.410 
animation before you can continue
there's<00:03:25.140> no<00:03:25.560> way<00:03:25.740> around<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:26.760> not<00:03:27.060> quick

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
there's no way around and it's not quick

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.150 
there's no way around and it's not quick
either<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:28.260> especially<00:03:28.740> like<00:03:28.890> you're<00:03:29.040> gonna

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
either and especially like you're gonna

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.850 
either and especially like you're gonna
see<00:03:29.459> here<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.510> snow<00:03:30.780> level<00:03:31.110> for<00:03:31.770> the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
see here in the snow level for the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.040 
see here in the snow level for the
character<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> chose<00:03:32.730> at<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.150> very<00:03:33.480> edge<00:03:33.690> if

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
character I chose at the very edge if

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.110 
character I chose at the very edge if
you<00:03:34.170> hit<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.500> edge<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.980> basically<00:03:35.640> slide<00:03:35.970> off

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
you hit the edge you basically slide off

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.060 
you hit the edge you basically slide off
yeah<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:37.140> like<00:03:37.290> here<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.830> have

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
yeah and it's like here you have

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.820 
yeah and it's like here you have
triangle<00:03:38.700> which<00:03:38.820> does<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.270> like<00:03:39.590> /and<00:03:40.590> thing

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
triangle which does it's like /and thing

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.620 
triangle which does it's like /and thing
where<00:03:41.040> he<00:03:41.100> does<00:03:41.280> like<00:03:41.430> three<00:03:41.760> or<00:03:41.850> four<00:03:41.910> slashes

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
where he does like three or four slashes

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.010 
where he does like three or four slashes
and<00:03:43.010> there's<00:03:44.010> no<00:03:44.220> way<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.400> stop<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:45.020> so

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
and there's no way to stop it so
