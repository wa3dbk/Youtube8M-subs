00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
should be one and how to find them hmm

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.440 
should be one and how to find them hmm
like<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.709> said<00:03:13.950> find<00:03:14.280> out<00:03:14.400> big<00:03:14.609> natural<00:03:15.030> cave<00:03:15.209> if

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
like I said find out big natural cave if

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.330 
like I said find out big natural cave if
not<00:03:15.629> like<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> massive<00:03:16.140> room<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.650> hope<00:03:17.129> for<00:03:17.160> the

in hopefully this video did help you out
and<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.269> find<00:03:54.870> them<00:03:55.049> just<00:03:55.980> fun<00:03:56.639> just<00:03:57.090> left<00:03:57.840> hit

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
and to find them just fun just left hit

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.409 
and to find them just fun just left hit
them<00:03:58.169> with<00:03:58.290> your<00:03:58.379> hand<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.129> just<00:03:59.700> don't

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
them with your hand like that just don't

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.449 
them with your hand like that just don't
use<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:00.599> served<00:04:00.930> or<00:04:01.379> like<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.980> know<00:04:02.010> anything

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
use a served or like you know anything

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.849 
use a served or like you know anything
powerful<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:04.230> guess<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.530> could<00:04:04.560> use<00:04:04.739> an

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
powerful and I guess you could use an

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.559 
powerful and I guess you could use an
item<00:04:05.099> in<00:04:05.220> your<00:04:05.280> hand<00:04:05.489> but<00:04:05.609> yeah<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:06.030> pinched

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
item in your hand but yeah it pinched

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.110 
item in your hand but yeah it pinched
them<00:04:06.660> until<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.989> get<00:04:07.139> em<00:04:07.379> to<00:04:07.739> smallest<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.790> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
them until I get em to smallest like the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.640 
them until I get em to smallest like the
tiny<00:04:09.359> ones<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:09.810> then<00:04:09.900> hopefully<00:04:10.290> we'll<00:04:10.470> get

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
tiny ones and then hopefully we'll get

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.140 
tiny ones and then hopefully we'll get
sandals<00:04:11.129> and<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:12.720> guys<00:04:13.280> this<00:04:14.280> problem<00:04:14.970> how<00:04:15.120> to

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
sandals and you guys this problem how to

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.870 
sandals and you guys this problem how to
be<00:04:15.269> too<00:04:15.449> much<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.070> mainly<00:04:17.070> because<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.549> sounds

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
be too much and mainly because it sounds

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.080 
be too much and mainly because it sounds
a<00:04:17.940> bit<00:04:18.030> complicated<00:04:18.389> but

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
a bit complicated but

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.629 
a bit complicated but
trust<00:04:19.449> me<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:19.690> make<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.930> massive<00:04:20.230> room<00:04:20.639> quite

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
trust me just make a massive room quite

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.930 
trust me just make a massive room quite
close<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.030> live<00:04:22.210> level<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.010> like<00:04:24.010> this<00:04:24.280> I'll

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
close to live level and like this I'll

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.460 
close to live level and like this I'll
try<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.210> find<00:04:25.389> a<00:04:25.570> natural<00:04:25.870> cave<00:04:25.960> like<00:04:26.199> I<00:04:26.290> said

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
try and find a natural cave like I said

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.110 
try and find a natural cave like I said
and<00:04:26.650> look<00:04:26.800> around<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.370> put<00:04:27.699> make<00:04:27.880> sure<00:04:28.030> it's

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
and look around and put make sure it's

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.870 
and look around and put make sure it's
an<00:04:28.210> easier<00:04:28.600> though<00:04:28.750> as<00:04:28.870> we<00:04:28.900> would<00:04:29.050> spawn<00:04:29.380> and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
an easier though as we would spawn and

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.230 
an easier though as we would spawn and
and<00:04:31.680> yeah<00:04:32.680> hopefully<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.310> fine<00:04:33.610> one<00:04:33.820> doesn't

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
and yeah hopefully a fine one doesn't

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.790 
and yeah hopefully a fine one doesn't
mean<00:04:34.360> where<00:04:34.780> they're<00:04:34.960> sitting<00:04:35.139> that's<00:04:35.650> why

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
mean where they're sitting that's why

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.260 
mean where they're sitting that's why
they<00:04:35.919> spawn<00:04:36.190> it<00:04:36.400> could<00:04:36.550> be<00:04:36.639> an<00:04:36.729> eye<00:04:36.820> area<00:04:37.120> it

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
they spawn it could be an eye area it

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.760 
they spawn it could be an eye area it
could<00:04:37.389> be<00:04:37.510> really<00:04:37.840> far<00:04:38.080> away<00:04:38.229> from<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.560> area

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
could be really far away from the area

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.770 
could be really far away from the area
just<00:04:39.040> try<00:04:39.669> on<00:04:39.729> the<00:04:39.820> ground<00:04:40.060> make<00:04:40.449> like<00:04:40.750> a

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
just try on the ground make like a

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.080 
just try on the ground make like a
massive<00:04:41.100> enclosure<00:04:42.100> which<00:04:42.520> they<00:04:42.669> can't<00:04:42.910> get

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
massive enclosure which they can't get

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.270 
massive enclosure which they can't get
off<00:04:43.300> come<00:04:43.870> back<00:04:44.080> have<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.530> look<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.979> if<00:04:45.100> their

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
off come back have a look and if their

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.590 
off come back have a look and if their
spawn<00:04:45.520> in<00:04:45.669> there<00:04:45.820> then<00:04:45.970> you<00:04:46.030> found<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.330> slime

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
spawn in there then you found a slime

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.390 
spawn in there then you found a slime
spawner<00:04:46.990> they're<00:04:47.620> not<00:04:47.710> like<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.010> other<00:04:48.190> mobs

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400

wherein you know they have like a slow
near<00:04:51.610> mob<00:04:51.820> spawner<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:53.139> they<00:04:53.470> like<00:04:53.620> spawn

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
near mob spawner and they like spawn

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.430 
near mob spawner and they like spawn
from<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.340> box<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.940> spawning<00:04:55.780> chunks<00:04:56.290> of<00:04:56.350> the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
from that box the spawning chunks of the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.170 
from that box the spawning chunks of the
map<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.889> you<00:04:56.919> it's<00:04:57.370> like<00:04:57.520> invisible<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.120> you

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
map and you it's like invisible so you

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.090 
map and you it's like invisible so you
can<00:04:58.330> see<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.570> which<00:04:58.750> makes<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.169> harder<00:04:59.919> for<00:04:59.950> you

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100
