I<00:03:13.630> will<00:03:14.080> hit<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.290> coil<00:03:14.470> tap<00:03:14.740> and<00:03:14.980> then<00:03:15.130> we'll

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
I will hit the coil tap and then we'll

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.920 
I will hit the coil tap and then we'll
hit<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.460> bypass<00:03:15.640> switch<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.450> can<00:03:16.600> hear

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
hit the bypass switch so you can hear

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.240 
hit the bypass switch so you can hear
what<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.440> sounds<00:03:17.800> like<00:03:17.830> when<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.070> hit<00:03:18.130> the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
what it sounds like when you hit the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.860 
what it sounds like when you hit the
bypass<00:03:18.400> switch<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.000> get<00:03:19.120> just<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.480> maybe<00:03:19.780> a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
bypass switch you get just that maybe a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.700 
bypass switch you get just that maybe a
twinge<00:03:20.770> more<00:03:21.100> output<00:03:21.520> but<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.850> high<00:03:22.030> end

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
twinge more output but the high end

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.980 
twinge more output but the high end
seems<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.800> be<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.920> lot<00:03:24.250> more<00:03:24.990> distinguishable

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
seems to be a lot more distinguishable

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.590 
seems to be a lot more distinguishable
so<00:03:26.260> check<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.370> out<00:03:27.520> here<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.030> just<00:03:28.360> regular

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600
