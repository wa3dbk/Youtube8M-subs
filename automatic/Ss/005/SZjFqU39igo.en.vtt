00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
first things first obviously you open

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.350 
first things first obviously you open
your<00:00:35.950> image<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.430> Photoshop<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.059> first

your image and Photoshop now the first
thing<00:00:40.540> that<00:00:40.690> you<00:00:40.780> would<00:00:40.900> do<00:00:41.080> is<00:00:42.180> change<00:00:43.180> your

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
thing that you would do is change your

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.260 
thing that you would do is change your
colour<00:00:43.900> space<00:00:44.290> -<00:00:44.620> srgb

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
colour space - srgb

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.490 
colour space - srgb
and<00:00:46.650> I<00:00:47.879> shoot<00:00:48.879> at<00:00:49.180> my<00:00:49.629> camera<00:00:49.989> settings<00:00:50.320> are

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
set to shoot ms RGB and a lot of people

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.590 
set to shoot ms RGB and a lot of people
disagree<00:00:53.800> with<00:00:54.010> that<00:00:54.160> for<00:00:54.550> what<00:00:55.000> I<00:00:55.030> do<00:00:55.180> it<00:00:55.420> just

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
disagree with that for what I do it just

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.630 
disagree with that for what I do it just
works<00:00:55.780> best<00:00:56.110> but<00:00:57.100> if<00:00:57.160> you<00:00:57.250> want<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.460> continue

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
works best but if you want to continue

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.820 
works best but if you want to continue
shooting<00:00:58.030> an<00:00:58.120> RGB<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.510> your<00:00:58.690> camera<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.589> first

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
profile now mine is already yours would

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.190 
profile now mine is already yours would
say<00:01:08.530> profile<00:01:09.369> RGB<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.180> then<00:01:10.869> you<00:01:10.960> would<00:01:11.080> go<00:01:11.170> to

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
say profile RGB and then you would go to

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200 
say profile RGB and then you would go to
your<00:01:11.350> destination<00:01:11.590> space<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.550> you<00:01:13.090> would

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
your destination space and you would

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.109 
your destination space and you would
change<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.630> SRTP<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:15.340> line<00:01:15.520> like<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:15.880> said

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
change that to SRTP the line like I said

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.550 
change that to SRTP the line like I said
it's<00:01:16.240> already<00:01:16.420> like<00:01:16.630> that<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.050> then<00:01:17.470> you

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
it's already like that and then you

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.779 
it's already like that and then you
would<00:01:17.649> hit<00:01:17.740> OK<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.100> then<00:01:18.369> everything<00:01:18.700> would

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
would hit OK and then everything would

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.560 
would hit OK and then everything would
be<00:01:18.910> done<00:01:20.190> second<00:01:21.190> thing<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.399> would<00:01:21.490> do<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.820> for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
be done second thing you would do is for

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
Facebook they support a few different

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.900 
Facebook they support a few different
sizes<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.680> size<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.100> I<00:01:27.220> like<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.460> go<00:01:27.580> with<00:01:27.729> is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
sizes the size that I like to go with is

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.510 
sizes the size that I like to go with is
960<00:01:28.899> pixels<00:01:29.619> on<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.430> longest<00:01:30.910> edge<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.369> when

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
960 pixels on the longest edge so when

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.440 
960 pixels on the longest edge so when
you<00:01:33.640> come<00:01:33.820> up<00:01:33.940> here<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.149> your<00:01:34.300> crop<00:01:34.539> tool

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you come up here to your crop tool

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.290 
you come up here to your crop tool
my<00:01:37.320> longest<00:01:37.650> edge<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:38.250> horizontal<00:01:38.940> so<00:01:39.240> I'm

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
my longest edge is horizontal so I'm

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:48.640 
my longest edge is horizontal so I'm
going<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> make<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:41.960> 960<00:01:42.960> pixels

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.530 

and<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.400> can<00:01:49.490> see<00:01:49.550> obviously<00:01:50.030> my<00:01:50.330> image

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
and as you can see obviously my image

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.350 
and as you can see obviously my image
got<00:01:50.750> smaller<00:01:51.020> isn't<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.530> small<00:01:51.770> note<00:01:52.120> so

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
got smaller isn't that small note so

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.620 
got smaller isn't that small note so
is<00:01:53.540> now<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.750> size<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.350> my<00:01:54.470> image<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.630> the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
is now the size of my image and the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.070 
is now the size of my image and the
third<00:01:57.320> thing<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.650> do<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:59.240> when<00:01:59.510> you<00:01:59.630> upload<00:01:59.930> it

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
third thing I do is when you upload it

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.270 
third thing I do is when you upload it
looks<00:02:00.230> fine<00:02:00.410> on<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.650> screen<00:02:00.860> right<00:02:00.980> now<00:02:01.040> boy

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
looks fine on the screen right now boy

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.420 
looks fine on the screen right now boy
you<00:02:01.400> upload<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.910> to<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.090> website<00:02:02.390> or<00:02:02.630> Facebook

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
you upload it to a website or Facebook

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.280 
you upload it to a website or Facebook
it<00:02:04.430> tends<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.820> desaturate<00:02:05.510> it<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.690> little<00:02:05.840> bit<00:02:06.080> i

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
loving just a little bit and then I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.670 
loving just a little bit and then I
always<00:02:16.670> sent<00:02:17.660> rated<00:02:17.990> about<00:02:18.200> 5<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.280> 6<00:02:19.490> points

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.280 
and then flattened image to get rid of
my<00:02:29.060> layers<00:02:29.300> because<00:02:29.630> I'm<00:02:29.750> not<00:02:29.900> going<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.140> need

my layers because I'm not going to need

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.199
