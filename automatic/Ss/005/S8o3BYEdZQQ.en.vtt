blackleg<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:48.519> bad<00:00:48.699> news<00:00:49.089> is<00:00:49.420> that<00:00:49.449> it<00:00:49.989> seems

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
blackleg the bad news is that it seems

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.439 
blackleg the bad news is that it seems
to<00:00:50.559> be<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:50.920> soil<00:00:51.190> just<00:00:51.670> about<00:00:51.940> anywhere

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
to be in the soil just about anywhere

that<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.900> might<00:00:53.110> want<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.409> check<00:00:54.330> you<00:00:55.330> do<00:00:55.809> not

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
that you might want to check you do not

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.689 
that you might want to check you do not
necessarily<00:00:56.170> have<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.710> problem<00:00:57.189> with<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.460> every

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
necessarily have a problem with it every

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.270 
necessarily have a problem with it every
year<00:00:58.030> but<00:00:58.269> it<00:00:59.019> does<00:00:59.229> crop<00:00:59.589> up<00:00:59.769> periodically

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
year but it does crop up periodically

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.090 
year but it does crop up periodically
and<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.970> course<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.330> losses<00:01:01.720> are<00:01:01.930> very<00:01:02.350> severe

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
and of course the losses are very severe

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.060 
and of course the losses are very severe
with<00:01:03.790> blackleg<00:01:04.330> there<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:05.019> no<00:01:05.590> treatment

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
with blackleg there is no treatment

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.530 
with blackleg there is no treatment
usually<00:01:06.970> an<00:01:07.659> animal<00:01:08.049> is<00:01:08.170> dead<00:01:08.439> before<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:10.330> see

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
usually an animal is dead before you see

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.990 
usually an animal is dead before you see
any<00:01:10.720> symptoms<00:01:11.259> of<00:01:11.439> anything<00:01:11.860> that<00:01:12.460> has

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
any symptoms of anything that has

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.969 
any symptoms of anything that has
actually<00:01:13.420> happened<00:01:13.600> out<00:01:13.960> there<00:01:13.990> there's<00:01:14.830> some

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
actually happened out there there's some

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.920 
actually happened out there there's some
other<00:01:15.159> cost<00:01:15.490> radials<00:01:15.939> that<00:01:16.180> do<00:01:16.360> cause<00:01:16.900> some

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
other cost radials that do cause some

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.390 
other cost radials that do cause some
similar<00:01:17.740> type<00:01:18.900> disease<00:01:19.900> problems<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:21.159> kill

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
similar type disease problems that kill

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.609 
similar type disease problems that kill
animals<00:01:21.880> also<00:01:22.299> but<00:01:22.810> we're<00:01:22.960> just<00:01:22.990> dealing<00:01:23.350> here

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
animals also but we're just dealing here

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.149 
animals also but we're just dealing here
primarily<00:01:23.890> with<00:01:24.340> blackleg<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:26.080> key<00:01:26.800> thing<00:01:27.130> is

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
primarily with blackleg the key thing is

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.730 
primarily with blackleg the key thing is
prevention<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.510> is<00:01:28.690> through<00:01:28.930> vaccination

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
prevention this is through vaccination

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.330 
prevention this is through vaccination
and<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.060> blackleg<00:01:31.170> vaccine<00:01:32.170> comes<00:01:33.010> with

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
and the blackleg vaccine comes with

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.170 
and the blackleg vaccine comes with
several<00:01:33.700> other<00:01:33.909> of<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.470> Clostridium

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
several other of the Clostridium

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.969 
several other of the Clostridium
products<00:01:37.180> in<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.690> so<00:01:37.930> that<00:01:38.200> we<00:01:38.560> do<00:01:38.740> have<00:01:38.950> a

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
products in it so that we do have a

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.840 
products in it so that we do have a
pretty<00:01:39.310> broad<00:01:39.640> spectrum<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.470> protection<00:01:41.850> we

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
pretty broad spectrum of protection we

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.550 
pretty broad spectrum of protection we
need<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.150> be<00:01:43.270> sure<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.750> we<00:01:43.870> do<00:01:44.050> follow<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
need to be sure that we do follow the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.930 
need to be sure that we do follow the
label<00:01:44.770> on<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.610> vaccinations<00:01:47.400> many<00:01:48.400> of<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
label on the vaccinations many of the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.410 
label on the vaccinations many of the
products<00:01:49.600> will<00:01:49.750> recommend<00:01:51.299> vaccinating<00:01:52.299> and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
products will recommend vaccinating and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.230 
products will recommend vaccinating and
then<00:01:52.600> coming<00:01:52.990> back<00:01:53.020> with<00:01:53.620> a<00:01:53.770> booster<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.520> 2<00:01:55.090> to

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
then coming back with a booster and 2 to

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.920 
then coming back with a booster and 2 to
4<00:01:55.420> weeks

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
4 weeks

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.310 
4 weeks
so<00:01:56.380> again<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.070> key<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.479> look<00:01:58.479> at<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.900> label

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
so again the key is look at the label

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.590 
so again the key is look at the label
and<00:01:59.500> if<00:01:59.650> it<00:01:59.799> does<00:02:00.010> recommend<00:02:00.880> coming<00:02:01.390> back

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
and if it does recommend coming back

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.160 
and if it does recommend coming back
with<00:02:01.870> a<00:02:01.900> second<00:02:02.850> vaccination<00:02:03.850> by<00:02:04.630> all<00:02:04.810> means

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
with a second vaccination by all means

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.789 
with a second vaccination by all means
do<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.119> these<00:02:07.119> losses<00:02:07.450> from<00:02:07.869> blackleg<00:02:08.440> can

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
do that these losses from blackleg can

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.960 
do that these losses from blackleg can
be<00:02:09.810> reduced<00:02:10.810> or<00:02:11.250> completely<00:02:12.250> stopped<00:02:12.580> if<00:02:12.819> we

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
be reduced or completely stopped if we

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.930 
be reduced or completely stopped if we
go<00:02:13.239> with<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> good<00:02:13.870> vaccination<00:02:14.590> program<00:02:15.069> if

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
go with a good vaccination program if

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.330 
go with a good vaccination program if
you'd<00:02:16.120> like<00:02:16.269> some<00:02:16.330> more<00:02:16.659> information
