hear a lot of building noises in the
background<00:00:37.590> by<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> way<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:39.030> actually

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
background by the way I was actually

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.209 
background by the way I was actually
gonna<00:00:39.420> try<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> stop<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> noise<00:00:41.010> from

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
gonna try and stop that noise from
happening<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.790> by<00:00:41.969> closing<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.570> double

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
happening like by closing the double

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.540 
happening like by closing the double
glazed<00:00:43.079> window<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.680> thought<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
glazed window but I thought because this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.610 
glazed window but I thought because this
is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> polka<00:00:44.969> collection<00:00:45.450> buildi<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.469> like

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is a polka collection buildi it's like

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.290 
is a polka collection buildi it's like
free<00:00:46.920> sound<00:00:47.219> effect<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> thought<00:00:48.059> why<00:00:48.270> not

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
free sound effect so I thought why not

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.819 
free sound effect so I thought why not
we'll<00:00:48.719> add<00:00:48.840> some<00:00:48.989> building<00:00:49.379> sounds<00:00:49.710> to
