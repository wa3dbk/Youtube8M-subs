00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:14.030
 hello everyone , I have such a mail 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 relay voltage regulator means I was driving 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.740
 home 2 abductors abruptly salute salons 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:30.720
 cabin with thought you can posting in the herd 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:41.520
 caught fire something else immediately charging 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:47.100
 Charging has stopped, I usually watch it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.760
 immediately 12 charging him namely 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.460
 the battery I drove home was already 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.719
 Close means I put a spare 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.719
 regulator that I do 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:14.440
 here he is you behind him 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.979
 training my shop to increase 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:22.790
 bother anyone 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:27.500
 battery here here begins the 1 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.470
 there are wires attached as there it is on 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.940
 three 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:38.300
 bolted with a gadget so that's all tall 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.869
 and the calculator would need to listen at the junction 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.500
 their adapter from him making them they than 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:55.600
 can not cut the wires do not twist 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:58.039
 just me lk stay well means to 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.679
 you need to protect yourself health 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:04.429
 constantly carry regulator stock but i 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:11.480
 put 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:14.020
 sensible of this i bought another 11 case here 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.020
 so here 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:25.010
 the same means here and made in Russia 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.659
 model number is the same from 21.02 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.439
 but here and without any identifying 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:32.439
 Signs where it is made I know 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:57.140
 wandering stocks I already have one so 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:02.989
 that's what i wanted to say i didn't go to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:07.370
 this before he burned but 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:09.500
 there were unpleasant moments when 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.340
 put a new regulation later put 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.430
 ruble cars these moments all disappeared a 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.799
 just so you know 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.690
 then the first thing I have been to the light 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.230
 everywhere 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.400
 which bar you like the near distant 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:38.560
 Well, carry them both, but he can be seen in looking after 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:42.739
 that is , we were not bothered but 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.310
 yours is the first moment of the second 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:51.280
 moment how would you not regulate 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.919
 idle after will be so 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.739
 impermanent that is well that it is normal 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:06.879
 intermittently there is such a moment this 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.879
 the second point is two main points and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.900
 Here usually the voltage goes out 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.780
 rechargeable battery 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.930
 if the regulator fails normally 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:27.199
 measure on etc. 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:28.389
 but I also know how to defense within 14 to 40 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.499
 fine 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:38.379
 the usual but it's all over with 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:42.330
 but I went to the salon will be worth it 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:45.310
 meters there it turns out travel 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.550
 this reflection that is if anyone has it 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:53.069
 him and besides there let's go to the rooms 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.979
 sort of ok actually this is 3d 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:05:00.219
 the regulator did not ensure normal 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.500
 tension looked back and forth from 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:05.580
 This and the light blinks or there blurs or 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.129
 inconstant I am less tabitna here 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.259
 just turnovers 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:14.889
 bad but they seem to be set up but 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:18.490
 not that interruptions ie it could be 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:22.599
 reel regularly from born in 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.310
 Beslan robots Well, put a new all 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:32.349
 idle into place 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:35.319
 The color is already dug in. Everything is clearly reflected on 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:39.370
 battery that is measuring at idle 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:44.639
 revs without those participating consumers 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:49.240
 polina's when you turn on the light 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:54.240
 emergency gang and microphone points that is all 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.379
 14 volts really good that is well 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.089
 relay control provides normal 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:03.669
 in that the stress here is the deal here 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:07.270
 invest with you necessarily spare 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.760
 the regulator of course if in the city you can 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:16.970
 find a store 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:22.400
 buy there but somewhere on the field is very bad 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:25.490
 thank you all subscribe to my channel 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.490
 goodbye
