gets<00:02:38.799> around<00:02:39.900> 30<00:02:41.640> about<00:02:42.870> 38<00:02:44.579> 38<00:02:45.579> to<00:02:45.989> 44<00:02:46.989> miles

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
gets around 30 about 38 38 to 44 miles

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.580 
gets around 30 about 38 38 to 44 miles
to<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> gallon<00:02:47.829> in<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.870> highway<00:02:50.320> it

to the gallon in the on the highway it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.530 
to the gallon in the on the highway it
what<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.010> does<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.609> press<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.060> gas<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.420> it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
what it does is you press the gas and it

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.690 
what it does is you press the gas and it
revs<00:02:52.750> up<00:02:52.959> goes<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> certain<00:02:53.709> speed<00:02:54.010> then<00:02:54.579> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
revs up goes to a certain speed then the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.040 
revs up goes to a certain speed then the
revs<00:02:54.879> right<00:02:55.150> back<00:02:55.330> down<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.780> got<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
revs right back down it's got the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.530 
revs right back down it's got the
continuous<00:02:56.590> variable<00:02:57.040> transmission<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.390> that

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
continuous variable transmission so that

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.400 
continuous variable transmission so that
transmission<00:02:59.019> once<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.470> gets<00:02:59.620> up<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.800> coast

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
transmission once it gets up to coast

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.940 
transmission once it gets up to coast
speed<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:01.960> pretty<00:03:02.960> much<00:03:03.200> will<00:03:03.770> it<00:03:04.510> will<00:03:05.770> go<00:03:06.770> in

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
speed it pretty much will it will go in

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.800 
speed it pretty much will it will go in
a<00:03:07.040> low<00:03:07.280> gear<00:03:07.580> sort<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:07.970> like<00:03:08.090> 10th<00:03:08.330> gear<00:03:08.690> on

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
a low gear sort of like 10th gear on

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.050 
a low gear sort of like 10th gear on
your<00:03:08.930> bicycle<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.900> what<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.020> do<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.440> if<00:03:13.060> you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
your bicycle and what you do is if you

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.200 
your bicycle and what you do is if you
need<00:03:14.240> power<00:03:14.510> it'll<00:03:15.190> sometimes<00:03:16.190> be<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.030> too

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
need power it'll sometimes be in a too

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.880 
need power it'll sometimes be in a too
much<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.570> a<00:03:17.660> low<00:03:17.840> gear<00:03:18.140> so<00:03:18.380> what<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.620> do<00:03:18.710> is<00:03:18.800> you

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
much of a low gear so what you do is you

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.070 
much of a low gear so what you do is you
put<00:03:19.040> on<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.220> gas<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.730> revs<00:03:19.970> up<00:03:20.180> once<00:03:20.930> it

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
put on the gas and it revs up once it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.890 
put on the gas and it revs up once it
gets<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.350> about<00:03:21.380> coasting<00:03:22.130> speed<00:03:22.490> it<00:03:22.820> seems<00:03:23.690> to

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
gets to about coasting speed it seems to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900 
gets to about coasting speed it seems to
go<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.440> really<00:03:24.800> low<00:03:25.010> gear<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:25.460> the<00:03:25.490> engine's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
go on a really low gear so the engine's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.020 
go on a really low gear so the engine's
going<00:03:26.120> at<00:03:26.840> slow<00:03:27.140> revolutions<00:03:27.770> per<00:03:27.830> minute<00:03:28.030> so

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
going at slow revolutions per minute so

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.360 
going at slow revolutions per minute so
I<00:03:29.360> just<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:30.290> one<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.710> best<00:03:30.920> cars<00:03:31.160> I've

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
I just it's one of the best cars I've

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.890 
I just it's one of the best cars I've
ever<00:03:31.400> driven<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.360> I've<00:03:32.450> seen<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.810> know

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
ever driven and I've seen you know

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.890 
ever driven and I've seen you know
Lexuses<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:33.770> forth<00:03:34.120> $50,000<00:03:35.120> they<00:03:35.720> have

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
Lexuses and so forth $50,000 they have

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.920 
Lexuses and so forth $50,000 they have
more<00:03:36.080> power<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.770> forth<00:03:37.070> I<00:03:37.310> put<00:03:37.490> these<00:03:37.640> uh

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
more power and so forth I put these uh

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.270 
more power and so forth I put these uh
rugs<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.110> bottom<00:03:39.500> there<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:39.890> because<00:03:40.160> I

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
rugs in the bottom there just because I

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.650 
rugs in the bottom there just because I
like<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.460> protect<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:42.460> original<00:03:43.460> rugs<00:03:44.450> a

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
like to protect the original rugs a

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.680 
like to protect the original rugs a
little<00:03:44.870> bit<00:03:44.960> longer<00:03:45.340> but<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.670> know<00:03:46.820> spinnin

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
little bit longer but you know spinnin

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.300 
little bit longer but you know spinnin
Lexus's<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.380> so<00:03:48.500> forth<00:03:48.770> they<00:03:48.950> have<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.100> little

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
Lexus's and so forth they have a little

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.590 
Lexus's and so forth they have a little
more<00:03:49.460> power<00:03:49.700> we<00:03:50.060> know<00:03:50.210> what<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.390> six

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
more power we know what the six

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.750 
more power we know what the six
cylinders<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.260> forth<00:03:51.530> but<00:03:52.160> this<00:03:52.400> car<00:03:52.730> is

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
cylinders and so forth but this car is

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.980 
cylinders and so forth but this car is
probably<00:03:53.210> one<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.570> best<00:03:53.750> I've<00:03:53.960> ever

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
probably one of the best I've ever

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.900 
probably one of the best I've ever
driven<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:55.070> especially<00:03:55.550> because<00:03:55.700> the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
driven and especially because the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.400 
driven and especially because the
revolutions<00:03:56.510> per<00:03:56.570> minute<00:03:56.750> are<00:03:57.080> going<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.260> be

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
revolutions per minute are going to be

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.370 
revolutions per minute are going to be
less<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.270> car<00:03:59.510> since<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.840> revolutions

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
less in the car since the revolutions

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.650 
less in the car since the revolutions
per<00:04:00.440> minute<00:04:00.590> are<00:04:00.920> going<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.220> be<00:04:01.400> less<00:04:01.670> what

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
per minute are going to be less what

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.850 
per minute are going to be less what
that<00:04:02.810> makes<00:04:03.020> me<00:04:03.110> think<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.530> there's<00:04:03.710> going<00:04:03.800> to

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
that makes me think is there's going to

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.760 
that makes me think is there's going to
be<00:04:03.920> less<00:04:04.220> wear<00:04:04.520> and<00:04:04.550> tear<00:04:04.940> on<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.050> engine<00:04:06.440> so

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
be less wear and tear on the engine so

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.710 
be less wear and tear on the engine so
say<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.550> engine<00:04:07.820> goes<00:04:08.000> two<00:04:08.270> thousand

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
say the engine goes two thousand

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.900 
say the engine goes two thousand
revolutions<00:04:09.110> per<00:04:09.530> minute<00:04:09.680> two<00:04:10.430> thousand<00:04:10.790> five

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
revolutions per minute two thousand five

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
you're driving at at 60 miles an hour so

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.460 
you're driving at at 60 miles an hour so
that<00:04:23.000> means<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.450> me<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.630> lot<00:04:23.900> less<00:04:24.200> wear<00:04:24.440> and

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
that means to me a lot less wear and

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.500 
that means to me a lot less wear and
tear<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.919> car<00:04:25.160> although<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.360> engine

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.840 
tear in the car although the engine
might<00:04:26.840> be<00:04:27.130> pushing<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.190> little<00:04:28.280> harder<00:04:28.640> so

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
might be pushing a little harder so

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.990 
might be pushing a little harder so
we'll<00:04:29.720> see<00:04:29.900> how<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.080> affects<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.680> but<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.850> has

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
we'll see how that affects it but it has

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.890 
we'll see how that affects it but it has
the<00:04:32.180> tire<00:04:32.390> pressure<00:04:33.430> gauges<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.730> we<00:04:35.510> know<00:04:35.720> in

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
the tire pressure gauges so we know in

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.270 
the tire pressure gauges so we know in
any<00:04:36.140> tire<00:04:36.500> needs<00:04:36.800> air

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
any tire needs air

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.340 
any tire needs air
a<00:04:37.310> lot<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.180> warning<00:04:38.570> signals<00:04:38.990> on<00:04:39.169> there

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
a lot of the warning signals on there

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.840 
a lot of the warning signals on there
I'd<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:40.100> just<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.370> best<00:04:40.520> car<00:04:40.760> I've

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
I'd like it's just the best car I've

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.540 
I'd like it's just the best car I've
ever<00:04:40.940> driven<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:43.010> know<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.130> think<00:04:43.250> this

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
ever driven and you know I think this

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.720 
ever driven and you know I think this
starting<00:04:43.970> MSRP<00:04:44.150> for<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:45.040> for<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.130> base<00:04:46.310> models

around<00:04:47.000> twenty<00:04:47.360> one<00:04:47.510> five<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.650> can

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
around twenty one five so you can

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.260 
around twenty one five so you can
probably<00:04:49.040> get<00:04:49.250> them<00:04:49.370> for<00:04:49.490> around<00:04:49.700> twenty<00:04:50.240> to

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
try this car has a lot of ground

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.010 
try this car has a lot of ground
clearance<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:07.010> which<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:07.370> noticed<00:05:07.760> let<00:05:08.660> me<00:05:08.840> see

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
clearance to which I noticed let me see

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.469 
clearance to which I noticed let me see
then<00:05:09.169> go<00:05:09.350> here<00:05:09.650> it's<00:05:10.070> kind<00:05:10.340> of<00:05:10.430> dark<00:05:10.669> so<00:05:10.789> but

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
then go here it's kind of dark so but

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.060 
then go here it's kind of dark so but
the<00:05:11.600> ground<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.289> ground<00:05:12.320> clearance<00:05:12.680> doesn't

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
the ground the ground clearance doesn't

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.100 
the ground the ground clearance doesn't
look<00:05:13.160> like<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.310> lot<00:05:13.580> from

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
look like a lot from

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.680 
look like a lot from
this<00:05:14.200> video<00:05:14.500> but<00:05:15.250> it's<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.520> lot<00:05:15.700> it's<00:05:15.940> it's<00:05:16.540> a

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
this video but it's a lot it's it's a

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.250 
this video but it's a lot it's it's a
good<00:05:17.040> maybe<00:05:18.040> 77<00:05:19.000> inches<00:05:19.240> or<00:05:19.420> more<00:05:19.600> around

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
good maybe 77 inches or more around

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.010 
good maybe 77 inches or more around
clearance<00:05:20.850> so<00:05:21.850> it's<00:05:22.210> like<00:05:22.420> nice<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.690> high

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
clearance so it's like nice and high

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.320 
clearance so it's like nice and high
it's<00:05:23.260> not<00:05:23.410> too<00:05:23.590> low<00:05:23.800> so<00:05:24.640> there's<00:05:24.880> a<00:05:24.940> realistic

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
it's not too low so there's a realistic

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.180 
it's not too low so there's a realistic
review<00:05:28.330> of<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:31.440> 2013<00:05:32.440> Nissan<00:05:32.590> Altima<00:05:33.040> I've

hope it helps I definitely think you

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.200 
hope it helps I definitely think you
should<00:05:59.110> go<00:05:59.350> try<00:05:59.620> one<00:05:59.830> of<00:05:59.860> these<00:06:00.070> for<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:00.940> price

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
should go try one of these for the price

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.090
