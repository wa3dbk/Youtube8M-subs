00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
always going to be a little bit of a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280 
always going to be a little bit of a
body<00:01:05.009> image<00:01:05.339> problem<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.149> me<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.509> you<00:01:07.259> know

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

body image problem with me and you know
I<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.549> loose<00:01:08.700> skin<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
all of that but I think it's a matter of

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.440 
all of that but I think it's a matter of
looking<00:01:11.280> beyond<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
looking beyond all of that and just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
looking beyond all of that and just
being<00:01:12.990> healthy<00:01:13.290> every<00:01:13.920> day<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.520> saying

being healthy every day and like saying
that<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.869> work<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.200> 14-hour<00:01:16.799> days

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that I can work like 14-hour days

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
that I can work like 14-hour days
without<00:01:17.369> being<00:01:17.729> tired<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
without being tired I think that's the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.649 
without being tired I think that's the
most<00:01:19.229> important<00:01:19.770> thing<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.360> it's<00:01:21.360> about

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
most important thing so it's about

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.620 
most important thing so it's about
eating<00:01:22.049> right<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.369> exercising<00:01:24.149> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
trying to be you know trying to try and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.219 
trying to be you know trying to try and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
I think as soon as you get some of that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.570 
I think as soon as you get some of that
into<00:01:33.929> your<00:01:33.990> life<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.039> automatically

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
into your life I think you automatically
