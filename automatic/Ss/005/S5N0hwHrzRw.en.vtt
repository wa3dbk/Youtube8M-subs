first of all let me see you you you you

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.309 
first of all let me see you you you you
you<00:00:01.979> build<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.550> system<00:00:02.730> for<00:00:03.629> watching<00:00:04.200> the

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
you build a system for watching the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.020 
you build a system for watching the

Tendo system the FPGA can't actually
lock<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:33.960> right<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:41.120> yes<00:00:42.200> and<00:00:43.200> it's

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
lock to it right so the yes and it's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.090 
lock to it right so the yes and it's

works fine it kind of just ignores the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.670 
works fine it kind of just ignores the
lack<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.649> sync<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.329> chip<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.410> doing

and this and this this device assumes

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.660 
and this and this this device assumes
that<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.530> proper<00:01:02.010> signal<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.489> must

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that if it's not a proper signal it must

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.609 
that if it's not a proper signal it must
be<00:01:02.789> some<00:01:02.940> other<00:01:03.120> format<00:01:03.539> right<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
be some other format right and so it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.479 
be some other format right and so it
turns<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> off

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
turns it off

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.000 
turns it off
well<00:01:06.119> tries<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.260> whatever<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.710> getting

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
well tries to use whatever it's getting

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.399 
well tries to use whatever it's getting
and<00:01:08.189> whatever<00:01:08.340> for

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
and whatever for

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.260 
and whatever for
so<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> had<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.950> use<00:01:10.979> something<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.820> had<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
so you had to use something you had to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.600 
so you had to use something you had to
use<00:01:12.420> cues<00:01:12.780> besides<00:01:13.350> position<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> screen

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
use cues besides position on the screen

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.899 
use cues besides position on the screen
to<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:16.350> stuff<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> work<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.460> benefited

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
to get stuff to work we benefited

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.580 
to get stuff to work we benefited
because<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.479> an<00:01:18.689> entirely<00:01:18.990> horizontally

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
because it's an entirely horizontally

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
because it's an entirely horizontally
scrolling<00:01:19.860> game<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> lot<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
scrolling game so a lot of the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700 
scrolling game so a lot of the
information<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> x

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
information we can just get the x

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.990 
information we can just get the x
coordinate<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> use<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.880> make

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
coordinate and use that to make

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.359 
coordinate and use that to make
decisions<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.930> also<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.650> one<00:01:25.860> trick<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.189> used

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
decisions we also but one trick we used

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.340 
decisions we also but one trick we used
is<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.850> notice<00:01:27.090> there's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> black<00:01:28.080> bar

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
is that you notice there's a black bar

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
is that you notice there's a black bar
it<00:01:28.950> separates<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.460> frame<00:01:29.729> mm-hmm<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it separates the frame mm-hmm we have a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
it separates the frame mm-hmm we have a
method<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:30.869> detecting<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.490> can

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
method for detecting that so that we can

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
method for detecting that so that we can
compare<00:01:32.970> where<00:01:33.210> else<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.720> relative<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
compare where else was not relative to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.039 
compare where else was not relative to
that<00:01:35.000> okay<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.450> still<00:01:36.689> creates<00:01:36.869> some

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that okay but it still creates some

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.319 
that okay but it still creates some
problems<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.619> sometimes<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.850> for

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
problems because sometimes think of for

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.640 
problems because sometimes think of for
example<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.780> literally<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.229> visible<00:01:40.560> at

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
example it's literally not visible at

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.179 
example it's literally not visible at
all<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> screen

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
all on the screen

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.810 
all on the screen
uh-huh<00:01:42.530> what's<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> what's<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.579> gray

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
uh-huh what's the what's the little gray

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.330 
uh-huh what's the what's the little gray
tail<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> brown<00:01:45.840> tail<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.409> tan<00:01:46.649> tail<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> see

tail or the brown tail or tan tail I see

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:58.490 
tail or the brown tail or tan tail I see
to<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.460> left<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.149> some<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:56.810> see<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.200> good

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
to the left of some of the I see so good

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.080 
to the left of some of the I see so good
job<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.280> yellow<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:04.009> I'm<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.340> red<00:02:05.520> lines<00:02:05.820> on

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
job so yellow and I'm the red lines on
there<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.420> are<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.780> indication<00:02:07.649> that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
there then are the indication that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.850 
there then are the indication that
you're<00:02:07.920> near<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.399> enemy<00:02:08.879> enemy<00:02:09.060> right<00:02:09.509> oh<00:02:09.860> that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you're near of enemy enemy right oh that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.110 
you're near of enemy enemy right oh that
is<00:02:10.979> striking<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> color<00:02:11.670> that's<00:02:11.970> only

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
is striking for a color that's only

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.729 
is striking for a color that's only
found<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.660> Cuba<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.110> component<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
found in the Cuba and the component and

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.530 
found in the Cuba and the component and
the<00:02:13.860> title<00:02:14.129> screen<00:02:14.280> which<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.760> thinks<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.480> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the title screen which it thinks it's a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:27.979 
the title screen which it thinks it's a
giant<00:02:15.840> enemy<00:02:26.180> we<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.480> node<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.810> where

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
giant enemy we have one node to where

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.740 
giant enemy we have one node to where
you<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.520> basically<00:02:30.000> just

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you can see so this is basically just

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.020 
you can see so this is basically just
what<00:02:31.650> mario<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.160> scene<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:33.360> looking<00:02:33.750> at

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
what mario of the scene is looking at

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.750 
what mario of the scene is looking at
the<00:02:36.030> green<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.019> parts<00:02:37.459> which<00:02:38.459> we'll<00:02:38.610> see

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the green for the parts which we'll see

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.430 
the green for the parts which we'll see
in<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.849> minute<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.810> yellow<00:02:40.019> for<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> brakes

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
in a minute the yellow for the brakes

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.880 
in a minute the yellow for the brakes
and<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.680> reference<00:02:41.010> numbers<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:42.470> see<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.739> this

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
and the reference numbers I see so this

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.130 
and the reference numbers I see so this
is<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:45.000> stripped-down<00:02:45.569> view<00:02:46.050> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
is this is the stripped-down view of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.949 
is this is the stripped-down view of
what<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.470> AI<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.830> using<00:02:47.459> pretty<00:02:47.790> much<00:02:48.650> huh

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.199 

and<00:02:53.069> importantly<00:02:54.069> we<00:02:54.310> only<00:02:54.459> look<00:02:54.760> at<00:02:54.879> certain

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
and importantly we only look at certain

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.550 
and importantly we only look at certain
areas<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.689> screen<00:02:56.049> where<00:02:56.230> we<00:02:56.260> know<00:02:56.409> things

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
areas of the screen where we know things

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.039 
areas of the screen where we know things
matter<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.219> like<00:02:57.519> for<00:02:58.120> example<00:02:58.150> for<00:02:58.689> a<00:02:58.719> Goomba

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
matter so like for example for a Goomba

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.399 
matter so like for example for a Goomba
detection<00:03:00.599> there's<00:03:01.599> like<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> color<00:03:02.290> that

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
detection there's like a color that

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.289 
detection there's like a color that
shows<00:03:02.620> up<00:03:02.769> only<00:03:03.069> in<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.189> goombas<00:03:03.579> but<00:03:03.939> it<00:03:04.120> also

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
shows up only in the goombas but it also

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.619 
shows up only in the goombas but it also
might<00:03:04.959> show<00:03:05.200> up<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.379> some<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.829> bricks<00:03:06.629> but

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
might show up in some of the bricks but

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.479 
might show up in some of the bricks but
we're<00:03:07.780> only<00:03:07.870> looking<00:03:08.200> at<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.980> certain

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
we're only looking at like a certain

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.729 
we're only looking at like a certain
number<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.939> certain<00:03:10.569> range<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.989> X<00:03:11.230> pixels<00:03:11.650> in

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
number a certain range of X pixels in

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.289 
number a certain range of X pixels in
the<00:03:11.829> screen<00:03:12.129> for<00:03:12.340> when<00:03:12.459> we<00:03:12.579> want<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.819> act<00:03:13.000> upon

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
the screen for when we want to act upon

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.750 
the screen for when we want to act upon
things<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:14.260> same<00:03:14.469> thing<00:03:14.650> goes<00:03:14.799> for<00:03:14.829> like<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
things the same thing goes for like the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.000 
things the same thing goes for like the
yellow<00:03:16.060> also<00:03:16.329> shows<00:03:16.629> up<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:16.900> Mario<00:03:17.230> in

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
yellow also shows up in Mario in

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.920 
yellow also shows up in Mario in
addition<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.549> edges<00:03:18.849> of<00:03:18.969> walls<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:19.840> we

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
addition to the edges of walls but we

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.059 
addition to the edges of walls but we
don't<00:03:20.079> want<00:03:20.200> Mario<00:03:20.409> to<00:03:20.500> keep<00:03:20.650> trying<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.040> jump

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
don't want Mario to keep trying to jump

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.050 
don't want Mario to keep trying to jump
over<00:03:21.370> himself

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
over himself

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.330 
over himself
so<00:03:22.629> only<00:03:22.750> looking<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:23.170> add<00:03:23.769> pixels<00:03:24.189> to<00:03:24.310> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
so only looking to add pixels to the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.890 
so only looking to add pixels to the
right<00:03:24.549> America<00:03:27.450> very<00:03:28.450> interesting

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.320 

like<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.830> can't<00:03:34.159> play<00:03:34.280> again

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.040 

let's

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.350 

Casey<00:03:41.050> hit<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.440> reset<00:03:41.890> let<00:03:42.520> me<00:03:42.610> have<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
Casey hit the reset let me have the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.790 
Casey hit the reset let me have the
start<00:03:43.660> button<00:03:43.900> on<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.170> controller<00:03:44.560> is

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
start button on the controller is

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.360 
start button on the controller is
directly<00:03:45.220> connected<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.910> switch<00:03:46.030> and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
directly connected to a switch and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.199 
directly connected to a switch and
emulated<00:03:48.370> they<00:03:48.490> can<00:03:48.640> fill<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:48.940> mean<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
emulated they can fill I mean the

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.850 
emulated they can fill I mean the
control<00:03:49.569> on<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.780> NES<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.260> very<00:03:50.470> simple<00:03:50.770> it's

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
control on the NES is very simple it's

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.140 
control on the NES is very simple it's
basically<00:03:51.750> then<00:03:52.750> 8-bit<00:03:53.910> parallel<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.000> serial

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
basically then 8-bit parallel to serial

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.479 
basically then 8-bit parallel to serial
shift<00:03:55.510> register<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.739> we<00:03:56.920> basically<00:03:57.190> just

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
shift register so we basically just

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.199 
shift register so we basically just
recreated<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.330> controller<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.010> FPAA<00:04:00.430> FPGA

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
recreated a controller and the FPAA FPGA

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.120 
recreated a controller and the FPAA FPGA
toggles<00:04:01.780> buttons<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.500> want<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.739> control

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
toggles buttons like you want to control

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.400 
toggles buttons like you want to control
our<00:04:03.190> orange<00:04:03.520> go<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.080> register<00:04:05.080> merge<00:04:05.230> then

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
our orange go to the register merge then

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.530 
our orange go to the register merge then
gets<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.860> Danny<00:04:06.040> yes<00:04:06.220> well<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:07.120> got<00:04:07.300> hit

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
gets that to Danny yes well we got hit

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.150 
gets that to Danny yes well we got hit
so<00:04:07.959> this<00:04:08.110> is<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.680> complaining

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
so this is this is complaining

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:23.270 
so this is this is complaining
completely<00:04:09.640> automatically

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:53.070 

doesn't<00:04:24.280> usually<00:04:24.370> die<00:04:24.639> first

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.820 

oh<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.620> got<00:04:53.979> caught<00:04:54.250> in<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:55.319> trap<00:04:56.319> that's<00:04:56.590> the

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
oh I got caught in the trap that's the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:04.160 
oh I got caught in the trap that's the
trail<00:04:57.129> that's<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.639> hardest<00:04:57.970> part<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.300> think

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.690 

because<00:05:04.680> we're<00:05:04.800> basically<00:05:04.950> just<00:05:05.340> holding

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
because we're basically just holding

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.220 
because we're basically just holding
down<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:06.000> right<00:05:06.150> arrow<00:05:06.420> key<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.750> whole<00:05:06.990> time

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
down the right arrow key the whole time

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.380 
down the right arrow key the whole time
or<00:05:07.440> just<00:05:08.190> going<00:05:08.370> as<00:05:08.490> fast<00:05:08.670> as<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:09.030> can<00:05:09.180> and

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
or just going as fast as you can and

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.880
