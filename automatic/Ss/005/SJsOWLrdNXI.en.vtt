now I want to talk about the cure for
the<00:02:43.050> bacon<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.250> cure<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:44.670> essentially

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
the bacon so the cure it's essentially

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.030 
the bacon so the cure it's essentially
salt<00:02:46.670> but<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.880> also<00:02:48.300> adding<00:02:48.600> sugar<00:02:49.020> um

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
salt but I'm also adding sugar um

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.500 
salt but I'm also adding sugar um
the<00:02:50.340> mixture<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.970> salt<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.480> sugar

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the mixture of the salt and the sugar

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.960 
the mixture of the salt and the sugar
gives<00:02:52.290> them<00:02:52.440> much<00:02:52.650> nicer<00:02:53.070> balance<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.670> just

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
gives them much nicer balance it just

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.390 
gives them much nicer balance it just
doesn't<00:02:54.330> make<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.690> only<00:02:54.900> taste<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.800> salt<00:02:56.130> you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400

know and both salt and sugar draw

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.520 
know and both salt and sugar draw
moisture<00:02:59.820> out<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> meat<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.900> that's<00:03:01.380> what

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
moisture out of the meat and that's what

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.949 
moisture out of the meat and that's what
you<00:03:01.650> want<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.040> preserve<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.580> meat<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:02.970> but

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
you want to preserve the meat really but

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.350 
you want to preserve the meat really but
you<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.410> also<00:03:04.530> add<00:03:04.739> other<00:03:04.950> things<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:06.150> give<00:03:06.269> it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
you can also add other things to give it

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.030 
you can also add other things to give it
flavor<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.019> that's<00:03:07.110> what<00:03:07.320> I've<00:03:07.440> done<00:03:07.650> I've

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
flavor and that's what I've done I've

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.160 
flavor and that's what I've done I've
used<00:03:08.670> quite<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.239> few<00:03:09.540> herbs<00:03:09.959> are<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.320> sage<00:03:10.790> and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
used quite a few herbs are you sage and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.110 
used quite a few herbs are you sage and
bay<00:03:13.170> leaf<00:03:13.410> but<00:03:14.010> also<00:03:14.160> some<00:03:14.430> garlic<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.060> some

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
bay leaf but also some garlic and some

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.050 
bay leaf but also some garlic and some
peppercorns<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.230> if<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.190> use<00:03:17.400> herbs<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
peppercorns and if you use herbs and

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.960 
peppercorns and if you use herbs and
spices<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.680> good<00:03:19.830> idea<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.280> add<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> bit<00:03:20.820> of

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
spices it's a good idea to add a bit of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.720 
spices it's a good idea to add a bit of
oil<00:03:21.299> in<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.989> mixture<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.070> whole<00:03:23.250> flavors

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
oil in the mixture so the whole flavors

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.400 
oil in the mixture so the whole flavors
chemical<00:03:24.299> better<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:24.989> just<00:03:25.290> apply

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
chemical better and then you just apply

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:50.870 
chemical better and then you just apply
that<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.850> meat

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:13.430 

you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.649 

you

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.779 

so<00:04:18.659> we're<00:04:18.810> done<00:04:18.989> with<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> bacon<00:04:19.709> cut<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.609> and

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
so we're done with a bacon cut it and

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.050 
so we're done with a bacon cut it and
put<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.650> with<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.770> cure<00:04:23.039> into<00:04:23.520> tapa<00:04:23.789> we're

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
put it with the cure into tapa we're

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.390 
put it with the cure into tapa we're
trying<00:04:24.659> to<00:04:24.750> get<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.990> salt<00:04:25.259> everywhere<00:04:26.129> and

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
trying to get the salt everywhere and

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.640 
trying to get the salt everywhere and
now<00:04:26.970> we<00:04:27.300> just<00:04:27.449> leave<00:04:27.659> it<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.080> fridge<00:04:28.319> for

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650
