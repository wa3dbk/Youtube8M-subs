00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.960 
period in paragraph wow that's cool so
I'm<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.620> turn<00:02:45.010> off<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> software<00:02:45.700> now

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
I'm going to turn off the software now

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.610 
I'm going to turn off the software now
and<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.470> filled<00:02:48.190> up<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.490> number<00:02:49.240> of<00:02:49.620> sentences

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
and I I filled up a number of sentences

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.940 
and I I filled up a number of sentences
here<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.490> like<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.670> now<00:02:52.770> one<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.800> the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
here just like that now one of the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.280 
here just like that now one of the
things<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:54.700> can<00:02:55.150> then<00:02:55.330> do<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.840> may<00:02:56.140> not

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
things that I can then do is it may not

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.199 
things that I can then do is it may not
have<00:02:56.500> spelled<00:02:56.800> everything<00:02:56.950> accurately<00:02:57.489> right

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
have spelled everything accurately right

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.210 
have spelled everything accurately right
so<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.810> can<00:02:59.350> then<00:02:59.380> go<00:03:00.280> back<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.330> use<00:03:01.630> a

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
so I can then go back and I can use a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.800 
so I can then go back and I can use a
speech<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.489> check<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.000> sound<00:03:04.239> quality<00:03:04.690> on

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
speech to check the sound quality on

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.890 
speech to check the sound quality on
this<00:03:04.989> so<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.920> have<00:03:06.190> set<00:03:06.430> up<00:03:06.459> my<00:03:06.760> speech<00:03:07.480> engine

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
this so I have set up my speech engine

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.580 
this so I have set up my speech engine
already<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.830> that<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.040> can<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:10.660> listen<00:03:11.440> to

said<00:03:39.070> with<00:03:39.400> visualized<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.330> think<00:03:40.630> what<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.900> want

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
said with visualized I think what I want

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.830 
said with visualized I think what I want
to<00:03:41.230> say<00:03:41.350> is<00:03:41.500> with<00:03:41.739> um<00:03:41.950> with<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.820> visual<00:03:43.299> process

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
to say is with um with a visual process

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.370 
to say is with um with a visual process
so<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.489> in<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.760> context<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.630> would<00:03:47.170> just

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
so in that in that context I would just

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.720 
so in that in that context I would just
say<00:03:47.620> uh<00:03:48.120> with<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.150> visual<00:03:49.690> process<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.580> will

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
say uh with a visual process and it will

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.460 
say uh with a visual process and it will
and<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.420> will<00:03:52.510> fix<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.110> can<00:03:53.590> do<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.070> like<00:03:54.580> so

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
and it will fix it I can do that like so

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.229 
and it will fix it I can do that like so
so<00:03:56.470> this<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.799> an<00:03:56.920> integrated<00:03:57.250> system<00:03:57.400> would

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
so this is an integrated system would

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.060 
so this is an integrated system would
you<00:03:58.360> like<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.600> give<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> try<00:03:59.110> sure<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.860> a

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
you like to give it a try sure in a

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.830 
you like to give it a try sure in a
typical<00:04:00.489> system<00:04:00.670> we<00:04:01.090> will<00:04:01.239> have<00:04:01.299> trained<00:04:01.720> you

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
on how to use this and it will be

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.830 
on how to use this and it will be
familiar<00:04:03.160> with<00:04:03.489> your<00:04:03.670> voice<00:04:03.880> so<00:04:04.540> we<00:04:04.720> would

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
dyslexic ironically because we use it

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.940 
dyslexic ironically because we use it
all<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.250> time<00:06:29.370> but<00:06:30.380> this<00:06:31.380> is<00:06:31.530> a<00:06:31.560> way<00:06:31.710> that<00:06:31.890> you

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
all the time but this is a way that you

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.140 
all the time but this is a way that you
can<00:06:32.070> work<00:06:32.190> around<00:06:32.310> it<00:06:32.520> and<00:06:32.610> it<00:06:32.729> shows<00:06:32.910> how<00:06:33.090> you

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
can work around it and it shows how you

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.700 
can work around it and it shows how you
can<00:06:33.270> use<00:06:33.510> assistive<00:06:33.810> technology<00:06:34.470> to<00:06:34.620> be

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
can use assistive technology to be

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.740 
can use assistive technology to be
independent<00:06:35.310> even<00:06:35.400> in<00:06:35.729> the<00:06:35.850> setup<00:06:36.060> of<00:06:36.300> other

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
independent even in the setup of other

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.420 
independent even in the setup of other
assistive<00:06:37.260> technology<00:06:37.740> so<00:06:37.979> I<00:06:38.010> think<00:06:38.130> for<00:06:38.280> that

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
assistive technology so I think for that

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.640 
assistive technology so I think for that
one<00:06:38.580> we<00:06:38.669> get<00:06:38.790> a<00:06:38.820> fist<00:06:39.000> bound<00:06:39.210> yeah<00:06:39.930> all<00:06:40.260> right<00:06:40.440> I

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
one we get a fist bound yeah all right I

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.560 
one we get a fist bound yeah all right I
think<00:06:41.220> we're<00:06:41.460> done<00:06:41.580> for<00:06:41.610> today<00:06:41.850> thank<00:06:42.510> you
