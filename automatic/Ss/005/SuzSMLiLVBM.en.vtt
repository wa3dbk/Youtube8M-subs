actually it's seek him safe got this in
the<00:00:15.299> mail<00:00:15.450> today<00:00:16.580> it's<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.699> four<00:00:18.300> kilograms

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.660 

it's<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> same<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.650> prime<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.310> just

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it's the same as prime this is just

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.109 
it's the same as prime this is just
basically<00:00:27.660> dried<00:00:28.019> out<00:00:28.199> prime<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
basically dried out prime this is the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.519 
basically dried out prime this is the
stuff<00:00:30.359> that's<00:00:30.599> normally<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.260> prime

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
stuff that's normally in the prime

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.319 
stuff that's normally in the prime
liquid<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:34.460> now<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.670> call<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:35.940> seek

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
liquid and now they just call it seek

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.530 
liquid and now they just call it seek
him<00:00:36.510> safe<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:42.090> best<00:00:42.239> stuff

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
him safe so this is like the best stuff

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.889 
him safe so this is like the best stuff
that<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.670> four<00:00:44.670> kilograms<00:00:45.210> treats

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that you can get four kilograms treats

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.959 
that you can get four kilograms treats
up<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:47.510> 800,000<00:00:48.510> gallons<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:50.280> I'm<00:00:50.550> never<00:00:50.760> going

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
up to 800,000 gallons so I'm never going

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
up to 800,000 gallons so I'm never going
to<00:00:51.030> need<00:00:51.210> dechlorinator<00:00:51.899> again<00:00:54.800> go<00:00:55.800> ahead<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to need dechlorinator again go ahead and
