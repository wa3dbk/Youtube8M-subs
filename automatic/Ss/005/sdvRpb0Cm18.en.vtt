them<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:49.850> here<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.969> go<00:00:51.649> now<00:00:53.570> here<00:00:54.570> I'll<00:00:55.440> be

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
them on now here we go now here I'll be

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.709 
them on now here we go now here I'll be
twelve<00:00:56.190> running<00:00:57.320> just<00:00:58.320> open<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.890> later<00:01:01.190> okay

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
twelve running just open this later okay

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.320 
twelve running just open this later okay
nope<00:01:05.090> now<00:01:06.710> board<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.950> both<00:01:08.189> remotes<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
nope now board is both remotes at the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
nope now board is both remotes at the
same<00:01:09.540> time

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:35.800 

that<00:01:20.590> stuff<00:01:20.920> Punk<00:01:21.250> in<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.460> background

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.750 

now<00:01:37.510> here<00:01:38.510> is<00:01:38.750> my<00:01:39.549> Sevenfold<00:01:40.549> pneumatic<00:01:41.390> pump

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
now here is my Sevenfold pneumatic pump

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.810 
now here is my Sevenfold pneumatic pump
which<00:01:43.760> is<00:01:43.850> run<00:01:44.090> by<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.479> murder<00:01:45.430> connected<00:01:46.430> to

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
which is run by this murder connected to

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.100 
which is run by this murder connected to
down<00:01:47.330> there<00:01:47.630> there's<00:01:48.290> another<00:01:48.380> receiver<00:01:50.110> and

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
down there there's another receiver and

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.990 
down there there's another receiver and
that's<00:01:51.290> on<00:01:52.990> hurry

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.050 

yes<00:01:59.290> that's<00:02:00.290> close

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.130 

settles<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:08.239> pretty<00:02:08.420> quickly<00:02:08.690> as<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:08.989> can

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
settles it up pretty quickly as you can

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.990 
settles it up pretty quickly as you can
hear<00:02:09.380> from<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.580> tone<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.269> motor<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:13.370> this

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
hear from the tone of the motor and this

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.400 
hear from the tone of the motor and this
is<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.750> release<00:02:15.320> valve<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:21.110> let<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
is just a release valve to not let the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.080 
is just a release valve to not let the
motor<00:02:21.590> work<00:02:22.130> itself<00:02:24.550> all<00:02:25.550> going<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.030> be

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
motor work itself all going to be

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.080 
motor work itself all going to be
controlled<00:02:26.569> in<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.860> end<00:02:28.010> when<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.489> finished

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
controlled in the end when it's finished

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.050 
controlled in the end when it's finished
oops<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.340> we're<00:02:31.459> going<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.640> be<00:02:31.700> controlled

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
oops so we're going to be controlled

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.670 
oops so we're going to be controlled

joysticks bloody great it's going to be
group<00:03:18.109> up<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:19.989> these<00:03:20.989> are<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> electric

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
group up so these are the electric

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:22.780 
group up so these are the electric
switches<00:03:21.950> there's<00:03:22.549> going<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.730> be

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790

waiting some parts from brick link and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.120 
waiting some parts from brick link and
that<00:03:28.250> will<00:03:28.880> proceed<00:03:29.690> clickers

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
that will proceed clickers

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.720 
that will proceed clickers
and<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.940> allows<00:03:32.210> it<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.600> go<00:03:32.840> one<00:03:33.020> way<00:03:33.520> put<00:03:34.520> that

idea<00:03:34.850> from<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:35.420> book<00:03:35.630> here<00:03:37.360> excellent<00:03:38.360> book

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
idea from this book here excellent book

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.670 
idea from this book here excellent book
like<00:03:39.020> a<00:03:39.050> Bible<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.090> can<00:03:41.330> control<00:03:41.680> two

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
like a Bible so I can control two

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.580 
like a Bible so I can control two
switches<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:44.660> with<00:03:44.780> three<00:03:45.020> motors<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.470> can

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
switches and with three motors I can

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.280 
switches and with three motors I can
control<00:03:45.890> six<00:03:46.250> pneumatic<00:03:46.820> switches<00:03:47.290> it's

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
control six pneumatic switches it's

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:58.180 
control six pneumatic switches it's
going<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.560> be<00:03:48.650> brewing

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.250 

you
