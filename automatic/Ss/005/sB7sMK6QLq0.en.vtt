I can't exactly source where I thought
it<00:00:17.220> probably<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:17.640> reddit<00:00:17.910> or<00:00:18.000> something<00:00:18.359> but

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
it probably was reddit or something but

gun<00:00:36.930> locks<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.559> live<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.399> Connecticut<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
gun locks I live in Connecticut and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.479 
gun locks I live in Connecticut and
these<00:00:39.149> are<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:40.230> mandatory<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.129> they<00:00:41.280> when

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
these are like mandatory when they when

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.160 
these are like mandatory when they when
you<00:00:41.610> buy<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> gun<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.570> come<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.930> ones

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
you buy a gun like they come with ones

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.279 
you buy a gun like they come with ones
so<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> bunch<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> these<00:00:44.309> lying<00:00:44.579> around

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
so I have a bunch of these lying around

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.139 
so I have a bunch of these lying around
so<00:00:47.450> it's<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.860> best<00:00:49.860> lock<00:00:50.219> or<00:00:50.969> anything

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
so it's not the best lock or anything

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.450 
so it's not the best lock or anything
just<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.840> normal<00:00:52.170> key<00:00:52.620> lock<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> I'm<00:00:53.160> sure<00:00:53.309> it's

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
just a normal key lock and I'm sure it's

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
just a normal key lock and I'm sure it's
super<00:00:53.640> easy<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.000> pick<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.480> whatever<00:00:54.719> it's

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
super easy to pick but whatever it's

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.410 
super easy to pick but whatever it's
mostly<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:55.980> keep<00:00:56.370> honest<00:00:56.730> people<00:00:56.760> honest<00:00:57.239> if

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
mostly just keep honest people honest if

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.180 
mostly just keep honest people honest if
you<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> help<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.070> lock

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you want to help if you want to lock

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.020 
you want to help if you want to lock
your<00:00:59.370> helmet<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> your<00:00:59.940> bike<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.969> find<00:01:02.969> that

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
your helmet to your bike so I find that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
your helmet to your bike so I find that
this<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.329> actually<00:01:03.690> probably<00:01:04.290> better<00:01:04.619> than

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
this is actually probably better than

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.270 
this is actually probably better than
the<00:01:05.390> pennant<00:01:06.390> locks<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.979> attached

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the pennant locks you see that attached

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.390 
the pennant locks you see that attached
to<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:09.860> handlebars<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.100> something

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to like your handlebars or something

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.870 
to like your handlebars or something
like<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:12.260> or<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> stock<00:01:14.400> ones<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
like that or like the stock ones that

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.539 
like that or like the stock ones that
come<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.150> bike<00:01:15.330> sometimes<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.890> only<00:01:17.189> hook<00:01:17.369> on

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
come in bike sometimes that only hook on

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.010 
come in bike sometimes that only hook on
to<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.820> actual<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:20.280> chinstrap<00:01:20.659> so<00:01:21.659> because

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to the actual the chinstrap so because

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
to the actual the chinstrap so because
this<00:01:22.110> goes<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.530> way<00:01:22.619> around<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.220> can't

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
this goes all the way around you can't

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.190 
this goes all the way around you can't
really<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.000> mean<00:01:24.330> sure<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.689> could<00:01:24.900> cut<00:01:25.049> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
really I mean sure you could cut this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.460 
really I mean sure you could cut this
still<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.740> whatever<00:01:26.720> now<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.200> word<00:01:28.350> of

this area if you have a real gas tank

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.870 
this area if you have a real gas tank
area<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.490> where<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.729> usually

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
area you know like where they usually

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.690 
area you know like where they usually
are<00:01:48.590> because<00:01:49.590> I've<00:01:49.799> heard<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.369> fumes

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
are because I've heard that the fumes

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
are because I've heard that the fumes
from<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> gasoline<00:01:51.600> might<00:01:51.990> deteriorate<00:01:52.380> your

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
from the gasoline might deteriorate your

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.959 
from the gasoline might deteriorate your
helmet<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.649> that's<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:56.250> no<00:01:56.490> bueno

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
helmet and that's just no bueno

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.780 
helmet and that's just no bueno
so<00:01:57.409> I<00:01:58.409> mean<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.159> could<00:01:59.310> there's<00:01:59.490> plenty<00:01:59.729> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
so I mean you could there's plenty of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.130 
so I mean you could there's plenty of
other<00:01:59.909> places<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.329> probably<00:02:00.420> lock<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
other places you probably lock it up to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.490 
other places you probably lock it up to
your<00:02:01.259> bike<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.689> yeah<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.930> if<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> got<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> bunch

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
your bike but yeah so if you got a bunch
