 you have to download is completely 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.149
 many do not know we're going to go here 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.070
 where it says free books is not a 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.330
 application is a website that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.550

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.720
 safari right now I'm going to teach you how to 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.480
 do what 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.090
 and we're going to put this on this page 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.790

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.390
 Do not worry if this does not reach to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.370
 see well I'll leave it in the description 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.530
 so I'm going to check the description for 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.690
 that you see how is the url that you have to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.700
 enter from your device this is 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.310
 very important does not have to be from your 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.260
 pc since we are going to download it from the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.150
 same device so we're not going to 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.920
 need the pc for nothing and good since 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.510
 let's enter this website for 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.340
 create direct access to our 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.350
 springboard we're going to go to the little arrow 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.060
 down here that I am pressing is 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.190

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.369
 arrows to go back and to 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.860
 forward in the bar below this continues 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.890
 icon that when we tap it we will 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.509
 seem to share it by mail twitter or 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 facebook and good we will care nothing 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.960

 that we are inside this page 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.330

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.140
 well I know that you give a lot of you 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.360
 they are not interested in what we are interested in 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.040
 we will find it here where 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.270
 steve jobs 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.310
 I've been testing this page and it has 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.020
 countless books as you can see here 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.270
 I got four titles from steve jobs 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.250
 and good to me, the one that interests me is this 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.620
 that we all want to read good all 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.620

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.490
 the book that we go to 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.200
 interest we are going to give tap once 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.880
 we have given him a tape in the center 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.870
 to look like what is the description of 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.700
 book and we will appear two types of 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.590
 buttons one that says report and one that says 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.810
 says download to the bottom part 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 it also says download on pc and download 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.520
 free to that do not do anything 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.110
 because they are pure advertising that 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.210
 let's pay attention to us the one 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.880
 says download the one that has the button here 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.160
 blue we are going to give tap we are going to give 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.680
 a tap and it's going to look like it's going to open 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.200
 another internet page here how can you 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.400
 see you do not have to do anything only 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.380
 you have to wait, you do not have to give 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.970
 here where it says download how can you 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.700
 look here below and expect a 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.680
 moment in a moment will be redirected to 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.790
 the download page this is only 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.840
 advertising the page to earn more 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.489
 money 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.140
 the money from the books because as 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.400
 can see us give it to us like this 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.470
 that we have to wait a little bit 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.750
 take a long time as you can see here already 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.370
 charged and this is going to be the page the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.200
 true page where we're going to 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.660
 download good as we have 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.310
 redirected here in the part of 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.769
 left we will be able to see the name 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.090
 Book the size of the book when 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.829
 it went up and when I download it I do not know 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.109
 that is that and good what we 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.840
 interesting is what it says download 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.090
 now we are going to give him tap and how can you 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.850
 see us open another page we're going to 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.120
 close this page that opened us and we 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.740
 let's go again to direct to the page 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.830
 what we were in that is this 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.990
 says yes picture 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.070
 then we are waiting for it to end 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.070
 load the data 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.110
 ready once you finished loading the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.210
 data on the page is a bit slow 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.070
 that's why I did not leave it and I made that brief 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.320
 cut will look something like this 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.510
 here the name of the book appears 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.100
 size and most importantly in the part 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.440
 top right we have where it says 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.990
 open in ivoox and we will press 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.120
 here and it will redirect us to ibooks 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.010
 As you can see, I downloaded these 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.110
 from harry potter to test them to see what 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.120
 They served and worked well for me 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.100
 pretty good and good here already opens us 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.230
 the book that we download as you can see 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.760
 this is the cover of the book if we 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.730
 we perform from left to right 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.620
 will open the book and here we have 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.960
 and what is the synopsis of the book this 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.430
 we are already inside the book as 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.150
 you can see it 's completely in Spanish 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.850
 and 100% free here shows us a little 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.040
 what he says is for book and good here 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.900
 we are already inside the book is the 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.820
 biography of steve jobs the characters 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.710
 I would highly recommend this book already 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.780
 I had read a few times and I 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.890
 it seemed quite interesting and good 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.660
 as you can see in the bottom 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.850
 says 17 of 2,342 pages how can you 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.990
 observe the book comes complete so 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.180
 it's not a farce of this 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.430
 and you will be able to read it the times that 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.710
 you want us to see what if 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.740
 we close ibooks and we open it again 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.120
 here are going to be our books 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.950
 completely free and as I tell you again 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.480
 and here they are not going to move from here 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.370
 I have these two harry potter and the one 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.620
 steve jobs and every time we open it we're going 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.840
 to leave this application where 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.610
 We were reading for us to take 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.440
 He loses none of our books 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.970
 and well this has been all for the video 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.570
