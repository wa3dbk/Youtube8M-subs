who<00:00:45.989> will<00:00:46.110> tell<00:00:46.350> students<00:00:47.300> 98%<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.950> they<00:00:49.950> will

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
who will tell students 98% but they will

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.549 
who will tell students 98% but they will
leave<00:00:50.309> 2%<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.140> student

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
leave 2% out so when the student

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.810 
leave 2% out so when the student
actually<00:00:52.680> tries<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:54.140> it<00:00:55.140> doesn't<00:00:55.410> work

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
actually tries to do it it doesn't work

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
actually tries to do it it doesn't work
it<00:00:56.820> has<00:00:57.180> something<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.719> territory

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it has something to do with territory

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.950 
it has something to do with territory
that<00:00:58.800> I've<00:00:59.070> worked<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.730> hard<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.329> find<00:01:00.600> these

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that I've worked so hard to find these

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.560 
that I've worked so hard to find these
things<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:02.280> I'm<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> give<00:01:03.329> them

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
things that I'm not going to give them

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.250 
things that I'm not going to give them
away<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> silly<00:01:05.810> my<00:01:06.810> hope<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
away which is kind of silly my hope is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.539 
away which is kind of silly my hope is
that<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.340> video<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.860> actually<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.250> these

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that the video I actually like these

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.440 
that the video I actually like these
videos<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.270> craft<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.810> watched<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.200> lot<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.409> them

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
videos on craft I watched a lot of them

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.080 
videos on craft I watched a lot of them
they<00:01:15.450> always<00:01:15.659> give<00:01:15.930> me<00:01:16.080> ideas<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:19.729> think<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
they always give me ideas I think that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.719 
they always give me ideas I think that
there<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.780> many<00:01:22.140> ways<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.950> approach<00:01:23.369> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
there are many ways to approach this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.340 
there are many ways to approach this
topic<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.259> school<00:01:25.590> from<00:01:27.020> 1956<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
topic when I was in school from 1956 to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.969 
topic when I was in school from 1956 to

1960 Abstract Expressionism owned
painting<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.479> all<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> painting<00:01:34.320> classes<00:01:34.770> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
painting so all the painting classes I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.240 
painting so all the painting classes I
had<00:01:35.159> were<00:01:35.430> based<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.939> abstract<00:01:36.450> painting<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
had were based in abstract painting the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
had were based in abstract painting the
only<00:01:38.579> time<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.210> got<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
only time we have to got to see the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.069 
only time we have to got to see the
figure<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.650> drawing<00:01:40.979> class<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:42.390> much<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
figure was in drawing class so much of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
figure was in drawing class so much of
what<00:01:43.290> I'm<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> show<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> video

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
what I'm going to show you in the video

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.929 
what I'm going to show you in the video
is<00:01:45.000> actually<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:46.229> drawing<00:01:46.829> process<00:01:47.670> I've

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
is actually a drawing process I've

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.170 
is actually a drawing process I've
arrived<00:01:48.329> at<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.159> lead<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> painting

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
arrived at that can lead to a painting

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.100 
arrived at that can lead to a painting
so<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.520> try<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> treat<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> canvas<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.810> paper

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so I try to treat the canvas like paper

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.100 
so I try to treat the canvas like paper
I<00:01:55.470> push<00:01:55.860> pin<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.759> wall<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.119> my<00:01:57.210> studio<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
I push pin it on the wall of my studio I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.300 
I push pin it on the wall of my studio I
paint<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.490> stretch<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.390> later<00:02:01.310> people

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
paint them I stretch them later people

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
paint them I stretch them later people
have<00:02:02.430> always<00:02:02.549> said<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.030> me<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.420> can't<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.930> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
have always said to me you can't do that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.410 
have always said to me you can't do that
because<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.680> paint<00:02:05.100> will

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
because the paint will

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.680 
because the paint will
crack<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:06.280> found<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.670> if<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:07.970> stretch<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.660> a

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
crack I found that if you stretch on a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.589 
crack I found that if you stretch on a
rainy<00:02:09.319> day<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:10.399> humidity<00:02:10.940> goes<00:02:10.970> into<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
rainy day the humidity goes into the

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.140 
rainy day the humidity goes into the
canvas<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.319> stretched<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.890> canvas<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.700> I've

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
canvas you stretched the canvas and I've

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.380 
canvas you stretched the canvas and I've
never<00:02:14.330> had<00:02:14.540> one<00:02:14.780> crack<00:02:15.819> in<00:02:16.819> terms<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.260 
never had one crack in terms of the
tools<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:18.020> use<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.819> not<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.000> good

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
tools I use this is not a good

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.620 
tools I use this is not a good
explanation<00:02:20.599> but<00:02:21.319> I<00:02:21.560> like<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.100> use<00:02:22.370> tools<00:02:23.120> that

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
explanation but I like to use tools that

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
explanation but I like to use tools that
I<00:02:23.870> can't<00:02:24.170> control<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:25.069> sounds<00:02:26.030> backwards

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
I can't control it sounds backwards

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.530 
I can't control it sounds backwards
philosophically<00:02:27.650> but<00:02:28.150> what<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.300> tool<00:02:29.510> does

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
philosophically but what the tool does

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.070 
philosophically but what the tool does
for<00:02:30.080> me<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.830> work<00:02:31.700> much<00:02:31.970> faster<00:02:32.630> than<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.019> can

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
for me is work much faster than I can

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
for me is work much faster than I can
control<00:02:33.709> it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
control it

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.020 
control it
in<00:02:34.160> essence<00:02:34.940> works<00:02:35.360> faster<00:02:35.959> than<00:02:35.989> my<00:02:36.290> brain<00:02:37.030> my

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
in essence works faster than my brain my

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.420 
in essence works faster than my brain my
hope<00:02:38.300> in<00:02:38.480> this<00:02:38.630> process<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.739> will<00:02:39.950> hit<00:02:40.190> an

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
hope in this process is I will hit an

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.360 
hope in this process is I will hit an
accident<00:02:41.269> or<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:42.080> will<00:02:42.410> hit<00:02:42.560> something<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.250> I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
accident or I will hit something that I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.720 
accident or I will hit something that I
can<00:02:43.549> then<00:02:43.730> build<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.530> idea<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.280> find

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
can then build on so the idea is find

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.180 
can then build on so the idea is find
the<00:02:46.970> accident<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.690> then<00:02:48.049> build<00:02:48.319> on<00:02:48.470> top<00:02:48.769> and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
the accident and then build on top and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.850 
the accident and then build on top and
the<00:02:49.970> tools<00:02:50.269> are<00:02:50.569> useful<00:02:50.780> for<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.470> because

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
the tools are useful for that because

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.590 
the tools are useful for that because
they're<00:02:52.459> unorthodox

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
they're unorthodox

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.699 
they're unorthodox
they<00:02:54.200> are<00:02:54.319> not<00:02:54.470> typical<00:02:54.920> tools<00:02:56.230> when<00:02:57.230> American

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
they are not typical tools when American

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.830 
they are not typical tools when American
artist<00:02:58.010> approached<00:02:58.370> me<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.819> do<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.180> video<00:02:59.510> on

artist approached me to do the video on
how<00:03:00.769> I<00:03:00.799> work<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.989> hesitated<00:03:04.330> how<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.360> work<00:03:05.750> is
