underworld will finally look as we
always<00:00:32.070> imagined<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.700> could<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:33.200> we've<00:00:34.200> been

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
always imagined it could be we've been

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500 
always imagined it could be we've been
far<00:00:34.770> more<00:00:35.000> interested<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.090> getting<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
far more interested in getting the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.360 
far more interested in getting the
simulation<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> world<00:00:37.620> working<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
simulation of the world working and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.119 
simulation of the world working and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
getting all the gameplay aspects through

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.720 
getting all the gameplay aspects through
so<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.090> example<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:43.040> wanted<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
so for example we wanted to get the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.150 
so for example we wanted to get the
physics<00:00:45.300> simulation<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.200> getting<00:00:47.010> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
physics simulation in getting that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.459 
physics simulation in getting that
working<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> bridge<00:00:48.539> exploding<00:00:49.289> and

working so with the bridge exploding and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.760 
working so with the bridge exploding and
making<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.120> awesome<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.360> that's<00:00:52.170> an<00:00:52.469> actual

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
making that awesome and that's an actual

is really built as a 3d physics
simulation<00:01:19.920> system<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.880> for

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
simulation system that's what it's for

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.090 
simulation system that's what it's for
its<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.330> building<00:01:21.689> 3d<00:01:21.930> environments<00:01:22.619> with

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
its for building 3d environments with

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.920 
its for building 3d environments with

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
other with physics this is sort of the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
other with physics this is sort of the
core<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.990> where<00:01:28.290> we're<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.770> game

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
core of where we're going with this game

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.490 
core of where we're going with this game
is<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.670> game<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.020> simulation

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is this game is the kind of simulation

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.219 
is this game is the kind of simulation
one<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> strengths<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> unity<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
one of the strengths of unity is the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.280 
one of the strengths of unity is the
rapid<00:01:34.740> implementation<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.060> rapid<00:01:36.570> iteration

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
rapid implementation and rapid iteration

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.359 
rapid implementation and rapid iteration
so<00:01:38.040> compared<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> other<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.119> engines<00:01:39.659> unity<00:01:40.229> is

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
so compared to other in engines unity is

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
so compared to other in engines unity is
extremely<00:01:41.369> fast<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:42.060> implementing<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
extremely fast at implementing and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410 
extremely fast at implementing and
reiterating<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.640> came<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
reiterating so when it came when it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.330 
reiterating so when it came when it
comes<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.869> game<00:01:46.079> development<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.950> designing

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
comes to game development and designing

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.030 
comes to game development and designing
games<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:48.000> big<00:01:48.689> important<00:01:49.290> part<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.829> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
games a big important part of it is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.149 
games a big important part of it is
going<00:01:50.909> back<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.509> re<00:01:51.960> polishing<00:01:52.649> Andrey

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
going back and re polishing Andrey

going back and re polishing Andrey
polishing

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.580 

gives<00:01:57.240> us<00:01:57.390> environment<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.140> very<00:01:58.350> quickly

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
gives us environment we can very quickly

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.840 
gives us environment we can very quickly
build<00:01:59.070> pretty<00:01:59.790> complex<00:02:00.590> logical<00:02:01.610> systems<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
build pretty complex logical systems and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.180 
build pretty complex logical systems and
test<00:02:03.450> them<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.660> a<00:02:03.720> 3d<00:02:03.990> environment<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.740> that's

test them in a 3d environment and that's

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.370 
test them in a 3d environment and that's
kind<00:02:05.400> of<00:02:05.430> fun<00:02:05.670> too<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.120> because<00:02:07.080> we're<00:02:07.230> doing

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
kind of fun too and because we're doing

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.660 
kind of fun too and because we're doing
a<00:02:07.410> lot<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.530> experimental<00:02:08.160> stuff<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.580> it

a lot of experimental stuff if it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.460 
a lot of experimental stuff if it
doesn't<00:02:08.790> work<00:02:09.150> we<00:02:09.780> haven't<00:02:10.050> lost<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.290> lot<00:02:10.440> of

doesn't work we haven't lost a lot of

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.750 
doesn't work we haven't lost a lot of
work<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.800> throw<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.100> out<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.370> try<00:02:11.520> something

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
work we throw it out and try something

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.940 
work we throw it out and try something
