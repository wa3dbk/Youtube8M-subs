00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.700
 welcome to a new video tutorial 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.390
 how we stayed in the last we were 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.490
 working on the 25s pf now we are going to 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.609
 show a technique called watch or 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.220
 washing let's see two ways to do it 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.380
 There are several ways to do it but not 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.570
 we're just going to show only two the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.850
 idea is to make an effect like that 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.620
 you can see here 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.110
 we paint this piece 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.450
 previously with a March spray 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.150
 silver and the idea was to rescue all 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.030
 these details that have in this part 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.770
 how can you see 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.770
 I do not know what the idea of ​​this technique is 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.300
 make a solution that has a pigment 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 and what to spread the hard 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.390
 in the piece and that is introduced 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.399
 in the bas-reliefs for that we're going to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.670
 show them two ways to make them like 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.350
 I already mentioned one we are going to occupy this 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 material called walnut extract that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.150
 it's a bit complicated to get to 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.340
 cantiles 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.000
 but you can find in some stores 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.960
 of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.020
 of craftsmanship in it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.060
 in the pink neighborhood to find several 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.600
 craft stores that have paintings 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 Acrylics that have various materials 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.820
 all to be crafts 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.740
 well this is a powder that I know 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:42.470
 mix with water and dilute 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.470
 and how can you see how taking color 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.190
 the thanks of this one 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.490
 of the walnut extract that generates a color 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.390
 coffee that if you apply it on the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.010
 metal 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.250
 It gives a very good rust effect 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.230
 solidad is that with the brush well 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.940
 we use this piece and we use it 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.320
 but let's show them to the model side 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.320
 the idea is that 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.560
 here you do not have to be precise to my partner 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.010
 nothing 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.709
 one passes the brush trying to make everyone 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.970
 low reliefs full of the 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.970
 walnut extract 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.180
 as you can see there is no figure of 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.630
 nations or delicacy in doing this 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.630
 technique 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.940
 later when this piece dries 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.670
 with content 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.260
 we are going to go over and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.660
 let's remove all the excess 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.390
 paint and will only be what 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.940
 is in the bas-relief and there goes to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.590
 everything is marked as is here 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.070
 we can see us we mark a 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.070
 piece here 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.030
 there we go removing a little paint 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.030
 which is below 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.380
 another way to do this same technique 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.380
 It is with acrylic paint 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.050
 we go 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.980
 here we have a little clinical structure 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.980
 can occupy any brand 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.240
 I want to think a little 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.180
 we get some acrylic paint 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.480
 like this technique 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.530
 very little paint is practically occupied 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.300
 it takes a lot of water 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.810
 the idea is that it is the most beautiful 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.810
 possible 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.090
 and we do exactly the same 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.460
 as our piece and we go with 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.360
 filling with this wash of paint 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.360
 acrylic that we made 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.459
 this technique serves both to make the 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.060
 aging effect and can serve 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.850
 also to make the effect of panels 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.870
 even me in this piece did a mix 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.790
 of walnut extract and the mixture of 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.060
 acrylic paint and it worked super well 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.360
 here for example 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.700
 is done with that way and it served 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.040
 to do the panel I read and it's very little a 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.310
 aged effect that is generated 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.150
 in both once the paint dries one 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.400
 passes the coton and pto 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.640
 and we finish with our effect the idea 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.730
 is that the whole painting under the relief and 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.620
 you can to highlight them the 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.010
 textures or details you may have 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:03.890
 the piece that we are that we are 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.890
 decorating the detail 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.340
 we mark 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.340
 the idea is that 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.500
 in that way 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.860
 can clearly see all the 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.900
 details that they have as we paint it 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.260
 a single color if you are going to lose a lot of 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.260
 those details 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.029
 that would be the video review sorry the 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.740
 video tutorial of this opportunity we are going 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:39.990
 to continue showing how we finish these 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.819
 mock-ups and giving some other tips 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.819
 See you in the next tutorial
