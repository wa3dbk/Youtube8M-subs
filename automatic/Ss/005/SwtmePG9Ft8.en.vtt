white I'm trying to figure out if this
is<00:02:02.070> something<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> big

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is something because we have a big

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.789 
is something because we have a big
international<00:02:04.020> audience<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> is

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
international audience if this is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.429 
international audience if this is
something<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.670> exists<00:02:06.180> elsewhere<00:02:06.390> mmm

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
something that that exists elsewhere mmm

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.040 
something that that exists elsewhere mmm
so<00:02:07.819> egg<00:02:08.819> beaters<00:02:09.209> are<00:02:09.330> basically<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:09.869> egg

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so egg beaters are basically what egg

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.199 
so egg beaters are basically what egg
whites

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
whites

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.860 
whites
they're<00:02:11.590> preprocessor<00:02:13.450> colored<00:02:14.450> yellow<00:02:14.629> to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
they're preprocessor colored yellow to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.869 
they're preprocessor colored yellow to
make<00:02:14.989> them<00:02:15.170> look<00:02:15.379> like<00:02:15.439> eggs<00:02:15.799> you<00:02:16.730> know

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
make them look like eggs you know

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.289 
make them look like eggs you know
they're<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> egg<00:02:17.299> whites<00:02:17.569> right<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.370> don't

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
they're the egg whites right so I don't

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.670 
they're the egg whites right so I don't
have<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.510> separate<00:02:20.900> egg<00:02:21.049> yolk<00:02:21.969> yeah<00:02:23.500> great

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.319 

probably<00:02:27.680> true<00:02:27.889> I<00:02:28.639> don't<00:02:28.879> know<00:02:29.030> where<00:02:29.180> it's

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
probably true I don't know where it's

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.179

obviously<00:03:10.040> we're<00:03:10.519> gonna<00:03:10.579> do<00:03:11.469> Stewart's<00:03:12.469> first

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
obviously we're gonna do Stewart's first

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.409 
obviously we're gonna do Stewart's first
we're<00:03:13.010> gonna<00:03:13.069> do<00:03:13.280> 1/2<00:03:13.370> ounce<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:13.969> egg<00:03:14.120> beaters

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
we're gonna do 1/2 ounce of egg beaters

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.599 
we're gonna do 1/2 ounce of egg beaters
and<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.629> guess<00:03:18.079> legs<00:03:18.379> is<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.400> what<00:03:19.519> the

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
and it's I guess legs is that what the

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:20.789 
and it's I guess legs is that what the
half<00:03:19.819> ounce<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.150> two<00:03:20.269> eggs

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
half ounce is two eggs

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.680 
half ounce is two eggs
really<00:03:21.799> that's<00:03:21.949> right<00:03:22.370> there's<00:03:22.579> two<00:03:22.760> eggs<00:03:22.940> no

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
really that's right there's two eggs no

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.509 
really that's right there's two eggs no
no<00:03:23.870> good<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.680> don't<00:03:24.919> think<00:03:25.069> so

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
no good I don't think so

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.159 
no good I don't think so
cuz<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.150> would<00:03:26.239> be<00:03:26.359> really<00:03:26.780> weird<00:03:27.019> 1/2<00:03:27.139> cup

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
cuz that would be really weird 1/2 cup

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.300 
cuz that would be really weird 1/2 cup
to<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:28.150> not<00:03:29.150> 1/2<00:03:29.389> cup<00:03:29.629> right<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.189> that<00:03:31.189> would

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
to it not 1/2 cup right here that would

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.629 
to it not 1/2 cup right here that would
be<00:03:31.370> straight<00:03:31.579> quarter<00:03:31.849> capital<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.299> 1<00:03:32.419> so

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
be straight quarter capital to 1 so

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.159 
be straight quarter capital to 1 so
we'll<00:03:34.639> just<00:03:34.819> keep<00:03:35.090> reusing<00:03:35.389> that<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:36.079> way

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
we'll just keep reusing that that way

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.349 
we'll just keep reusing that that way
we'll<00:03:36.319> get<00:03:36.409> all<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.639> of<00:03:37.639> course<00:03:37.849> this<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.239> all
