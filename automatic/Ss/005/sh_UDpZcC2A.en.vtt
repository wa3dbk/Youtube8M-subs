00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.039 

so<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.639> my<00:00:02.820> temperature<00:00:03.389> reader<00:00:03.689> and

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
so this is my temperature reader and

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.039 
so this is my temperature reader and
Grapher<00:00:04.730> you<00:00:05.730> say<00:00:05.970> there's<00:00:06.180> an<00:00:06.330> see<00:00:06.839> there's

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
Grapher you say there's an see there's

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.450 
Grapher you say there's an see there's
an<00:00:07.200> LCD<00:00:07.529> deplane

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
an LCD deplane

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.030 
an LCD deplane
thoughts<00:00:09.050> inside<00:00:10.050> temperature<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
thoughts inside temperature and the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.209 
thoughts inside temperature and the
outside<00:00:11.519> temperature<00:00:12.259> that's<00:00:13.259> acid<00:00:13.740> current

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
outside temperature that's acid current

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.630 
outside temperature that's acid current
and<00:00:14.790> then<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.509> plots<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> last<00:00:16.230> 48<00:00:16.890> hours<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
and then it plots the last 48 hours of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
and then it plots the last 48 hours of
the<00:00:18.449> temperature<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.410> see<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.800> been

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the temperature so you can see it's been

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.200 
the temperature so you can see it's been
a<00:00:19.949> nice<00:00:20.250> summer's<00:00:21.029> day<00:00:22.010> in<00:00:23.010> Trondheim<00:00:23.820> this

display I have an infrared touch
functions<00:00:45.360> yet<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> there's<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.579> outside

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
functions yet so there's a one outside

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.319 
functions yet so there's a one outside
probe<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.379> there's<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.309> inside<00:00:50.700> probe<00:00:51.090> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
probe and there's one inside probe it

updates<00:00:51.960> every<00:00:52.199> few<00:00:52.559> seconds<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.760> inside

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
updates every few seconds these inside

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.090 
updates every few seconds these inside
these<00:00:56.610> measurements<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.260> every<00:00:58.710> few

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
these measurements and then every few

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.770 
these measurements and then every few
minutes<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> lot<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> plot<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.660> that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
minutes it does a lot of plot so that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
minutes it does a lot of plot so that
you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.020> get<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> last<00:01:01.670> 24<00:01:02.670> hours<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> I'll

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you can get the last 24 hours and I'll

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.850 
you can get the last 24 hours and I'll
shoot<00:01:03.270> me<00:01:03.420> 48<00:01:03.750> hours<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:05.240> temperature<00:01:06.240> data

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
shoot me 48 hours of temperature data

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.830 
shoot me 48 hours of temperature data
it's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> little<00:01:08.159> bit<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.369> noise<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.600> seems

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it's a little bit of noise but it seems

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.109 
it's a little bit of noise but it seems
that<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> Sun<00:01:11.070> goes<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that as the Sun goes up and down the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.899 
that as the Sun goes up and down the
temperature<00:01:12.570> varies<00:01:12.990> quite<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> bit<00:01:13.670> I'm<00:01:14.670> very

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
temperature varies quite a bit I'm very

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
temperature varies quite a bit I'm very
pleased<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:16.470> now

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
pleased with this is now

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
pleased with this is now
maintenance-free

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.560 

so<00:01:25.450> it's<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.690> Raspberry<00:01:26.200> Pi<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:28.090> connected<00:01:28.540> to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
so it's a Raspberry Pi it's connected to

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.090 
so it's a Raspberry Pi it's connected to
Wi-Fi<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.380> can<00:01:29.530> also<00:01:29.680> read<00:01:30.070> the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
Wi-Fi so you can also read the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.120 
Wi-Fi so you can also read the
temperature<00:01:30.690> by<00:01:31.690> logging<00:01:32.140> on<00:01:32.290> or<00:01:32.590> externally

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
temperature by logging on or externally

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.650 
temperature by logging on or externally
also<00:01:33.490> from<00:01:33.790> outside<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:35.140> my<00:01:35.290> local<00:01:35.500> network<00:01:36.660> so

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
also from outside of my local network so

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.080 
also from outside of my local network so
I<00:01:37.720> can<00:01:38.020> log<00:01:39.010> on<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.430> see<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.730> temperature

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
I can log on and see the temperature

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.760 
I can log on and see the temperature
outside<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.630> inside<00:01:40.750> wherever<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.620> am<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.710> I

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
outside and inside wherever I am so I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.700 
outside and inside wherever I am so I
written<00:01:45.040> they<00:01:45.280> give<00:01:45.550> me<00:01:45.640> myself<00:01:46.150> later<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.560> a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
written they give me myself later it's a

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.640 
written they give me myself later it's a
self<00:01:48.090> regulating<00:01:49.090> vertical<00:01:49.960> scale<00:01:50.350> so<00:01:50.620> that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
self regulating vertical scale so that

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.950 
self regulating vertical scale so that
you<00:01:50.890> get<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.280> desired<00:01:52.000> resolution<00:01:52.270> even

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
you get the desired resolution even

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.580 
you get the desired resolution even
though<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.290> temperature<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:54.030> varying<00:01:55.030> quite

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
though the temperature is varying quite

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.420 
though the temperature is varying quite
dramatically<00:01:56.590> from<00:01:56.860> summer<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.250> winter

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
dramatically from summer to winter

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.479 
dramatically from summer to winter
