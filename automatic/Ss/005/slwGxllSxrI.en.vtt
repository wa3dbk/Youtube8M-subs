 how can you read about Russian 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.490

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.749

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.689
 default 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.239
 I recommend paying attention to the rink 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.930
 send no notice to 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.499

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.169
 do not send once and always 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.269
 do not send means that you will not 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.279
 receive notifications at all 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.709
