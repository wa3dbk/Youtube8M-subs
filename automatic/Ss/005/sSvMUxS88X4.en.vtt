00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the first half the day my energy level

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.110 
the first half the day my energy level
was<00:00:42.149> felt<00:00:42.450> quite<00:00:42.690> low<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> wasn't<00:00:43.590> hungry

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
was felt quite low but I wasn't hungry

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.529 
was felt quite low but I wasn't hungry
so<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> wasn't<00:00:46.070> interested<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.280> eating<00:00:48.239> food

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
so I wasn't interested in eating food

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.740 
so I wasn't interested in eating food
but<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> did<00:00:49.140> feel<00:00:49.350> very<00:00:49.640> quite<00:00:50.640> lethargic<00:00:51.360> so

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
but I did feel very quite lethargic so

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.420 
but I did feel very quite lethargic so
there's<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> bit<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> hill<00:00:52.590> involved<00:00:53.070> walking

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
there's a bit of a hill involved walking

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
there's a bit of a hill involved walking
from<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.610> end<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> farm<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.020> other

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
from one end of the farm to the other

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.889 
from one end of the farm to the other
here<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:57.420> found<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> quite<00:00:57.780> hard

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
here and I just found it quite hard

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
here and I just found it quite hard
going<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> hill<00:00:59.399> without<00:00:59.850> feeling<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> bit

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
going up that hill without feeling a bit

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.189 
going up that hill without feeling a bit
tough<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.640> that's<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.730> sign<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.719> energy

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
tough so that's a sign that the energy

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
tough so that's a sign that the energy
of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.710> body<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> vital<00:01:05.339> force<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> going

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
of the body the vital force is going

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.649 
of the body the vital force is going
inside<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.960> doing<00:01:07.619> some<00:01:07.979> work<00:01:08.659> especially

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
inside and doing some work especially

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.420 
inside and doing some work especially
process<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.260> absence<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.619> hunger<00:01:10.950> there's<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
process in absence of hunger there's a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.620 
process in absence of hunger there's a
sure<00:01:11.610> sign<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> body's<00:01:12.270> doing<00:01:12.390> some

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
sure sign that the body's doing some

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
sure sign that the body's doing some
inner<00:01:12.810> healing<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> type<00:01:13.619> of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
inner healing and that's the type of

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.910 
inner healing and that's the type of
thing<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> we're<00:01:14.189> we're<00:01:14.670> looking<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
thing that we're we're looking for and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.359 
thing that we're we're looking for and
felt<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.100> better<00:01:17.189> obviously<00:01:18.979> after<00:01:19.979> lunch

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
felt a lot better obviously after lunch

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.950 
felt a lot better obviously after lunch
we<00:01:20.610> had<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.210> after<00:01:21.390> breakfast

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
probably had a little bit of a headache

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.069 
probably had a little bit of a headache
in<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.310> first<00:01:29.610> half<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> day<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.509> well<00:01:30.840> which
