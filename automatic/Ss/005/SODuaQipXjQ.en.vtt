00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.180
 that for xavi boys we are already in the day 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.160
 113 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.780
 that wind in flesh was great and my 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.400
 objective was the power bus so 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.240
 started to connect and I started practicing 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.240
 the set of the broken 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.190
 and then the set evolved fry 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.190
 caught 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.630
 all right 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:19.440
 then I'm practicing from football 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:23.420
 do a control and put a 6 and then 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.420
 try a froze and uche 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 later instead of trying a gel or 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.080
 normal I tried the gel or this one that fell 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.080
 on the opposite shoulder and you do davis 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.800
 then I wanted to learn the sky of co2 so 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.800
 that I spoke from head 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.979
 Thank you 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.270
 as I was already starting from the head 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.270
 tests of this mill 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.450
 Imagine 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.819
 now it's time to do it a little more 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:56.530
 difficult to make from hello and angel mill 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:58.269
 or elbow as I left halo 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.220
 all because I did not try it from shoulder 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.430
 so I started from angel head or from 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.430
 shoulder 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.690
 and later of angel or shoulder mill 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.720
 Y 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.620
 and at the end of everything, I tried to do 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.140
 a combination of everything that had 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.280
 done bone hello hello of cobo and hello 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.280
 shoulder from molina 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.880
 and already to finish stretching and now what 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.380
 last I did a little elche but when 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.209
 I had finished the training and I gave myself 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.680
 I realize that it 's magically coming out 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.599
 that is the day before I tried to do 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.160
 and it did not work out for me, I do not know, it's as if my 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.510
 body would have understood it as if 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.099
 I would have used it and I was super 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.810
 happy for that he had also learned 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.040
 a lot of gel types or if it's 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.330
 starting to control a lot the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.950
 shoulder that before not controlled 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.390
 absolutely nothing you gave me also to 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.160
 to do from mill to shoulder I did not dare 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.630
 so a super productive training and 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.360
 I think nothing good to you so far 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.989
 di 113 so see you tomorrow 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.989
 take care
