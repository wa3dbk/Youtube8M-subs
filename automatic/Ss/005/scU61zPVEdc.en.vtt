00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.930
 hello friends greets you high street and today 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.600
 I have the long-awaited gta colombia 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.140
 yes gentlemen the patch for the gta san 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.050
 andreas totally done by me and 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.029
 for some other pages that have 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.440
 also helped give the credits to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.090
 them good once we download the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.739
 link will be as always below in the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.989
 description a link that will direct you to 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.570
 my blogger there will find a link to 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.210
 mega once they enter the download 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.910
 all the files that exist there 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.330
 will be the files like these once 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.950
 that we say it already downloaded will be left 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.710
 so let's unzip the first 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.540
 part we will extract and once 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.820
 let's do this already decompress ourselves in 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.130
 These four parts game 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.519
 when we do it decompressed we 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.740
 will be a folder like this model what 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.530
 what we are going to do is that we must first 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.479
 have the gta san andreas totally 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 clean without any mode if the version 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.280
 above must re-install the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 gta san andreas and they had version 1 is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.860
 this version is not compatible with the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.930
 version 1 it is worth noting that we are going to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.950
 copy this mode folder is the one we're going to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.770
 cut and we're going to paste it here 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.229
 ok asks us if we want to replace 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.840
 let's say yes and move and replace 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.950
 ok once we've done this let's go 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.850
 to proceed to decompress this other 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.799
 folder that says gta with 1 then 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.649
 let's unzip the extract 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.159
 file and let's accept we hope that 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.829
 decompress us 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.079
 In case this is the folder that brings 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.909
 good the compressed file that brings the 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.670
 most of the parchís of this is more 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.810
 essential than the previous one although the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.149
 previous also has all the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.459
 textures then all are important 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.110
 more than all this the dlc are 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.750
 supplements of some things that I 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.580
 missing to integrate the patch but also 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.049
 they are necessary so to speak so that 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.629
 have a better gaming experience 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:20.470
 both of lcd come in the description 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.420
 I've already uploaded it, they're ready 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.950
 good this dlc 2 I already have it 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.560
 decompressed as you can see here already 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.570
 they are distracted we are going to copy everything 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.210
 everything you see here we give you 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.730
 control and we give you cut 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.410
 and we go to the folder our goal and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.310
 let's paste this here 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.659
 we give you replace all 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.409
 move a site to do this with 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:55.310
 the 19 complete do this with all 19 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.859
 and we hope that we install everything ok a 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.890
 Once we have done this we 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.890
 all this will be well 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.170
 let's install the dlc 1 that would be this 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.340
 for this we are going to need the following 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.069
 we go to the dlc 2 or exercises of the fingers 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.969
 also apart if you need it and 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.410
 let's open the al cis to cis and m &amp; g 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:31.230
 editor 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.390
 well here I have it ready and we are going to 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.910
 look for her show open 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.060
 let's find where we have installed 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.280
 our gta san andreas let's go to the 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.330
 folder models 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:49.050
 let's go to gta 3 img we hope that we 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.700
 load let's give it a go and let's go 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.380
 to find where we have downloaded 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.950
 our ls 1.0 that is already extracted 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.400
 then it is here games in macao 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.230
 clc1 and we will select everything and you 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.500
 let's open once we've done 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.750
 this we give here on facebook and 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.060
 we keep ok 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.790
 once we set this done let's give it 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.170
 open again here and we see the 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.670
 route where we have installed our 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.580
 gta and we go to gta iv nt then this will 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.050
 we give here in import again and we go 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.330
 to ls 2.0 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.960
 and you see the files that say here 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.960
 gta iv n we are going to select them 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.319
 everyone 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.340
 and we are going to open it then this we give 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:43.860
 store and will not be replaced and then 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.650
 of this we're going to open and we're going to 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.590
 give kristen is set is n 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.570
 then this we go we do the same 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.900
 let's give that 2 here we look for the 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.360
 folder as a replacement this is in 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.100
 we replace this is so they have a 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.340
 best game experience the truth is 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.979
 little things that I missed by integrating 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.009
 those those that are not in folder like 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:13.150
 you can see these these go in the 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:16.330
 of gta let's go again to file open iván 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.860
 and we give gta 3 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.379
 all those that are not in folders 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.639
 because they go here that we go to ls and 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:27.729
 we copy everything everything all everything everything is 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.610
 we are going to open and we are almost in green 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.060
 quoted just read the and we already 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.710
 they are saved after this we close 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.620
 we do not need it at all 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.449
 more here as you can see there is a folder 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.789
 of data this we are also going to copy 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.439
 that comes in the s2 folder too 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.939
 it is necessary for the images that 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.219
 in large and look prettier 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:51.610
 then we copy it here in the folder 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:54.159
 I read no no no no pardon sorry this 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.259
 it's for the helicopter sorry the data 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:59.439
 let's copy and replace copy and 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:01.830
 replace very well is necessary this is not 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:04.710
 very fixed some little things 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.360
 Well, after this, we're leaving now 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.070
 to the folder that is required 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.620
 we copy these files and copy them 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.080
 within the cle or of our objective san 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:18.090
 andreas from the cleo folder 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.129
 ok that of the dlc 11 no pardon of the dlc 2 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.650
 it says kernel these files are 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:25.200
 optional if you are going to install this I think 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.480
 that comes with it 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.960
 the file that runs out of gas at 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.800
 all that will not work 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.170
 missions this is yes if we activate this 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.270
 Missions may give you problems 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.640
 I'm going to install it to show you 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.800
 let's give it to copy and we'll 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.800
 install this in the folder san andreas 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:51.149
 in the folder that I read and we hit 

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:53.039
 once we have done this it is 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:55.919
 necessary if they are going to install this 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:58.889
 install this folder models simply 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.839
 we copied the entire mobile folder and the 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.229
 we paste in our gta san folder 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.229
 andreas 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:11.729
 she already with this we have our gta 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.709
 colombia fully installed dlc 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:16.499
 they are optional if they are not installed 

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:18.300
 rest assured that the patch likewise 

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:19.770
 It works normally without any 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.080
 inconvenient 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.509
 they are simply little details that 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.929
 they forgot about me 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:31.319
 add but they will be in version 3 that 

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:34.820
 will be in the future were 7 minutes of 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:36.530
 installation I hope you take it 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.170
 to pay attention and if not 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:43.280
 understand they return the video and so they are going to
