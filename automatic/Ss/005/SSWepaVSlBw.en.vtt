 the employers 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.640
 that social security is not to match their names or what is known as the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.640
 letters 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.379

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.100
 they put them in the trash in this way they expressed their annoyance and discontent 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.689
 frustration with the recent dismissals of workers of tuzsa javier davara

 be brand new clothes for tabÃ¡rez la pepa 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.569
 the concentration of protest 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:52.030
 occurred between the affordable uab 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.220
 It was Maria del Carmen who had been with the company for five years. 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.050
 they had in March but stayed a little longer to train that the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.510
 replaced I have five children 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.660

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.040
 the head of the family because I am divorced 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.450

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.540
 I work together with another 100 Chicago colleagues and the suburbs, all of them the

 pick up one side we put the entrance will have new calender life 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.920
 after years of searching for a new coach the famous letters do not 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.159
 more than social security 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.299
 began to arrive in December and indicate that there are discrepancies 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.040
 But for sure and the name of the employee the law obliges them to deliver the letter to the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.969
 employee 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.569
 nothing else to sign was using the letters to dismiss workers 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.499
 we think that is wrong the jaca chalk workers question the 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.009
 legality of these dismissals 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.670
 because the social security office itself and even a judge in california 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.200
 determined fifteen letters should not be used against workers who 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.579
 support us and that do not eat in pits abbot

 protest actions evoked how they will continue in chicago and the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.979
 suburbs 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.120
 we contacted the corporation of pisa young galaxy they told us that we 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.680
 they notified employees six months in advance and that since then 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.230
 They have tried to fulfill their obligations
