00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.410
 hi how are you today 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.809
 I share a new video about cats and the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.410
 Today 's topic is about feeding 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.020
 a cat this video was by request of 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.420
 yunis and jennifer velis so 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.220
 thank you very much for this request and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.260
 Well, a huge greeting for all 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 Well you and let's start 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.340
 with this good video as I had already 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.890
 said in another previous video the cats 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 they are pure carnivorous animals so 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.780
 they need to ingest large amounts of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.120
 protein and taurine acid in your diet 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.309
 daily below I share 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
 some factors that you have to have in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.980
 account when choosing the best 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.980
 option for your cat 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 i 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.410
 Y 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.410
 we start by choosing the type of food 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.080
 suitable according to the life stage of 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.040
 our cat for example the kittens 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.810
 small ones less than one year old 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.510
 they need more protein and fat during 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.270
 its development so at the moment of 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.920
 choose the food check the package 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.280
 say that food is special to 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.880
 small cats or ideal for cats 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.880
 any age 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.490
 in the same way when choosing the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.350
 food for your adult cat a cat 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.900
 adult is considered after the year of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.540
 age onwards it is important to review 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.670
 the package and make sure it says it's 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.300
 for adult cats or for cats 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.300
 any age 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.360
 what 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.549
 well now when your cat comes to the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.820
 aging stage already when your 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.399
 cat is older this is around 8 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.530
 years old your cat needs to eat from 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.080
 same way a meal that is special 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.810
 for older cats since they lose 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.569
 the ability of the intestine to digest 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.209
 proteins and fat then that affects 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.730
 much to their fur they become more 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.709
 quiet less active then it's because 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.200
 this that should be given a food that 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.100
 be special for older cats which 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.590
 must have a higher content of 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.370
 proteins and fats of high quality and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.370
 easily digested 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 Y 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.120
 dry food is in shape 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.490
 of croquettes I think of different sizes 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.010
 and compositions 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.420
 this is a balanced meal and a very 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 good option for a feeding 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.360
 Complete for your cat also the texture 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.910
 Crunchy help during chewing to 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.170
 the removal of dental plaque and with 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.270
 this type of food 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.270
 the cat will need to drink more water 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.950
 wet food we find it 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.080
 normally canned and this kind of 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.540
 food is usually everyone's favorite 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.520
 cats but it is not recommended that the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.590
 feeding your cat is based 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.590
 exclusively in tin foods 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.230
 You can also choose the food 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.870
 home which is ideal for alternating 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.530
 with dry food you can feed 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.680
 your cat with meat either roasted or cooked 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.370
 without bones or cooked fish and without 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.599
 thorns accompanied with some vegetable already 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.489
 be steam packed or with rice 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.290
 boiled when you feed your 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.239
 cat you do not have to put any salt 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.239
 let alone season it 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.130
 how much to eat my cat a good 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.730
 Healthy adult cat should weigh around 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.390
 of 8 pounds and it is recommended that you eat 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:29.050
 30 calories per pound a day so in 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.650
 average an 8-pound cat requires 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.600
 approximately 240 calories a day 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.330
 now usually dry food 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.090
 contains about 300 calories per 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.260
 cup and the canned food contains 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.890
 about 250 calories in each can 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.080
 of 6 ounces with this we can give us a 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.630
 idea of how much food we can give to 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.880
 our cat in the day but if you prefer 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.440
 You can also check the package of the 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.110
 food that your cat is giving you 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.630
 usually in the back they bring 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.250
 a table in which tells you how much 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.430
 amount you can give your cat 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.500
 depending on the weight or they can also 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.620
 ask the opinion of your veterinarian 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.620
 trust 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:17.610
 the first option is through the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.949
 free feeding that is when you 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.080
 Fill your container with food and you 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.999
 allows our cat eat everything 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.680
 want and at the time you want 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:27.870
 this method works very well with 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.029
 dry foods since they are not thrown out 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.789
 lose as quickly as 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:34.590
 wet food also this process 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.719
 works very well for people who 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.520
 They are not at home or they work and they do not 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.599
 they have the opportunity to feed them 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.599
 determine the hours 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.140
 Y 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.869
 Y 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:56.050
 the next option is programmed and 

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:58.479
 controlled this method is healthier 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.550
 since the amount of 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.909
 food that your cat is eating in 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.309
 every meal if you decide that your data follow 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:09.189
 a feeding schedule must eat 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:11.289
 either two or three times a day 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.769
 option can be either feed him 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:17.219
 in the morning at noon and finally in 

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:17.219
 the night 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.969
 so this is the information that they 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.459
 I have about feeding their cats 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.860
 I hope this video can be from 

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.259
 a lot of help let me know if they have 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.509
 Any question or comment and 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:46.919
 Well, we'll see you soon in the 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.919
 next video thanks
