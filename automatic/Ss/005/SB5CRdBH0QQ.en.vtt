00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.570 
below my lip and then once I've applied
that<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.500> going<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:04.069> blend<00:03:04.340> everything

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
that I'm just going to blend everything

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.420 
that I'm just going to blend everything
with<00:03:04.940> my<00:03:05.390> finger<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.049> can<00:03:06.230> also<00:03:06.440> use<00:03:06.830> a<00:03:07.100> kind

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
with my finger you can also use a kind

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.360 
with my finger you can also use a kind
of<00:03:07.549> a<00:03:07.900> brush<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.350> blend<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.799> but<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> find<00:03:10.250> that

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
of a brush to blend it but I find that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.830 
of a brush to blend it but I find that
using<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.790> brush<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.239> can<00:03:11.269> become<00:03:11.630> quite

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
using the brush it can become quite

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.870 
using the brush it can become quite
streaky<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:13.160> prefer<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.489> use<00:03:13.730> my

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
streaky so I just prefer to use my

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.030 
streaky so I just prefer to use my
fingers<00:03:14.269> but<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:15.049> can<00:03:15.230> go<00:03:15.380> ahead<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.769> use

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
fingers but you can go ahead and use

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.600 
fingers but you can go ahead and use
whatever<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.579> want

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.430 

so<00:03:23.610> I'm<00:03:23.670> going<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.000> cream<00:03:24.540> contour<00:03:25.050> with<00:03:25.319> the

in a really dark shade

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.100 
in a really dark shade
I<00:03:29.610> believe<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:30.270> actually<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.660> dog<00:03:30.840> cachet

I believe this actually the dog cachet

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.050 
I believe this actually the dog cachet
that<00:03:31.140> they<00:03:31.349> have<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.040> but<00:03:32.520> I'm<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.790> going<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.699 
my temples as well as my kind of jaw
line<00:03:41.060> as<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.239> can<00:03:42.390> see<00:03:42.569> I'm<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:42.959> applying<00:03:43.290> too

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
line as you can see I'm not applying too

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.710 
line as you can see I'm not applying too
much<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:44.400> because<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.700> have<00:03:45.030> run<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.390> mistake

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
much just because I have run the mistake

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.509 
much just because I have run the mistake
before<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.260> actually<00:03:46.560> applying<00:03:46.650> way<00:03:47.040> too<00:03:47.099> much

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
before of actually applying way too much

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.670 
before of actually applying way too much
because<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:48.569> dark<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.110> sometimes<00:03:49.560> it

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
because it is so dark and sometimes it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.860 
because it is so dark and sometimes it
can<00:03:49.769> look<00:03:49.890> really<00:03:50.160> kind<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.489> muddy<00:03:51.180> on<00:03:51.450> my<00:03:51.630> face

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
can look really kind of muddy on my face

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.770 
can look really kind of muddy on my face
so<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.140> did<00:03:52.410> decide<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.800> go<00:03:53.160> with<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.239> light<00:03:54.480> hand

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
so I did decide to go with a light hand

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.229 
so I did decide to go with a light hand
I<00:03:54.989> kind<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.290> wish<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.590> went<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.980> bit<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.060> did<00:03:57.180> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
I kind of wish I went a bit like I did a

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
absolutely horrendous but now I'm just

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.720

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
everything this is in the shade

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.830 
everything this is in the shade
I<00:04:29.940> believe<00:04:30.570> medium<00:04:31.140> /<00:04:31.560> dark<00:04:32.120> but<00:04:33.120> again<00:04:33.479> I<00:04:33.510> have

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
I believe medium / dark but again I have

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.270 
I believe medium / dark but again I have
to<00:04:34.020> apply<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.470> with<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.680> real<00:04:34.860> light<00:04:35.039> hand

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
to apply it with a real light hand

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.490 
to apply it with a real light hand
because<00:04:35.610> at<00:04:35.880> times<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.390> can<00:04:36.630> start<00:04:36.960> looking<00:04:37.350> a

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
because at times it can start looking a

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.969 
because at times it can start looking a
bit<00:04:37.680> ashy<00:04:38.479> but<00:04:39.479> I<00:04:39.720> actually<00:04:40.110> do<00:04:40.650> quite<00:04:40.890> like

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
bit ashy but I actually do quite like

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.219 
bit ashy but I actually do quite like
this<00:04:41.280> I've<00:04:41.430> been<00:04:41.550> using<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:42.000> for<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.630> few<00:04:43.200> weeks

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
this I've been using it for a few weeks

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.070 
this I've been using it for a few weeks
now<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.520> seems<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.789> be<00:04:44.880> setting<00:04:45.330> my<00:04:45.720> makeup

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
now and it seems to be setting my makeup

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.290 
now and it seems to be setting my makeup
really<00:04:46.380> well<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:47.010> then<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.640> set<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.970> rest<00:04:48.180> of

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
really well and then to set the rest of

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.570 
really well and then to set the rest of
my<00:04:48.419> face<00:04:48.690> I'm<00:04:48.900> using<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.440> Maybelline<00:04:49.770> fit<00:04:50.520> me

powder<00:04:50.880> in<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.419> shade<00:04:51.450> free<00:04:52.080> 55<00:04:52.770> coconut<00:04:53.340> as

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
powder in the shade free 55 coconut as

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.180 
powder in the shade free 55 coconut as
you<00:04:54.300> can<00:04:54.419> see<00:04:54.600> in<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.930> pan<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.470> was<00:04:55.620> super

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
you can see in the pan it was super

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.710 
you can see in the pan it was super
light<00:04:56.400> but<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.760> doesn't<00:04:57.000> really<00:04:57.120> provide<00:04:57.330> that

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
light but it doesn't really provide that

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.050 
light but it doesn't really provide that
much<00:04:57.900> coverage<00:04:58.410> so<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:59.039> kind<00:04:59.729> of<00:04:59.760> just<00:04:59.910> went

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
much coverage so I kind of just went

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.469 
much coverage so I kind of just went
with<00:05:00.270> it

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
with it

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.420 
with it
cuz<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:00.720> don't<00:05:00.840> really<00:05:01.050> own<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.590> part<00:05:01.889> of<00:05:02.100> it

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
cuz I don't really own a part of it

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.270 
cuz I don't really own a part of it
that's<00:05:02.669> exactly<00:05:03.270> in<00:05:03.389> my<00:05:03.419> shade<00:05:03.840> but<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.530> just

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
that's exactly in my shade but I just

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.650 
that's exactly in my shade but I just
applied<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.700> with<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:06.030> real<00:05:06.240> techniques

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
applied that with a real techniques

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.020 
applied that with a real techniques
powder<00:05:06.960> brush<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:08.430> decided<00:05:08.789> to<00:05:08.850> be<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:08.940> little

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
powder brush so decided to be a little

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.840 
powder brush so decided to be a little
bit<00:05:09.330> extra<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:10.020> use<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.530> sleek<00:05:10.979> contour<00:05:11.400> kit
