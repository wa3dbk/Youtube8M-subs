this<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.720> very<00:03:03.930> low<00:03:04.140> budget<00:03:05.300> but<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.360> think<00:03:06.570> it

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
this is very low budget but I think it

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.340 
this is very low budget but I think it
gets<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.959> point<00:03:06.990> across<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:09.140> success<00:03:10.140> with

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
gets the point across so success with

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.280 
gets the point across so success with
money<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.800> think<00:03:11.250> these<00:03:12.209> are<00:03:12.270> not<00:03:12.930> rocket

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
