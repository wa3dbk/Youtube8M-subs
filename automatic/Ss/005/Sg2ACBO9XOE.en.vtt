 we have a man worked in gronau 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.840
 and then thinking about it was blown away 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.470
 the town is good 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.440

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.050

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.050
 well that can always be 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.870
 what it is so beautiful in the mountains here 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.870
 What would you say that too? 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.120

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.750

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.300
 the old town the badhaus here and me 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.980
 must also say the house hits with the 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.850
 House Schlegel has the marketplace up 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.980

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.610
 So already from how optimally is one 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.610
 real profit behavior 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.949
 The question is exactly whether they are ours 

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:06.209
 foreign declaration of love to ipad 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.979
 they can just repeat 

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:09.979
 explanation to stop explaining 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:26.669

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:29.719
 in German so in one can stop 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.719
