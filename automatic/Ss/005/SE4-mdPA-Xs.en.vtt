so<00:00:35.090> I<00:00:35.149> thought<00:00:35.329> this<00:00:35.480> was<00:00:35.630> a<00:00:35.690> really<00:00:35.930> good

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
so I thought this was a really good

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.170 
so I thought this was a really good
start<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:37.309> visioning<00:00:37.730> I<00:00:37.880> couldn't

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
start to the visioning I couldn't

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.180 
start to the visioning I couldn't
complain<00:00:38.540> i<00:00:38.600> was<00:00:38.839> up<00:00:38.989> 1-nothing<00:00:39.320> already<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.129> i

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
complain i was up 1-nothing already so i

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.529 
complain i was up 1-nothing already so i
thought<00:00:40.370> it<00:00:40.550> wouldn't<00:00:40.760> be<00:00:40.879> not<00:00:41.059> bad<00:00:41.269> for<00:00:41.510> the

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
thought it wouldn't be not bad for the

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.000 
thought it wouldn't be not bad for the
rest<00:00:41.809> of<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.019> season<00:00:43.539> but<00:00:44.539> my<00:00:45.530> thoughts<00:00:45.800> were

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
rest of the season but my thoughts were

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.049 
rest of the season but my thoughts were
wrong<00:00:46.249> because<00:00:46.519> shortly<00:00:47.239> after<00:00:47.719> this<00:00:47.899> goal<00:00:49.059> he

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
wrong because shortly after this goal he

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.819 
wrong because shortly after this goal he
was<00:00:50.239> putting<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.780> lot<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:50.989> pressure<00:00:51.289> on<00:00:51.440> he<00:00:51.649> was

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
was putting a lot of pressure on he was

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.160 
was putting a lot of pressure on he was
just<00:00:52.370> passing<00:00:52.909> around<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.300> shot<00:00:53.839> after<00:00:53.989> shot

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
just passing around a shot after shot

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.470 
just passing around a shot after shot
and<00:00:54.589> finally<00:00:55.129> got<00:00:55.339> a<00:00:55.370> little<00:00:55.699> lucky<00:00:56.030> break

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
and finally got a little lucky break

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.139 
and finally got a little lucky break
after<00:00:56.929> my<00:00:57.079> defense<00:00:57.710> screwed<00:00:58.069> up<00:00:58.249> this<00:00:58.819> ran

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
after my defense screwed up this ran

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.790 
after my defense screwed up this ran
down<00:00:59.480> and<00:00:59.719> I<00:00:59.899> should<00:01:00.199> have<00:01:00.230> probably<00:01:00.440> rushed

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
down and I should have probably rushed

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.250 
down and I should have probably rushed
my<00:01:00.949> going<00:01:01.249> all<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.550> way<00:01:01.670> but<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:02.179> was<00:01:02.960> kind<00:01:03.140> of

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
my going all the way but I was kind of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.500 
my going all the way but I was kind of
changing<00:01:04.159> my<00:01:04.250> mind<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.610> lot<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:04.970> I<00:01:05.059> stopped<00:01:05.360> my

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
changing my mind a lot and I stopped my

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.770 
changing my mind a lot and I stopped my
bowl<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.020> he<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:06.320> finished<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.780> nothing

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
bowl and he just finished it so nothing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.320 
bowl and he just finished it so nothing
I<00:01:08.840> could<00:01:09.020> have<00:01:09.110> really<00:01:09.320> done<00:01:09.530> but<00:01:10.280> it's<00:01:10.910> 11

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
I could have really done but it's 11

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.000 
I could have really done but it's 11
after<00:01:11.510> that<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.080> I<00:01:12.110> decided<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:12.680> wanted<00:01:12.950> to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
after that so I decided I wanted to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.310 
after that so I decided I wanted to
score<00:01:13.310> again<00:01:13.610> but<00:01:14.240> unfortunately<00:01:14.390> he<00:01:15.050> just

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
score again but unfortunately he just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.410 
score again but unfortunately he just
kept<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.800> putting<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.250> pressure<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:17.180> guy

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
kept on putting the pressure this guy

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.450 
kept on putting the pressure this guy
this<00:01:17.990> guy<00:01:18.110> knew<00:01:18.320> what<00:01:18.350> he<00:01:18.470> was<00:01:18.680> doing<00:01:18.890> another

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
this guy knew what he was doing another

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.280 
this guy knew what he was doing another
header<00:01:19.760> than<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.120> rebound<00:01:20.810> he<00:01:21.020> just<00:01:21.200> had

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
header than a rebound he just had

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.320 
header than a rebound he just had
players<00:01:21.560> everywhere<00:01:22.040> my<00:01:22.700> defense<00:01:23.090> couldn't

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
players everywhere my defense couldn't

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.719 
players everywhere my defense couldn't
handle<00:01:23.720> it

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
handle it

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.609 
handle it
I<00:01:25.729> gave<00:01:26.359> him<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.570> 2-1<00:01:26.929> lead<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.350> at<00:01:27.469> this

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
I gave him the 2-1 lead and at this

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.649 
I gave him the 2-1 lead and at this
point<00:01:27.890> I'm<00:01:28.070> really<00:01:28.340> disappointed<00:01:28.490> because<00:01:29.210> I

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
point I'm really disappointed because I

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.630 
point I'm really disappointed because I
want<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.229> win<00:01:30.380> my<00:01:30.500> first<00:01:30.740> game<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:31.219> Division

want to win my first game in Division

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.069 
want to win my first game in Division
eight<00:01:31.789> but<00:01:32.000> unfortunately<00:01:32.600> it's<00:01:32.750> not<00:01:32.810> going

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
eight but unfortunately it's not going

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.980 
eight but unfortunately it's not going
as<00:01:33.469> I<00:01:33.950> planned<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.610> not<00:01:35.060> even<00:01:35.090> too<00:01:35.570> long<00:01:35.750> after

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
as I planned and not even too long after

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.499 
as I planned and not even too long after
you<00:01:36.350> go<00:01:36.560> he<00:01:37.130> gets<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.520> third<00:01:37.789> goal<00:01:38.060> right<00:01:38.210> here

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
you go he gets a third goal right here

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.330 
you go he gets a third goal right here
with<00:01:38.689> this<00:01:38.840> shot<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.469> think<00:01:39.740> it's<00:01:39.859> a<00:01:39.979> rebound

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
with this shot I think it's a rebound

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.389 
with this shot I think it's a rebound

that<00:01:55.520> early<00:01:55.939> in<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.060> game<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.799> then<00:01:58.009> all<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.250> a

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
that early in the game and then all of a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.279 
that early in the game and then all of a
sudden<00:01:58.429> my<00:01:59.060> defense<00:01:59.599> screwed<00:01:59.780> up<00:01:59.899> again<00:02:00.020> he

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
sudden my defense screwed up again he

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.529 
sudden my defense screwed up again he
just<00:02:00.439> kept<00:02:00.619> tackling<00:02:01.069> running<00:02:01.459> forward<00:02:01.939> saw

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
just kept tackling running forward saw

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.770 
just kept tackling running forward saw
an<00:02:02.689> opportunity<00:02:02.840> we'd<00:02:03.829> crossed<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.819> wide

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
an opportunity we'd crossed it in wide

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.929 
an opportunity we'd crossed it in wide
open<00:02:06.170> again<00:02:06.409> my<00:02:06.590> defense<00:02:07.069> all<00:02:07.280> rushed<00:02:07.729> across

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
open again my defense all rushed across

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.669 
open again my defense all rushed across
her<00:02:08.360> at<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.569> same<00:02:08.780> time<00:02:08.989> I<00:02:09.049> guess<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.530> was<00:02:09.590> my

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
her at the same time I guess that was my

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.680 
her at the same time I guess that was my
thought<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:10.069> was<00:02:10.280> telling<00:02:10.549> my<00:02:11.120> defenders<00:02:11.660> to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
thought I was telling my defenders to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.870 
thought I was telling my defenders to
rush<00:02:11.989> because<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.440> was<00:02:12.590> not<00:02:12.860> expecting<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.610> cross

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
rush because I was not expecting a cross

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.550 
rush because I was not expecting a cross
at<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.329> point<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.780> looked<00:02:14.959> like<00:02:15.049> he<00:02:15.230> was<00:02:15.349> for

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
at that point it looked like he was for

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.069 
at that point it looked like he was for
sure<00:02:15.799> gonna<00:02:16.010> take<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> shot<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.000> he<00:02:17.840> took<00:02:18.019> the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
sure gonna take a shot but he took the

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.229 
sure gonna take a shot but he took the
cross<00:02:18.440> either<00:02:18.829> way<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.130> i'm<00:02:19.250> down<00:02:19.459> for<00:02:19.519> one<00:02:20.030> so

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
cross either way and i'm down for one so

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.960 
cross either way and i'm down for one so
i<00:02:20.269> basically<00:02:20.810> almost<00:02:21.380> gave<00:02:21.769> up<00:02:21.799> i<00:02:22.220> got<00:02:22.400> one

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
i basically almost gave up i got one

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.210 
i basically almost gave up i got one
more<00:02:23.180> goal<00:02:23.480> here<00:02:23.750> with<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.860> took<00:02:25.069> the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
more goal here with so just took the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.670 
more goal here with so just took the
shot<00:02:25.459> right<00:02:25.670> after<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> through<00:02:26.329> ball<00:02:26.680> bottom

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
shot right after a through ball bottom

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.860 
shot right after a through ball bottom
corner<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.489> was<00:02:28.609> the<00:02:28.730> only<00:02:28.850> one<00:02:29.150> keeping<00:02:29.510> me

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
corner so it was the only one keeping me

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.979 
corner so it was the only one keeping me
in<00:02:29.989> this<00:02:30.139> game<00:02:30.350> partially<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:32.299> was<00:02:32.450> for<00:02:32.780> two

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
off the season 0 into I thought this

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.729 
off the season 0 into I thought this
using<00:04:18.000> aunty<00:04:18.299> would<00:04:18.419> be<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.570> good<00:04:18.780> deal<00:04:19.049> but<00:04:19.320> I

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
using aunty would be a good deal but I

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.830 
using aunty would be a good deal but I

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
penalties but this penalty decided to be

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.790 
penalties but this penalty decided to be
different<00:04:53.729> because<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.500> didn't<00:04:55.500> follow<00:04:55.710> my
