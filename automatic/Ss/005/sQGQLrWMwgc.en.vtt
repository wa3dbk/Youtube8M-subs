00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
and for the lead rope it has a little

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.660 
and for the lead rope it has a little
hook<00:02:05.289> so<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:05.740> can<00:02:05.890> hook<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.189> onto<00:02:06.340> the

hook so you can hook it onto the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.750 
hook so you can hook it onto the
noseband<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:12.930> that's<00:02:13.930> how<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.140> put<00:02:14.410> on

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
noseband like that that's how you put on

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.500 
noseband like that that's how you put on
the<00:02:15.760> adult<00:02:16.030> halters<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.790> full<00:02:18.970> holders<00:02:19.299> are

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
the adult halters the full holders are

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.860 
the adult halters the full holders are
even<00:02:20.140> easier<00:02:20.349> they'll<00:02:21.010> fit<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.400> all<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.629> molds

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
even easier they'll fit on all the molds

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.610 
even easier they'll fit on all the molds
of<00:02:22.930> foals<00:02:23.200> except<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:25.030> one<00:02:25.620> obviously

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
of foals except this one obviously

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.380 
of foals except this one obviously
because<00:02:27.310> its<00:02:27.489> foot<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.819> attached<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.120> his<00:02:28.269> now

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
because its foot is attached to his now

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.020 
because its foot is attached to his now
so<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.930> can't<00:02:29.200> let<00:02:29.349> a<00:02:29.379> halter<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.680> there<00:02:30.030> but

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
so you can't let a halter on there but

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.809 
so you can't let a halter on there but
it'll<00:02:31.269> sit<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.569> all<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.750> rest<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.049> them<00:02:33.420> so

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
it'll sit on all the rest of them so

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.059 
it'll sit on all the rest of them so
just<00:02:36.819> take<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> halter<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.470> put<00:02:38.859> it

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
just take the halter then you put it

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.240 
just take the halter then you put it
under<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.370> throat<00:02:39.640> latch<00:02:40.530> over<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.739> nose<00:02:41.890> and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
under the throat latch over the nose and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.150 
under the throat latch over the nose and
then<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.670> kind<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:44.579> pull<00:02:45.579> back<00:02:47.160> over

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
then you just kind of pull back over

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.030 
then you just kind of pull back over
that<00:02:48.780> glass<00:02:49.780> string<00:02:50.290> back<00:02:50.440> there<00:02:50.650> until<00:02:50.769> it

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
that glass string back there until it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.120 
that glass string back there until it
goes<00:02:51.160> over<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.489> ears<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.569> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
goes over the ears just like that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.949 
goes over the ears just like that
simulator<00:02:57.130> up<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.700> same<00:02:58.450> thing<00:02:58.480> as<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
simulator up is the same thing as the

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.059 
simulator up is the same thing as the
adult<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.319> just<00:02:59.500> took<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.650> on<00:02:59.859> to<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
adult you just took it on to the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.659 
adult you just took it on to the
noseband<00:03:02.040> sad<00:03:03.040> well<00:03:03.220> as<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.489> may<00:03:03.639> have

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
guessed is a little more complicated so

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.440 
guessed is a little more complicated so

first you take your saddle pad and you

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.080 
first you take your saddle pad and you
put<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:11.169> the<00:03:11.889> underside<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.760> saddle

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
put it on the underside of the saddle

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.559 
put it on the underside of the saddle
like<00:03:16.090> that

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.640 

and<00:03:19.109> put<00:03:19.379> it<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:20.969> this<00:03:23.870> then<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.379> pull

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
and put it on like this then you pull
