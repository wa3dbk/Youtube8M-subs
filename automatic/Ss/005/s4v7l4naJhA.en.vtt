00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.499
 it's hard to be French 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.750
 to be proud right now at brussels of 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:10.670
 to say to oneself this is my country wear the 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.410
 responsibility to decide to bury a 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.830
 regulation at European level 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:24.409
 all this to protect some ships 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:25.880
 deficit in addition we have today 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.439
 in europe the possibility of 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.759
 rid of a fishing method that 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.619
 is pretty mind-boggling which is called the 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.320
 deep water trawling are 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.670
 huge fishing nets that pass 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.590
 up to 2000 meters deep and which 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.780
 devastate absolutely everything they 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.519
 find that they are not selective 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.550
 obviously since the trawl is picking up 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.620
 everything is sorted on board the ship and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.239
 that obviously impacts directly the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.730
 bottom of the oceans because they are weighted 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.969
 and they are drawn so they scrape the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.649
 funds 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.570
 the problem obviously the method of 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.230
 fisheries and that in those ecosystems that 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.879
 are deprived of light life is unfolding 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.379
 everything is wrong or valentine since there is 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.839
 very little to eat it's cold 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.420
 it's obscure so animals in 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.009
 general live very long they get 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.460
 reproduce late in their cycle 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.380
 of life 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.299
 we aim for a fairly low fertility 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.100
 finally we really have one of 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.200
 features that are aligned for 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.570
 constitute one of the most 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.149
 fragile and least resilient to the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.009
 disturbance that exists on earth the 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.490
 trawling in deep water in devastating 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.229
 makes a genetic heritage that is 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.060
 common to humanity since this 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.680
 resource she belongs cave to thoune 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.049
 does not belong particularly to 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.630
 industrial armaments and devastated 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.610
 whole fields of thousand-year-old corals 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.710
 centennial punches of fish that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.719
 often live beyond 100 years and that 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.920
 actually looks like nets one can 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.570
 well imagine that it be 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 nets that he passes in the middle water 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.229
 pyramids of egypt that makes one fall 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.450
 all that heritage that take the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.100
 mummies the pyramids shaving everything and 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.740
 that we return it like in a landfill 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.570
 that we leave misery in fact in the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.869
 trawl wake this would be totally 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.490
 unacceptable if we could see that 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.430
 obviously the problem of all this subject 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.590
 that's happening in the water and in 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.539
 more in the deep water so the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.399
 bottled divers can not even 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.100
 not go filming the damage that is 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.390
 caused 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.710
 the economic profile of these fisheries and 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.950
 facts so that without 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.080
 the injection of public subsidies 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.760
 so public money these peaches 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.830
 would not even exist to finance their 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.430
 development and finance their 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.709
 exploitation 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.180
 So here we are exploding in an aberration 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.610
 which is total that it is ecological 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.190
 economic the same ethics the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.990
 real consequences of our actions 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.280
 we do not really have any idea since everything 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.740
 is nested we begin to understand 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840
 with the birds the insects the 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.450
 pollination typically but in 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.980
 reality it took a long time to 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.120
 that researchers go down this path 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.440
 and understand how much we 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.820
 are related to very small animals 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.430
 who look completely insignificant 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.790
 however we already know that when we are 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.290
 facing a reservoir of biodiversity 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.050
 gigantic where every time we put 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.000
 nose under water with researchers 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.440
 taxonomists who are capable 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.040
 to identify species that brings them back 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.959
 on the surface 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.550
 we discover new species so 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.400
 necessarily we discover animals that 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.380
 have coping skills that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.970
 are new so molecules that 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.500
 are new and in fact every time 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.000
 that we discover new things we 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.560
 realizes that there are certain 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.830
 molecules that can be applied in 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.700
 pharmacy in medicine in industry and 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.610
 that it can serve us 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.400
 so if we can not manage a 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.239
 tiny sector or even an activity 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.410
 which has a disproportionate impact on 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.890
 the environment and even finances 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.890
 public 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.660
 but if we can not manage his share 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.640
 political will but but what is it 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.500
 we will know how to manage so we ate that 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.720
 hope since I can see that there are 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.200
 politicians who carry strong 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.610
 a vision that are really there for 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.410
 to say our role as politician is 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.299
 of arbitrated decisions must be made 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.049
 it is obvious that this fishing 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.260
 belongs to the past 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.180
 let's go and stop being scared 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.040
 threats from lobbies it's not 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.320
 some lobbies lorientais broke what 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.700
 it's really a few individuals from the 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.989
 city ​​of lorient who are really 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.519
 mobilized around the fleet 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.430
 intermarket since the fleet 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.190
 inter-market most concerned by this 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.250
 European regulation which may dictate a 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.570
 European regulation must be stopped and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.200
 so that's our dear nation 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.730
 French who bears the responsibility 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.040
 to be burying a 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.140
 a regulation of importance 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.190
 absolutely essential for the 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.690
 protection of the oceans in the 21st century 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.140
 so we still have public opinion 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.270
 petitions the petition that 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.620
 the bloom association has bet on its site 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.540
 who asks françois hollande to 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.540
 mobilize to stop this rampage
