 as far as it goes for the people because in 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.440
 this volume I do not know very well how far 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.560
 it arrives but the whole pack let's say 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.180
 starts where in the beginning of the series 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.579

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.620

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.420
 different yes to see if I can pick them up 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.370
 because a little bit of the flash is a 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.909

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.320
 have taken advantage of he has put here 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.500

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:13.920
 the same as the other with its index and a 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.920

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.740
 new edition we have to say that the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.780
 paper is of better quality than the edition 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.870
 previous yes yes people see it a little bit 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:36.189
 bright is because it is foolish the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:41.560
 paper is so bright and good because this 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:42.969
 It has been a little show to the people 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.090
 how is the editing inside because 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:49.430
 It is complicated if one does not know how to decide 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.230
 and see how it is inside and that helps 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.990
 to decide good so guys here what 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.020
 you have and whoever wants to have a 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.110
 way more to be based and to know if yes 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.570
 throw forwards take this edition that 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.120
 someday we'll talk about it we'll talk about it 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.260
 and of the whole series of agreement come 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.260
