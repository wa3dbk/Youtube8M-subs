00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
215 which isn't that great because I'm

thousands but man I was so excited to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.530 
thousands but man I was so excited to
get<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.440> 215<00:02:32.130> because<00:02:32.580> my<00:02:32.700> previous<00:02:33.090> score<00:02:33.330> was

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
get to 215 because my previous score was

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.450 
get to 215 because my previous score was
109<00:02:33.900> but<00:02:34.470> while<00:02:34.650> playing<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.100> can<00:02:35.250> collect

109 but while playing you can collect

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.580 
109 but while playing you can collect
coins<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.240> use<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.630> coins<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.110> unlock<00:02:37.440> new

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
coins and use the coins to unlock new

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.470 
coins and use the coins to unlock new
characters<00:02:38.160> which<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.880> really<00:02:39.060> cool<00:02:39.300> because

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
characters which is really cool because

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.720 
characters which is really cool because
some<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.960> new<00:02:40.080> characters<00:02:40.560> change<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
some of the new characters change the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.030 
some of the new characters change the
setting<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.630> instead<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:43.020> grass<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> road

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
setting so instead of grass and a road

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.980 
setting so instead of grass and a road
it<00:02:44.490> will<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.360> desert<00:02:45.810> and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
it will be like the desert and

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.110 
it will be like the desert and
alligators<00:02:46.800> will<00:02:46.980> be<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> water<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.910> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
alligators will be in the water it's a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.940 
alligators will be in the water it's a
fun<00:02:48.330> game<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.380> one<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.590> those<00:02:49.680> games

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
fun game but it's one of those games

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.500

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.760 
like a quick moment and try see how far
you<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:53.970> get<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:55.110> then<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.350> end<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.590> spending
