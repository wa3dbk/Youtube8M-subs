start and for a few minutes there I

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.960 
start and for a few minutes there I
thought<00:05:39.110> it<00:05:39.289> might<00:05:39.440> have<00:05:39.560> been<00:05:39.740> sound<00:05:40.669> enough

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
thought it might have been sound enough

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.730 
thought it might have been sound enough
reason<00:05:41.449> for<00:05:41.479> me<00:05:41.720> to<00:05:41.840> calm<00:05:42.139> down<00:05:42.169> and<00:05:42.680> not
