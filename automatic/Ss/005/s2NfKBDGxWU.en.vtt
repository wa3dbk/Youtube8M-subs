game<00:02:13.390> um<00:02:13.780> what<00:02:14.320> was<00:02:14.440> kind<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.770> your<00:02:15.010> goal<00:02:15.430> when

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
game um what was kind of your goal when

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.910 
game um what was kind of your goal when
you<00:02:15.970> set<00:02:16.300> out<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.510> do<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:16.990> sequel<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.710> Mass

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you set out to do this sequel to Mass

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.160 
you set out to do this sequel to Mass
Effect<00:02:18.310> says<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.970> very<00:02:19.210> much<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.630> different

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
Effect says it is very much a different

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.290 
Effect says it is very much a different
game<00:02:20.470> than<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.740> first<00:02:20.920> one<00:02:21.130> well<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.640> think<00:02:21.820> we

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
game than the first one well I think we

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.420 
game than the first one well I think we
think<00:02:22.480> about<00:02:22.600> games<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.440> kind<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.280> unique

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
think about games in kind of a unique

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.480 
think about games in kind of a unique
way<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.820> mean<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.960> lot<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.680> our<00:02:26.800> goal<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.220> try

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
way I mean a lot of our goal is to try

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.890 
way I mean a lot of our goal is to try
and<00:02:27.700> create<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:28.030> game<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.360> people<00:02:28.510> fall<00:02:28.780> in

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and create a game that people fall in

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900 
and create a game that people fall in
love<00:02:29.080> with<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.470> that's<00:02:30.280> not<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:30.460> a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
love with and that's not really a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.000 
love with and that's not really a
feature<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.750> put<00:02:31.990> on<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.170> bullet<00:02:32.710> pointed

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
feature that you put on a bullet pointed

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.370 
feature that you put on a bullet pointed
list<00:02:33.250> or<00:02:33.430> anything<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:34.930> about<00:02:35.050> creating

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
list or anything but it's about creating

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.220 
list or anything but it's about creating
a<00:02:35.680> world<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.220> creating<00:02:36.640> characters<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.450> an

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
a world and creating characters and an

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470 
a world and creating characters and an
ultimately<00:02:38.620> creating<00:02:38.980> gameplay<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:40.060> is

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
ultimately creating gameplay that is

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.690 
ultimately creating gameplay that is
engaging<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.800> pulls<00:02:42.069> you<00:02:42.220> into<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.520> world

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
engaging and it pulls you into the world

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.360 
engaging and it pulls you into the world
so<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.870> mean<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.560> do<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.710> we<00:02:44.950> really<00:02:45.220> look

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
so we I mean to do that we really look

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.670 
so we I mean to do that we really look
at<00:02:45.460> what<00:02:45.700> our<00:02:46.030> fans<00:02:46.240> are<00:02:46.420> saying<00:02:46.569> about<00:02:46.900> our

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
at what our fans are saying about our

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.920 
at what our fans are saying about our
games<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> above<00:02:48.580> Mass<00:02:48.730> Effect<00:02:49.030> one<00:02:49.240> and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
games in the above Mass Effect one and

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.960 
games in the above Mass Effect one and
we<00:02:50.050> dug<00:02:50.200> really<00:02:50.410> deep<00:02:50.530> into<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.730> way<00:02:51.819> people

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
we dug really deep into the way people

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.250 
we dug really deep into the way people
were<00:02:52.180> playing<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.870> feedback<00:02:53.230> they

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
were playing it and the feedback they

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.320 
were playing it and the feedback they
gave<00:02:53.590> us<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.460> became<00:02:54.730> our<00:02:54.880> blueprint

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
gave us and that became our blueprint

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.050 
gave us and that became our blueprint
for<00:02:55.510> how<00:02:55.660> we<00:02:55.720> would<00:02:55.960> design<00:02:56.260> mass<00:02:56.470> effect<00:02:56.800> two

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
for how we would design mass effect two

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.160 
for how we would design mass effect two
combined<00:02:58.060> with<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.330> story<00:02:58.600> goals<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.050> we

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
combined with the story goals that we

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.990 
combined with the story goals that we
had<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.620> ultimately<00:03:00.250> there<00:03:00.490> there<00:03:00.819> is<00:03:00.970> a

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
had and ultimately there there is a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.199 
had and ultimately there there is a
whole<00:03:01.959> series<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.709> these<00:03:02.860> games<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.520> has<00:03:04.030> an

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
whole series to these games that has an

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.940 
whole series to these games that has an
overarching<00:03:04.569> story<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.560> we<00:03:05.680> had<00:03:05.800> our<00:03:05.920> own

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
overarching story so we had our own

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.650 
overarching story so we had our own
goals<00:03:06.310> we<00:03:06.910> brought<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.330> lot<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.569> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
goals we brought in a lot of the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.390 
goals we brought in a lot of the
feedback<00:03:07.840> from<00:03:08.260> fans<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.860> that's<00:03:09.040> that's

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
feedback from fans and that's that's

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.960 
feedback from fans and that's that's
really<00:03:09.520> what<00:03:09.820> made<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.120> as<00:03:10.330> good<00:03:10.450> as<00:03:10.600> it

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
really what made it as good as it

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.640 
really what made it as good as it
the<00:03:11.970> story<00:03:12.480> mass<00:03:12.660> effect<00:03:12.870> one<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.349> mean<00:03:13.500> it

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
the story mass effect one I mean it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.100 
the story mass effect one I mean it
involves<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.340> large<00:03:14.760> cast<00:03:15.209> but<00:03:15.510> very<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:16.050> was

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
involves a large cast but very it was

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.509 
involves a large cast but very it was
very<00:03:16.170> much<00:03:16.440> centered<00:03:16.739> on<00:03:16.890> sort<00:03:17.099> of<00:03:17.160> shepherd

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
very much centered on sort of shepherd

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.729 
very much centered on sort of shepherd
trying<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.910> stop<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.780> world<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.260> that's<00:03:19.560> what

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
trying to stop the world and that's what

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.839 
trying to stop the world and that's what
that<00:03:19.860> ques<00:03:20.129> different<00:03:20.489> well<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:20.670> almost

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
think we're going to go places in the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.700 
think we're going to go places in the
story<00:04:38.100> that<00:04:38.720> no<00:04:39.720> one<00:04:39.870> known<00:04:40.169> would<00:04:40.350> expect

from<00:04:40.950> from<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:41.520> series<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.150> yet<00:04:42.690> i<00:04:42.750> think<00:04:43.080> i

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
from from this series and yet i think i

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.070 
from from this series and yet i think i
think<00:04:43.770> for<00:04:44.160> fans<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.639> series<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:45.600> really

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
think for fans of the series it really

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.370 
think for fans of the series it really
is<00:04:46.260> designed<00:04:46.830> as<00:04:47.360> taking<00:04:48.360> everything<00:04:49.110> that

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
is designed as taking everything that

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.540 
is designed as taking everything that
we've<00:04:49.500> done<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.950> everything<00:04:50.160> that<00:04:50.430> we've

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
we've done and everything that we've

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.150 
we've done and everything that we've
built<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.620> satisfying<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.800> on<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.979> really

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
built and satisfying that on a really

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.700 
built and satisfying that on a really
fundamental<00:04:53.430> level<00:04:54.060> so<00:04:54.330> we<00:04:54.539> can't<00:04:55.229> share<00:04:55.410> too

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
fundamental level so we can't share too

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.140 
fundamental level so we can't share too
many<00:04:55.889> details<00:04:56.130> but<00:04:56.520> i<00:04:56.669> think<00:04:56.880> people<00:04:57.060> are

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
many details but i think people are

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.850 
many details but i think people are
going<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.300> be<00:04:57.389> really<00:04:57.599> happy<00:04:57.780> with<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.200> now<00:04:58.710> is

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
going to be really happy with it now is

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.020 
going to be really happy with it now is
there<00:04:58.979> anything<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.460> want<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.880> say<00:05:00.000> to
