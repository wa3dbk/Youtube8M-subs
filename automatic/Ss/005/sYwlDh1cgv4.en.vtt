to work on full wheel drives

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.770 
to work on full wheel drives
after<00:00:58.040> many<00:00:58.250> years<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.610> upgrading<00:00:59.210> diesel<00:00:59.600> for

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
drives in my own workshop there's plenty

were<00:01:05.750> match<00:01:06.020> tuning<00:01:06.530> their<00:01:06.680> chimney<00:01:06.979> course

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
were match tuning their chimney course

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.270

together<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:08.180> maximize<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:09.080> power<00:01:09.320> and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
together to maximize the power and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.800 
together to maximize the power and
that's<00:01:10.430> when<00:01:10.670> resistance<00:01:11.240> was<00:01:11.420> started

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.440 

my<00:01:14.409> philosophy<00:01:14.740> is<00:01:15.189> you<00:01:15.219> never<00:01:15.729> have<00:01:15.880> too<00:01:16.299> much

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
my philosophy is you never have too much

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.929 
my philosophy is you never have too much
power<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.079> we<00:01:17.770> set<00:01:17.979> up<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.219> roof<00:01:18.429> system<00:01:18.640> for

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
power so we set up the roof system for

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.910 
power so we set up the roof system for
performance<00:01:19.390> products<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.109> deliver<00:01:20.439> that<00:01:20.679> in

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
performance products to deliver that in

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.069 
performance products to deliver that in
a<00:01:21.039> safe<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.549> reliable<00:01:21.850> way<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.630> word<00:01:22.869> got

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
a safe and reliable way and the word got

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.860 
a safe and reliable way and the word got
out<00:01:23.140> around<00:01:23.500> Australia

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
out around Australia

as a forward drive myself I know that

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.840 
as a forward drive myself I know that
