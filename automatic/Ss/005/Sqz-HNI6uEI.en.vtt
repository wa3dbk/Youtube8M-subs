00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
different designs so I could tennis net

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.919 
different designs so I could tennis net
and<00:01:37.190> then<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.759> hit<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.000> ball<00:01:38.149> over<00:01:38.569> the<00:01:38.899> net

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
and then you hit the ball over the net

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.900 
and then you hit the ball over the net
or<00:01:39.289> Internet<00:01:39.739> I<00:01:39.950> don't<00:01:40.340> pretend<00:01:40.459> to<00:01:40.670> be<00:01:40.819> an

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.580 

I<00:01:53.549> think<00:01:54.549> laureus<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.810> know<00:01:55.930> it's<00:01:56.170> hard<00:01:56.409> to

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
I think laureus you know it's hard to

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.929 
I think laureus you know it's hard to
imagine<00:01:56.650> that<00:01:57.130> it's<00:01:57.250> actually<00:01:57.430> been<00:01:57.729> ten

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
imagine that it's actually been ten

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.450 
imagine that it's actually been ten
years<00:01:57.970> almost<00:01:58.780> small<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.409> mean<00:01:59.650> 10<00:02:00.009> years<00:02:00.040> next

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
years almost small it mean 10 years next

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.340 
years almost small it mean 10 years next
year<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.759> it's<00:02:01.420> been<00:02:01.479> going<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:01.900> that<00:02:02.140> long

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
year that it's been going on that long

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.999 
year that it's been going on that long
and<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.680> never<00:02:02.890> know<00:02:03.130> how<00:02:03.250> things<00:02:03.280> turn<00:02:03.729> out

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
and it never know how things turn out

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.820

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.050 
now we have over 60 projects worldwide
in<00:02:08.830> 40<00:02:09.729> countries<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.330> mean<00:02:11.430> when<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:12.610> started

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
in 40 countries I mean when we started

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.510 
in 40 countries I mean when we started
out<00:02:13.209> we<00:02:13.270> thought<00:02:13.840> okay<00:02:14.140> we<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.650> do<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:15.340> i

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
out we thought okay we can do this but i

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.280 
out we thought okay we can do this but i
think<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.180> grown<00:02:16.450> actually<00:02:16.870> more<00:02:17.110> than

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
think it's it's grown actually more than

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.949 
think it's it's grown actually more than
we<00:02:17.739> thought<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.280> think<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.700> brand<00:02:18.970> laureus<00:02:19.720> is

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
we thought I think the brand laureus is

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.809 
we thought I think the brand laureus is
pretty<00:02:20.440> strong<00:02:20.709> now<00:02:20.920> around<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.310> world<00:02:21.489> even

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
pretty strong now around the world even

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.370 
pretty strong now around the world even
people<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.120> America<00:02:22.510> are<00:02:22.630> paying<00:02:22.870> attention

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
people in America are paying attention

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.550 
people in America are paying attention
and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.670> think<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.300> just<00:02:25.420> exponentially<00:02:26.140> keep

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
and I think it's just exponentially keep

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.440 
and I think it's just exponentially keep
going<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.160> keep<00:02:27.280> growing<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:27.910> I'm<00:02:28.209> very

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
going to keep growing so I'm very

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.170 
going to keep growing so I'm very
excited<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.350> but<00:02:30.130> what<00:02:30.580> we've<00:02:30.760> been<00:02:30.850> able<00:02:30.970> to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
excited but but what we've been able to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.820 
excited but but what we've been able to
achieve<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.630> far<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.350> course<00:02:32.620> there's

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
achieve so far but of course there's

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.420 
achieve so far but of course there's
that<00:02:33.069> much<00:02:33.190> more<00:02:33.430> work<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.790> do

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.819 

well<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.120> think<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.510> add<00:02:41.750> leads<00:02:42.109> always<00:02:42.469> try<00:02:42.769> to

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
well I think we add leads always try to

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.819 
well I think we add leads always try to
give<00:02:43.099> back<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.370> our<00:02:43.640> sport<00:02:44.299> and<00:02:44.390> do<00:02:45.349> sports<00:02:45.650> in

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
give back to our sport and do sports in

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.130 
give back to our sport and do sports in
general<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.430> our<00:02:47.269> sport<00:02:47.659> has<00:02:47.780> given<00:02:48.019> us

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
general because our sport has given us

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.619 
general because our sport has given us
such<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.349> great<00:02:48.560> life<00:02:48.849> that<00:02:49.849> it<00:02:50.000> almost<00:02:50.359> feel

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
such a great life that it almost feel

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.569 
such a great life that it almost feel
guilty<00:02:50.810> making<00:02:51.739> all<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.040> money<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.400> you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
us about giving opportunities to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.479 
us about giving opportunities to
youngsters<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.200> know<00:02:57.319> we<00:02:57.500> we<00:02:57.799> had<00:02:58.040> our

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
youngsters you know we we had our

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.819 
youngsters you know we we had our
opportunity<00:02:59.239> somehow<00:02:59.750> we<00:03:00.379> made<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.650> happen

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
opportunity somehow we made it happen

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.920 
opportunity somehow we made it happen
and<00:03:01.340> it's<00:03:01.519> it's<00:03:01.819> it's<00:03:02.209> just<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.510> shame<00:03:02.719> when

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
and it's it's it's just a shame when

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.990 
and it's it's it's just a shame when
when<00:03:03.139> kids<00:03:03.379> want<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.799> but<00:03:04.069> they<00:03:04.219> can't<00:03:04.730> because

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
when kids want to but they can't because

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.690 
when kids want to but they can't because
the<00:03:05.659> chances<00:03:06.019> are<00:03:06.379> not<00:03:06.560> there<00:03:06.769> for<00:03:06.980> them<00:03:07.099> so

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
the chances are not there for them so

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.309 
the chances are not there for them so
it's<00:03:07.849> great<00:03:07.969> that<00:03:08.209> we<00:03:08.239> can<00:03:08.329> we<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:08.930> do<00:03:09.109> that

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
it's great that we can we can do that

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.289 
it's great that we can we can do that
and<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.709> reason<00:03:09.889> laureus<00:03:10.400> works<00:03:10.639> because<00:03:11.030> we

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
and the reason laureus works because we

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.259 
and the reason laureus works because we
do<00:03:11.659> have<00:03:11.780> superstars<00:03:12.349> as<00:03:12.609> members<00:03:13.609> but<00:03:14.060> we're

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
do have superstars as members but we're

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.059 
do have superstars as members but we're
all<00:03:14.359> there<00:03:14.689> there<00:03:14.989> for<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.290> same<00:03:15.500> reason<00:03:15.530> so

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
all there there for the same reason so

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.170 
all there there for the same reason so
there's<00:03:16.250> nobody<00:03:16.669> that's<00:03:16.849> bigger<00:03:17.120> than

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
there's nobody that's bigger than

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.210 
there's nobody that's bigger than

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.520 
laureus the whole foundation the whole
Academy<00:03:19.519> is<00:03:19.879> bigger<00:03:20.120> than<00:03:20.329> anyone<00:03:20.900> ever<00:03:21.169> and

Academy is bigger than anyone ever and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.589 
Academy is bigger than anyone ever and
that's<00:03:22.340> what<00:03:22.639> makes<00:03:22.819> it<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.120> work<00:03:23.299> we<00:03:23.480> all

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
that's what makes it all work we all

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.059 
that's what makes it all work we all
