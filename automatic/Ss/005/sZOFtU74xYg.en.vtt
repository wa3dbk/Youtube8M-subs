 Good people, I'm here to demonstrate. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.360
 a problem that is happening in my 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.880
 new fiat palio and a recent model 2012 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 it's raining rainy weather today and mine 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.050
 car is getting water 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.340

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.760

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.619
 at the time of the foot of the driver who 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:38.040
 run over the driver 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:42.239
 My car is in 1982 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.270
 my car is new 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.969
 my car is in another warranty 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.100
 factory still, right? 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.710
 What happens is my car went to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.570
 repair and at the dealer and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.960
 dealer at the time in September 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.750
 claimed that the effect of my car was that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.080
 I installed the accessories outside the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:11.600
 dealers and a filler cap 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:15.720
 here near the lever of the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.000
 the opening hood of the chat has a 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.520
 the cover there was violated 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.820
 was open step penetrating entering 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.369
 Water when it rained I washed 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.439
 the filter that the filter layer below 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.570
 of the carpet and she was 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.450
 soaking every time I used air 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.049
 conditioning or anything of the sort 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.119

 repair done and I played well the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.479
 assessment now the manufacturer 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.729
 dealer will be that the defect was 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.479
 really caused by me because the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.850
 defect was triggered second 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:29.120

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.669
