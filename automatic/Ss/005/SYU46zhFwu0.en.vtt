00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.029
 well found with purebred beef 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.340
 piedmontese 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.710
 today we prepare a recipe together 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.379
 historic of the piedmont the boiled alla 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.879
 Piedmontese for this recipe we have 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.449
 need different cuts of meat 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.780
 Piedmontese in particular are seven 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.299
 cuts of beef 7 ammenicoli and the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.510
 everything is then seasoned served with 7 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:54.179
 different sauces or seven baths us today 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.979
 we won't do it with the 14 cuts planned 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.079
 from the brotherhood of boiled ne 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.989
 we have chosen six in particular 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 we chose the ugly is good the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.440
 shoulder muscle skip the tail 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 the head and the tongue for the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.310
 boiled preparation we need 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 of two distinct pans precisely because i 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.550
 various cuts have different types of cooking 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.510
 let's start by preparing a vegetable broth 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.420
 inserting into the pots 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.050
 carrot celery and onion for fence with 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.050
 of cloves 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.000
 and let's put in hot water 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:38.820
 we bring to the boil adding also 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.820
 aromas of rosemary parsley 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.270
 and garlic one per fan then let's go 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.900
 to insert a handful of grains of 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.250
 black pepper and also wanting a leaf of 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.760
 laurel to those who like it 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.440
 lastly, the coarse salt should be added 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.630
 boiled differs from the classic 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.270
 I read because we have to get one 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.360
 good and juicy meat then we will go to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.860
 cook in already boiling water when it reaches 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.480
 boiling point 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.369
 let's put more in the pot 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.100
 great the bad is good that it was 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.950
 previously tied and together 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.900
 we also add the scaramella that does 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.890
 part of the belly of the abdomen 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.890
 animal's 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.580
 and also the shoulder muscle 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.650
 in the same pot we are going to insert 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.650
 even the tail cut into pieces 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.989
 these pieces will cook about two 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.480
 hours two hours and a quarter 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.939
 now let's add in the other 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.189
 pot the other two cuts that are 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.189
 more fatty details coming from 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:58.190
 head this is the head that just does 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.110
 part of the outer part of the head e 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.680
 we are going to put them in the pot 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.290
 also tied and then rolled up 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.540
 let's enter the language that is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.329
 previously cleaned and washed 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.819
 scraped these two with a small knife 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.560
 pieces the head and the tongue we go 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.109
 to cook a little less than an hour and three quarters 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.879
 two hours and we have differentiated them 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.849
 from the other pieces just for one 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.409
 a matter of fatness in fact seeing that 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.470
 they come from the head area 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.359
 tend to release a lot of broth 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.250
 fat then we go to make a 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.159
 separate culture 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.049
 let's froth the broth out 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.480
 precisely the foam that is created in 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.430
 surface so as to go to it 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.349
 degrease 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.569
 of the seven sauces mentioned earlier today 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.239
 we are going to prepare the green bath or 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.969
 the green and green sauce prepared sauce 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.920
 with parsley we can go to 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.989
 treat with the crescent or even 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.090
 with a blender or a mixer with 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.280
 the foresight to go and put the blades 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.840
 in the refrigerator and also to cool the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.510
 bowl so that it does not go 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.909
 to damage we say the ingredient a 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.269
 cook it with the heat that yes 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.760
 creates 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.560
 start chopping parsley today 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.120
 we will make the richer version that comes 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.099
 also called the master's version 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.620
 of the master's green bath because 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.289
 inside we have both parsley 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.109
 the anchovy soaked bread crumb 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:25.789
 in the vinegar also the yolk takes place 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.530
 egg already cooked and then minced and 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.270
 the classic anchovies that go to give 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.099
 taste has this false 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.560
 unlike that of the sharecropper o 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.330
 of the farmer who instead is simpler and 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.539
 does not require the use of egg yolk 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.820
 and of the capers we have of the crumb of 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.830
 stale bread we go to bathe with 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.830
 of the vinegar of less white 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:54.229
 so it will soften we leave it a 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.229
 moment to soften 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.890
 then we go to add to ours 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.890
 chopped 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:22.400
 we also add the garlic capers 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.400
 desalted anchovy fillets 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:30.270
 we can use those in oil or again 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.670
 better those under salt prime a 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.280
 clean now let's add the 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:39.630
 egg yolk we break it up otherwise 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.100
 then we are going to chop in turn is one 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.290
 Once chopped all the ingredients 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.630
 let's transfer to a bowl e 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.970
 add the oil flush to the bath 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.770
 Homemade green is very good but if 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.620
 you have no time you can buy some 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.110
 equally valid sauces prepared as 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.170
 if they were home-made, for example, me 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.880
 I chose this red bath 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.330
 prepared with peppers tomatoes 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.330
 and garlic 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.000
 finished cooking the various cuts of 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.010
 boiled we go to lay on a 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.780
 serving tray and we go to 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:21.490
 sprinkle with a little coarse salt 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:23.940
 before serving then a nice ladle of 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.940
 hot broth 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.050
 we serve our boiled with the various 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.010
 sauces available and side dishes of 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.930
 season 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.350
 you can also find this recipe 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.060
 on www.ferrari.com 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.920
 and to celebrate the great mixed boiled meat 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.410
 the master danilo from Piedmont 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.500
 paparelli arrived here in the kitchen a 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:50.880
 bring us his beautiful cartoon 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.560
 thank you thank you so much this 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.500
 flat I don't think it's just nice to 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.210
 see but has a splendid appearance that 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.160
 I think it's just as much about VIPs 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.710
 I have chosen cuts this time 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.710
 well 6 and you of that serious cut
