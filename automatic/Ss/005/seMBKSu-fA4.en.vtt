00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello together i wish me and today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.200
 I have come for you one summer 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.230
 Look and there I show you how I mean 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.300
 lure steeply what make-up wear 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.330
 currently what you are absolutely favorite 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 summer hole is i would suggest 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.279
 I'm just starting to use it here 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.080
 my pure racing team austria has 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.430
 a sun protection factor of 30 and 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.250
 chemically i use two different colors 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.140
 because that is not really my skin tone 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 hits one and the other color 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.740
 That's why I do that and distribute it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
 It's really about a whole face 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 very light it just makes for easy 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.940
 an even complexion and the lighter 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.440
 I wear color again as saying 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.719
 a light highlighter under mine 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.030
 eyes on me may never be a concealer 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 That's why I'm missing the ice aliens 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.420
 queenie concealer is my favorite 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.950
 concealer not just rich under 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.870
 my eyes and mine too 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.719
 along nasal bone and sat, so to speak 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.559
 the highlights and cash in with it eyes 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.559
 things or eye shadows 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.450
 gbp 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.200
 then it goes on to my own 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.510
 eyebrows 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.150
 yes i can give you an eyebrow 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.360
 routine make a current i wear 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.610
 mostly always in the inner area my 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.940
 eyebrow a lighter color than 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.350
 Everything works on the outer area 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.350
 a little more natural than when you are 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.420
 now in the inner area a dark 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.610
 color applies it very much too hard then 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.050
 Let's go over to the powder I brother only 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 very subtle here namely a small 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.410
 brush and ink so to speak or laundry 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.840
 very easily about the foundation and the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.600
 concealer because I'm not a big fan 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.380
 by brother in the summer so only for 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.920
 Chat very discreetly and that's it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.720
 already 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.210
 we come to the eyes already that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.190
 eye make up is mega simple so i 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.770
 ask here first a base on it 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.720
 even the eye make-up stops in the summer 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.700
 one sweats and the eyelids become 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.100
 light oil me that's why I use each one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.140
 often victims of nec and wear now 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.280
 only two eyeshadows to be 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.230
 so read two matte of a tk once 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.850
 lighter chic brown that is dull 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.620
 and I just wear that on mine 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.120
 complete song on clearly remaining 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.480
 then first with a blender 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.480
 brush 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.610
 Now I ask this shadow also the 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.280
 has such a subtle shimmer and 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.380
 also has an orange effect on the skin 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.510
 brownish and I use that too 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.220
 I just fade this 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.920
 have slightly embellished effect and 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.200
 again with a clean blender 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.209
 brush over it and make sure it is 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.680
 really very softly hidden 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.090
 Now I'm back with the ass 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.400
 inner brown on my lower 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.299
 eyelash wreath and wear it easy 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.130
 directly on 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.049
 I burn everything that way 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.600
 has this slightly embellished effect 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.820
 and i love this industry lures in 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.620
 summer everything looks so nice again 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.390
 out and I would definitely go to you 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.870
 advise against taking too much glitter 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.580
 summer because that runs and then you have 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.010
 it's all about the face and all 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.320
 Looks like I'm wearing one more 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.750
 light highlighter on the iss in such 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.720
 one 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.000
 would have finished mac and the question that 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.070
 in the inner eye angle on there I no 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.750
 one has applied in black 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.740
 I consider a brownstone 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.690
 unsubscribe 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.700
 and here has less of the merck 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.140
 this light golden brown stone and the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.630
 I just wear it along the top 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.490
 Paired with the eyelashes 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.990
 be compacted once and then go 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.360
 me with my absolute favorite 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.490
 Currently Mascara over my eyelashes 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.100
 really makes them very long and separates 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.959
 the eyelashes and therefore how I like them 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.910
 then it goes on directly 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.739
 I just can not thus because 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.780
 Contour my nose as many always 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.030
 the opinion I have a nose-op 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.250
 No I did not have that is just 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.780
 the magic of make up and then I go 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.310
 Of course, even with the brown silver 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.550
 mine faces or most important step 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.670
 so that this browns i think is look 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.580
 gets and rich of merck on the 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.500
 actually has hardly any shimmer whatsoever 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.780
 easy the gold particles with this 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.760
 bell arises and I carry that 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.760
 just on my sleep 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.010
 and, as it were, in this threesome area 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.979
 along my bank still a child line 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.340
 and temple and that was it also 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.140
 beautiful 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.320
 then, of course, must not be missing 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.640
 I have a matte piepston 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.979
 selected and I wear that on mine 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.370
 Girl on to the home manager at the hi people 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.530
 I have a very light selected 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.700
 the only a very subtle with low 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.370
 In any case I would lend 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.810
 Guessing with too much glitter she wants 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.020
 to go as already said 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.870
 and then she also sets this beautiful one 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.979
 highlight in the face and snappy gets 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.979
 this sun kissed yellow 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.000
 Last but not least , my lips are coming 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.699
 wear here first a pietsch have the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.650
 planner on the I carry quite easily 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.169
 over my lips to give you one 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.760
 gets slightly fuller gaps effect 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.440
 and that also provides for a certain 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.949
 Baseball also holds the lips Sagittarius 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.690
 longer 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.150
 then I always go to my absolute 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.949
 favorite summer lipstick and two 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.479
 the water notes he really is 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.610
 very intense of the color 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.130
 can see it here and wear it easily 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.199
 mostly everything is dazzled 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.790
 times with the ring finger that's the color 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.650
 not too intense and is also very 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.300
 beautifully finished lips that was it then 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.910
 even with the eyes make up or 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.250
 which at least with make up look i 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.289
 did not really want to latte that day 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.270
 or slightly wavy hair 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.110
 but that's why we're coming now 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.440
 to the hague 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.880
 I will first comb my hair 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.650
 that is probably the most important thing 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.630
 I can not use any knots at 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.780
 My bake then I go here 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.370
 a product of fritzi flakes spray 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.900
 and it makes sure they are still enticing 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.610
 times are a bit defined and that 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.610
 is also a heat protection at the same time 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.280
 then I take this foam stabilizer 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.410
 here and what I always do 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.740
 endure already protected yes lotion 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.690
 of course first on my fight and stuff 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.200
 I then got the product in the hair 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.620
 on 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.170
 I think I always have the best 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.190
 result so far and therefore since 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.190
 I do it that way for years 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.300
 we are almost done then 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.550
 I always do my men upside down 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.530
 and loosen everything again in the approach of 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.420
 knead my hair so that even more 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.200
 flowers arise and then mine for me 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.760
 hair then a diffuser to 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.610
 good last we come to the outfit me 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.790
 carry here a simple skater dress from 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.530
 h &amp; m was super cheap i'm airy 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.500
 love to wear short dresses summer 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.420
 and that can be very easy and 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.830
 Of course, throw over very quickly 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.320
 and not in the most shoes 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.090
 with a higher and a flat and 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.010
 that was it 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.350
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.090
 and if you suisse more such credit 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.720
 then wants to see behind mine 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.150
 thumbs up 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.850
 all the products I have used we 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.560
 are listed in the infobox and 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.970
 otherwise I want to say until 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.990
 Next time people and I have 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.990
 great league 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.050
 it gave us
