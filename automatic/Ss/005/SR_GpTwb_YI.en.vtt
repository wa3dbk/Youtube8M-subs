00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
of months I had him and so I didn't

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.889 
of months I had him and so I didn't
really<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.249> that<00:00:38.399> was<00:00:38.609> about<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.179> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
really know what that was about and it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.829 
really know what that was about and it
just<00:00:39.929> progressively<00:00:40.679> got<00:00:41.129> worse<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
just progressively got worse and

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.930 
just progressively got worse and
eventually<00:00:42.839> he<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.649> wasn't<00:00:44.579> doing<00:00:44.909> very

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
eventually he just wasn't doing very

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
eventually he just wasn't doing very
good<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.600> he<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.019> sitting<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.350> top<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.559> his

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
good and he was sitting on top of his

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.160 
good and he was sitting on top of his
favorite<00:00:47.159> plant<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:47.699> he<00:00:47.820> passed<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.539> he<00:00:49.079> was

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
favorite plant when he passed and he was

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
favorite plant when he passed and he was
in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> big<00:00:49.499> tank<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.069> he<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.429> happy<00:00:50.819> it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
in the big tank so he was all happy it

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.799 
in the big tank so he was all happy it
was<00:00:51.449> pretty<00:00:51.569> peaceful<00:00:51.870> um<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:54.329> honestly<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
was pretty peaceful um so honestly I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.299 
was pretty peaceful um so honestly I
think<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.109> just<00:00:55.230> could<00:00:55.409> have<00:00:55.440> been<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.800> old<00:00:56.039> age

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

think it just could have been of old age

but<00:01:54.509> oh<00:01:54.659> well<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.149> emeralds<00:01:57.509> tank<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.810> don't

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
but oh well so in emeralds tank I don't

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.569 
but oh well so in emeralds tank I don't
really<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.170> too<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.619> because<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
really have too much because the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.029 
really have too much because the
treatment<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> i'm<00:02:00.689> using<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.259> stains<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
treatment that i'm using it stains the

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.849 
treatment that i'm using it stains the
water<00:02:02.219> blue<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.780> didn't<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.109> to<00:02:04.200> add<00:02:04.289> like

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
water blue so I didn't want to add like

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.260 
water blue so I didn't want to add like
plants<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.369> anything<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.880> case<00:02:05.999> they<00:02:06.179> would

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
plants or anything in case they would

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.870 
plants or anything in case they would
turn<00:02:06.390> blue<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.619> she<00:02:07.679> has<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.039> same<00:02:08.340> gravel

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
turn blue so she has the same gravel

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.630 
turn blue so she has the same gravel
stay<00:02:09.539> filter<00:02:10.020> which<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.350> took<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:11.039> carbon

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
stay filter which I took out the carbon

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.910 
stay filter which I took out the carbon
in<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.659> way<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.080> wouldn't<00:02:13.290> mess<00:02:13.739> up

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
in it so that way it wouldn't mess up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.350 
in it so that way it wouldn't mess up
the<00:02:14.190> treatment

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
the treatment

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.480 
the treatment
and<00:02:15.480> then<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.140> thermometer<00:02:17.010> that's<00:02:17.190> always

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
and then the thermometer that's always

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.090 
and then the thermometer that's always
sideways<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.960> beta<00:02:19.470> leaf<00:02:19.680> hammock<00:02:19.980> was

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
sideways and the beta leaf hammock was

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.340 
sideways and the beta leaf hammock was
she<00:02:20.220> likes<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.520> rest<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.990> just<00:02:22.140> bought

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
she likes to rest on and I just bought

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.370 
she likes to rest on and I just bought
this<00:02:22.560> yesterday<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.270> got<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.690> from<00:02:24.810> walmart

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
this yesterday and I got it from walmart

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.580 
this yesterday and I got it from walmart
so<00:02:26.600> it's<00:02:27.600> pretty<00:02:27.780> much<00:02:27.960> just<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.440> little

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
so it's pretty much just like a little

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.320 
so it's pretty much just like a little
rock<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.280> was<00:02:29.370> debating<00:02:29.490> over<00:02:29.850> whether<00:02:30.210> to

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
rock and I was debating over whether to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.030 
rock and I was debating over whether to
put<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> turtle<00:02:31.230> tank<00:02:31.350> or<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.740> tank

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
put it in the turtle tank or this tank

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.120 
put it in the turtle tank or this tank
but<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.430> decided<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:33.300> tank<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.650> that's<00:02:34.980> pretty

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
but I decided this tank so that's pretty

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.720 
but I decided this tank so that's pretty
much<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:35.490> her<00:02:35.820> tank<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:37.370> I'll<00:02:38.370> show<00:02:38.700> you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
much it for her tank and I'll show you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.900 
much it for her tank and I'll show you
the<00:02:39.000> treatment<00:02:39.390> right<00:02:39.660> now<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:41.490> here's<00:02:41.760> what

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the treatment right now so here's what

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030 
the treatment right now so here's what
I'm<00:02:41.940> using<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.480> her<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> API<00:02:43.380> liquid

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
I'm using for her it's the API liquid

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.990 
I'm using for her it's the API liquid
super<00:02:44.550> ich<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.930> recommend<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:47.700> made

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
super ich and I recommend this it's made

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.860 
super ich and I recommend this it's made
for<00:02:48.630> smaller<00:02:49.530> aquariums<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:51.209> unlike<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
for smaller aquariums so it's unlike the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.229 
for smaller aquariums so it's unlike the
tablets<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.430> use<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:53.880> five

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
tablets you can just use it for five

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.510 
tablets you can just use it for five
gallons<00:02:54.660> instead<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.050> 10<00:02:55.200> gallons<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.739> it's

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
gallons instead of 10 gallons and it's

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.080 
gallons instead of 10 gallons and it's
been<00:02:56.730> doing<00:02:56.970> really<00:02:57.209> great<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.910> only

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
been doing really great it the only

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.520 
been doing really great it the only
thing<00:03:00.270> about<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.870> dusty<00:03:01.020> in<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> water

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
thing about it is it dusty in the water

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.930 
thing about it is it dusty in the water
a<00:03:01.620> little<00:03:01.739> bit<00:03:01.920> blue<00:03:02.130> but<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.550> really<00:03:02.730> not

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
a little bit blue but it's really not

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.190 
a little bit blue but it's really not
that<00:03:03.000> big<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.360> deal<00:03:03.480> because<00:03:03.690> then<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.020> just

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
that big of a deal because then you just

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.229 
that big of a deal because then you just
do<00:03:04.320> more<00:03:04.500> water<00:03:04.680> changes<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.790> looks<00:03:06.030> fine

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
do more water changes and it looks fine

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.300 
do more water changes and it looks fine
so<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.580> what<00:03:08.820> I'm<00:03:08.910> treating<00:03:09.239> her<00:03:09.390> with<00:03:10.310> so

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
so this is what I'm treating her with so

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.260 
so this is what I'm treating her with so
yeah<00:03:11.430> that's<00:03:11.550> pretty<00:03:11.670> much<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.120> this

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
yeah that's pretty much it for this

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.940 
yeah that's pretty much it for this
video<00:03:12.480> emerald<00:03:13.020> has<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.320> whole<00:03:13.470> five<00:03:13.709> point
