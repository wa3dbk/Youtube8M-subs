they're<00:00:00.570> working<00:00:00.840> on<00:00:00.900> curve<00:00:01.170> balls<00:00:01.439> now<00:00:01.650> and

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.290 
they're working on curve balls now and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.120 
they're working on curve balls now and
you<00:00:04.290> know<00:00:04.350> they're<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.740> go<00:00:04.859> through<00:00:05.069> a

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
you know they're going to go through a

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.769 
you know they're going to go through a
process<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.819> their<00:00:05.970> locations<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.690> we're

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
process of their locations and we're

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.240 
process of their locations and we're
gonna<00:00:06.870> expand<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.500> little<00:00:07.710> bit<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:07.980> you'll<00:00:08.099> see

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
gonna expand a little bit and you'll see

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.190 
gonna expand a little bit and you'll see
you'll<00:00:08.519> watch<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.880> catcher's<00:00:09.300> they<00:00:09.929> know

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
you'll watch the catcher's they know

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.690 
you'll watch the catcher's they know
their<00:00:10.440> routine<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.250> they'll<00:00:11.429> kind<00:00:11.580> of

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
their routine and so they'll kind of

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.669 
their routine and so they'll kind of
expand<00:00:12.090> their<00:00:12.269> zone<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> little<00:00:12.599> bit<00:00:12.750> but

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
expand their zone a little bit but

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.990 
expand their zone a little bit but
they'll<00:00:13.860> get<00:00:13.980> them<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:15.109> hit<00:00:16.109> spots<00:00:17.000> our

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
they'll get them to hit spots our

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.849 
they'll get them to hit spots our
catchers<00:00:18.449> don't<00:00:18.600> move<00:00:18.779> around<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.260> lot<00:00:19.410> they

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
catchers don't move around a lot they

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
catchers don't move around a lot they
tend<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.310> real<00:00:20.580> quiet<00:00:20.789> behind<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.300> plate

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
tend to be real quiet behind the plate

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.540 
tend to be real quiet behind the plate
and<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.500> ideally<00:00:24.830> they'll<00:00:25.830> set<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> location

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and so ideally they'll set the location

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.720 
and so ideally they'll set the location
and<00:00:26.880> hit<00:00:26.970> locations<00:00:27.920> work<00:00:28.920> their<00:00:29.099> spins<00:00:29.460> work

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and hit locations work their spins work

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.160 
and hit locations work their spins work
locations<00:00:31.219> and<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.940> anything<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
locations and this is like anything the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.959 
locations and this is like anything the
more<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.250> more<00:00:35.280> proficient<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
more you do it the more proficient you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.760 
more you do it the more proficient you
get<00:00:36.120> at<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.079> spend<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> lot<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.590> time

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
get at it and so we spend a lot of time

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.080 
get at it and so we spend a lot of time
doing<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:40.850> we'll<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:42.000> through<00:00:42.300> probably<00:00:43.100> 15<00:00:44.100> 15

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
doing it we'll go through probably 15 15

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.200 
doing it we'll go through probably 15 15
pitches<00:00:45.680> of<00:00:46.680> curveballs<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:49.610> once<00:00:50.610> again<00:00:50.879> we

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
pitches of curveballs and once again we

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.049 
pitches of curveballs and once again we
will<00:00:51.329> try<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> keep<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.170> work<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.680> about<00:00:53.190> 75

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
will try to keep this work out about 75

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.709 
will try to keep this work out about 75
to<00:00:54.329> 80<00:00:54.510> pitches<00:00:56.360> they're<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> go

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
to 80 pitches they're going to go

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
to 80 pitches they're going to go
through<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> rest<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> day<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:59.039> work<00:00:59.250> our

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
through the rest of the day we work our

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
through the rest of the day we work our
pitchers<00:01:00.210> real<00:01:00.449> hard<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> infield<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.859> hit

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pitchers real hard on the infield we hit

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.709 
pitchers real hard on the infield we hit
them<00:01:02.190> ground<00:01:02.430> balls<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.910> expect<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> move

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
them ground balls we expect them to move

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.479 
them ground balls we expect them to move
and<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> things<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and do some of the things that the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.250 
and do some of the things that the
infielders<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:06.090> doing<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> regular<00:01:06.540> basis

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
infielders are doing on a regular basis

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
infielders are doing on a regular basis
so<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.250> something<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:08.939> foreign<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
so it's not something that's foreign to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.260 
so it's not something that's foreign to
them<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> they'll<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.610> through<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> full<00:01:12.060> day

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
them so they'll go through the full day

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.600 
them so they'll go through the full day
but<00:01:12.479> they'll<00:01:12.630> come<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.049> throw<00:01:13.610> because

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
but they'll come in and throw because

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.399 
but they'll come in and throw because
this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> only<00:01:15.299> time<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this is the only time we get to do this

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.830 
this is the only time we get to do this
when<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.759> work<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.030> pure<00:01:18.360> location

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
when they can just work on pure location

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.310 
when they can just work on pure location
without<00:01:18.960> worrying<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.439> hitter<00:01:21.049> okay<00:01:22.049> now

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
without worrying about a hitter okay now

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.550 
without worrying about a hitter okay now
we'll<00:01:22.470> go<00:01:22.560> screwball<00:01:24.020> it's<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> same<00:01:25.380> idea

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
we'll go screwball it's the same idea

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
we'll go screwball it's the same idea
and<00:01:25.920> once<00:01:26.250> again<00:01:26.400> they're<00:01:26.670> gonna<00:01:26.790> expand<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and once again they're gonna expand the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359 
and once again they're gonna expand the
zone<00:01:27.540> you'll<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.080> they'll<00:01:28.920> pick<00:01:29.130> spots

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
zone you'll see them they'll pick spots

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.910 
zone you'll see them they'll pick spots
and<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.790> gonna<00:01:29.909> start<00:01:30.180> working<00:01:30.329> out<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:31.770> was

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and I'm gonna start working out that was

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:42.020 
and I'm gonna start working out that was
