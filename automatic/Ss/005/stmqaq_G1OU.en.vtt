so<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:02.159> still<00:00:02.399> selling<00:00:04.879> what<00:00:05.879> happened<00:00:06.180> was

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
so we're still selling what happened was

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.970 
so we're still selling what happened was
the<00:00:06.450> battery<00:00:06.779> voltage<00:00:06.810> built<00:00:07.379> up<00:00:07.560> really<00:00:07.770> good

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the battery voltage built up really good

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.180 
the battery voltage built up really good
and<00:00:08.599> now<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.780> suit<00:00:09.990> basically<00:00:10.650> selling<00:00:11.010> all

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and now it's suit basically selling all

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.180 
and now it's suit basically selling all
that<00:00:11.219> extra<00:00:12.030> voltage<00:00:12.620> off<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.830> top<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
that extra voltage off the top of the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.939 
that extra voltage off the top of the
battery<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.759> that's<00:00:14.910> why<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.240> someone

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
battery so that's why we're someone

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.560 
battery so that's why we're someone
appears<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.100> selling<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.550> much<00:00:17.760> starting

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
appears to be selling so much starting

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:28.560 
appears to be selling so much starting
to<00:00:18.630> go<00:00:18.720> down<00:00:18.930> now

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.070 

660

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
660

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.670 
660
and<00:00:31.369> staying<00:00:32.369> steady<00:00:32.610> at<00:00:32.850> about<00:00:33.030> 17<00:00:33.680> 1800

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and staying steady at about 17 1800

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.280 
and staying steady at about 17 1800
watts<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.809> didn't<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> chance<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
watts so I didn't have a chance to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.060 
watts so I didn't have a chance to
before<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.860> want<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> show<00:00:41.220> you<00:00:41.280> guys<00:00:41.400> the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
before but I want to show you guys the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.240 
before but I want to show you guys the
disconnect<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:45.210> solar<00:00:45.450> disconnect<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
disconnect the solar disconnect and the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.810 
disconnect the solar disconnect and the
two<00:00:47.430> breakers<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.970> put<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:50.340> wiring<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
two breakers that I put in the wiring is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.299 
two breakers that I put in the wiring is
fairly<00:00:51.030> simple<00:00:51.330> but<00:00:53.150> I<00:00:54.710> just<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> two

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
fairly simple but I just have the two

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.200 
fairly simple but I just have the two
20s<00:00:57.680> right<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:59.040> that<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.400> put<00:00:59.610> in<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> two

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
20s right here that I put in for the two

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.180 
20s right here that I put in for the two
kyocera's<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.879> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> bottom<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.989> know

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
kyocera's and on the bottom you know

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.440 
kyocera's and on the bottom you know
pluses<00:01:05.190> are<00:01:05.220> coming<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.850> bottom<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
pluses are coming into the bottom of the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.590 
pluses are coming into the bottom of the
breakers<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.370> then<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.520> minuses<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.330> going

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
breakers and then the minuses are going

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.070 
breakers and then the minuses are going
to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:12.140> negative<00:01:13.430> bus<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> r<00:01:17.659> in<00:01:18.659> you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to the negative bus here so r in you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.280 
to the negative bus here so r in you
know<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.409> conduit<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.100> ran<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.790> here

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
know to conduit so ran this one here

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.250 
know to conduit so ran this one here
which<00:01:22.290> goes<00:01:22.560> over<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.570> set<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> panels

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
which goes over to that set of panels

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.920 
which goes over to that set of panels
and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.299> coming<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and then the one coming out of the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.570 
and then the one coming out of the
bottom<00:01:28.049> right<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.939> it's<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:31.130> over<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
bottom right here it's going over to

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.760 
bottom right here it's going over to
these<00:01:32.700> set<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> panels<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:39.770> anyway

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
these set of panels right here so anyway

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
these set of panels right here so anyway
that's<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.340> disconnect<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.420> fully

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
that's the disconnect and it's fully

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.390 
that's the disconnect and it's fully
loaded<00:01:42.870> I<00:01:43.260> can't<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:43.650> any<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:43.980> breakers<00:01:44.370> in

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
loaded I can't put any more breakers in

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.160 
loaded I can't put any more breakers in
it<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.760> if<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.300> more<00:01:45.480> solar<00:01:45.780> panels

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it so if I want to get more solar panels

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.370 
it so if I want to get more solar panels
that<00:01:47.010> I'm<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.400> to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.610> another

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
that I'm going to have to get another

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.260 
that I'm going to have to get another
and<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.220> another<00:01:50.430> disconnect<00:01:51.030> but

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and you know another disconnect but

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.830 
and you know another disconnect but
personally<00:01:52.230> I<00:01:52.260> would<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.650> recommend<00:01:53.840> at

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
personally I would not recommend at

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.720 
personally I would not recommend at
least<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.380> particular<00:01:56.070> model<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
least this particular model of the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.590 
least this particular model of the
midnite<00:01:57.090> solar<00:01:57.300> disconnect<00:01:57.870> because<00:01:59.480> the<00:02:00.480> way

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
midnite solar disconnect because the way

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
midnite solar disconnect because the way
the<00:02:00.750> breakers<00:02:01.110> are<00:02:01.290> held<00:02:01.470> on<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.920> back<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the breakers are held on to the back of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the breakers are held on to the back of
this<00:02:02.310> thing<00:02:02.690> it's<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.810> din<00:02:04.290> rail<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.909> back

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
this thing it's a din rail in the back

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.999 
this thing it's a din rail in the back
they<00:02:06.510> kind<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:07.550> hook<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.560> back<00:02:10.709> there

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
they kind of hook on to the back there

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.759 
they kind of hook on to the back there
and<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:12.209> thing<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.659> you<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:12.989> anything<00:02:13.379> with<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
and the thing if you do anything with it

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.240 
and the thing if you do anything with it
it<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.010> falls<00:02:14.489> off<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.409> real<00:02:16.680> bear<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it just falls off so it's a real bear to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.990 
it just falls off so it's a real bear to
get<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:17.970> cover<00:02:18.269> plate<00:02:18.540> back<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.409> then

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
get this cover plate back on and then

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.030 
get this cover plate back on and then
also<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.450> able<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.720> shut<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.080> door<00:02:22.319> all<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
also to be able to shut the door all the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.750 
also to be able to shut the door all the
way<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.849> just<00:02:25.250> everything<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.489> kind<00:02:26.700> of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
way it's just everything is just kind of

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.430 
way it's just everything is just kind of
loose<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.269> just<00:02:27.450> sort<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.900> hanging<00:02:28.110> out<00:02:28.290> in

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
loose and just sort of hanging out in

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.110 
loose and just sort of hanging out in
there<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.739> I'd<00:02:28.830> probably<00:02:29.040> go<00:02:29.430> with<00:02:29.610> an<00:02:29.760> Outback

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
there so I'd probably go with an Outback

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.809 
there so I'd probably go with an Outback
disconnect<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:30.840> something<00:02:31.049> like<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.819> but

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
disconnect or something like that but

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.100 
disconnect or something like that but
this<00:02:33.299> thing<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.799> doing<00:02:34.799> its<00:02:34.920> job<00:02:35.099> anyway<00:02:36.110> so

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
this thing is doing its job anyway so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.559 
this thing is doing its job anyway so
anyway

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
anyway

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:53.610 
anyway
that's<00:02:40.569> that<00:02:47.400> there<00:02:48.400> they<00:02:48.580> are<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:53.440> you'll

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
that's that there they are if you'll

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.830 
that's that there they are if you'll
notice<00:02:53.800> this<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.760> one<00:02:54.910> at<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.150> very<00:02:55.180> end<00:02:55.600> is

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
notice this the one at the very end is

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.620 
notice this the one at the very end is
sort<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.260> more<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.560> an<00:02:56.680> angle<00:02:57.600> than<00:02:58.600> the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
sort of it more of an angle than the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.910 
sort of it more of an angle than the
rest<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.050> them<00:03:01.230> I'm<00:03:02.230> not<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.620> worried<00:03:02.860> about

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
rest of them I'm not so worried about

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.150 
rest of them I'm not so worried about
that<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.019> summertime<00:03:11.350> when<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.920> Sun

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
that but in the summertime when the Sun

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.770 
that but in the summertime when the Sun
gets<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.850> little<00:03:12.970> bit<00:03:13.150> higher<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.660> sky

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
gets a little bit higher in the sky

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.539 
gets a little bit higher in the sky
right<00:03:14.140> now<00:03:14.470> it's<00:03:14.709> October<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:17.340> usually<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
right now it's October so usually in the

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.580 
right now it's October so usually in the
summer<00:03:18.840> spring<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.019> summer<00:03:20.260> i'm<00:03:20.410> probably

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
summer spring and summer i'm probably

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.870 
summer spring and summer i'm probably
going<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.860> get<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:21.010> lot<00:03:21.130> more<00:03:21.160> output<00:03:21.640> out<00:03:21.760> of

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
going to get a lot more output out of

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.729 
going to get a lot more output out of
these<00:03:22.000> once<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.540> sun<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.900> more<00:03:23.049> perpendicular

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
these once the sun is more perpendicular

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:39.880 
these once the sun is more perpendicular
to<00:03:23.860> them

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.150 

there's<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.640> old<00:03:40.700> trusty<00:03:40.940> transformer

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
there's the old trusty transformer

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.470 
there's the old trusty transformer
progress<00:03:43.160> energy<00:03:45.850> one<00:03:46.850> thing<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.150> forgot<00:03:47.180> to

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
progress energy one thing I forgot to

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.640 
progress energy one thing I forgot to
mention<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:48.560> some<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:48.950> my<00:03:49.040> other<00:03:49.190> videos<00:03:49.569> was

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
mention in some of my other videos was

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.130 
mention in some of my other videos was
the<00:03:51.650> AR<00:03:52.640> e<00:03:54.550> voltage<00:03:55.550> clamp<00:03:55.930> controller<00:03:56.930> for

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
the AR e voltage clamp controller for

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.710 
the AR e voltage clamp controller for
the<00:03:57.170> wind<00:03:57.350> turbine<00:03:58.060> one<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.209> things<00:03:59.360> I<00:03:59.570> had

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
the wind turbine one of the things I had

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:10.510 
the wind turbine one of the things I had
to<00:03:59.750> do<00:04:00.580> was<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.610> get<00:04:02.300> an<00:04:02.390> rs-232<00:04:06.790> cable<00:04:09.340> male<00:04:10.340> on

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
to do was a get an rs-232 cable male on

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.300 
to do was a get an rs-232 cable male on
one<00:04:10.700> side<00:04:10.970> female<00:04:11.630> on<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.959> other<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.320> plug<00:04:13.160> it

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
one side female on the other and plug it

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.630 
one side female on the other and plug it
onto<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.730> board<00:04:14.090> back<00:04:14.390> here<00:04:14.660> that's<00:04:15.290> in<00:04:15.640> the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
onto this board back here that's in the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.400 
onto this board back here that's in the
controller<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.329> that's<00:04:17.870> how<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.049> program

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
controller and that's how you program

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.099 
controller and that's how you program
this<00:04:18.799> controller<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:20.060> adjust<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.870> voltage

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
this controller to adjust the voltage

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.190 
this controller to adjust the voltage
and<00:04:22.120> right<00:04:23.120> now<00:04:23.830> currently<00:04:25.330> when<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.510> wind<00:04:27.110> is

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
and right now currently when the wind is

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.990 
and right now currently when the wind is
going<00:04:27.470> really<00:04:27.620> hard<00:04:27.950> at<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:29.830> software<00:04:30.880> it's<00:04:31.880> a

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
going really hard at the software it's a

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.650 
going really hard at the software it's a
just<00:04:32.330> binary<00:04:32.570> code<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.169> you<00:04:33.290> put<00:04:33.470> in<00:04:33.650> with

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
just binary code that you put in with

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.390 
just binary code that you put in with
the<00:04:35.660> command<00:04:35.960> prompt<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.590> uh<00:04:38.980> you<00:04:39.980> program

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
the command prompt and uh you program

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.030 
the command prompt and uh you program
that<00:04:40.640> in<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.060> currently<00:04:41.750> limits<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
that in and it currently limits the

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.590 
that in and it currently limits the
voltage<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.580> 101<00:04:44.120> volts<00:04:45.370> so<00:04:46.370> basically<00:04:46.940> it

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
voltage to 101 volts so basically it

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.440 
voltage to 101 volts so basically it
keeps<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.620> i<00:04:49.070> guess<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.820> controller<00:04:50.300> from

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
keeps the i guess the controller from

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.750 
keeps the i guess the controller from
overloading<00:04:50.870> even<00:04:51.290> though<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.590> FM<00:04:52.130> 80<00:04:52.280> can<00:04:52.610> go

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
overloading even though the FM 80 can go

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.460 
overloading even though the FM 80 can go
all<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.880> way<00:04:52.940> up<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.120> 150<00:04:53.750> i'm<00:04:53.990> not<00:04:54.110> sure<00:04:54.320> why

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
all the way up to 150 i'm not sure why

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.090 
all the way up to 150 i'm not sure why
they<00:04:54.620> stopped<00:04:54.890> at<00:04:55.040> 101<00:04:56.800> but<00:04:57.800> if<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:57.950> go<00:04:58.040> to

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
they stopped at 101 but if you go to

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.570 
they stopped at 101 but if you go to
stats<00:04:59.800> okay<00:05:00.800> so<00:05:00.860> right<00:05:01.160> there<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.430> see

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
stats okay so right there you see

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.570 
stats okay so right there you see
maximum<00:05:02.090> voltage<00:05:02.240> was<00:05:02.600> 101<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.380> at<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:04.400> time

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
maximum voltage was 101 and at that time

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:12.100 
maximum voltage was 101 and at that time
I<00:05:04.850> was<00:05:05.120> getting<00:05:05.540> a<00:05:05.600> max<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:06.280> 3461<00:05:08.080> lots<00:05:10.330> so<00:05:11.330> this

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
I was getting a max of 3461 lots so this

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.110 
I was getting a max of 3461 lots so this
is<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.380> maximum<00:05:12.860> wattage<00:05:13.070> that<00:05:13.550> that<00:05:13.729> turbine

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
is the maximum wattage that that turbine

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.020 
is the maximum wattage that that turbine
is<00:05:14.270> put<00:05:14.479> out<00:05:15.280> although<00:05:18.190> back<00:05:19.190> here<00:05:19.610> I've

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
is put out although back here I've

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.090 
is put out although back here I've
actually<00:05:20.270> registered<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.760> right<00:05:22.760> here<00:05:23.090> at<00:05:24.100> 35

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
actually registered it right here at 35

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.560 
actually registered it right here at 35
hundred<00:05:25.610> watts<00:05:26.110> but<00:05:27.110> it<00:05:27.289> was<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:28.240> guess<00:05:29.240> only

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
hundred watts but it was I guess only

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.200 
hundred watts but it was I guess only
there<00:05:29.840> for<00:05:30.110> a<00:05:30.320> certain<00:05:31.280> you<00:05:31.520> know<00:05:31.669> brief

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
there for a certain you know brief

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.260 
there for a certain you know brief
period<00:05:32.570> of<00:05:32.600> time<00:05:32.800> so<00:05:33.800> it<00:05:33.919> didn't<00:05:34.220> register<00:05:34.820> it

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
period of time so it didn't register it

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.820 
period of time so it didn't register it
under<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.660> stats<00:05:36.370> here<00:05:38.229> so<00:05:39.229> that's

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
under the stats here so that's

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.890 
under the stats here so that's
interesting<00:05:40.070> i<00:05:40.370> could<00:05:40.580> call<00:05:41.030> a<00:05:41.060> re<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:41.750> say

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
interesting i could call a re and say

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.300 
interesting i could call a re and say
hey<00:05:42.080> I'd<00:05:42.289> like<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.590> get<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.830> voltage<00:05:43.160> up

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
hey I'd like to get the voltage up

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.969 
hey I'd like to get the voltage up
higher<00:05:43.750> maybe<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:44.930> 120<00:05:45.440> or<00:05:45.560> something<00:05:45.890> like

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
higher maybe to 120 or something like

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.670 
higher maybe to 120 or something like
that<00:05:46.039> and<00:05:46.370> what<00:05:46.820> they<00:05:46.970> could<00:05:47.150> do<00:05:47.360> is<00:05:47.620> send<00:05:48.620> me

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
that and what they could do is send me

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.640 
that and what they could do is send me
some<00:05:48.919> more<00:05:49.039> code<00:05:49.280> and<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.640> can<00:05:49.789> program

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
some more code and I can program

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.830 
some more code and I can program
this<00:05:51.220> box<00:05:51.520> again<00:05:51.910> to<00:05:52.150> make<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.419> bolt<00:05:52.600> that<00:05:52.750> you

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
this box again to make the bolt that you

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.040 
this box again to make the bolt that you
go<00:05:52.960> up<00:05:53.110> higher<00:05:54.090> so<00:05:57.600> theoretically<00:05:58.600> since

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
go up higher so theoretically since

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.840 
go up higher so theoretically since
they're<00:05:59.199> limiting<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.650> voltage<00:05:59.949> at<00:06:00.070> 101<00:06:00.580> if<00:06:00.759> I

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
they're limiting the voltage at 101 if I

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.390 
they're limiting the voltage at 101 if I
could<00:06:01.030> get<00:06:01.150> it<00:06:01.240> up<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:01.449> 120<00:06:02.310> 130<00:06:03.720> then<00:06:04.720> I<00:06:05.280> bet<00:06:06.280> we

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
could get it up to 120 130 then I bet we

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.939 
could get it up to 120 130 then I bet we
could<00:06:06.550> see<00:06:06.729> maximum<00:06:07.240> wattage<00:06:07.389> of<00:06:07.830> you<00:06:08.830> know

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
could see maximum wattage of you know

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.820 
could see maximum wattage of you know
between<00:06:09.190> four<00:06:09.690> maybe<00:06:10.690> close<00:06:10.930> to<00:06:10.960> 5000<00:06:11.620> watts

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
between four maybe close to 5000 watts

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.150 
between four maybe close to 5000 watts
and<00:06:12.130> talking<00:06:12.910> with<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.090> a<00:06:13.120> re<00:06:13.389> guy<00:06:13.800> in<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:14.949> lab

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
and talking with the a re guy in the lab

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.870 
and talking with the a re guy in the lab
they've<00:06:15.520> seen<00:06:15.789> their<00:06:16.440> turbines<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:18.039> AR<00:06:18.400> e110

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
they've seen their turbines the AR e110

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.620 
they've seen their turbines the AR e110
get<00:06:19.389> up<00:06:19.539> to<00:06:19.780> over<00:06:20.139> 4000<00:06:20.710> watts<00:06:21.750> but<00:06:22.750> I<00:06:23.070> guess

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
get up to over 4000 watts but I guess

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.029 
get up to over 4000 watts but I guess
you<00:06:25.630> get<00:06:25.720> to<00:06:25.780> put<00:06:25.930> limits<00:06:26.260> on<00:06:26.380> stuff<00:06:26.650> so<00:06:26.830> things

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
you get to put limits on stuff so things

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:36.900 
you get to put limits on stuff so things
don't<00:06:27.190> get<00:06:27.370> damaged<00:06:29.699> so

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.320 

there's<00:06:37.540> a<00:06:37.600> wind<00:06:37.840> menu<00:06:38.260> here<00:06:38.440> and<00:06:39.090> if<00:06:40.090> you<00:06:40.120> know

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
there's a wind menu here and if you know

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.320 
there's a wind menu here and if you know
the<00:06:40.480> key<00:06:40.720> here<00:06:41.490> if<00:06:42.490> you<00:06:42.640> enter<00:06:42.970> that<00:06:43.000> key<00:06:43.330> in<00:06:44.250> I

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
the key here if you enter that key in I

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.540 
the key here if you enter that key in I
don't<00:06:46.330> know<00:06:46.390> what<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.660> key<00:06:46.840> is<00:06:47.250> you<00:06:48.250> can<00:06:48.400> get

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
don't know what the key is you can get

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.580 
don't know what the key is you can get
inside<00:06:48.910> this<00:06:49.090> FM<00:06:49.420> 80<00:06:49.600> and<00:06:49.810> program<00:06:50.200> it<00:06:50.230> and<00:06:50.350> put

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
inside this FM 80 and program it and put

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.020 
inside this FM 80 and program it and put
your<00:06:50.770> own<00:06:52.200> your<00:06:53.200> win<00:06:53.800> curve<00:06:54.130> power<00:06:54.730> curve

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
your own your win curve power curve

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.910 
your own your win curve power curve
information<00:06:55.660> in<00:06:55.780> there<00:06:55.960> and<00:06:56.290> you<00:06:56.800> can

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
information in there and you can

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.450 
information in there and you can
probably<00:06:57.430> make<00:06:57.550> this<00:06:57.610> work<00:06:57.970> with<00:06:58.150> any<00:06:58.330> turbine

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
probably make this work with any turbine

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.520 
probably make this work with any turbine
especially<00:07:00.460> like<00:07:00.610> the<00:07:00.730> axial<00:07:01.180> flux<00:07:01.530> wind

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
especially like the axial flux wind

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.730 
especially like the axial flux wind
turbines<00:07:02.920> that<00:07:03.220> people<00:07:03.640> are<00:07:03.730> making<00:07:04.740> which

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
turbines that people are making which

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.550 
turbines that people are making which
are<00:07:05.890> so<00:07:06.010> popular<00:07:06.220> and<00:07:07.140> the<00:07:08.140> day<00:07:08.320> that<00:07:08.350> that

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
are so popular and the day that that

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.860 
are so popular and the day that that
happens<00:07:09.100> that<00:07:09.250> we<00:07:09.970> can<00:07:10.120> start<00:07:10.330> programming

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
happens that we can start programming

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.430 
happens that we can start programming
these<00:07:10.990> FM<00:07:11.320> 80s<00:07:12.450> will<00:07:13.450> be<00:07:13.600> the<00:07:13.750> day<00:07:13.900> that<00:07:13.930> people

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 
these FM 80s will be the day that people

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.800 
these FM 80s will be the day that people
can<00:07:14.560> just<00:07:14.760> make<00:07:15.760> their<00:07:15.910> own<00:07:15.940> wind<00:07:16.180> turbine<00:07:16.540> and

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
can just make their own wind turbine and

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.090 
can just make their own wind turbine and
put<00:07:16.900> this<00:07:17.020> multi<00:07:17.380> PowerPoint<00:07:17.830> tracker

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100 
put this multi PowerPoint tracker

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.940 
put this multi PowerPoint tracker
controller<00:07:18.880> on<00:07:19.090> it<00:07:19.240> and<00:07:19.750> getting<00:07:20.410> an<00:07:20.530> enormous

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950 
controller on it and getting an enormous

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.760 
controller on it and getting an enormous
amount<00:07:21.280> of<00:07:21.310> output<00:07:21.460> out<00:07:22.120> of<00:07:22.360> them<00:07:22.620> and<00:07:23.620> that

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
amount of output out of them and that

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.690 
amount of output out of them and that
would<00:07:23.860> be<00:07:23.890> sweet<00:07:24.690> so
