00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.460
HEX
Thanks Goose!

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.460
BAJO
Ok Hex, are you ready to grip the wheel and

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.480
put the pedal to the metal?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.470
HEX
Sure am, Bajo! I';m revved up and ready to

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.470
go!

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.470
DARREN
Ahh... negative.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.631
BAJO
What you talkin' bout Darren?

00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:13.700
DARREN
I'm the only one here with a professional

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.200
race car driver's license, so clearly I'm
the only one qualified to properly put Forza

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.990
Horizon 2 through its paces. With a bit of
help from Goose, of course.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.990
HEX
Darren!

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.980
DARREN
Will you help me get this hat off? I've got

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.540
another outfit to get into. Well, if you'll
excuse me... there's rubber to burn! See you

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.540
soon!

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.610
BAJO
He just took over the review!

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.470
HEX
I'm sure he'll do a really great job.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.140
BAJO
I wanted to review Forza Horizon 2...

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.359
HEX
You can still play the game!

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:40.732
GOOSE
Let's face it Darren, we're lost!

00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:44.320
DARREN
Au contraire Goose, my gps says we're exactly

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320
where we need to be.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.980
GOOSE
I can't even read the road signs, they're

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.980
not in English.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.609
DARREN
Oh, I'll translate for you! Oh, we're supposed

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.499
to turn left here.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:13.730
GOOSE
Oh, hang on! WOAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! The original

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.180
Forza Horizon is a spin off from the Forza
racing series. It focused more on open world

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.520
arcadey racing around a fictional 'Horizon
Festival'. This sequel opens up the world

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.759
even more, as the festival now takes place
in southern Europe where you can explore the

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:35.360
beautiful country side of both Italy, and
France. It really feels like the next step

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.790
for open world racers! Don't you think Darren?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.730
DARREN
Oui oui Goose! This is a remarkable racer

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.090
for many reasons, which we'll get into. But
first, it's important to point out that we

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.829
reviewed this on Xbox One. The 360 version
has a different lead developer, and no doubt

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.020
will be quite different.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.340
GOOSE
You begin the game by going on a road trip!

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.969
It's not a race exactly, just a way for you
to move through the game from one point to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.719
another, to begin a championship in another
location. And this sets up the theme of horizon

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.810
2 - blissful open world cruising.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.340
DARREN
Oui oui! There's nothing like jumping in a

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.310
muscle car and thrashing donuts through a
vineyard!

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.460
GOOSE
But of course - this is all about the racing.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.080
There are plenty of events from your standard
grid races, to off road circuits, to terrifying

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.780
night tracks where you can't see much at all!
There's even some wacky events to mix things

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.610
up, such as trying to beat jets, or a train.
I quite liked these silly little races, Darren.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.030
DARREN
Oui oui! They do add to the variety of it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.330
all. But technically they are just time trials,
as you don't really interact with the train

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.330
or jets.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.750
GOOSE
Yes, but it is exciting to see them whizz

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.070
past.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.060
DARREN
There are a few ways to increase your collection

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.580
of cars, you can simply buy them, and they're
priced quite reasonably with the in game currency.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.070
GOOSE
And it's nice that there's no more of those

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.350
pesky micro-transactions from Forza 5.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.220
DARREN
Ugh, they were tres horrible!

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.600
GOOSE
Good pronunciation! I also really liked that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.560
you can find old beat up cars in the 'barn
finds'. Every now and then you get a tip that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.450
there's an abandoned car in a certain area,
and it's up to you to find it. Then once it's

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.130
fixed up - you can take it for a ride. I especially
liked the old Combie Darren.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.420
DARREN
Of course you would Goose. Apparently there

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.130
are over 200 cars to collect. And the detail
is... magnifique! Mwah!

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.510
GOOSE
Yes, I don't think I've ever seen cars look

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.480
this good in a video game! The interiors are
gorgeous and you can see so many reflections

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.010
on the hood and around the car. Even the hub
caps! Plus when it rains, slight speckles

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.940
of water appear on your bonnet. And it runs
impressively smooth too.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.660
DARREN
It's quite an achievement to have so much

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.270
detail moving at such high speeds, without
any kind of frame rate issues. Colour me impressed.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.280
GOOSE
You really get the felling the developers

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.210
have taken it up a gear, with all that new
power in the console. Each time I'd look off

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.840
to the horizon, and see those mountains shimmering
in the distance, and the sunsets and the storm

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.920
clouds! I felt like I was there Darren!

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.830
DARREN
We are there Goose! This is also helped by

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.700
the sophisticated physics engine behind the
game! In fact, it's 'updating' 365 times a

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.480
second! So many processes!! This means, you
feel every bump and traction change. The road

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.410
will get noticeably slippery when there's
a bit of light rain. Dirt and tarmac all have

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.680
their own distinct feel too, so as you go
off road in a race it's important to adjust

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.049
your driving style to suit.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.940
GOOSE
The best part is nothing in this game is too

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.069
punishing. A slight bump with another car
won't cause a big crash and you're constantly

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.439
being rewarded with XP for just about everything
you do. If you have a Kinect, you can even

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:43.699
talk to the GPS which is very helpful if you're
stuck on what to do next. This is great because

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.219
initially that championship system is a bit
overwhelming.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.490
DARREN
Oui oui! I had many a good chat with the GPS,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.180
Anna. We struck up quite a rapport. There
are plenty of assist options too. So if you're

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.870
new to racing games, you can turn on breaking
and steering control, and adjust driver difficulty

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.270
until you find a setting that works for you.
But if you're an old school drifter, such

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.150
as myself, you can turn off all the assists
and give yourself a true challenge. Drifting

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.639
my car... spinning the tires...

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.710
GOOSE
Maybe you should leave the assists on for

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.020
now Darren. All in all, this is a very fun
racer and one of the best looking ones we've

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.449
ever seen in a long while. This is all magnified
when you take the game online and start roaming

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.889
around with your friends, challenging them
to jumps and just hanging out in fancy cars.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.370
I had a great time here Darren, so I'm giving
this 9 out of 10 rubber chickens. Et toi?

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.889
DARREN
I'm giving it a 9 as well! Oh, but we've got

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.020
to get back in time for the Darren Report!
Floor it Goose!

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.850
GOOSE
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!
