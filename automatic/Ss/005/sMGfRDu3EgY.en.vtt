the that's already priced then I think
that<00:05:13.789> a<00:05:13.820> lot<00:05:14.180> of<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.449> factors<00:05:14.960> involved<00:05:15.349> are

that a lot of the factors involved are

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.950 
that a lot of the factors involved are
already<00:05:16.070> showing<00:05:16.130> us<00:05:16.550> that<00:05:16.729> either<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.780> top

gold is going to go usually we have a

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.790 
gold is going to go usually we have a
bubble<00:05:26.330> just<00:05:26.960> as<00:05:27.139> there<00:05:27.500> was<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.620> lot<00:05:27.770> of

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800

excitement enthusiasm on the way up

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240 
excitement enthusiasm on the way up
there's<00:05:29.780> a<00:05:29.870> lot<00:05:29.930> of<00:05:30.080> panic<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.770> selling<00:05:31.159> on

there's a lot of panic and selling on

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.240 
there's a lot of panic and selling on
the<00:05:31.280> way<00:05:31.400> down<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:32.510> even<00:05:32.930> you<00:05:33.349> know<00:05:33.409> it<00:05:33.710> breaks

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
the way down and even you know it breaks

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.740 
the way down and even you know it breaks
above<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.760> long-term<00:05:34.880> average<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.539> flies

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
above the long-term average and flies

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.450 
above the long-term average and flies
above<00:05:36.050> it<00:05:36.199> but<00:05:36.320> on<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.889> way<00:05:37.010> down<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.340> actually

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
above it but on the way down it actually

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.399 
above it but on the way down it actually
overshoots<00:05:38.270> to<00:05:38.479> the<00:05:38.570> downside<00:05:38.780> we're<00:05:39.199> going

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
overshoots to the downside we're going

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.260 
overshoots to the downside we're going
down<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.740> probably<00:05:39.950> around<00:05:40.190> 700<00:05:40.820> well<00:05:41.090> right

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
down to probably around 700 well right

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.700 
down to probably around 700 well right
now<00:05:41.300> we're<00:05:41.599> seeing<00:05:41.810> that<00:05:42.080> so<00:05:42.500> many<00:05:42.590> people

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
now we're seeing that so many people

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.540

old or investing in it and they're

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.400

spurred<00:05:47.370> on<00:05:47.460> to<00:05:47.670> do<00:05:47.820> it<00:05:47.940> themselves<00:05:48.410> problem

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
spurred on to do it themselves problem

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.590 
spurred on to do it themselves problem
is<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.710> when<00:05:49.890> that<00:05:50.490> happens<00:05:50.640> it's<00:05:51.150> usually

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
is that when that happens it's usually

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.040 
is that when that happens it's usually
near<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.080> peak<00:05:52.940> the<00:05:53.940> Oni<00:05:54.090> Jacobs<00:05:54.570> but<00:05:54.930> you

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
near the peak the Oni Jacobs but you

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.630 
near the peak the Oni Jacobs but you
expect<00:05:55.410> something<00:05:55.590> big<00:05:55.920> to<00:05:56.070> happen<00:05:56.220> come

September<00:05:57.180> I<00:05:57.330> think<00:05:57.870> people<00:05:57.990> are<00:05:58.170> pushing<00:05:58.470> it

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
September I think people are pushing it

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.860 
September I think people are pushing it
off<00:05:58.890> the<00:05:59.400> entire<00:05:59.610> summer<00:06:00.000> it's<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.630> summer

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
off the entire summer it's the summer

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.540 
off the entire summer it's the summer
doldrums<00:06:01.380> people<00:06:01.800> are<00:06:01.920> looking<00:06:02.340> at<00:06:02.430> the

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
doldrums people are looking at the

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.860 
doldrums people are looking at the
election<00:06:02.910> year<00:06:03.060> waiting<00:06:03.240> for<00:06:03.480> some<00:06:03.630> kind<00:06:03.660> of

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
election year waiting for some kind of

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.230 
election year waiting for some kind of
action<00:06:04.830> and<00:06:05.310> especially<00:06:05.640> looking<00:06:05.910> at<00:06:06.150> the

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
action and especially looking at the

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.520 
action and especially looking at the
central<00:06:06.570> banks<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.020> Fed<00:06:07.230> to<00:06:07.410> do

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
central banks and the Fed to do

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.790 
central banks and the Fed to do
something<00:06:07.920> I'm<00:06:08.340> expecting<00:06:08.790> a<00:06:08.940> negative<00:06:09.300> shock

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
something I'm expecting a negative shock

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.020 
something I'm expecting a negative shock
but<00:06:10.800> there<00:06:10.950> still<00:06:11.070> is<00:06:11.220> a<00:06:11.340> possibility<00:06:11.820> that

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
but there still is a possibility that

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.030 
but there still is a possibility that
central<00:06:12.780> banks<00:06:12.810> do<00:06:13.110> something<00:06:13.440> stimulate<00:06:13.920> the

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
central banks do something stimulate the

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.010 
central banks do something stimulate the
economy<00:06:14.100> stimulate<00:06:14.850> with<00:06:15.720> more<00:06:15.900> money

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
economy stimulate with more money

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.840 
economy stimulate with more money
printing<00:06:16.500> and<00:06:16.650> that<00:06:16.770> helps<00:06:17.010> gold<00:06:17.250> I<00:06:17.430> think

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
printing and that helps gold I think

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.450 
printing and that helps gold I think
that<00:06:18.000> gold<00:06:18.360> will<00:06:19.350> likely<00:06:19.560> fall<00:06:19.890> together<00:06:20.130> with

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
that gold will likely fall together with

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.310 
that gold will likely fall together with
the<00:06:20.550> markets<00:06:20.910> if<00:06:21.150> we<00:06:21.330> enter<00:06:21.450> a<00:06:21.540> recession<00:06:21.960> what

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
the markets if we enter a recession what

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.810 
the markets if we enter a recession what
we're<00:06:22.440> seeing<00:06:22.560> right<00:06:22.680> now<00:06:22.770> is<00:06:22.890> a<00:06:23.040> recessionary

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
we're seeing right now is a recessionary

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.020 
we're seeing right now is a recessionary
or<00:06:24.480> deflationary<00:06:25.230> environment<00:06:25.550> coming<00:06:26.550> with

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
or deflationary environment coming with

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.850 
or deflationary environment coming with
emerging<00:06:27.840> market<00:06:28.110> slowdown<00:06:28.290> in<00:06:28.620> China

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
emerging market slowdown in China

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.700 
emerging market slowdown in China
commodity<00:06:29.640> slow<00:06:29.850> down<00:06:30.090> you<00:06:30.780> see<00:06:30.990> oil<00:06:31.200> under

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
commodity slow down you see oil under

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.640 
commodity slow down you see oil under
100<00:06:32.130> and<00:06:32.310> gold<00:06:32.700> under<00:06:33.060> 1,600<00:06:33.750> now<00:06:33.780> but<00:06:34.380> I<00:06:34.410> think

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
100 and gold under 1,600 now but I think

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.900 
100 and gold under 1,600 now but I think
we're<00:06:34.770> approaching<00:06:35.010> a<00:06:35.250> time<00:06:35.400> where<00:06:35.640> gold

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
we're approaching a time where gold

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.120 
we're approaching a time where gold
might<00:06:36.120> break<00:06:36.360> that<00:06:36.600> long-term<00:06:36.990> trend<00:06:37.350> gold<00:06:37.860> is

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
might break that long-term trend gold is

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.950 
might break that long-term trend gold is
not<00:06:38.340> safe<00:06:38.730> the<00:06:39.090> miners<00:06:39.390> has<00:06:39.510> been<00:06:39.660> what<00:06:39.840> I've

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
not safe the miners has been what I've

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.900 
not safe the miners has been what I've
been<00:06:40.050> shorting<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.740> entire<00:06:40.980> time<00:06:41.220> if<00:06:41.760> you're

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
been shorting the entire time if you're

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.130 
been shorting the entire time if you're
going<00:06:42.030> to<00:06:42.090> see<00:06:42.240> weakness<00:06:42.630> and<00:06:42.810> gold<00:06:42.990> it's

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
going to see weakness and gold it's

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
going to be led by the minor so we're

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.590 
going to be led by the minor so we're
dealing<00:06:44.670> with<00:06:44.700> golden<00:06:45.090> are<00:06:45.210> seeing<00:06:45.450> the

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
dealing with golden are seeing the

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.870 
dealing with golden are seeing the
slowdown<00:06:46.260> hitting<00:06:47.100> them<00:06:47.220> right<00:06:47.400> now<00:06:47.520> that's<00:06:47.730> a

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
slowdown hitting them right now that's a

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.090 
slowdown hitting them right now that's a
leading<00:06:48.480> indicator<00:06:48.660> for<00:06:49.500> goal<00:06:49.650> to<00:06:49.800> go<00:06:49.920> down

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
leading indicator for goal to go down

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.040 
leading indicator for goal to go down
that's<00:06:50.670> kind<00:06:50.850> of<00:06:50.880> a<00:06:51.030> dangerous<00:06:51.330> son<00:06:51.540> still

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
that's kind of a dangerous son still

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.020 
that's kind of a dangerous son still
looking<00:06:52.350> at<00:06:52.440> 1800<00:06:53.220> is<00:06:53.310> the<00:06:53.460> next<00:06:53.730> resistance

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
looking at 1800 is the next resistance

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.630 
looking at 1800 is the next resistance
level<00:06:54.330> which<00:06:54.720> gold<00:06:55.680> fell<00:06:55.950> that<00:06:56.100> twice<00:06:56.400> already

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
level which gold fell that twice already

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.360 
level which gold fell that twice already
this<00:06:56.820> year
