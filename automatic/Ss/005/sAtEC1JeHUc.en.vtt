and<00:00:47.280> right<00:00:47.460> hand<00:00:47.489> within<00:00:47.850> each<00:00:48.090> measure<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and right hand within each measure and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.900 
and right hand within each measure and
what<00:00:49.350> finger<00:00:49.710> number<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.280> want<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> play

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
what finger number they want you to play

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
what finger number they want you to play
it<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.350> example<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> first

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it with here so for example the first

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
it with here so for example the first
measure<00:00:53.280> has<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> v<00:00:53.969> between<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> C<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.660> G<00:00:56.000> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
measure has a v between the C and G and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.410 
measure has a v between the C and G and
the<00:00:57.120> next<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.449> has<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> 6<00:00:57.930> between<00:00:58.260> CNA<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.420> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the next one has a 6 between CNA and the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
the next one has a 6 between CNA and the
next<00:01:00.629> measure<00:01:00.780> has<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> 7th<00:01:01.649> between<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> C<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
next measure has a 7th between the C and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.910 
next measure has a 7th between the C and
B<00:01:02.989> then<00:01:03.989> goes<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> 6<00:01:06.350> measure<00:01:07.350> 4<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
B then goes back to the 6 measure 4 and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.840 
B then goes back to the 6 measure 4 and
then<00:01:08.040> measure<00:01:08.220> 5<00:01:08.490> goes<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.119> 5th<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:11.369> 6

in<00:01:14.090> measure<00:01:14.360> seven<00:01:14.780> goes<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.170> seventh

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
in measure seven goes to the seventh

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.610 
in measure seven goes to the seventh
this<00:01:16.610> time<00:01:16.850> played<00:01:17.120> together<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.840> then<00:01:18.440> the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
this time played together and then the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.460 
this time played together and then the
six<00:01:19.060> played<00:01:20.060> together<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:20.630> two<00:01:21.050> beats<00:01:21.229> and

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
six played together for two beats and

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.200 
six played together for two beats and
then<00:01:21.560> back<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.950> fifth

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.640 

the<00:01:26.210> next<00:01:26.510> section<00:01:26.660> starts<00:01:27.110> on<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.440> last

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
the next section starts on the last

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.430 
the next section starts on the last
measure<00:01:27.860> on<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.130> second<00:01:28.520> line<00:01:29.080> measure<00:01:30.080> nine

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
measure on the second line measure nine

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.410 
measure on the second line measure nine
you'll<00:01:31.340> notice<00:01:31.580> that<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.790> left<00:01:31.970> hand<00:01:32.210> has

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
you'll notice that the left hand has

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.200 
you'll notice that the left hand has
shifted<00:01:32.690> positions<00:01:33.290> 2f<00:01:33.729> should<00:01:34.729> play<00:01:34.910> left

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
shifted positions 2f should play left

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.790 
shifted positions 2f should play left
with<00:01:35.869> five<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.490> C<00:01:37.820> with<00:01:38.320> one<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:39.619> there's

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
with five and then C with one so there's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.490 
with five and then C with one so there's
a<00:01:39.890> fifth<00:01:40.220> on<00:01:44.410> f6<00:01:46.810> measure<00:01:47.810> eleven<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.289> goes<00:01:48.410> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
a fifth on f6 measure eleven it goes to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.490 
a fifth on f6 measure eleven it goes to
the<00:01:48.560> 7th<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.570> then<00:01:50.570> maybe<00:01:50.780> twelve<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.200> doesn't

notice<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.720> music<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.170> also<00:02:09.380> tells<00:02:09.709> you

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
notice in the music that also tells you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.860 
notice in the music that also tells you
to<00:02:09.890> play<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.160> with<00:02:10.280> two<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.940> four<00:02:11.209> always<00:02:11.570> pay

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
to play it with two and four always pay

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.840 
to play it with two and four always pay
attention<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.470> finger<00:02:12.769> numbers<00:02:12.890> then

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
attention to the finger numbers then

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.090 
attention to the finger numbers then
you'll<00:02:14.000> notice<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.690> ending<00:02:15.380> where<00:02:16.010> it

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
you'll notice that the ending where it

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.590 
you'll notice that the ending where it
says<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.430> AH<00:02:16.459> tempo<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:20.090> goes<00:02:20.239> back<00:02:20.480> to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
says the AH tempo that it goes back to

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.449 
says the AH tempo that it goes back to
the<00:02:20.750> same<00:02:20.959> way<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.350> what<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.799> did<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.340> very

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
the same way of what you did in the very

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.060 
the same way of what you did in the very
first<00:02:22.850> eight<00:02:23.090> measures<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.080> really<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.040> a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
first eight measures so really it's a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.979 
first eight measures so really it's a
lot<00:02:25.220> long<00:02:25.430> it's<00:02:25.700> really<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:26.000> 16<00:02:26.420> measure<00:02:26.630> piece

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
lot long it's really a 16 measure piece
