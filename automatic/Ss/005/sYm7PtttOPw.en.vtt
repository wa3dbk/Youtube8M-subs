 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.120
 I am Alexey and today I want your attention 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.110
 submit your new video on video 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.510
 spintires 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.369
 this time from the base mod reviews and 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.750
 Today I got a pretty review 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:29.050
 still interesting model is the VAZ 2121 Niva 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.869
 actually it replaces the UAZ 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.790
 there is already part to say so in 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.640
 the standard framework of that model is something 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.110
 replaces me, I hope soon put on 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.309
 converters learn all the same 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.280
 prescribe it separately 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.540
 but it also does not work multiplayer 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.250
 that is, before that before the game 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.710
 multiplayer, I still advise you 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 make a so-called backup backup 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.479
 a copy 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.820
 archive but there is one such plus you can 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.280
 install this mod does not 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.010
 only in the media archive but also in the media folder 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.650
 that is, if you look closely at 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.650
 root directory of the game you will see a folder 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.570
 media you can shove these here 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.100
 all the very files that come with the mod in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.870
 this folder and you could perfectly 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.020
 actually earn it right now it's me 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.390
 you and showing well let's 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.079
 let's start the car and see what's on it 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.439
 there are addons 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.090
 but most likely no no yes no 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.789
 there are no addons even 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.590
 off-road wheels so what are you not going 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.509
 cheer up let's just a little bit 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.320
 let's see how it gets dirty 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.320
 how wet 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.250
 dirt as you see sticks on the wheels 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.250
 pretty good let's dive 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.300
 Well, here we have the opportunity to see 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.920
 how wet the car gets dirty 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.510
 have us also slightly damaged 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.910
 front bumper as time to notice 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.880
 apparently after i stuck in the bottom 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.459
 that is, most puddles Well, that's actually 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.769
 probably this is what everyone wants 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.500
 say that this car is impossible 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.599
 By the way is suitable to open 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.910
 well, pretty simple cards like 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.980
 coasts either plain that is there in 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.160
 principle, well, almost nowhere to slip 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.590
 and here this car is just perfect 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.819
 way will suit you but it is all I 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.069
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.959
