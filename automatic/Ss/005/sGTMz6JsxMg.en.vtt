00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
weapon at level 25 we've got the you

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500 
weapon at level 25 we've got the you
reduced<00:00:25.230> recoil<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.830> improved<00:00:26.310> sights<00:00:26.760> now<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
reduced recoil and improved sights now I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.120 
reduced recoil and improved sights now I
haven't<00:00:28.050> gotten<00:00:28.199> there<00:00:28.410> yet<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> lot<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
haven't gotten there yet but a lot of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.310 
haven't gotten there yet but a lot of
people<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.580> been<00:00:29.699> disliking<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.689> level<00:00:30.990> 25

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
people have been disliking the level 25

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680 
people have been disliking the level 25
upgrades<00:00:31.830> rather<00:00:32.669> than<00:00:32.969> improving<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
upgrades rather than improving the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.650 
upgrades rather than improving the
recoil<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.320> gotten<00:00:34.739> worse<00:00:35.010> apparently<00:00:35.880> now

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
recoil it's gotten worse apparently now

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180 
recoil it's gotten worse apparently now
I<00:00:36.690> can't<00:00:37.140> claim<00:00:37.320> anything<00:00:37.739> yet<00:00:37.860> since<00:00:38.070> again

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I can't claim anything yet since again

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.280 
I can't claim anything yet since again
I'm<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.670> there<00:00:38.910> yet<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> base<00:00:39.870> recoil

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
I'm not there yet but the base recoil

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.740 
I'm not there yet but the base recoil
seemed<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.040> pretty<00:00:41.340> bearable<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.570> this

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
seemed to be pretty bearable for this

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
seemed to be pretty bearable for this
weapon<00:00:42.950> shooting<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> gun<00:00:44.250> feels<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.700> lot<00:00:44.850> more

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
weapon shooting the gun feels a lot more

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.450 
weapon shooting the gun feels a lot more
controllable<00:00:45.719> over<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> American<00:00:46.890> m1a1

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
controllable over the American m1a1

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.630 
controllable over the American m1a1
Thompson<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.899> at<00:00:49.140> level<00:00:49.469> 50<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
Thompson and then at level 50 we get a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
Thompson and then at level 50 we get a
bayonet<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.210> pretty<00:00:52.020> much<00:00:52.140> that's<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.559> for

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
bayonet and pretty much that's it for

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.180 
bayonet and pretty much that's it for
this<00:00:52.920> weapon<00:00:54.770> alright<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.160> let's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this weapon alright so now let's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.950 
this weapon alright so now let's
actually<00:00:56.610> get<00:00:56.940> into<00:00:57.090> some<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> these<00:00:57.600> specs

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
actually get into some of these specs

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.630 
actually get into some of these specs
and<00:00:58.260> compare<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.309> Allied

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and compare this to the Allied

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.869 
and compare this to the Allied
submachine<00:01:00.180> gun<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:01.230> type<00:01:01.500> 100<00:01:02.039> we've<00:01:02.340> we

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
submachine gun with a type 100 we've we

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.170 
submachine gun with a type 100 we've we
got<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> rate<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> fire<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:04.010> 400<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.040> 800<00:01:05.489> rounds

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
got a rate of fire of 400 to 800 rounds

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.590 
got a rate of fire of 400 to 800 rounds
per<00:01:06.240> minute<00:01:06.600> depending<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> model<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
per minute depending on the model and a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.679 
per minute depending on the model and a
muzzle<00:01:10.049> velocity<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.450> 335<00:01:12.890> meters<00:01:13.890> per<00:01:14.070> second

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
muzzle velocity of 335 meters per second

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.359 
muzzle velocity of 335 meters per second
the<00:01:15.689> Thompson<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.470> hand<00:01:16.770> has<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the Thompson on the other hand has a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.020 
the Thompson on the other hand has a
rate<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.610> fire<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> 600<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.400> 1,500<00:01:20.400> rounds<00:01:20.610> per

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
rate of fire of 600 to 1,500 rounds per

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.350 
rate of fire of 600 to 1,500 rounds per
minute<00:01:21.150> again<00:01:21.900> depending<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.500> its<00:01:22.680> model<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
minute again depending on its model the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.929 
minute again depending on its model the
muzzle<00:01:24.900> velocity<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> m1a1<00:01:26.220> Thompson<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
muzzle velocity for the m1a1 Thompson is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.190 
muzzle velocity for the m1a1 Thompson is
285<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.729> Thompson<00:01:30.299> you're<00:01:30.840> shooting

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
285 so with the Thompson you're shooting

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.990 
285 so with the Thompson you're shooting
more<00:01:31.409> bullets<00:01:31.740> at<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> enemy<00:01:32.400> indefinitely

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
more bullets at the enemy indefinitely

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.539 
more bullets at the enemy indefinitely
but<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> rate<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.500> fire<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.100> your

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
but with a rate of fire like that your

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.580 
but with a rate of fire like that your
recoil<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.210> accuracy<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> hinder

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
recoil and accuracy is going to hinder

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
recoil and accuracy is going to hinder
and<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.939> I've<00:01:39.060> experienced<00:01:39.840> when

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and that's what I've experienced when

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.310 
and that's what I've experienced when
using<00:01:40.290> new<00:01:40.439> Thompson<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.759> type<00:01:42.210> 100<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
using new Thompson with the type 100 the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.469 
using new Thompson with the type 100 the
lower<00:01:43.530> rate<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.890> fire<00:01:44.040> allows<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> very

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
lower rate of fire allows for a very

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.929 
lower rate of fire allows for a very
stable<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.200> accurate<00:01:46.439> weapon<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.759> packs

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
stable and accurate weapon and it packs

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.700 
stable and accurate weapon and it packs
a<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:48.450> powerful<00:01:48.720> punch<00:01:49.170> due<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.560> its

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
a more powerful punch due to its

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190 
a more powerful punch due to its
velocity<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> I'm<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
velocity so I'm going to go with the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
velocity so I'm going to go with the
type<00:01:52.409> 100<00:01:52.920> being<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> better<00:01:53.460> submachine<00:01:54.030> gun

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
type 100 being the better submachine gun

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.249 
type 100 being the better submachine gun
at<00:01:54.659> range<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.770> then<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.369> Thompson<00:01:57.140> being<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
at range and then the Thompson being a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.120 
at range and then the Thompson being a
better<00:01:58.409> submachine<00:01:58.979> gun<00:01:59.130> at<00:01:59.340> close<00:01:59.939> range<00:02:01.130> but

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
better submachine gun at close range but

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.770 
better submachine gun at close range but
again<00:02:02.369> that's<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.700> my<00:02:02.909> opinion<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780

the<00:02:06.240> comments<00:02:06.659> section<00:02:06.960> below

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.899 

the<00:02:10.289> way<00:02:10.439> I<00:02:10.469> use<00:02:10.799> this<00:02:10.950> weapon<00:02:11.159> is<00:02:11.400> similar<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
the way I use this weapon is similar to

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.140 
the way I use this weapon is similar to
the<00:02:12.090> way<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.329> use<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.810> VAR<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.859> Allied<00:02:14.040> side

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
the way I use the VAR on the Allied side

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.399 
the way I use the VAR on the Allied side
so<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.329> am<00:02:15.390> defending<00:02:15.870> most<00:02:16.049> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.230> time

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
so that I am defending most of the time

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.039 
so that I am defending most of the time
I<00:02:16.620> tend<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.400> find<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.909> nice<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.510> cozy<00:02:18.840> place

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
I tend to find a nice and cozy place

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.860 
I tend to find a nice and cozy place
behind<00:02:19.739> cover<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.280> suppress<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.239> enemy<00:02:21.359> from

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
but if it were down to preference I

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.879 
but if it were down to preference I
prefer<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:32.430> be<00:03:32.549> on<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.819> bottom<00:03:33.319> now<00:03:34.319> this<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.680> a

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
prefer to be on the bottom now this is a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810

they put into the statistics but the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.149

fired fully automatic I don't know what

fired fully automatic I don't know what
they<00:03:45.870> were<00:03:45.930> thinking<00:03:46.199> when<00:03:46.500> making<00:03:46.709> this

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
they were thinking when making this

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:47.749 
they were thinking when making this
design

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
design

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.300 
design
maybe<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.720> helped<00:03:49.079> reload<00:03:49.409> quicker<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:50.009> don't

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
maybe it helped reload quicker I don't

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.429 
maybe it helped reload quicker I don't
even<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.549> but<00:03:51.479> I<00:03:51.509> might<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.079> look<00:03:52.259> into

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
even know but I might have to look into

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.999 
even know but I might have to look into
that<00:03:52.560> because<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.970> British<00:03:54.389> ton<00:03:54.810> had<00:03:55.650> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.309 
that because the British ton had the
same<00:03:56.400> type<00:03:56.669> of<00:03:56.699> feature<00:03:57.180> where<00:03:57.509> the<00:03:57.689> magazine

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
same type of feature where the magazine

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.640 
same type of feature where the magazine
was<00:03:58.500> mounted<00:03:58.859> on<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.220> side<00:04:00.409> but<00:04:01.409> I<00:04:01.470> think

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
was mounted on the side but I think

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.710 
was mounted on the side but I think
that's<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.889> for<00:04:01.949> this<00:04:02.220> weapon<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.669> might<00:04:03.569> have

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
that's it for this weapon I might have

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.649 
that's it for this weapon I might have
missed<00:04:03.989> some<00:04:04.290> details<00:04:04.650> but<00:04:04.769> that's<00:04:05.069> alright

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
missed some details but that's alright

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.449 
missed some details but that's alright
my<00:04:06.659> goal<00:04:06.870> was<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.049> make<00:04:07.259> a<00:04:07.319> short<00:04:08.040> video<00:04:08.159> but

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
my goal was to make a short video but

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.229 
my goal was to make a short video but
again<00:04:08.729> cover<00:04:10.159> the<00:04:11.159> weapon<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:11.609> as<00:04:11.849> much<00:04:12.000> detail

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239
