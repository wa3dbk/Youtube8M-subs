00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 man would we have a project 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.370
 of country designed by people capable of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.420
 smart an inclusive project 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.600
 democratic tolerant and peaceful 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.610
 summit would be that we did not have a 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.500
 libertarian youth that was 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.410
 willing to defend this one with his life 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.689
 to Venezuela of this arbitrary regime and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.860
 authoritarian but we have it and our 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.860
 Youth will make a difference 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.900
 summit would be that the signatures that it carries 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.230
 Venezuela were not part of a 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.230
 confrontation 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.300
 summit would be that we did not have inflation 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.680
 that we did not have political prisoners that 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.560
 there was not so much hatred a new government 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.900
 summit would be that all Venezuelans 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.940
 we can decide what we want in 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.770
 our lives without the intervention of a 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.000
 government that wants to control everything 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.000
 ideal would be 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.300
 Summit summit would be that I saw you 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.430
 illusiona will deign to fix the date of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.140
 the parliamentary elections 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.090
 I would say that the venezuela government 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.980
 explain why in the country there is no 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.280
 freedom of expression in the media 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.990
 communication and there's censorship that means 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.079
 the official communication hegemony 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.090
 summit would be that the Venezuelan government 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.880
 put to jail his seven corrupt that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.340
 they have assets in the empire and that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.330
 money will be used for the welfare of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.040
 all Venezuelans 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.560
 summit would be that many Venezuelans 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.630
 they had to leave their country to 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.400
 look for the best quality of life and that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.680
 return the 25 million dollars that 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.160
 They have robbed Venezuela to have fun 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.810
 in food the education summit would be that 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.940
 the Latin American presidents 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.610
 will be aware of the validity of the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.860
 popular wisdom that prays today for you 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.060
 tomorrow for me venezuela was today 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.130
 you from almost every country 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.799
 Latin Americans do not deny their support 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.770
 summit would be that they did not use the power 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.380
 to enrich themselves persecute and abuse 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.560
 but to build and develop the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.560
 country
