got to do is a short video on how we
sharpen<00:00:18.090> our<00:00:18.180> knives<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:19.470> system<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.949> we

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
sharpen our knives the system that we

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.220 
sharpen our knives the system that we
use<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.609> if<00:00:21.390> we're<00:00:21.570> any<00:00:21.689> good<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.050> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
use and if we're any good at it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
nice edge on folding knives and we've

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.490 
nice edge on folding knives and we've
got<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.980> wider<00:01:01.980> angle<00:01:02.399> at<00:01:02.489> 25<00:01:02.910> degrees<00:01:03.500> which

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
got this wider angle at 25 degrees which

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.649 
got this wider angle at 25 degrees which
is<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.100> good<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.640> hard<00:01:06.360> use

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
is which is good for you know hard use

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020

big heavy knives that you might be using

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.370 
big heavy knives that you might be using
outdoors<00:01:09.450> where<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> need<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:09.990> edge<00:01:10.140> but

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
outdoors where you need an edge but

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.420 
outdoors where you need an edge but
might<00:01:10.590> last<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.369> bit<00:01:11.400> longer<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> happens

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
might last a bit longer just so happens

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.460 
might last a bit longer just so happens
that<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.670> need<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> sharpen<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.420> Ontario<00:01:16.020> rat<00:01:16.229> 1

I've been chopping up a lot of cardboard
lately<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> recycling<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> quick

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
lately for the recycling so I do a quick

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.550 
lately for the recycling so I do a quick
demo

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.190 

okay<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.360> sharpening<00:01:27.360> system<00:01:27.540> sits<00:01:27.990> on

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
okay so I have sharpening system sits on

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.780 
okay so I have sharpening system sits on
a<00:01:28.229> flat<00:01:28.680> surface<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.450> use<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.950> creek<00:01:31.950> 20<00:01:32.490> degree

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
a flat surface I use the creek 20 degree

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.960 
a flat surface I use the creek 20 degree
angle<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.329> is<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.509> take<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> knife

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
angle and all we do is we take the knife

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.450 
angle and all we do is we take the knife
alternating<00:01:41.970> from<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.360> side<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> other

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
alternating from one side to the other

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.700 
alternating from one side to the other
make<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> couple<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> passes<00:01:45.290> like<00:01:46.290> pressure

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
make a couple of passes like pressure

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
make a couple of passes like pressure
and<00:01:49.710> basically<00:01:50.689> slow<00:01:51.689> draw<00:01:52.229> cuts<00:01:53.540> don't<00:01:54.540> put

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
and basically slow draw cuts don't put

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.569 
and basically slow draw cuts don't put
too<00:01:54.869> much<00:01:54.899> pressure<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> blade<00:01:55.890> otherwise

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
too much pressure on the blade otherwise

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.639 
too much pressure on the blade otherwise
you<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.939> actually<00:01:57.329> damage<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> stones<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you can actually damage the stones and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.600 
you can actually damage the stones and
the<00:01:58.829> arm<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.030> blade<00:02:00.240> steel<00:02:00.509> itself<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
the arm and the blade steel itself I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.280 
the arm and the blade steel itself I
like<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.909> about<00:02:03.030> eight<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.509> ten<00:02:03.719> passes<00:02:04.170> on

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
like to do about eight to ten passes on

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.589 
like to do about eight to ten passes on
each<00:02:04.320> side<00:02:07.310> once<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.580> are<00:02:08.610> done<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
each side once we are done with the

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.280 
each side once we are done with the
course<00:02:11.870> rods<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:14.079> switch<00:02:15.079> them<00:02:15.260> up<00:02:16.749> pop<00:02:17.749> in<00:02:17.989> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
course rods I switch them up pop in the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.250 
course rods I switch them up pop in the
the<00:02:19.040> fine<00:02:19.310> ceramic<00:02:19.790> rods<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.939> then<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:24.019> will

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
the fine ceramic rods and then this will

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.770 
the fine ceramic rods and then this will
just<00:02:24.349> help<00:02:24.560> take<00:02:24.859> that<00:02:25.069> little<00:02:25.310> bear<00:02:25.549> off

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
just help take that little bear off

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.319 
just help take that little bear off
finish<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.049> edge<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.750> hopefully<00:02:31.329> we

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
finish up the edge and hopefully we

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.289 
finish up the edge and hopefully we
sharpen<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.930> knife<00:02:33.079> I<00:02:33.409> don't<00:02:33.889> have<00:02:34.099> a<00:02:34.129> strop<00:02:34.489> I

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
sharpen the knife I don't have a strop I

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.420 
sharpen the knife I don't have a strop I
really<00:02:36.230> would<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.769> get<00:02:37.069> one<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.280> just

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
really would like to get one I just
