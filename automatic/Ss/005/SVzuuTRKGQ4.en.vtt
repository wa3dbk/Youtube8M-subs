would take the rhubarb and she would

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
would take the rhubarb and she would
just<00:00:23.130> boil<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.550> down<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:23.970> water<00:00:24.480> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
would be we'd add a little bit of

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
would be we'd add a little bit of
strawberry<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.510> too<00:00:30.869> or<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.380> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
strawberry to that too or have it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.870 
strawberry to that too or have it
without<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.980> strawberry<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> rhubarb

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
without the strawberry just the rhubarb

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.940 
without the strawberry just the rhubarb
and<00:00:33.059> put<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.660> some<00:00:33.870> ice<00:00:34.020> cream<00:00:34.350> tastes

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and put it on to some ice cream tastes

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
and put it on to some ice cream tastes
just<00:00:35.219> wonderful<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.420> when<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
just wonderful so when you have a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
just wonderful so when you have a
rhubarb<00:00:37.739> plant<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:39.030> big<00:00:39.239> they

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
rhubarb plant they get really big they

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
rhubarb plant they get really big they
have<00:00:39.540> big<00:00:39.809> celery<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.649> stalks<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> just

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
have big celery like stalks that just

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.580 
have big celery like stalks that just
take<00:00:41.910> over<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:42.840> big<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.320> massive

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
take over and they get big and massive

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.250 
take over and they get big and massive
so<00:00:44.399> when<00:00:44.550> you're<00:00:44.670> transplanting<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.719> it's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so when you're transplanting them it's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.830 
so when you're transplanting them it's
almost<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.739> peony<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.640> any<00:00:47.879> type<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> plant

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
almost like a peony or any type of plant

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.650 
almost like a peony or any type of plant
that<00:00:49.050> has<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> big<00:00:49.620> root<00:00:49.950> stalk<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.789> long<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.570> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
that has a big root stalk as long as you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
that has a big root stalk as long as you
got<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:52.079> stem<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> root<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.250> will<00:00:53.430> start<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
got some stem and root it will start a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.240 
got some stem and root it will start a
new<00:00:54.059> plant<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.020> don't<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
new plant you don't want to have the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
new plant you don't want to have the
roots<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.640> pieces<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> roots<00:00:57.510> won't<00:00:57.750> grow

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
roots just pieces the roots won't grow

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.920 
roots just pieces the roots won't grow
they<00:00:58.469> still<00:00:58.800> need<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> eyes<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.780> you're

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
they still need the eyes so when you're

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.720 
they still need the eyes so when you're
transplanting<00:01:01.410> them<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.039> could<00:01:02.219> cut<00:01:02.430> right

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
transplanting them you could cut right

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.060 
transplanting them you could cut right
down<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.030> middle<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> side<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
down the middle or right to the side and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.670 
down the middle or right to the side and
make<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.400> into<00:01:05.930> triangles<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.200> long<00:01:07.500> as

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
make them into triangles as long as

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.740 
make them into triangles as long as
you've<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> stem<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.720> root

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you've got some of the stem and the root

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.890 
you've got some of the stem and the root
and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.610> transplant<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> right<00:01:12.390> away

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and then you transplant it right away

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
and then you transplant it right away
it<00:01:12.960> will<00:01:13.200> grow<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it will grow because they don't like to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.070 
it will grow because they don't like to
be<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> ground<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.360> dry<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.720> real

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
be out of the ground they dry out real

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.160 
be out of the ground they dry out real
easily<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.680> rhubarb<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.939> best<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.570> transplant

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
easily and rhubarb is best to transplant

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
easily and rhubarb is best to transplant
in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> fall<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> winter<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> early

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
in the fall or the winter or the early

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
in the fall or the winter or the early
spring<00:01:21.600> when<00:01:22.439> they<00:01:22.619> haven't<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.520> they're<00:01:23.850> not

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
spring when they haven't are they're not

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.060 
spring when they haven't are they're not
growing<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> producing<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.320> rhubarb<00:01:25.650> stems

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
growing and producing the rhubarb stems

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.149 
growing and producing the rhubarb stems
and<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.360> they<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.750> produce<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.470> stems<00:01:28.740> towards

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and so they do produce the stems towards

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
and so they do produce the stems towards
late<00:01:29.369> summer<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:30.030> fall<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:30.990> soon<00:01:31.140> as

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
late summer into fall so as soon as

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
late summer into fall so as soon as
they're<00:01:31.530> done<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> spring<00:01:32.790> then

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
they're done or in the spring then

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.880 
they're done or in the spring then
that's<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> best<00:01:33.930> time<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.140> transplant<00:01:34.470> them

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that's the best time to transplant them

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
that's the best time to transplant them
and<00:01:35.220> always<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.700> them<00:01:35.820> into<00:01:35.939> full<00:01:36.270> Sun<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and always put them into full Sun and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
and always put them into full Sun and
make<00:01:37.409> sure<00:01:37.590> they<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:37.950> composted

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
make sure they have good composted

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
make sure they have good composted
