quick video of the projects here so I
just<00:00:24.330> um<00:00:24.660> at<00:00:25.230> hack<00:00:25.710> Pittsburgh<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.869> turned

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
just um at hack Pittsburgh I just turned

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.519 
just um at hack Pittsburgh I just turned
this<00:00:28.050> nice<00:00:28.519> pulley<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.179> lathe<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.689> other

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this nice pulley on the lathe the other

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.780 
this nice pulley on the lathe the other
day<00:00:31.769> well<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.160> actually<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> first

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
day well this is actually the first

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.610 
day well this is actually the first
thing<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.090> ever<00:00:33.120> turned<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> lathe<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.260> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
thing I ever turned on a lathe and this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.160 
thing I ever turned on a lathe and this
is<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.160> plumb<00:00:35.760> bob<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.180> didn't<00:00:36.750> make<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.960> hole

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
is just a plumb bob I didn't make a hole

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.930 
is just a plumb bob I didn't make a hole
for<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> string<00:00:37.770> yet<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> plumb

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
for the string yet but that's a plumb

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.799 
for the string yet but that's a plumb
bob<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:41.059> but<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.390> first<00:00:42.600> thing<00:00:42.690> I've

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
bob so but that's the first thing I've

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.830 
bob so but that's the first thing I've
returned<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.649> lathe<00:00:43.890> does<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
returned and this lathe does have a it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.590 
returned and this lathe does have a it
basically<00:00:46.140> has<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.500> cross<00:00:46.800> feeds<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> there's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
basically has to cross feeds so there's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.630 
basically has to cross feeds so there's
the<00:00:48.780> feed<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.320> goes<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.739> way<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the feed that goes this way so if you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.630 
the feed that goes this way so if you
have<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> spindle<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
have the spindle here so if this is the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.760 
have the spindle here so if this is the
spindle<00:00:53.940> over<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.870> where<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.469> your

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
spindle over here where you put your

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.080 
spindle over here where you put your
material<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
material you have your one your this is

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.029 
material you have your one your this is
the<00:01:00.329> travel<00:01:00.899> or<00:01:00.989> something<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> have

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the travel or something then you have

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.830 
the travel or something then you have
your<00:01:02.280> cross<00:01:02.489> feed<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.910> goes<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
your cross feed that goes this way and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.100 
your cross feed that goes this way and
then<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:05.100> has<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.369> third<00:01:05.729> axis<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
then this one has a third axis that is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.640 
then this one has a third axis that is
variable<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:07.770> called<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> compound

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
variable and it's called a compound

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.840 
variable and it's called a compound
compound<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.890> something<00:01:11.280> compound<00:01:11.760> feed<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
compound to something compound feed I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.710 
compound to something compound feed I
forgot<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.090> called<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.570> what

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
forgot what it's called but that's what

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
forgot what it's called but that's what
the<00:01:15.810> turrets<00:01:16.110> mounted<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.729> angle

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the turrets mounted on so you can angle

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.149 
the turrets mounted on so you can angle
that<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.390> any<00:01:18.540> angle<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.830> angle

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that at any angle and if you like angle

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:20.840 
that at any angle and if you like angle
it<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> way

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it this way

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.710 
it this way
then<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.810> cut<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.320> perfect<00:01:23.100> angle<00:01:24.030> like

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
then you can cut a perfect angle like

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.170 
then you can cut a perfect angle like
this<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:25.950> nice<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
this it's really nice I really like it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.280 
this it's really nice I really like it
the<00:01:27.360> only<00:01:27.479> problem<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.900> ladies<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the only problem with the ladies of the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
the only problem with the ladies of the
blade<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:30.000> worn

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
blade is it's really really really worn

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.830 
blade is it's really really really worn
out<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.979> needs<00:01:32.130> some<00:01:32.340> work<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.119> let's

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
out and it needs some work but let's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
out and it needs some work but let's
just<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> Ben<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.400> yeah<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
just kind of Ben I don't know yeah so I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.289 
just kind of Ben I don't know yeah so I
need<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.420> work<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.759> then<00:01:38.759> I've<00:01:38.909> turned<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
need some work but then I've turned this

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.249 
need some work but then I've turned this
nice<00:01:40.049> pulley<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> my<00:01:41.640> ingots

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
nice pulley out of one of my ingots

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.039 
nice pulley out of one of my ingots
ICAST<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.390> got<00:01:45.600> three<00:01:45.930> different

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
ICAST so this is got three different

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
ICAST so this is got three different
grooves<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.189> there<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.360> it's<00:01:51.360> pretty<00:01:51.630> nice

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
grooves on there and it's pretty nice

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.200 
grooves on there and it's pretty nice
but<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.759> aluminum

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
but you can see that the aluminum

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.990 
but you can see that the aluminum
quality<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.259> best<00:01:55.520> it's<00:01:56.520> got<00:01:56.759> some

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
quality is not the best it's got some

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.300 
quality is not the best it's got some
like<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.049> gummy<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.100> really

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
like it was really gummy it was really

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.830 
like it was really gummy it was really
gumming<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> tools<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.299> stuff<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
gumming up the tools and stuff but you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929 
gumming up the tools and stuff but you
can<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.170> there's<00:02:01.380> some<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> slag<00:02:02.610> got<00:02:02.850> in

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
can see there's some of the slag got in

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.149 
can see there's some of the slag got in
there<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.299> was<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:04.200> make<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> lot<00:02:04.740> heavier

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
there I was gonna make it a lot heavier

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.010 
there I was gonna make it a lot heavier
and<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.640> would<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.880> made<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.600> but

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and I would have made a lot of here but

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.809 
and I would have made a lot of here but
this<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.560> full<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.920> slag<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.489> here<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.789> I

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
this was all full of slag in here that I

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
this was all full of slag in here that I
had<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.090> cut<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.590> made<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> lot<00:02:10.950> lighter

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
had to cut out so it made a lot lighter

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.570 
had to cut out so it made a lot lighter
but<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.430> turned<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.730> pretty<00:02:11.790> good

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
but it turned out pretty good

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.550 
but it turned out pretty good
for<00:02:12.910> my<00:02:13.030> second<00:02:13.450> second<00:02:14.020> thing<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.200> ever<00:02:14.230> turned

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
for my second second thing I ever turned

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.200 
for my second second thing I ever turned
on<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.770> lathe<00:02:14.950> what<00:02:15.610> used<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.850> be<00:02:15.940> anything

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
on the lathe what used to be anything

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.110 
on the lathe what used to be anything
get<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.070> then<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.100> was<00:02:18.250> also<00:02:18.550> poking

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
get like that and then I was also poking

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.580 
get like that and then I was also poking
around<00:02:19.180> at<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> high<00:02:19.690> voltage<00:02:19.990> power<00:02:20.200> supply

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
around at the high voltage power supply

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.470 
around at the high voltage power supply
oh<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.430> also<00:02:21.550> got<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> pulse<00:02:22.180> furnace

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
oh and I also got the pulse furnace

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.930 
oh and I also got the pulse furnace
running<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:24.040> video<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> works

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
running I have a video that in the works

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.360 
running I have a video that in the works
but<00:02:25.240> right<00:02:25.900> lately<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.620> not<00:02:26.800> been<00:02:26.980> into

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
but right lately I have not been into

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.440 
but right lately I have not been into
editing<00:02:27.790> real<00:02:27.970> at<00:02:28.900> all<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:30.030> I'll<00:02:31.030> try<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.300> get

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
editing real at all so I'll try to get

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.080 
editing real at all so I'll try to get
that<00:02:31.570> out<00:02:31.750> soon<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.440> video<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.700> was

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
that out soon a video that but I was

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.720 
that out soon a video that but I was
starting<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.100> look<00:02:36.100> into<00:02:36.430> reverse

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
starting to look into reverse

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.250 
starting to look into reverse
engineering<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.330> circuit<00:02:37.660> board<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:37.900> here<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.200> I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
engineering a circuit board on here so I

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.600 
engineering a circuit board on here so I
can<00:02:38.410> figure<00:02:38.620> out<00:02:38.740> how<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:38.980> works<00:02:39.190> because<00:02:39.370> it

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
can figure out how it works because it

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.810 
can figure out how it works because it
uses<00:02:39.730> some<00:02:40.000> kind<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.450> interface<00:02:41.550> connector<00:02:42.550> so

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
uses some kind of interface connector so

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.750 
uses some kind of interface connector so
I<00:02:43.090> figure<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:43.750> how<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:43.960> thing<00:02:44.170> works<00:02:44.380> but

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
I figure out how this thing works but

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.040 
I figure out how this thing works but
but<00:02:45.760> yeah<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.120> they'll<00:02:46.270> view<00:02:46.390> videos<00:02:46.750> coming

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
but yeah so they'll view videos coming

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.310 
but yeah so they'll view videos coming
I'm<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.410> not<00:02:47.860> not<00:02:48.160> into<00:02:48.460> editing<00:02:48.850> right<00:02:49.030> now

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
I'm just not not into editing right now

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.480 
I'm just not not into editing right now
probably<00:02:50.320> this<00:02:50.590> week<00:02:50.830> sometime<00:02:51.220> will<00:02:51.370> have

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
probably this week sometime will have

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.350 
probably this week sometime will have
sometimes<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:52.060> get<00:02:52.180> editing<00:02:52.930> but<00:02:53.260> um<00:02:53.470> yeah<00:02:54.430> up

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
sometimes I get editing but um yeah up

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.380 
sometimes I get editing but um yeah up
until<00:02:55.510> then<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:56.230> more<00:02:56.850> happy<00:02:57.850> Memorial<00:02:58.060> Day

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
until then have more happy Memorial Day

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.430 
until then have more happy Memorial Day
guys<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.040> keep<00:03:00.040> exploring
