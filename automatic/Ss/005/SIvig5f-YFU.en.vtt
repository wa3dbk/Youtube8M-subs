00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.840
 with the concept for vintage cars, the fourteenth all meals from 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:06.520
 a car 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.760
 in those ten guests, in addition, the option to choose immediately 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.209
 that you serve the meal 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.660
 the concept becomes possible with the series succeeding the forward contract heat with 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.419
 variable temperature setting of the seat 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.949

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.380
 a tasty fresh experience 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 I got the chance to have breakfast sandwiches the night before 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.930
 matter 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 the unique the bread in Sneek pastridor's meals 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.010
 frozen in the wagon 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.260
 the hot meals also come from the cold store 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.370
 in the 15 minutes the bread products are ready at a perfect temperature 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 Many guests choose to serve breakfast themselves 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.790
 Today's rules are simple or a delicious fresh cheese sandwich 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.940
 surprise your guests with options for lunch 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.000
 richly filled hot sandwich 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.400
 or rather a savory snack 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.720
 a tasty snack like b 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.320
 8 or a little later in the evening 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.220
 a fire or other surprise appears so far in his pizza sandwich 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.380
 You can see your guests and you can read them 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.310
 it is good meals and the guests can choose the latter 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.560
 moment 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 the hot meal because then does not have reported billion dropped 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.140
 it for our concept 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.330
 this has many benefits 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.650
 a tasty meal all day long 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.130
 how guests 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.750
 optimum freedom of choice 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.750
 the work can be planned flexibly 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 the lower investment because this includes all meals 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.930
 an MBA 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 no more maintenance and less waste result in substantial savings 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.460
 electoral search for long-term contact de not only generates customized but insures it 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460
 also maintains temperature during serving 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.239
 in days 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.929
 all meals 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.279
 optimum freedom of choice for the top ten is my experience
