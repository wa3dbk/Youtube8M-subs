 today's tutorial colored signs in 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.110
 the past on the xbox 360 ps3 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.509
 version everything went so anyway 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 carl at the xbox only with safe file 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.979
 Tricks with mods and a few things with 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.439
 the game scores to work on now 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.610
 the xbox was ps4 version goes all the way 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.590
 by orders 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.329
 you do not need a keyboard anymore 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.460
 it is a bit hidden for me 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.560
 show you now how it works 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.110
 there is in the description of the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.490
 all the short videos you need so 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.049
 Let's start here I have here 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.820
 already a few things prepared here 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.329
 so all the important colors there are 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.219
 16 colors in total you take a sign 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.570
 Let's tell her the first one 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.710
 row at black writing who still 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.710
 times you go to the icons here under 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.500
 with lt, this is where i appear 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.600
 Now call it what is the tab 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.950
 There you have to sign with a bit 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.590
 press longer and then dive 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.900
 left that paragraph sign on real 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.090
 a bit hidden alma paragraph 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.830
 back to normal writing and again 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.460
 Now you choose a color like 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.120
 said from 1 to 9 and from a to abcd 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.159
 e 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.220
 I think I'll go take the colors 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:32.049
 like o module the seven and write 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.390
 a paragraph behind it was just hello easy 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.519
 short works hello then we'll do it 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.970
 finished then that looks like that on the blackboard 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.280
 from § 7 hello and already we have one 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.890
 gray font you can as I said 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.629
 with this paragraph sign in 16 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.950
 different colors make a little one 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.319
 tip on the edge 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.629
 You can sign those by the paragraf 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.920
 hear the limitation of the signs on it 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.359
 can influence Write 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.590
 For example, I had one here 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:04.780
 is a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 abcdef 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.440
 still written and somewhere you see 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.390
 all the four missing the 840 move 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.950
 it lacks the characters 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.569
 you can write endlessly out of it 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.250
 but it is still not displayed 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.959
 so a little on the limit 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.510
 pay attention when you get the first lyrics 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.909
 tried what my second story 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.349
 So you can also without any problems 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.200
 switch back a bit longer 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:32.010
 Let's go paragraf times 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:35.829
 Writing the 2 was my favorite word 9 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.930
 Let's write a deeper one 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.980
 we press again to turn it on 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.000
 park was 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:54.099
 let's take bbb and sales have 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.590
 my friends my friends we have it 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.949
 but already finished and look like 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.109
 It looks like nine friends are fine 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.970
 Part one done as I said all 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.040
 Please take care of that 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.760
 paragraph and draw a blank 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.349
 to leave before you write part 2 how 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.930
 we can do that with the scriptures 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.419
 you once colored and once in black 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.769
 you noticed that people always 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.639
 a recommendation but actually 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.260
 goes more 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.169
 I just show it for a very short time 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.180
 same tipper not that z again home 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.039
 on paragraph now we are looking for 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.289
 First again a color statement we 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.880
 stay with b say any one now 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.200
 pay column here to the half 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.710
 Sorry I have only the second 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.419
 part 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.090
 now we have a few more power 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.990
 tuned 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.850
 and there could be anyone 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.290
 Letters dranhängen except the first 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.330
 which are taken for the colors so 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.650
 it is always recommended that k but me 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.220
 have already tried the z shows 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.740
 it is also very short as well 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.650
 you have the pay column ready look 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.780
 look at us and there are already 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.910
 as I said as a short proof again 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.410
 including what do once a 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.870
 Press a little longer today 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.910
 again the same b 1 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:12.660
 that does not stay close to each other 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:16.680
 this is exactly the wrong thing here 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.750
 is that yes yes every letter goes 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.370
 so it must be clear so 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.730
 every other letter as well 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.830
 Letters you for the colors 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.680
 used you can use 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.660
 then have that and that's what we say 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.460
 just once quite simple with no color when 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.140
 It really does happen then 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.460
 even the tutorial concluded 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.940
 I'll just do it, too 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.140
 only paragraph sign a letter 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:47.490
 besides the colors of the wine paragraph 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:49.650
 finished and looks in black I think 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.810
 me for modern textures synonymous for 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.330
 city ​​so better for coach as if it were something like that 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.040
 runs a number kolonne runs a lot and 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.830
 there will certainly be a possibility 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.930
 to use such signs sometimes 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.130
 but please do not ask me now 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.900
 the deeper meaning 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.560
 that was short and sweet on the 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.060
 Holiday does not want to hold you long 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.400
 enjoy the nice weekend community 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.500
