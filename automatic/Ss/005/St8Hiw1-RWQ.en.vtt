00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799 
the final component that we want to

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.369 
the final component that we want to
attach<00:00:12.129> to<00:00:12.160> the<00:00:12.820> pixhawk<00:00:13.480> flight<00:00:13.930> controller

is<00:00:14.650> the<00:00:15.490> turnigy<00:00:16.029> 9x<00:00:17.070> receiver<00:00:18.070> and<00:00:19.259> in<00:00:20.259> order

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
is the turnigy 9x receiver and in order

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.400 
is the turnigy 9x receiver and in order
to<00:00:20.740> do<00:00:20.890> that<00:00:21.099> we<00:00:21.669> first<00:00:21.910> have<00:00:22.090> to<00:00:22.509> connect<00:00:23.289> it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
to do that we first have to connect it

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.330 
to do that we first have to connect it
to<00:00:23.880> what's<00:00:24.880> called<00:00:25.060> a<00:00:25.269> ppm<00:00:25.720> encoder<00:00:26.230> now<00:00:27.070> if

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
to what's called a ppm encoder now if

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.519 
to what's called a ppm encoder now if
you<00:00:27.490> ask<00:00:27.699> me<00:00:28.090> this<00:00:28.810> particular<00:00:29.140> ppm<00:00:30.010> encoder

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
you ask me this particular ppm encoder

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.930 
you ask me this particular ppm encoder
seems<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.739> me<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.190> terminals<00:00:33.670> are

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
seems to me that the terminals are

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.829 
seems to me that the terminals are
upside<00:00:34.300> down<00:00:34.360> I'll<00:00:34.930> tell<00:00:35.140> you<00:00:35.230> why<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:37.690> we

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
upside down I'll tell you why when we

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.869 
upside down I'll tell you why when we
connect<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.930> wires<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.650> each<00:00:41.680> channel<00:00:42.400> we

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
connect the the wires to each channel we

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.130 
connect the the wires to each channel we
have<00:00:43.059> our<00:00:43.120> signal<00:00:43.809> wires<00:00:44.019> on<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:45.909> top<00:00:46.540> roll<00:00:46.839> of

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
have our signal wires on the top roll of

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.289 
have our signal wires on the top roll of
pins

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.299 
pins

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.700 
pins
that's<00:00:49.299> the<00:00:49.510> white<00:00:49.720> wire<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.260> white<00:00:50.440> wire<00:00:50.680> is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
that's the white wire the white wire is

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.670 
that's the white wire the white wire is
our<00:00:51.100> signal<00:00:51.549> wire<00:00:51.729> and<00:00:52.420> when<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:53.080> connect<00:00:53.470> it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
our signal wire and when you connect it

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.100 
our signal wire and when you connect it
it's<00:00:54.010> very<00:00:54.339> important<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.659> is<00:00:55.690> on<00:00:55.989> the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
it's very important that it is on the

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.079 
it's very important that it is on the
top<00:00:56.350> roll<00:00:56.619> of<00:00:56.769> pins<00:00:57.100> because<00:00:57.460> that<00:00:57.850> roll<00:00:58.059> of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
top roll of pins because that roll of

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.469 
top roll of pins because that roll of
pins<00:00:58.799> are<00:00:59.799> the<00:00:59.979> is<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.400> row<00:01:00.549> of<00:01:00.580> pins<00:01:01.000> that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
pins are the is the row of pins that

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.160 
pins are the is the row of pins that
provide<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.589> signal<00:01:02.979> from<00:01:03.189> the<00:01:03.309> radio

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
provide the signal from the radio

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.789 
provide the signal from the radio
however<00:01:05.170> when<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.650> go<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.159> connect<00:01:06.729> it<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:07.119> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
however when you go to connect it to the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.789 
however when you go to connect it to the
PPM<00:01:08.799> encoder<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.790> have<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.750> give<00:01:10.960> each<00:01:11.290> one<00:01:11.650> of

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
PPM encoder you have to give each one of

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.219 
PPM encoder you have to give each one of
these<00:01:11.979> wires<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.520> twist<00:01:13.119> so<00:01:13.689> that<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.020> white

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
these wires a twist so that the white

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.969 
these wires a twist so that the white
signal<00:01:14.770> wire<00:01:14.979> is<00:01:15.310> on<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.299> bottom<00:01:16.829> and<00:01:17.829> now

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
signal wire is on the bottom and now

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.669 
signal wire is on the bottom and now
this<00:01:18.189> is<00:01:18.369> looking<00:01:18.520> at<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.119> PPM<00:01:19.960> encoder<00:01:20.380> from

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
this is looking at the PPM encoder from

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.510 
this is looking at the PPM encoder from
the<00:01:20.799> underside<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.329> have<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:23.310> give<00:01:24.310> though

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
the underside so you have to give though

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.840 
the underside so you have to give though
each<00:01:24.789> connector<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.420> twist<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.249> white

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
each connector a twist so that the white

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.349 
each connector a twist so that the white
signal<00:01:28.390> wire<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.929> on<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.799> bottom<00:01:30.310> when<00:01:31.060> you're

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
signal wire is on the bottom when you're

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.200 
signal wire is on the bottom when you're
looking<00:01:31.719> at<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.049> underside<00:01:32.469> of<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.789> encoder

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
looking at the underside of the encoder

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.359 
looking at the underside of the encoder
now<00:01:34.749> you<00:01:34.810> may<00:01:35.109> be<00:01:35.140> asking<00:01:35.289> yourself<00:01:35.920> why<00:01:36.189> are

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
now you may be asking yourself why are

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.620 
now you may be asking yourself why are
we<00:01:36.490> looking<00:01:36.759> at<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.969> underside<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
we looking at the underside of the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.950 
we looking at the underside of the
encoder<00:01:38.109> well<00:01:38.439> that's<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.740> good<00:01:38.859> question<00:01:38.920> I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
encoder well that's a good question I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.139 
encoder well that's a good question I
don't<00:01:40.960> know<00:01:41.170> if<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.770> can<00:01:41.950> see<00:01:42.310> here<00:01:42.909> let<00:01:43.119> me

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
don't know if you can see here let me

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.709 
don't know if you can see here let me
get<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.450> little<00:01:44.380> pointer<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:46.390> know<00:01:46.479> if<00:01:46.600> you

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
get a little pointer I don't know if you

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.620 
get a little pointer I don't know if you
can<00:01:46.869> see<00:01:47.109> but<00:01:47.469> if<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.859> are<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.819> website<00:01:49.149> or

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
can see but if you are on the website or

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.660 
can see but if you are on the website or
want<00:01:50.289> to<00:01:50.350> visit<00:01:50.530> our<00:01:50.770> website<00:01:51.280> you'll<00:01:51.460> see<00:01:51.520> a

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
want to visit our website you'll see a

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.690 
want to visit our website you'll see a
close-up<00:01:51.999> photograph<00:01:52.659> on<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.399> bottom<00:01:54.399> side

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
close-up photograph on the bottom side

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.149 
close-up photograph on the bottom side
of<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.389> encoder<00:01:55.929> you're<00:01:56.469> going<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.710> notice

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
of the encoder you're going to notice

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.319 
of the encoder you're going to notice
that<00:01:57.189> it<00:01:57.999> says<00:01:58.479> channel<00:01:59.350> 1<00:01:59.619> here<00:02:00.249> and<00:02:00.399> channel

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
that it says channel 1 here and channel

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.050 
that it says channel 1 here and channel
8<00:02:01.600> here<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:03.009> then<00:02:03.159> we<00:02:03.280> got<00:02:03.429> channel<00:02:03.850> 1<00:02:04.030> channel

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
8 here so then we got channel 1 channel

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.020 
8 here so then we got channel 1 channel
2<00:02:04.509> channel<00:02:04.539> 3<00:02:05.109> and<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:05.709> on<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.280> forth<00:02:06.639> up<00:02:06.999> to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
2 channel 3 and so on and so forth up to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.499 
2 channel 3 and so on and so forth up to
channel<00:02:07.509> 8<00:02:07.749> well<00:02:08.500> when<00:02:08.890> we<00:02:09.039> connect<00:02:09.520> channel<00:02:10.240> 1

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
channel 8 well when we connect channel 1

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.199 
channel 8 well when we connect channel 1
from<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.020> receiver<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:12.160> channel<00:02:12.580> 1<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:13.030> the

saying one another I don't even know if
you<00:02:23.870> could<00:02:24.020> do<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.350> be<00:02:24.470> honest<00:02:24.770> with<00:02:24.800> you

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
you could do it to be honest with you

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.440 
you could do it to be honest with you
but<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:27.590> from<00:02:27.860> channel<00:02:28.310> 1<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.820> channel<00:02:29.030> 1

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
but going from channel 1 to channel 1

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.480 
but going from channel 1 to channel 1
over<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:29.960> that<00:02:30.170> would<00:02:30.860> make<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> heck<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.280> a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
over here that would make a heck of a

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.790 
over here that would make a heck of a
mess<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.300> when<00:02:32.750> we<00:02:32.870> look<00:02:33.020> at<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.260> underside<00:02:33.740> of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
mess so when we look at the underside of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.990 
mess so when we look at the underside of
it<00:02:34.100> we<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:34.460> that<00:02:34.490> channel<00:02:35.030> 1<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:36.370> here<00:02:37.370> channel

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
it we see that channel 1 is here channel

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.210 
it we see that channel 1 is here channel
2<00:02:38.209> channel<00:02:38.240> 3<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:39.650> forth<00:02:40.010> and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
2 channel 3 so on and so forth and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.850 
2 channel 3 so on and so forth and
channel<00:02:40.550> 8<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.970> over<00:02:41.240> here<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.440> receiver

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
channel 8 is over here on the receiver

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.449 
channel 8 is over here on the receiver
we've<00:02:43.220> got<00:02:43.430> channel<00:02:43.850> 1<00:02:44.090> 2<00:02:44.330> 3<00:02:44.510> 4<00:02:44.780> 5<00:02:44.959> 6<00:02:45.170> 7<00:02:45.530> 8<00:02:45.620> going

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
we've got channel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 going

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.110 
we've got channel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 going
this<00:02:46.730> way

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
this way

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.770 
this way
so<00:02:47.420> when<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:48.050> connect<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.770> connectors<00:02:49.780> we

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
so when we connect the connectors we

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.230 
so when we connect the connectors we
have<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.110> go<00:02:51.260> from<00:02:51.590> channel<00:02:51.980> 1<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.459> channel<00:02:52.700> 1

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
have to go from channel 1 to channel 1

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.630 
have to go from channel 1 to channel 1
and<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.630> want<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.900> be<00:02:54.020> in<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> fairly<00:02:55.220> straight

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and you want to be in a fairly straight

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.630 
and you want to be in a fairly straight
line<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.090> that's<00:02:56.840> where<00:02:57.140> we're<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:57.980> think<00:02:58.400> that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
line and that's where we're I think that

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.820 
line and that's where we're I think that
this<00:02:58.820> encoder<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.510> the<00:03:00.170> terminals<00:03:00.650> are

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
this encoder is the terminals are

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.530 
this encoder is the terminals are
actually<00:03:01.280> upside<00:03:01.550> down<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.850> be<00:03:01.880> quite<00:03:02.239> honest

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
actually upside down to be quite honest

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.750 
actually upside down to be quite honest
with<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.720> because<00:03:03.470> our<00:03:03.800> signal<00:03:04.310> wire<00:03:04.489> our

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
with you because our signal wire our

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.360 
with you because our signal wire our
white<00:03:05.000> wire<00:03:05.330> has<00:03:06.020> to<00:03:06.050> be<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> top<00:03:06.920> role<00:03:07.220> of

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
white wire has to be on the top role of

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.760 
white wire has to be on the top role of
the<00:03:07.550> receiver<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.270> then<00:03:08.930> we<00:03:09.080> have<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.410> give<00:03:09.590> it

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
the receiver and then we have to give it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.300 
the receiver and then we have to give it
a<00:03:09.860> twist<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.480> signal<00:03:12.260> wire<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.800> on

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
a twist so that the signal wire is on

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.229 
a twist so that the signal wire is on
the<00:03:13.459> bottom<00:03:13.970> row<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.080> encoder<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.239> that's

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
the bottom row of the encoder and that's

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.500 
the bottom row of the encoder and that's
what<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.780> lot<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.470> people<00:03:18.709> get<00:03:19.550> so<00:03:19.700> gives<00:03:20.239> people

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
what a lot of people get so gives people

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.140 
what a lot of people get so gives people
a<00:03:20.959> lot<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.530> grief<00:03:21.830> when<00:03:22.610> they're<00:03:22.760> trying<00:03:23.030> to

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
a lot of grief when they're trying to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.460 
a lot of grief when they're trying to
connect<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.720> turnigy<00:03:24.230> radio<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.850> encoder

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
connect the turnigy radio to the encoder

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.750 
connect the turnigy radio to the encoder
once<00:03:27.470> we<00:03:27.739> have<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:29.530> step<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:30.860> place<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.640> let

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
once we have that step in place and let

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.259 
once we have that step in place and let
me<00:03:31.880> mention<00:03:32.650> these<00:03:33.650> servo<00:03:34.430> connector<00:03:34.850> wires

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
me mention these servo connector wires

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.210 
me mention these servo connector wires
you're<00:03:35.780> going<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.110> have<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.440> buy<00:03:36.620> their<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.890> 3

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
you're going to have to buy their a 3

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.240 
you're going to have to buy their a 3

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
wire you're going to have to buy them

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.560 
wire you're going to have to buy them
separately<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:41.120> package<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.810> 10<00:03:42.220> because<00:03:43.570> none

separately a package of 10 because none
of<00:03:44.600> these<00:03:44.780> components<00:03:45.410> come<00:03:45.650> with<00:03:46.130> these

of these components come with these

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.449 
of these components come with these
connector<00:03:47.360> wires<00:03:48.790> once<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.420> have<00:03:50.630> the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
connector wires once you have the

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.810 
connector wires once you have the
receiver<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.880> encoder<00:03:53.750> wired<00:03:54.320> together

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
receiver and the encoder wired together

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.250 
receiver and the encoder wired together
then<00:03:55.820> we<00:03:56.120> can<00:03:58.060> connect<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.239> output<00:03:59.450> signal

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
then we can connect the output signal

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.949 
then we can connect the output signal
and<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.799> what<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.880> set<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.540> pins<00:04:02.780> that

and this is what the set of pins that
we'll<00:04:03.260> use

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
this is the set of pins that will go to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.199 
this is the set of pins that will go to

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
the pixhawk flight controller now if you

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.960 
the pixhawk flight controller now if you
look<00:04:11.660> very<00:04:11.930> very<00:04:12.290> carefully<00:04:13.040> on<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:15.019> encoder

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
look very very carefully on the encoder

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.960 
look very very carefully on the encoder
there's<00:04:16.970> one<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.780> says<00:04:18.049> auxilary<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.340> I

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
there's one that says auxilary and I

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.500 
there's one that says auxilary and I
think<00:04:20.479> it<00:04:20.570> says<00:04:20.750> axillary<00:04:21.229> I<00:04:22.270> can't<00:04:23.270> tell

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
think it says axillary I can't tell

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.780 
think it says axillary I can't tell
what's<00:04:23.690> on<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> glasses<00:04:24.110> but<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:25.520> row<00:04:25.760> of

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
what's on the glasses but this row of

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.680 
what's on the glasses but this row of
pins<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.300> says<00:04:26.660> ppm<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:28.390> looking<00:04:29.390> at<00:04:29.539> the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
pins that says ppm so looking at the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.770 
pins that says ppm so looking at the
encoder<00:04:30.140> from<00:04:30.440> this<00:04:30.770> angle

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
encoder from this angle

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.110 
encoder from this angle
this<00:04:32.780> says<00:04:33.080> ppm<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.250> have<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.669> connect

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
this says ppm so you have to connect

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.320 
this says ppm so you have to connect
servo<00:04:35.479> wire<00:04:35.870> your<00:04:36.320> servo<00:04:36.620> wire<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.699> this<00:04:37.970> set

servo wire your servo wire to this set
of<00:04:38.360> pins<00:04:39.400> when<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.550> do<00:04:40.790> that<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.600> also<00:04:41.810> need

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
of pins when you do that you also need

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.090 
of pins when you do that you also need
to<00:04:42.560> keep<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:44.389> white<00:04:45.169> wires<00:04:45.970> in<00:04:47.470> line<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:48.979> the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
to keep the white wires in line so the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.960 
to keep the white wires in line so the
white<00:04:49.310> wire<00:04:49.780> from<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.870> output<00:04:51.500> has<00:04:52.100> to<00:04:52.520> go<00:04:52.669> on

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
white wire from the output has to go on

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.080 
white wire from the output has to go on
the<00:04:53.180> bottom<00:04:53.570> pin<00:04:54.320> when<00:04:55.280> you're<00:04:55.520> looking<00:04:55.910> at

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
the bottom pin when you're looking at

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.840 
the bottom pin when you're looking at
the<00:04:56.240> encoder<00:04:56.660> from<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.110> underside<00:04:57.850> alright

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
the encoder from the underside alright

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:25.490 
the encoder from the underside alright
now<00:04:59.540> let<00:05:00.020> us<00:05:00.050> get<00:05:00.410> our<00:05:00.669> demo<00:05:01.669> frame

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.470 

then<00:05:26.900> you're<00:05:27.900> going<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.230> take<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:29.430> this<00:05:30.180> end

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
then you're going to take the this end

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.960 
then you're going to take the this end
of<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:31.110> circle<00:05:32.100> connector

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.550 
of the circle connector
you're<00:05:33.360> going<00:05:33.480> to<00:05:33.540> take<00:05:33.750> this<00:05:33.960> end<00:05:34.230> of<00:05:34.410> the

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
you're going to take this end of the

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.850 
you're going to take this end of the
servo<00:05:34.920> connector<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:35.700> you're<00:05:36.210> going<00:05:36.450> to

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
servo connector and you're going to

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.840 
servo connector and you're going to
connect<00:05:37.860> it<00:05:38.100> to<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.820> RC<00:05:40.580> terminal<00:05:41.580> on<00:05:41.790> the

not<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.790> signal<00:05:44.790> bus<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.450> RC<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:46.410> when<00:05:47.100> you

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
not the signal bus the RC and when you

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.080 
not the signal bus the RC and when you
do<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:48.110> you<00:05:49.110> also<00:05:49.380> need<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:49.920> make<00:05:50.100> sure<00:05:50.130> that

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
do that you also need to make sure that

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.720 
do that you also need to make sure that
the<00:05:51.270> white<00:05:51.540> wire<00:05:51.930> is<00:05:53.210> on<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.450> bottom<00:05:55.430> roll<00:05:56.430> of

the white wire is on the bottom roll of

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.409 
the white wire is on the bottom roll of
pens<00:05:59.270> now<00:06:00.270> we'll<00:06:00.690> just<00:06:00.870> take<00:06:00.960> this<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.740> we'll

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
pens now we'll just take this and we'll

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:11.800 
pens now we'll just take this and we'll
set<00:06:03.419> it<00:06:04.340> alongside

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810
