00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.790
 good afternoon , we were out 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.189
 introduce you to this boiler 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.740
 which is interesting first of all your 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.540
 scheme 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.839
 implemented for heating such 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.470
 offices both internally hurt and exchanged 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.010
 radiator heating 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.080
 cooking hot water and 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.080
 heat supply heat exchanger pool 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.420
 the main element of our boiler room says 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.559
 investment quality medals 200 s 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.700
 trades addicted control migatronic 200 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.190
 go to the hydraulic elements 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.570
 our scheme to the topic of the taste of the boiler installed 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.590
 heating connection kit 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.250
 contour 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.059
 which includes the main pump 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.219
 operating hydraulic separator 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.620
 this is a variable frequency pump 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.629
 rotation here is installed pump 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.039
 Boiler loading gas tap and 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.559
 safety valve 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.050
 The next element of our play scheme is 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.519
 hydraulic separations are distributed 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.190
 this and the pump to the savior of the node phones 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.979
 pump mixing unit derek he 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.210
 we need for heat supply 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.030
 separate heating circuit in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.369
 In this case, here's the phone job 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.100
 as if it hurt and the update consists of 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.250
 casing of circulation pump with 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.290
 adjustable speed 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.990
 electric mixer on them is 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.850
 mixer itself 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.580
 temperature sensors thermometers 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.080
 the falling lines are the return lines which 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.440
 at the same time are shut-off 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.790
 hot water fittings 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.070
 before sanitary needs 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.580
 we use red years heats up 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.170
 19 table is a field 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.100
 stainless steel see enamel 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.399
 coverage but by experience we can say that 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.850
 service life of 20 years is well maintained 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:03.729
 in the lower part of the body of the bolero we see 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.960
 possibility of installing flange 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.929
 36 electric heaters 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.819
 or 9 kilowatts of top will make you 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.860
 ceiling mounted expansion tank 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.019
 heating systems need to 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.150
 compensate you and yourself stupid 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.549
 changes in the coolant volume in the system 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.709
 new autumn viessmann module 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.680
 remote control of a boiler room or 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.810
 such a table, it even allows the device 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.459
 using mobile devices such as 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.920
 iphone or 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.079
 as well as from any computer to any 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.110
 point of the globe 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:38.360
 monitor your installation 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.160
 interrogate work and control parameters 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.800
 we installed the remote module 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.440
 control and such a trunk on then appreciate 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.620
 you boiler controller 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.810
 have downloaded the application on our mobile 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.850
 device we see that interface 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.010
 boiler controller is our mobile 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.220
 devices are almost identical we 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.080
 we are able to carry out all the same 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.130
 regulating functions as on 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.740
 boiler controller for example ask 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.930
 excellent temperature data about 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.390
 changes to the settings will be transmitted through 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.910
 Internet to server with a data 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.070
 then using modems like that 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.030
 became one information will go on 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.820
 la controller 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.540
 we see the data on the boiler controller 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.590
 temperatures 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.590
 dairy changed
