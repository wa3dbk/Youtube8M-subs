00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
in carbohydrates what that means is your

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.650

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
and then it takes a significant drop and

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.960 
and then it takes a significant drop and
that<00:03:30.900> means<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.530> get<00:03:31.739> hungry<00:03:32.130> again<00:03:32.580> so
