00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
hi zoo I'm Kitty from sushi and I'm

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.690 
hi zoo I'm Kitty from sushi and I'm
going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.590> show<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.740> how<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> draw<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.280> number

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
going to show you how to draw the number

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.749 
going to show you how to draw the number
four<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.870> fist<00:00:13.200> up<00:00:13.380> what<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.519> draw<00:00:14.730> a

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
four so fist up what we do is we draw a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.519 
four so fist up what we do is we draw a
little<00:00:14.940> line<00:00:15.240> across<00:00:15.750> there<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.289> then<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
little line across there and then a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.450 
little line across there and then a
little<00:00:16.740> line<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.240> further<00:00:18.240> down<00:00:18.390> our<00:00:18.539> page

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
little line just further down our page

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.689 
little line just further down our page
we<00:00:20.460> turn<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.090> into<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:22.279> finish<00:00:23.300> rectangle<00:00:25.699> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
we turn it into a finish rectangle and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.490 
we turn it into a finish rectangle and
you<00:00:26.880> want<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> make<00:00:27.240> another<00:00:27.810> rectangle<00:00:28.380> with

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you want to make another rectangle with

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.080 
you want to make another rectangle with
a<00:00:28.529> net<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> side<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> four<00:00:31.820> got<00:00:32.820> that

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
a net for the side of the four got that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
a net for the side of the four got that
thick<00:00:35.149> about<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> third<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> way<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
thick about a third of the way up the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.880 
thick about a third of the way up the
page<00:00:38.000> make<00:00:39.000> another<00:00:42.020> thick<00:00:43.020> rectangle<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
page make another thick rectangle and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
page make another thick rectangle and
just<00:00:44.100> bring<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.000> forms<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> square

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
just bring it out so it forms a square

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.580 
just bring it out so it forms a square
like<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.940> at<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.180> side

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.340 

then<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.280> join<00:00:53.490> that<00:00:53.640> line<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.150> that<00:00:54.210> line<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
then we join that line and that line and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.630 
then we join that line and that line and
then<00:00:55.470> we<00:00:55.560> look<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.740> the<00:00:55.860> thickness<00:00:56.040> again<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
then we look at the thickness again and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.400 
then we look at the thickness again and
work<00:00:56.790> out<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.360> approximately<00:00:57.900> about<00:00:58.110> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
work out it's approximately about the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.700 
work out it's approximately about the
air<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.390> bring<00:01:00.570> another<00:01:00.810> line<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.230> just

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
air and then bring another line up just

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.320 
air and then bring another line up just
to<00:01:01.860> match<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.700> thickness<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.239> way

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
to match the thickness all the way

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.860 
to match the thickness all the way
around<00:01:04.519> we<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.550> kind<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.940> curve<00:01:06.450> off<00:01:06.660> those

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
around we just kind of curve off those

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.900 
around we just kind of curve off those
edges<00:01:07.110> slightly<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:08.130> make<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> look<00:01:08.580> even<00:01:08.729> more

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
edges slightly to make it look even more

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.480 
edges slightly to make it look even more
cartoony<00:01:12.470> let<00:01:13.470> me<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.680> grab<00:01:13.770> our<00:01:14.010> black<00:01:14.220> pins

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
cartoony let me just grab our black pins

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.020 
cartoony let me just grab our black pins
and<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> come<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> pencil<00:01:15.660> line

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:48.370 

you

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.359 

then<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.680> back<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.070> thicken<00:01:50.189> up

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
then we just go back in and thicken up

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.529 
then we just go back in and thicken up
the<00:01:50.520> line<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.729> make<00:01:50.969> it<00:01:51.090> look<00:01:51.210> even<00:01:51.329> more

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
the line to make it look even more

00:01:51.539 --> 00:02:09.400 
the line to make it look even more
cartoony

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:21.690 

you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.680 

then<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.880> wait<00:02:23.030> for<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.300> dry

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.330 

then<00:02:26.260> we<00:02:26.350> just<00:02:26.440> go<00:02:26.560> back<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.040> rub<00:02:27.160> out<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
then we just go back in and rub out the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:43.140 
then we just go back in and rub out the
pencil<00:02:27.550> lines

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.430 

so<00:02:44.150> there<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.330> have<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.810> cartoon<00:02:45.050> number

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
so there you have it a cartoon number

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.790 
so there you have it a cartoon number
for<00:02:45.680> happy<00:02:46.640> drawing
