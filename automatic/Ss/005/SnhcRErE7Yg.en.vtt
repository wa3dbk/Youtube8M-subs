keep things as simple as possible people
like<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> I've<00:00:32.250> got<00:00:32.430> my<00:00:32.640> pewter<00:00:33.300> tuners<00:00:33.570> right

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
like so I've got my pewter tuners right

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:43.340 
like so I've got my pewter tuners right
my<00:00:34.890> ram<00:00:35.100> air<00:00:37.129> it<00:00:38.129> only<00:00:38.309> goes<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:42.350> first

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
my ram air it only goes to the first

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
my ram air it only goes to the first
question<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> diamond<00:00:44.579> star<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.030> there<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
question is on a diamond star is there a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.709 
question is on a diamond star is there a
drain<00:00:45.480> hole

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
drain hole

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.380 
drain hole
nope<00:00:46.649> though<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.090> diamond

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
nope though there is not the diamond

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.139 
nope though there is not the diamond
products<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:48.930> great<00:00:49.200> holes<00:00:50.149> what's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
products don't have great holes what's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.100 
products don't have great holes what's
that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.340 
that
noir<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> katana<00:00:52.860> we're<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> twin<00:00:54.360> star<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
noir on a katana we're on a twin star so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.720 
noir on a katana we're on a twin star so
diamond<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.100> great<00:00:56.340> hold<00:00:56.550> which

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
diamond is not the great hold which

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
diamond is not the great hold which
applies<00:00:57.000> esna<00:00:57.449> though<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.739> your

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
applies esna though in the back of your

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
applies esna though in the back of your
pitot<00:00:59.370> tube<00:00:59.579> there's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> little<00:01:00.120> hole<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
pitot tube there's a little hole in the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.330 
pitot tube there's a little hole in the
back<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.899> where<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.649> water<00:01:01.920> gets<00:01:02.160> shoved

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
back there where the water gets shoved

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.219 
back there where the water gets shoved
in<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.670> thing<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:02.940> basically<00:01:03.300> drains<00:01:04.049> out

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
in that thing and basically drains out

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.149 
in that thing and basically drains out
the<00:01:04.260> bottom<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> shove<00:01:05.040> down<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:07.100> now<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the bottom you shove down so now the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.820 
the bottom you shove down so now the
question<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:08.820> does<00:01:09.750> air<00:01:10.049> actually<00:01:10.560> flow

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
question then does air actually flow

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.210 
question then does air actually flow
through<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.520> line<00:01:12.650> okay<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:14.100> actually

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
through this line okay so what actually

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.429 
through this line okay so what actually
happens<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.299> pressure<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.020> pressure

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
happens it's a pressure it's pressure

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.830 
happens it's a pressure it's pressure
I<00:01:16.560> basically<00:01:16.830> compress<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> line<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.299> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
I basically compress the line there so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.440 
I basically compress the line there so
water<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.680> can't<00:01:20.100> get<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.580> far<00:01:20.939> into<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
water really can't get that far into the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.980 
water really can't get that far into the
line<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.439> diamond<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> said<00:01:23.720> indict<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
line so diamond kind of said indict the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.630 
line so diamond kind of said indict the
way<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> diamonds<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.680> designed<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.369> goes

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
way the diamonds are designed it goes

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
way the diamonds are designed it goes
straight<00:01:26.850> into<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.509> mass<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
straight into that mass and then it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.140 
straight into that mass and then it
basically<00:01:28.380> goes<00:01:28.710> straight<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:30.000> there's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
basically goes straight up so there's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.850 
basically goes straight up so there's
really<00:01:30.329> not<00:01:30.600> much<00:01:30.840> opportunity<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.409> moisture

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
really not much opportunity for moisture

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130 
really not much opportunity for moisture
to<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:32.400> there<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.939> filters<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to get in there there are filters in the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.109 
to get in there there are filters in the
line<00:01:34.320> under<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> seats<00:01:35.130> they<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.850> never

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
line under the seats they have never

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.960 
line under the seats they have never
found<00:01:36.360> water<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.869> those<00:01:36.990> filters<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> diamond

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
found water in those filters so diamond

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.190 
found water in those filters so diamond
just<00:01:39.329> didn't<00:01:39.570> see

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
just didn't see

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.740 
just didn't see
point<00:01:40.860> even<00:01:41.130> doing<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.399> drain<00:01:41.610> points<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
point even doing the drain points so the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.230 
point even doing the drain points so the
question<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.399> pedo<00:01:44.789> mask<00:01:47.000> I've<00:01:48.000> got

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
question then on my pedo mask I've got

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.020 
question then on my pedo mask I've got
one<00:01:48.570> hole<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.460> we've<00:01:50.460> got<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> little<00:01:50.850> one

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
one hole up here we've got a little one

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.429 
one hole up here we've got a little one
here<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.929> little<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
here on the back and a little one on the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.469 
here on the back and a little one on the
bottom<00:01:53.270> these<00:01:54.270> two<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.929> what<00:01:56.329> they're<00:01:57.329> both

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
bottom these two are what they're both

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.779 
bottom these two are what they're both
static<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.229> don't<00:01:58.679> have<00:01:58.979> an<00:01:59.069> explanation<00:01:59.369> for

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
static I don't have an explanation for

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:27.710 
static I don't have an explanation for
why<00:02:02.179> I<00:02:24.530> did<00:02:25.530> not<00:02:25.650> know<00:02:25.829> that<00:02:25.860> yes<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:27.420> basically

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
why I did not know that yes so basically

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.330 
why I did not know that yes so basically
if<00:02:28.530> we're<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.799> do<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
if we're to do it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.410 
if we're to do it
we<00:02:29.519> have<00:02:29.610> huge<00:02:29.880> questions<00:02:30.360> about<00:02:30.599> this<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.220> so

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
we have huge questions about this and so

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.960 
we have huge questions about this and so
the<00:02:33.420> mechanics<00:02:33.900> actually<00:02:34.470> took<00:02:34.620> one<00:02:34.829> apart

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the mechanics actually took one apart

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.500 
the mechanics actually took one apart
and<00:02:36.980> looked<00:02:37.980> into<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.430> actually<00:02:38.849> blew<00:02:39.209> air

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
and looked into it actually blew air

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.819 
and looked into it actually blew air
down<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.930> sure<00:02:40.110> enough<00:02:40.140> they<00:02:40.620> were<00:02:40.680> all

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
down and sure enough they were all

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.030 
down and sure enough they were all
connected<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.310> basically<00:02:45.060> these<00:02:45.299> two<00:02:46.040> didn't

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
connected so basically these two didn't

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.479 
connected so basically these two didn't
help<00:02:47.220> these<00:02:47.880> two<00:02:48.049> are<00:02:49.049> your<00:02:49.170> static<00:02:49.590> line<00:02:49.829> and

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
help these two are your static line and

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.449 
help these two are your static line and
then<00:02:50.609> you<00:02:50.670> just<00:02:50.910> have<00:02:51.000> one<00:02:53.180> okay<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.340> got

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
then you just have one okay then we got

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.379 
then you just have one okay then we got
my<00:02:56.549> static<00:02:56.970> line<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:58.970> always<00:02:59.970> draw<00:03:00.209> them

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
my static line I always draw them

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.599 
my static line I always draw them
separately<00:03:00.930> yes<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.680> drawn<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.430> and

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
separately yes it's drawn like this and

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.129 
separately yes it's drawn like this and
of<00:03:02.670> diamond<00:03:03.000> stars<00:03:03.239> we<00:03:03.420> want<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.720> understand

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
of diamond stars we want to understand

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.170 
of diamond stars we want to understand
that<00:03:04.350> but<00:03:04.950> you're<00:03:05.130> all<00:03:05.220> separately<00:03:05.760> because

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
that but you're all separately because

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.720 
that but you're all separately because
it<00:03:06.389> keeps<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:07.130> separate<00:03:08.130> especially<00:03:08.609> in<00:03:08.700> a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
it keeps it separate especially in a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.099 
it keeps it separate especially in a
student's<00:03:09.150> mind<00:03:09.299> when<00:03:09.540> you're<00:03:09.660> teaching<00:03:09.840> them

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
student's mind when you're teaching them

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.220 
student's mind when you're teaching them
keeps<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.980> two<00:03:11.190> tubes<00:03:11.940> or<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.329> two<00:03:12.569> sources

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
keeps the two tubes or the two sources

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.349 
keeps the two tubes or the two sources
of<00:03:13.350> air<00:03:13.560> separate<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.880> then<00:03:15.090> I've<00:03:15.209> got<00:03:15.329> my

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
of air separate so then I've got my

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.039 
of air separate so then I've got my
static<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.079> then<00:03:16.290> goes<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.690> all<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.900> my

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
static that then goes to all of my

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.460 
static that then goes to all of my
instruments<00:03:19.730> okay<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:21.000> want<00:03:21.690> additional<00:03:22.139> item

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
instruments okay I want additional item

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.220 
instruments okay I want additional item
what's<00:03:23.310> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.030 

I'll<00:03:28.709> turn<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.069> static<00:03:31.400> okay<00:03:34.940> all<00:03:35.940> right

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
I'll turn it static okay all right

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.890 
I'll turn it static okay all right
so<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.400> afar<00:03:38.880> obviously<00:03:39.390> we're<00:03:39.569> concerned

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
so in afar obviously we're concerned

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.720 
so in afar obviously we're concerned
about<00:03:40.020> getting<00:03:40.349> clogs<00:03:40.770> but<00:03:41.310> normal<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.610> going

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
about getting clogs but normal is going

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.449 
about getting clogs but normal is going
to<00:03:41.849> cause<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> clog<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:43.140> see<00:03:43.680> there's<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
to cause the clog I see there's a

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.580 
to cause the clog I see there's a
question<00:03:44.489> our<00:03:45.060> mighty<00:03:45.300> diamond<00:03:45.720> star<00:03:45.959> if<00:03:46.440> I

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
question our mighty diamond star if I

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.710 
question our mighty diamond star if I
have<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:47.069> turn<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.430> my<00:03:47.610> pitot<00:03:48.000> heat<00:03:48.030> what<00:03:48.540> else

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
have to turn on my pitot heat what else

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.070 
have to turn on my pitot heat what else
should<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:48.989> probably<00:03:49.319> be<00:03:49.410> doing<00:03:51.080> leaving

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
should I probably be doing leaving

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.020 
should I probably be doing leaving
because<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.160> mean<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:53.489> wings<00:03:53.700> are<00:03:53.819> getting

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
because I mean your wings are getting

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.479 
because I mean your wings are getting
ice<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.670> there<00:03:56.940> for<00:03:57.180> emergency<00:03:57.780> but

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
ice so it's on there for emergency but

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.890 
ice so it's on there for emergency but
really<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.819> pitot<00:04:00.060> heat<00:04:00.150> should<00:04:00.630> probably

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
really that pitot heat should probably

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.470 
really that pitot heat should probably
never<00:04:01.350> need<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.739> be<00:04:01.950> used<00:04:02.190> by<00:04:02.400> us<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:03.420> we

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
never need to be used by us and we

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.750 
never need to be used by us and we
should<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:03.959> be<00:04:04.170> in<00:04:04.290> there<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:05.310> why<00:04:05.550> would<00:04:05.730> you

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
should not be in there so why would you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:24.110 
should not be in there so why would you
want<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.060> go<00:04:06.120> in<00:04:06.209> icy<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.720> diamond<00:04:07.049> star<00:04:23.120> aid

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
want to go in icy and a diamond star aid

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.940 
want to go in icy and a diamond star aid
how<00:04:24.570> powerful<00:04:24.930> my<00:04:25.080> engine<00:04:26.690> yes<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:28.590> get<00:04:28.770> into

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
how powerful my engine yes you get into

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.010 
how powerful my engine yes you get into
ice<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:30.030> think<00:04:30.240> pretty<00:04:30.360> much<00:04:30.450> falls<00:04:30.780> out<00:04:30.990> of

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
ice and I think pretty much falls out of

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.370 
ice and I think pretty much falls out of
the<00:04:31.139> sky

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
the sky

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.469

happens in I clogged my ram air because
of<00:05:14.970> ice<00:05:15.120> probably<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:15.630> first<00:05:15.780> one's<00:05:15.990> gonna<00:05:16.080> be

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
of ice probably the first one's gonna be

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.610 
of ice probably the first one's gonna be
infected<00:05:16.530> biotics<00:05:16.830> what<00:05:17.100> happens

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.310 

I'm<00:05:21.620> going<00:05:21.860> $90<00:05:23.620> tops<00:05:24.620> in<00:05:24.740> later<00:05:24.919> speed<00:05:26.320> all

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
I'm going $90 tops in later speed all

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.770 
I'm going $90 tops in later speed all
right<00:05:27.500> it'll<00:05:27.710> sprees<00:05:28.100> at<00:05:28.250> 90<00:05:28.639> and<00:05:28.850> then<00:05:29.660> it

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
right it'll sprees at 90 and then it

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.070 
right it'll sprees at 90 and then it
will<00:05:29.930> begin<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.440> act<00:05:31.330> as<00:05:32.330> an<00:05:32.810> altimeter

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
will begin to act as an altimeter

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.780 
will begin to act as an altimeter
meaning<00:05:33.830> it's<00:05:33.979> gonna<00:05:34.070> go<00:05:34.250> up<00:05:34.280> when<00:05:34.550> I<00:05:34.639> go<00:05:34.760> up

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
meaning it's gonna go up when I go up

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.200 
meaning it's gonna go up when I go up
and<00:05:35.090> down<00:05:35.150> when<00:05:35.449> I<00:05:35.510> go<00:05:35.660> down<00:05:36.130> okay<00:05:37.130> as<00:05:37.940> soon<00:05:38.060> as

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
and down when I go down okay as soon as

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.570 
and down when I go down okay as soon as
I<00:05:38.270> freeze<00:05:38.600> that<00:05:38.780> air<00:05:38.990> in<00:05:39.199> there<00:05:39.880> I'm<00:05:40.880> done<00:05:41.090> okay

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
I freeze that air in there I'm done okay

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.180 
I freeze that air in there I'm done okay
what<00:05:43.580> if<00:05:43.669> I<00:05:43.729> had<00:05:43.850> a<00:05:43.880> drain<00:05:44.120> hole<00:05:45.070> what<00:05:46.070> would

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
what if I had a drain hole what would

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.969 
what if I had a drain hole what would
happen<00:05:49.210> if<00:05:50.210> we<00:05:50.330> go<00:05:50.449> to<00:05:50.510> zero<00:05:50.900> so<00:05:51.770> it's

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
happen if we go to zero so it's

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.439 
happen if we go to zero so it's
important<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.490> point<00:05:52.669> that<00:05:52.850> out<00:05:52.910> even<00:05:53.270> though

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
important to point that out even though

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.879 
important to point that out even though
we're<00:05:53.630> training<00:05:53.870> in<00:05:54.020> a<00:05:54.080> diamond<00:05:54.289> star<00:05:54.650> you're

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
we're training in a diamond star you're

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.379 
we're training in a diamond star you're
giving<00:05:55.160> them<00:05:55.250> an<00:05:55.370> instrument<00:05:55.820> rating<00:05:56.180> okay

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
giving them an instrument rating okay

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.420 
giving them an instrument rating okay
not<00:05:56.750> a<00:05:56.780> diamond<00:05:57.050> star<00:05:57.320> rating<00:05:57.590> so<00:05:58.070> pointing

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
not a diamond star rating so pointing

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.770 
not a diamond star rating so pointing
out<00:05:58.550> to<00:05:58.699> them<00:05:58.850> that<00:05:59.090> you<00:05:59.240> may<00:05:59.389> see<00:05:59.449> your

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
out to them that you may see your

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.500 
out to them that you may see your
airspeed<00:06:00.110> drop<00:06:00.350> to<00:06:00.500> zero<00:06:00.770> or<00:06:01.370> you<00:06:02.060> may<00:06:02.210> see<00:06:02.270> it

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
airspeed drop to zero or you may see it

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.219 
airspeed drop to zero or you may see it
freeze<00:06:02.870> one<00:06:03.620> or<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:03.830> other<00:06:04.090> so<00:06:05.090> and<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:06.080> all

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
freeze one or the other so and it all

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.250 
freeze one or the other so and it all
depends<00:06:06.620> too<00:06:06.949> because<00:06:07.850> if<00:06:08.210> I've<00:06:08.389> got<00:06:08.660> if<00:06:09.080> I'm

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
depends too because if I've got if I'm

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.840 
depends too because if I've got if I'm
flying<00:06:09.500> in<00:06:09.740> freezing<00:06:10.220> rain

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
flying in freezing rain

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.640 
flying in freezing rain
where<00:06:11.600> does<00:06:11.750> freezing<00:06:12.080> rain<00:06:12.289> freeze<00:06:14.020> on<00:06:15.020> this

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
where does freezing rain freeze on this

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.770 
where does freezing rain freeze on this
piece<00:06:15.860> of<00:06:16.010> thing<00:06:16.160> so<00:06:17.150> freezing<00:06:17.389> rain<00:06:17.660> will

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
piece of thing so freezing rain will

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.090 
piece of thing so freezing rain will
actually<00:06:18.080> hit<00:06:18.229> like<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.530> pitot<00:06:18.770> tube<00:06:18.979> or

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
actually hit like the pitot tube or

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.230 
actually hit like the pitot tube or
something<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:19.580> it'll<00:06:19.760> actually<00:06:19.910> start

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
something and it'll actually start

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.540 
something and it'll actually start
freezing<00:06:20.570> in<00:06:20.960> the<00:06:21.080> back<00:06:21.260> row<00:06:21.590> and<00:06:21.860> move<00:06:22.400> its

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
freezing in the back row and move its

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.700 
freezing in the back row and move its
weight<00:06:22.729> forward<00:06:23.210> so<00:06:24.050> it<00:06:24.200> does<00:06:24.349> that<00:06:24.470> on<00:06:24.560> your

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
weight forward so it does that on your

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.260 
weight forward so it does that on your
windscreen<00:06:25.010> it'll<00:06:25.520> start<00:06:25.729> freezing<00:06:25.970> at<00:06:26.180> the

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
windscreen it'll start freezing at the

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.450 
windscreen it'll start freezing at the
top<00:06:26.479> and<00:06:26.750> then<00:06:26.840> it<00:06:26.900> starts<00:06:27.139> coming<00:06:27.440> down<00:06:27.470> so

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
top and then it starts coming down so

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.219 
top and then it starts coming down so
that<00:06:28.610> is<00:06:28.789> a<00:06:28.820> situation<00:06:29.539> that<00:06:29.570> you<00:06:29.780> could<00:06:30.020> have

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
that is a situation that you could have

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.219 
that is a situation that you could have
the<00:06:30.760> drain<00:06:31.760> hole<00:06:31.940> block<00:06:32.210> first<00:06:32.570> if<00:06:32.930> you<00:06:33.050> had<00:06:33.200> a

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
the drain hole block first if you had a

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:33.909 
the drain hole block first if you had a
drink

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
drink

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:40.029 
drink
so<00:06:34.460> it<00:06:34.729> is<00:06:34.820> possible<00:06:35.110> okay<00:06:36.610> from<00:06:37.610> there<00:06:39.039> this

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
so it is possible okay from there this

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.770 
so it is possible okay from there this
is<00:06:40.190> where<00:06:40.310> we<00:06:40.460> can<00:06:40.520> actually<00:06:40.880> draw<00:06:41.090> out<00:06:41.120> what

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
is where we can actually draw out what

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.870 
is where we can actually draw out what
our<00:06:41.810> what<00:06:42.800> our<00:06:42.860> instruments<00:06:43.370> I<00:06:43.430> guess<00:06:43.610> look

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
our what our instruments I guess look

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:57.210 
our what our instruments I guess look
like<00:06:44.090> if<00:06:44.389> we<00:06:44.510> were<00:06:44.660> to<00:06:44.750> draw<00:06:44.930> them<00:06:45.139> out

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.900 

so<00:06:57.760> go<00:06:57.910> make<00:06:58.090> three<00:06:58.360> instruments<00:06:59.910> we

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
so go make three instruments we

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.900 
so go make three instruments we
understand<00:07:01.420> how<00:07:01.660> they<00:07:01.810> all<00:07:01.960> work<00:07:01.990> a<00:07:02.910> lot

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
understand how they all work a lot

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.560 
understand how they all work a lot
easier<00:07:04.270> so<00:07:04.480> an<00:07:04.570> airspeed<00:07:04.930> indicator

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
easier so an airspeed indicator

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.990 
easier so an airspeed indicator
basically<00:07:07.570> has<00:07:07.780> a<00:07:11.370> diagram<00:07:12.370> that's<00:07:12.430> filled<00:07:12.880> up

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
basically has a diagram that's filled up

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.610 
basically has a diagram that's filled up
with<00:07:13.120> air<00:07:13.300> from<00:07:13.510> where<00:07:15.300> okay<00:07:16.300> you<00:07:16.780> know<00:07:16.900> the

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
with air from where okay you know the

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.850 
with air from where okay you know the
rest<00:07:17.830> of<00:07:17.980> the<00:07:18.040> chamber<00:07:18.490> is<00:07:18.640> full<00:07:18.850> of<00:07:19.860> static

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
rest of the chamber is full of static

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.580 
rest of the chamber is full of static
air<00:07:22.530> okay<00:07:23.970> so<00:07:24.970> if<00:07:25.750> I<00:07:25.900> effectively<00:07:26.470> have

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
air okay so if I effectively have

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.460 
air okay so if I effectively have
blocked<00:07:26.860> this<00:07:27.100> off<00:07:27.870> I've<00:07:28.870> sealed<00:07:29.230> this

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
blocked this off I've sealed this

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.960 
blocked this off I've sealed this
chamber<00:07:29.920> off<00:07:30.070> or<00:07:31.060> have<00:07:31.330> I<00:07:31.420> turned<00:07:31.480> it<00:07:31.780> into<00:07:32.970> an

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970 
chamber off or have I turned it into an

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.240 
chamber off or have I turned it into an
altimeter<00:07:34.300> an<00:07:35.020> altimeter<00:07:35.350> is<00:07:35.620> nothing<00:07:36.070> more

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250 
altimeter an altimeter is nothing more

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.450 
altimeter an altimeter is nothing more
than<00:07:36.580> a<00:07:36.930> pre<00:07:37.930> sealed<00:07:38.260> wafer<00:07:38.770> at<00:07:38.860> the<00:07:38.980> factory

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.460 
than a pre sealed wafer at the factory

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.390 
than a pre sealed wafer at the factory
and<00:07:40.300> all<00:07:40.480> I've<00:07:40.660> got<00:07:40.840> is<00:07:41.050> static<00:07:41.500> air<00:07:41.740> that

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 
and all I've got is static air that

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.950 
and all I've got is static air that
comes<00:07:42.580> in<00:07:42.880> and<00:07:43.030> out<00:07:43.090> of<00:07:43.300> it

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.330 

so<00:07:46.960> I<00:07:46.990> effectively<00:07:47.650> turned<00:07:47.950> it<00:07:48.070> into<00:07:48.190> an

so I effectively turned it into an
altimeter<00:07:48.630> okay<00:07:50.160> will<00:07:51.160> it<00:07:51.400> clog<00:07:51.670> around<00:07:52.000> there

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.180 
altimeter okay will it clog around there

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.320 
altimeter okay will it clog around there
affect<00:07:52.510> any<00:07:52.720> other<00:07:52.840> instruments
