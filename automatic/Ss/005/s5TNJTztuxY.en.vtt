00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.520
 Hello dear friends with you I am a crane 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.580
 and today we have another issue of headings 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.240
 Kranty and this time we have such a cheerful 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.460
 Tanchik as pc 2g im who he does not know 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.520
 German from buildings comes 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.410
 rather rare machine which 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.420
 several popular water makers already 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.980
 did a review and let's probably 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.830
 look at all the same as this machine 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.460
 bends she has her cons and hers 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.250
 pluses minuses it is of course his weapon 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.000
 machine gun gold only 46 penetration 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.059
 23, you understand that 23 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.809
 this level is not enough at all and 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.479
 level we have 3 and it turns out that you have 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.820
 machine gun it means still what friends who 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.140
 not aware machine gunner and in our game not 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.720
 shoot on about 350 meters plus 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.050
 armor penetration distance is lost and there 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.610
 at the entrance will already be I do not know 10 penetration 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.400
 Naturally in this but only Helketa 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.340
 Do you have to punch philippines but 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.990
 in addition to this minus nummies speed 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.530
 we have such a mediocre well speed-then 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.119
 okay god with him but we have 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.630
 amazing armor and at this level but 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.350
 no one breaks us out we fall into 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.729
 top art is naturally only 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.799
 the so -called gunners who 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.930
 amid fugasick shoot those can you 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.380
 do some damage 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.780
 but plus another cat litter that okay 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 here is all here are ordinary tanks like us 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.460
 see which is the overwhelming majority 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.520
 in these battles they would not have towers 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.329
 pierce yes and not everyone will even catch gold 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.880
 breaking through to your armor but that's all 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.950
 Of course joyful but the tank did not get it 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.049
 preferential level he falls into such 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.540
 anal and random where he is punished 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.340
 but sometimes, like in this case, you 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.239
 get a really good level 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.370
 battles where the tanks are not so evil and you can 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.950
 have lots of fun and let's have 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.140
 let's see how events will take place 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.840
 in this battle we see that someone is trying 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.730
 trying to target us reload 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.690
 the drum is 2 seconds there huge 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.540
 quantity 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.030
 damage we have 11 basically everything 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.330
 normally these guns exist but 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.120
 They are faster at all sorts where 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.950
 you can always catch something 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.600
 highlight someone to call in the rear and there 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.450
 already shoot and you will have more 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.870
 chances to break through and right there we have some 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.600
 minnie mouse that rides enough 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.450
 slowly and call someone in the rear not so 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.800
 already and just while I was chatting here account 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.530
 moaned 314 and watch the moment of truth 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.410
 friends all enemies practically live only 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.440
 2 enemies were killed and our hero remains 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.780
 against the whole team he didn't even have time 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.870
 move out of the base because speed 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.030
 as I say it does not allow yes to the enemy 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.520
 there is still Fri-shka and art which 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.220
 we can easily sell us 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.280
 punch and but the art has a minus on the data 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.900
 lavlok this is a small firing radius and 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.940
 which probably is not enough for well 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.860
 at least from grooves to base hardly art 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.410
 shoot in and there must already move 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.020
 and hope that the enemy's art is not 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.870
 I started to go because well by the way 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.550
 glows su-76 which pierce this 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.620
 whose head 112 is more than enough 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.530
 you need to quickly focus it and 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.700
 send him to the hangar for one dangerous 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.100
 the enemy has already flown into the hangar 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.739
 as many as eight four frags are already in 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.170
 uchiha stopping check arrives but I'm here 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.269
 that was our hero I quickly react 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.430
 and just we are trying trying somehow 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.489
 selling come to life here you see that a lot 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.310
 there is no penetration to them even in the side and 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.980
 Gold because angle duo 46 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.320
 breaking yes write without Golda did well 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.420
 friends without gold bebashkami unfortunately 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.239
 on this tank you will suffer because 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.160
 that you do not drink even in one half 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.680
 tanks even ass will not punch it 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.870
 very sad here and so gold 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.350
 addicted to understand something 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.110
 write us i bend over on bebashkah but 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.570
 believe me 23 pierce these bullets if 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.450
 you get caught this tank and fasting 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.880
 already booking for those if you will be in 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.620
 anala random but see that another 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.200
 the enemy comes and just flies away 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.950
 instantly the rate of fire is just 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.570
 wildly 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.670
 accuracy is also quite good 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.550
 given the more close range 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.590
 given tank all drive up and just 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.810
 flies into the hangar counted yes not even 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.070
 second fractions of a second pass and they already 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.930
 die we see our german warrior 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.910
 takes off and see that even 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.970
 skorkin 32 assemblies more or less 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.640
 rushing but somewhere else three enemies and plus 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.630
 still artillery 4 enemy half time 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.670
 we still have 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:15.040
 but minus sand 1 and the biggest 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.370
 slow tanks especially when I drove 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.200
 on pc mine not on pc mini 8 level a 3 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.480
 peteshechka there is such she also called 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:28.030
 fcm 36 pak 40 peteshechka amazing 400 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.400
 meters review at the third level is just 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.920
 inspired to bend but on this map 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.870
 I remember there was such a plum sad I here 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.980
 about the same situation 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.920
 like our hero 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.230
 I took these bushes all 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.910
 dismantled the team and it remains only 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.710
 one opponent 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.720
 I already knew that he would probably go 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.210
 on capture he drove around with his pants 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.930
 drove to capture and I'm friends with this one 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.700
 square did not have time to reach in 100 seconds 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.370
 to sleep well, because there is the speed 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.470
 like 18 or even less kilometers 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.080
 mined shichko no I after it 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.270
 sold here is such a sad story 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.620
 that is, there is such a minus 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.810
 similar tanks precisely because they are not 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.910
 have time to shoot down somewhere far 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.800
 drive off here we leave art we its 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.110
 getting somewhere far away just 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.420
 absolutely not welcome therefore 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.940
 our hero and was afraid was afraid to move away nor 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.360
 the more was alive art bullshit write that 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.990
 two remaining of them and kashin and but worth 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.400
 whether they believe or not incomprehensible well 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.830
 we call we try somehow enlighten yes 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.830
 really see what the LTP of and every 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.830
 but I think even if he was alive with him 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.980
 breakthrough 84 head which even gold 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.210
 would not be enough to break through our hero and he 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.840
 will we even managed 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.900
 if ltp was not of and to but i remains 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.810
 somewhere else one not glowing opponent 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.860
 who has a frag he has one 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.229
 Frag and this means that most likely 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.870
 after all not of kage well well let's 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.580
 rewind a bit and speed up because 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:05.210
 Enemies write it foresail whether they should 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.520
 believe or not incomprehensibly we stop by and 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.490
 see something really t-46 in her 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.259
 250 x b she never glowed with 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.680
 frag but stands somewhere near the base and 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:17.870
 just does not move well, apparently the guy 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.270
 our hero went to eat pickers 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.849
 it gets but again to 75 breakthrough 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.919
 Kaltay he also grabbed our 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:27.529
 hero somehow punish well such here 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:30.080
 I think enough unpretentious enough 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:32.150
 epic rare tank just against the whole 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.159
 teams stayed and dragged gave shelter 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.020
 will say the heads of each still was well 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:38.060
 friends in the first place and give him a drink 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.639
 did nothing and secondly it even 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.800
 more risky to believe enemies go 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.449
 over here and payra play capture 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.159
 I hope you like friends, thank you 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.840
 what was watching with you was I screen 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:51.849
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.849
 Good luck in the randomness and see you soon
