00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.020
 good start with this tutorial 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.020
 what are we going 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.340
 what we are going to do is download the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.520
 today I will not know 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.990
 and they will go where you downloaded 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 to a cat that wanted to tell him 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.020
 on my page will be an image of 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.760
 is the and contains is a notebook 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.280
 where will be the 7 link to download 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.409
 the 2006 pet 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:45.640
 I did it like that because it's better to download 7 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.220
 link of 189 megabytes that download a 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.570
 only a single file will be delayed 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.580
 more so I had better shape 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.460
 they know they have downloaded files 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.140
 I dont know 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.140
 they will select the seven files 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.500
 and they will be here when they have 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.750
 done this will appear a new 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.450
 rar file called p6 and they will do the same 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.390
 and when they have done that they 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.420
 a folder called ps appears to 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.870
 so to install it let's go where it says 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.690

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.940
 there is no third ice 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.340
 in that code and we take a serial I 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.580
