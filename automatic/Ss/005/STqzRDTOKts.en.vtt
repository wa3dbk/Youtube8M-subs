 wealthy who had a vast

 fortune inherited from his parents and his

 deceased husband his children did not have 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.590
 needs and they devoted themselves to the study 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.229
 but the only one who exercised his career was 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.380
 elisa who worked as a stenographer in 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.049

 his house on the other hand his brothers 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.729
 They followed a very different course me 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.369
 the women and the 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.310
 excesses their accommodated position them 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.110
 allowed to live in this way without the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.050
 need to work 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.470
 this was one of the main reasons 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.730
 that angered her sister with the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.240
 Going through the years 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.700
 catalina de galceran died his children 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.760
 With great pity they dismissed her and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.270
 they closed their room keeping it such 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.730
 which was not touching anything 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.650
 the brothers continued to live all 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.269
 together 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.099
 the males did not want the 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.340
 responsibility to take charge of a 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.310
 own house and that's why they delegated him all 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.730
 the responsibility of nice what does not 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.930
 did no fun here is where the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.599
 dark story begins 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.359
 shortly after the death of 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.460
 his mother one of the brothers dies of 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:40.370
 surprising way 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.490
 of all of them the only one that did not show 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.040
 sadness was smooth who took care of 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.760
 also close the room of your 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.550
 brother months later a new fact 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.790
 whips the family another of his brothers 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.820
 in complete drunken state while 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.319
 I was passing by the river with a friend suffering a 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.430
 stumble and falls into the water where he drowns 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.459
 the same scene had been repeated 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.219
 greetings of condolences and elisa closing 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.409
 forever the door of his room 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.719
 brother the next year 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.930
 the third of his brothers dies in a 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.879
 car accident in the house no 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.959
 the loss of another being was borne 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.150
 Dear 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.280
 and meanwhile elisa was still 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.640
 closing rooms 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.250
 time later the debauchery continued 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.250
 with the presence of his twelve brothers and 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.040
 elisa already felt hatred and resentment for the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.280
 way of life that those had without 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.670
 But nobody wanted to leave the house and 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.630
 they were forced to live together in 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.150
 an opportunity 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.459
 elisa was relieved by the 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.280
 death of his brothers by the style of 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.520
 life that they carried with total horror 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.150
 gal will be left unlinked yet 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.360
 more of her 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.810
 one night one of his brothers came out of 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.510
 revelry and in a bar called hansen in 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.269
 total drunk had a fight 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.599
 and was pierced by a knife what 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.639
 he caused death and the only brother 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.160
 male that was alive had a 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.859
 adventure with one of the maids elisa 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.100
 I was aware of that and this woke up 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.169
 even more or it was a morning that you enter 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.410
 to the police station to denounce the death 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.960
 of both died asphyxiated by a 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.970
 malfunctioning heating 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.789
 elisa threw all the employees 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.570
 domestic workers and finally closed the 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:44.840
 last of the rooms for 40 years 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.630
 his routine was to go to work 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 church and then secluded in the house of 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.599
 the palm tree where nobody else entered 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.740
 one day he began to miss the Masses of 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.020
 the parish 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.479
 the parish priest decided to enter the house 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.720
 together with the police and they found a 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.030
 creepy picture the whole house was 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.000
 abandoned the lights did not work 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.669
 there was an unbearable pestilence rats 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.520
 dead earth and dust everywhere 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.580
 the only place that emitted light in the 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.919
 basement where the isa was found dead 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.650
 that he had transported all his 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.770
 room to that site and there was where 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.590

 taking revenge against men 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.100
 who enter the house
