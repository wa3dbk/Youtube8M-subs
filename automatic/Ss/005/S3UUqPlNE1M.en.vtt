fifties easy go as you can see here it
has<00:00:05.649> the<00:00:06.330> solid<00:00:07.330> state<00:00:07.569> speed<00:00:08.140> controls<00:00:09.179> I've

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:10.179 
has the solid state speed controls I've

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.539 
has the solid state speed controls I've
one<00:00:10.990> last<00:00:11.259> video<00:00:11.440> I<00:00:11.620> reconnected<00:00:12.370> this

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
one last video I reconnected this

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.999 
one last video I reconnected this
dangler<00:00:12.910> here<00:00:13.209> and<00:00:13.530> when<00:00:14.530> I<00:00:14.589> stepped<00:00:14.830> on<00:00:14.919> the

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
dangler here and when I stepped on the

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.040 
dangler here and when I stepped on the
gas<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:16.150> got<00:00:16.299> nothing

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
gas we got nothing

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.380 
gas we got nothing
basically<00:00:17.560> just<00:00:17.680> you<00:00:18.430> could<00:00:18.609> hear<00:00:19.269> the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
basically just you could hear the

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.359 
basically just you could hear the
solenoids<00:00:19.900> clicking<00:00:20.289> but<00:00:20.890> there<00:00:21.039> was<00:00:21.189> no

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
solenoids clicking but there was no

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.599 
solenoids clicking but there was no
Drive<00:00:22.289> I've<00:00:23.289> got<00:00:23.470> it<00:00:23.590> all<00:00:23.679> jacked<00:00:24.010> up<00:00:24.130> here<00:00:24.400> so

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
Drive I've got it all jacked up here so

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.169 
Drive I've got it all jacked up here so
when<00:00:25.150> it<00:00:25.240> is<00:00:25.390> moving<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:27.310> won't<00:00:27.730> be<00:00:27.789> taking<00:00:28.060> off

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
when it is moving we won't be taking off

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.470 
when it is moving we won't be taking off
on<00:00:28.420> me<00:00:28.570> I<00:00:29.500> traced<00:00:30.039> it<00:00:30.160> down<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:30.730> well<00:00:31.089> Luke

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
on me I traced it down and well Luke

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.670 
on me I traced it down and well Luke
tuck<00:00:31.630> was<00:00:31.779> happening<00:00:32.140> only<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.439> speed

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
tuck was happening only the speed

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.520 
tuck was happening only the speed
controls<00:00:33.070> were<00:00:33.280> going<00:00:33.550> off<00:00:33.730> not<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.410> not<00:00:35.410> the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
controls were going off not the not the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.850 
controls were going off not the not the
one<00:00:35.649> for<00:00:35.890> Ford<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:36.460> not<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.760> one<00:00:36.879> for<00:00:37.090> Reverse

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
one for Ford and not the one for Reverse

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.110 
one for Ford and not the one for Reverse
they<00:00:38.860> weren't<00:00:39.070> making<00:00:39.190> contact<00:00:39.730> so<00:00:39.879> there<00:00:40.030> was

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
they weren't making contact so there was

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.520 
they weren't making contact so there was
no<00:00:40.270> juice<00:00:40.539> for<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:40.840> speed<00:00:41.020> controls<00:00:41.379> to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
no juice for the speed controls to

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.930 
no juice for the speed controls to
control<00:00:41.649> I<00:00:42.390> traced<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:43.510> back<00:00:43.570> down<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.320> this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
control I traced it back down to this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.080 
control I traced it back down to this
switch<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:46.510> normally<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.050> in<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:48.820> here

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
switch that normally is in the up here

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.569 
switch that normally is in the up here
in<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.210> -<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.780> could<00:00:49.899> switch<00:00:50.110> between<00:00:50.579> Ford

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
in the - you could switch between Ford

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.080 
in the - you could switch between Ford
off<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.570> reverse<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:54.309> know<00:00:54.399> which<00:00:54.910> looks

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
off and reverse you know which looks

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.610 
off and reverse you know which looks
pretty<00:00:55.149> old<00:00:55.359> but<00:00:55.660> it's<00:00:55.780> I<00:00:56.050> know<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:56.410> thought<00:00:56.559> it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
pretty old but it's I know I thought it

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.650 
pretty old but it's I know I thought it
was<00:00:56.710> working<00:00:56.829> so<00:00:57.250> what<00:00:57.969> I<00:00:58.059> do<00:00:58.180> is<00:00:58.300> I<00:00:58.390> take<00:00:58.510> the

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
was working so what I do is I take the

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.290 
was working so what I do is I take the
wires<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:59.170> were<00:00:59.379> and<00:00:59.850> there<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.000> basically

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
wires that were and there and basically

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.230 
wires that were and there and basically
it<00:01:01.660> just<00:01:01.870> shorts<00:01:02.140> together<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:03.730> control

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.240 
it just shorts together the the control

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.840 
it just shorts together the the control
control<00:01:05.230> wire<00:01:05.440> which<00:01:06.220> goes<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.670> speed

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
control wire which goes to the speed

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.450 
control wire which goes to the speed
control<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.530> either<00:01:08.530> forward<00:01:08.950> reverse<00:01:09.070> we're

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
control and either forward reverse we're

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:20.720 
control and either forward reverse we're
going<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.640> go<00:01:09.730> ahead<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:09.940> hard-code<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:10.480> into

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.640 

there<00:01:21.730> we<00:01:21.850> go<00:01:22.030> okay<00:01:22.570> sure<00:01:23.260> that's<00:01:23.500> not

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
there we go okay sure that's not

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.600 
there we go okay sure that's not
touching

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
touching

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.020 
touching
and<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:26.950> should<00:01:27.950> put<00:01:28.100> us<00:01:28.160> into<00:01:28.370> gear<00:01:28.640> here

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
and that should put us into gear here

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.780 
and that should put us into gear here
we've<00:01:29.780> got<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.190> multimeter<00:01:31.190> telling<00:01:31.610> us<00:01:31.700> we

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
we've got the multimeter telling us we

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.810 
we've got the multimeter telling us we
got<00:01:31.820> some<00:01:32.120> juice<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.750> little<00:01:33.200> Sun<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.770> way<00:01:33.920> this

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
got some juice a little Sun the way this

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.430 
got some juice a little Sun the way this
will<00:01:35.090> measure<00:01:35.390> how<00:01:35.660> many<00:01:35.720> amperes<00:01:36.170> are

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
will measure how many amperes are

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.640 
will measure how many amperes are
running<00:01:37.720> let's<00:01:38.720> see<00:01:38.930> we<00:01:39.110> should<00:01:39.170> be<00:01:39.440> good<00:01:39.590> to

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
running let's see we should be good to

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.300 
running let's see we should be good to
go<00:01:39.740> oh<00:01:43.840> yeah<00:01:44.870> as<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.440> can<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:45.710> I'm<00:01:45.830> holding<00:01:46.070> on

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
go oh yeah as you can see I'm holding on

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.510 
go oh yeah as you can see I'm holding on
the<00:01:46.430> gas<00:01:46.610> pedal<00:01:46.880> here<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:49.100> want<00:01:49.460> to

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
the gas pedal here and I want to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.060 
the gas pedal here and I want to
discharge<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.150> battery<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:51.440> in<00:01:51.560> order<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.860> do
