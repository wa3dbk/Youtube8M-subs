00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
properly so yeah I definitely think that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.580 
properly so yeah I definitely think that
boy<00:02:04.790> actor<00:02:05.150> snipers<00:02:05.540> should<00:02:05.900> be<00:02:05.990> nerve<00:02:06.200> I

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
boy actor snipers should be nerve I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.590 
boy actor snipers should be nerve I
really<00:02:07.550> like<00:02:07.700> how<00:02:07.850> they<00:02:08.000> did<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.360> bullet

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
really like how they did the bullet

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
kill anywhere else and I don't know I

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.050 
kill anywhere else and I don't know I
just<00:02:17.900> feel<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.290> that's<00:02:18.530> more<00:02:19.190> balanced<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
just feel like that's more balanced and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.930 
just feel like that's more balanced and
then<00:02:21.020> if<00:02:21.650> people<00:02:21.980> want<00:02:22.160> their<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.670> know<00:02:22.760> one

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
then if people want their you know one

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.940 
then if people want their you know one
hit<00:02:23.090> kill<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:23.870> action<00:02:24.260> big<00:02:24.470> they<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:24.800> play

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
hit kill for action big they can play

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.820 
hit kill for action big they can play
hardcore<00:02:25.220> servers<00:02:25.820> I<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:27.470> don't<00:02:27.680> know<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.800> just

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
hardcore servers I I don't know I just

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.130 
hardcore servers I I don't know I just
feel<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.459> that's<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.940> better<00:02:29.510> way<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.720> do<00:02:29.930> it

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
feel like that's a better way to do it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.620 
feel like that's a better way to do it
because<00:02:30.739> when<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.550> combine<00:02:31.850> easy<00:02:32.209> one<00:02:32.450> hit

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
because when you combine easy one hit

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.990 
because when you combine easy one hit
kills<00:02:32.870> with<00:02:33.050> bolt<00:02:33.260> action<00:02:33.530> sniper<00:02:33.880> plenty<00:02:34.880> of

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
kills with bolt action sniper plenty of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.180 
kills with bolt action sniper plenty of
like<00:02:35.269> high<00:02:35.510> vantage<00:02:35.750> points<00:02:36.380> like<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.860> point

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
like high vantage points like the point

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.920 
like high vantage points like the point
