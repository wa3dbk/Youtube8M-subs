00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
energy crystal cutter we go there's two

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:17.890 
energy crystal cutter we go there's two
more<00:00:09.679> an<00:00:11.330> energy<00:00:12.330> crystal<00:00:12.750> has<00:00:12.960> been<00:00:13.200> found<00:00:13.530> a

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:42.100 

landslide<00:00:18.900> has<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> curve

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:54.290 

do<00:00:50.330> you<00:00:51.330> dynamite<00:00:52.140> okay<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.730> or<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.150> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
do you dynamite okay one more or out of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.600 
do you dynamite okay one more or out of
there<00:00:54.450> and<00:00:54.629> when<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.900> get<00:00:55.080> to<00:00:55.290> use<00:00:55.440> dynamite

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.000 

there<00:01:03.610> we<00:01:03.730> go<00:01:03.940> now<00:01:04.360> we<00:01:04.420> can<00:01:04.660> use<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.989> dynamite

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:21.830 

I<00:01:19.850> buildings<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:21.030> upgrade<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.480> high<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.690> they

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I buildings your upgrade as high as they

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:43.840 
I buildings your upgrade as high as they
can<00:01:21.870> be<00:01:39.230> rubble<00:01:40.910> there's<00:01:41.910> an<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.300> seen

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
can be rubble there's an or seen

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:53.120 
can be rubble there's an or seen
something<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.180> don't<00:01:45.390> need<00:01:51.800> okay<00:01:52.800> go<00:01:53.070> ahead

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
something we don't need okay go ahead

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.880 
something we don't need okay go ahead
and<00:01:53.280> blow<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.670> up<00:01:53.850> drill<00:01:54.660> that<00:01:54.840> wait<00:01:55.560> wait<00:01:55.740> wait

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and blow it up drill that wait wait wait

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:21.920 
and blow it up drill that wait wait wait
wait<00:01:56.040> wait<00:01:56.220> no<00:01:56.430> not<00:01:56.700> yet<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:56.880> yet<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.240> yet

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.160 

the<00:02:22.930> landslide<00:02:23.380> has<00:02:23.710> a<00:02:23.740> club<00:02:24.840> you're<00:02:25.840> on<00:02:26.020> that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
the landslide has a club you're on that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:38.210 
the landslide has a club you're on that
side<00:02:26.230> instead<00:02:31.140> crystal<00:02:32.140> has<00:02:32.350> been<00:02:32.590> found<00:02:32.920> I

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.160 

landslide<00:02:39.220> has<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.550> car<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.210> said<00:02:40.690> for<00:02:41.020> that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
landslide has a car that I said for that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.450 
landslide has a car that I said for that
to<00:02:41.320> be<00:02:41.440> blown<00:02:41.680> out<00:02:43.110> maybe<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.230> didn't<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.800> don't

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
to be blown out maybe I didn't I don't

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.070 
to be blown out maybe I didn't I don't
know<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.760> can't<00:02:46.060> remember<00:02:48.210> an<00:02:49.210> energy<00:02:49.660> crystal

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
know I can't remember an energy crystal

00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:00.360 
know I can't remember an energy crystal
has<00:02:50.320> been<00:02:50.530> found<00:02:58.890> we<00:02:59.890> have<00:03:00.010> enough<00:03:00.220> energy

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
has been found we have enough energy

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.710 
has been found we have enough energy
crystals<00:03:01.350> we're<00:03:02.350> done<00:03:06.330> probably<00:03:07.330> could<00:03:07.690> have

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
crystals we're done probably could have

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:19.010 
crystals we're done probably could have
gone<00:03:07.990> faster<00:03:08.500> but<00:03:09.220> oh<00:03:11.250> well

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:39.960 

that's<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:33.660> gold<00:03:34.660> one<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.980> are<00:03:39.610> done<00:03:39.819> with

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
that's a gold one and we are done with

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.270 
that's a gold one and we are done with
that<00:03:40.120> mission<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.690> now<00:03:40.930> ah<00:03:46.200> yeah<00:03:47.200> these<00:03:48.040> two

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
that mission to now ah yeah these two

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.500 
that mission to now ah yeah these two
are<00:03:48.310> going<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.550> have<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.760> wait<00:03:48.910> because<00:03:49.209> they

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
are going to have to wait because they

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.120 
are going to have to wait because they
take<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> little<00:03:50.110> while<00:03:50.319> and<00:03:50.590> i'll<00:03:50.680> have<00:03:50.890> much

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
take a little while and i'll have much

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.670 
take a little while and i'll have much
time<00:03:51.370> left<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:51.970> we<00:03:52.930> will<00:03:53.019> continue<00:03:53.200> those

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
time left so we will continue those

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.630 
time left so we will continue those
tomorrow<00:03:54.130> hopefully<00:03:54.640> i<00:03:55.239> will<00:03:56.280> cut<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.400> here

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
tomorrow hopefully i will cut it here

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.360 
tomorrow hopefully i will cut it here
