00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.140 
thought was a pretty good fight pretty
good<00:00:25.750> well<00:00:26.290> pretty<00:00:26.710> good<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.150> suggestion

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
good well pretty good a suggestion

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.050 
good well pretty good a suggestion
because<00:00:28.450> I<00:00:28.960> believe<00:00:29.919> when<00:00:30.160> Gohan<00:00:30.550> went<00:00:30.790> super

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
because I believe when Gohan went super

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.120 
because I believe when Gohan went super
saiyan<00:00:31.270> to<00:00:31.480> idle<00:00:31.840> Gohan<00:00:32.140> actually<00:00:32.500> when<00:00:32.920> he

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
saiyan to idle Gohan actually when he

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.069 
saiyan to idle Gohan actually when he
went<00:00:33.280> super<00:00:33.550> saiyan<00:00:33.790> to<00:00:34.000> when<00:00:34.750> broadly

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
went super saiyan to when broadly

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.160 
went super saiyan to when broadly
returned<00:00:35.440> I<00:00:35.970> think<00:00:36.970> he<00:00:37.450> went<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.690> /<00:00:37.809> saying<00:00:37.989> to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
returned I think he went to / saying to

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.200 
returned I think he went to / saying to
anyway<00:00:38.500> I'm<00:00:38.739> not<00:00:39.070> entirely<00:00:39.400> sure<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:39.880> don't

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
anyway I'm not entirely sure I don't

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.270 
anyway I'm not entirely sure I don't
know<00:00:40.270> one<00:00:40.360> crew<00:00:40.510> vs<00:00:40.810> /<00:00:40.990> there<00:00:41.230> when<00:00:42.010> he<00:00:42.130> went

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
know one crew vs / there when he went

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.860

super<00:00:42.460> saiyan<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.880> I<00:00:43.180> think<00:00:43.480> he's<00:00:43.570> still<00:00:43.720> got
