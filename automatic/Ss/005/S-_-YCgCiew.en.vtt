00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
well I think that man has had a great

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.649 
well I think that man has had a great
career<00:01:48.050> here<00:01:48.260> at<00:01:48.290> USC<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:49.010> think<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.030> as<00:01:50.240> i

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
career here at USC I think that as i

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.330 
career here at USC I think that as i
mentioned<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.050> you

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
mentioned to you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.399 
mentioned to you
I<00:01:52.399> think<00:01:52.609> the<00:01:52.700> week<00:01:52.850> or<00:01:52.969> two<00:01:53.090> ago<00:01:53.350> as<00:01:54.350> a

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
I think the week or two ago as a

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.959 
I think the week or two ago as a
quarterback<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:55.039> can't<00:01:55.250> control<00:01:55.640> everything

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
quarterback you can't control everything

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.660 
quarterback you can't control everything
you<00:01:56.840> know<00:01:56.929> your<00:01:57.259> your<00:01:57.679> judge<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.219> often<00:01:58.579> on

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
you know your your judge so often on

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.090 
you know your your judge so often on
your<00:01:58.789> win<00:01:58.909> loss<00:01:59.090> record<00:01:59.710> Matt<00:02:00.710> can't<00:02:00.920> play

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
your win loss record Matt can't play

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.580 
your win loss record Matt can't play
defense<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.539> if<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:02.960> look<00:02:03.170> at<00:02:03.319> matt's

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
defense and so if you look at matt's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.020 
defense and so if you look at matt's
career<00:02:03.979> here<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.399> start<00:02:04.640> taking<00:02:04.819> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
career here and you start taking the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.999 
career here and you start taking the
numbers<00:02:05.329> when<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.049> play<00:02:06.380> quarterback<00:02:06.740> here

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
numbers when you play quarterback here

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.949 
numbers when you play quarterback here
comparable<00:02:07.609> to<00:02:07.759> those<00:02:07.909> guys<00:02:08.119> before<00:02:08.450> putting

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
comparable to those guys before putting

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.779 
comparable to those guys before putting
the<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.229> Heisey<00:02:09.530> winners<00:02:09.799> there's<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.399> definite

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
the to Heisey winners there's a definite

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.160 
the to Heisey winners there's a definite
difference<00:02:10.970> in<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.360> defense<00:02:11.720> being<00:02:11.959> played

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
difference in the defense being played

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.420 
difference in the defense being played
around<00:02:12.410> and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
around and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.069 
around and
that<00:02:15.120> goes<00:02:15.299> into<00:02:15.450> getting<00:02:15.599> them<00:02:15.750> all<00:02:15.900> back

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
that goes into getting them all back

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.780 
that goes into getting them all back
more<00:02:16.439> around<00:02:16.680> third<00:02:16.859> downs<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.579> more

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
more around third downs and on more

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.429 
more around third downs and on more
possessions<00:02:18.299> in<00:02:19.219> the<00:02:20.219> game<00:02:20.400> changes<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.120> I

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
possessions in the game changes so I

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.990 
possessions in the game changes so I
think<00:02:22.439> Matt's<00:02:22.799> had<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> great<00:02:23.250> career<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.939> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
think Matt's had a great career and I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.380 
think Matt's had a great career and I
think<00:02:24.239> we<00:02:24.480> were<00:02:24.599> able<00:02:24.719> to<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:27.000> know<00:02:27.120> over

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
think we were able to to you know over

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.500 
think we were able to to you know over
just<00:02:27.599> over<00:02:28.019> his<00:02:28.140> burger<00:02:28.560> play<00:02:28.799> better<00:02:29.040> defense

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
just over his burger play better defense

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.610 
just over his burger play better defense
played<00:02:30.510> great<00:02:30.540> leaders<00:02:31.230> they<00:02:31.290> played<00:02:31.469> great

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
played great leaders they played great

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.349 
played great leaders they played great
defense<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:32.340> those<00:02:32.549> guys<00:02:32.760> had<00:02:32.969> in<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> lot<00:02:33.329> of

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
defense like those guys had in a lot of

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.440 
defense like those guys had in a lot of
their<00:02:33.540> times<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:35.519> know<00:02:35.609> what<00:02:36.090> he<00:02:36.209> did<00:02:36.359> his
