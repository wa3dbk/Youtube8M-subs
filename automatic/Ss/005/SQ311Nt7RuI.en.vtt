00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.810 
like 20 flips before control like
one<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.230> thousand<00:00:31.679> pilots<00:00:31.859> could<00:00:32.700> have

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
make it crash but it flipped around like

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.670 
make it crash but it flipped around like
crazy<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:39.870> close<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.200> ground<00:00:40.379> flow

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
crazy got really close to ground flow

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
crazy got really close to ground flow
inverted<00:00:41.250> flipped<00:00:41.489> around<00:00:41.610> more<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.420> then

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
inverted flipped around more and then

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.270 
inverted flipped around more and then
finally<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.170> enough<00:00:43.320> airspeed<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> took

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
finally got enough airspeed and it took

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.110 
finally got enough airspeed and it took
off<00:00:44.399> away<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> decided<00:00:45.840> after<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.410> throw

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
off away so I decided after that throw

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
off away so I decided after that throw
luckily<00:00:48.120> no<00:00:48.300> damage<00:00:48.750> luckily<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.379> didn't<00:00:49.590> crash

luckily no damage luckily I didn't crash
it<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> decided<00:00:51.000> after<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.449> throw<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> was

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it but I decided after that throw I was

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.950 
it but I decided after that throw I was
going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> add<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.289> some<00:00:53.360> some<00:00:54.360> wheels<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
going to add on some some wheels to it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600 
going to add on some some wheels to it
so<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.590> did<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.160> took<00:00:56.430> some

so what we did here is we took some

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.369 
so what we did here is we took some
wheels<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.690> ones<00:00:57.930> look<00:00:58.109> kind<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
wheels now the back ones look kind of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.400 
wheels now the back ones look kind of
funny<00:00:59.059> it<00:01:00.059> kind<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.359> bent<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> see

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
work just fine i could actually bend

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.219 
work just fine i could actually bend
them<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.150> i<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.600> i<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.080> how

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
they are and the front wheel is

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.030 
they are and the front wheel is
steerable<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.200> let<00:01:13.290> me<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.470> ahead<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.890> just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
steerable so let me go ahead and do just

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.790 
steerable so let me go ahead and do just
a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.159> test<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.880> taxi<00:01:15.390> test

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:47.140 

get<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:21.920> out<00:01:22.040> there

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:57.260 

works<00:01:48.150> perfect

and as you can see i got a little bit on

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.230 
and as you can see i got a little bit on
an<00:01:59.890> angle<00:02:00.280> with<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.429> nose<00:02:00.700> pointing<00:02:01.149> up

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
an angle with the nose pointing up

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.779 
an angle with the nose pointing up
that's<00:02:01.479> how<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.770> should<00:02:02.770> have<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.460> helps

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
that's how you should have it that helps

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.729 
that's how you should have it that helps
it<00:02:04.229> helps<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.409> take<00:02:05.649> off<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.780> got<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.470> wheels

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
it helps to take off so got the wheels

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.139 
it helps to take off so got the wheels
on<00:02:08.979> we'll<00:02:09.129> get<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.280> flight<00:02:09.519> for<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.729> guys<00:02:09.849> soon

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.030 

see<00:02:35.840> how<00:02:35.900> straight<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.380> goes<00:02:36.500> will<00:02:36.740> turn<00:02:36.950> it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
see how straight it goes will turn it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.830 
see how straight it goes will turn it
around<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.370> Zuma<00:02:37.700> back<00:02:37.910> for<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.330> camera<00:02:38.660> here

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
around and Zuma back for the camera here

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.630 
around and Zuma back for the camera here
try<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.230> straighten<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.709> out<00:02:42.310> pretty<00:02:43.310> pointed

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
try to straighten it out pretty pointed

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.840 
try to straighten it out pretty pointed
at<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.850> camera<00:02:44.209> here<00:02:48.310> how<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.370> stop<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.640> with

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
at the camera here how to stop it with

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.910 
at the camera here how to stop it with
my<00:02:49.940> hand<00:02:50.150> there<00:02:50.360> make<00:02:51.260> sure<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.470> didn't<00:02:51.740> break

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
my hand there make sure I didn't break

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:22.570 
my hand there make sure I didn't break
anything

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.610 

so<00:03:23.580> there<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.790> have<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.240> mig-15<00:03:24.630> now<00:03:25.410> with

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
so there you have it the mig-15 now with

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.800 
so there you have it the mig-15 now with
wheels
