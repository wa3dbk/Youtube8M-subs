with<00:02:19.989> Apple<00:02:20.349> they<00:02:20.470> should<00:02:20.620> probably<00:02:20.800> switch

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
with Apple they should probably switch

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.390

gigabytes<00:02:32.350> storage<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.010> then<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.550> add

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
gigabytes storage and then you can add

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.729 
gigabytes storage and then you can add
up<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.000> 64<00:02:34.630> gigabyte<00:02:35.020> SD<00:02:35.200> card<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:37.600> know

wins it in every suspect category the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.780 
wins it in every suspect category the
one<00:03:05.019> thing<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.380> iPhone<00:03:05.650> 5c<00:03:06.069> is<00:03:06.190> gonna<00:03:06.400> have<00:03:06.610> is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
one thing the iPhone 5c is gonna have is

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.490 
one thing the iPhone 5c is gonna have is
that<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.180> obviously<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.690> smaller<00:03:08.049> phone<00:03:08.319> it's

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
that it's obviously a smaller phone it's

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.080 
that it's obviously a smaller phone it's
gonna<00:03:08.620> fit<00:03:08.890> into<00:03:09.040> your<00:03:09.220> hand<00:03:09.489> better<00:03:09.760> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
gonna fit into your hand better and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.229 
gonna fit into your hand better and
probably<00:03:10.900> be<00:03:11.680> more<00:03:11.890> usable<00:03:12.489> but<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.819> think

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
probably be more usable but I think

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.550 
probably be more usable but I think
people<00:03:13.330> are<00:03:13.510> getting<00:03:13.660> used<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.140> fact<00:03:14.319> with
