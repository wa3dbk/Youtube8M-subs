00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 this story happened seven years ago 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.620
 when I did not believe in ghosts and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.719
 start like that one day I was at school 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.269
 with my best friend lola who had 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.920
 moved to a new house she was 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.020
 counting that in a low room 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.420
 key you heard strange things 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.390
 cries of girls screams and glasses 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.430
 breaking apart whenever he washed 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.980
 the hands left light drops of blood 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.140
 of the tap of course it seemed to me 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 a lie since I did not believe in those 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.420
 things but she still insisted that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.280
 it was true when I left school lola 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.050
 He invited me to sleep over in his 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.660
 new house to prove to me that what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.640
 she told me it was true first we went 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.739
 to the bathroom to wash our hands and so 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.260
 check if blood drops came out of the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.899
 tap when opening the stretcher did not come out nor the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.910
 minimal red mark I looked at my friend 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.800
 and she told me that she swore by her parents 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.840
 who saw a drop of blood coming from there 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.449
 the night before but again not 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 I thought it was too late we did not go to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.829
 sleep without visiting the room of the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.899
 noises that was under lock and key at that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.880
 three in the morning I got up to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.930
 take a glass of water and when passing by 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.820
 mysterious room 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 and I realized that the door was 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 unlocked and semi open as the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.540
 curiosity beat me I went in and discovered 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.550
 blood stains and a broken glass 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.590
 I found a paper that said 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.570
 gift this because I know you love the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 game of the cup suddenly closed the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 door and when I turned around I saw a replica 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.350
 exact of the game that mentioned the letter 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.600
 I saw some instructions from the game of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.250
 the cup and I decided to read them to play 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.920
 that he could not leave because the door 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.930
 was mysteriously closed the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.700
 instructions said he had to put 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.009
 the finger on top of the cup and then say 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.869
 a strange prayer to do this is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.180
 it broke but then there was a noise 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.210
 coming from an old and dirty closet 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.250
 from this one fell a woman with a cut throat 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.320
 note hanging by the hand that said vein 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.930
 is home to read it I ran up and went 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.940
 lola's room from the door was 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.860
 a trail of blood that took me 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.500
 the body of my friend who was lying 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.300
 under his dead bed I found a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.700
 last note and crying the law I'll 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.590
 I noticed written with blood when I 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.720
 I sat in a corner heard screams and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.580
 Glasses breaking from the low room 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.470
 key as my friend had told me 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.890
 but instead of crying I heard laughter 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.830
 derision 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.560
 and I ran out of the house to mine 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.690
 since then I never told anyone 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.760
 about what happened and each time 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.830
 for that mysterious and tenebrous house 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.840
 I hear the same screams glasses 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.760
 breaking and mocking laughs and in the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.630
 input a note says you want to play at 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.630
 cup game
