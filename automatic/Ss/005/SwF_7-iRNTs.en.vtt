00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
curling wand and then what I do is just

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.039 
curling wand and then what I do is just
kind<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.150> run<00:01:06.330> my<00:01:06.450> fingers<00:01:06.810> through<00:01:07.020> my

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
kind of like run my fingers through my

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.170 
kind of like run my fingers through my
hair<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.500> start<00:01:08.189> grabbing<00:01:08.460> sections<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
hair and start grabbing sections and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.170 
hair and start grabbing sections and
then<00:01:09.240> around<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.380> face<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
then around my face I like to kind of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
then around my face I like to kind of
like<00:01:12.390> frame<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.350> bit<00:01:13.530> does<00:01:13.950> that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
like frame it a little bit does that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.649 
like frame it a little bit does that
make<00:01:14.220> sense<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.150> hold<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
make sense so what I do is hold the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
make sense so what I do is hold the
curling<00:01:15.960> wand<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.530> bit<00:01:16.619> longer<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
curling wand a little bit longer in the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.800 
curling wand a little bit longer in the
sections<00:01:17.759> right<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.150> by<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> front<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> my

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
sections right up by the front of my

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
sections right up by the front of my
face<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.830> makes<00:01:20.009> sense<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.820> they're

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
face if that makes sense just so they're

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
face if that makes sense just so they're
a<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.450> bit<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.990> curled<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.799> guess<00:01:22.979> then

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
a little bit more curled I guess then

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.890 
a little bit more curled I guess then
the<00:01:23.460> back<00:01:23.700> sections

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
the back sections

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.020 
the back sections
when<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:28.180> decide<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:29.050> stick<00:01:29.470> together<00:01:33.030> when

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
when we we decide to stick together when

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.880 
when we we decide to stick together when
I'm<00:01:34.150> all<00:01:34.300> done<00:01:34.330> curling<00:01:34.810> my<00:01:34.960> hair<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.290> go<00:01:35.680> ahead
