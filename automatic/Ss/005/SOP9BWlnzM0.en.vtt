00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.219 
hands warm in cooler weather now the
interesting<00:01:35.700> thing<00:01:36.090> about<00:01:36.119> Buell's<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
interesting thing about Buell's is that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.100 
interesting thing about Buell's is that
the<00:01:37.650> fuel<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:39.060> right<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the fuel is actually right here in the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.770 
the fuel is actually right here in the
frame<00:01:40.409> which<00:01:41.400> makes<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> bike<00:01:42.119> center<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
frame which makes the bike center of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.800 
frame which makes the bike center of
gravity<00:01:43.200> lower<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.829> better<00:01:43.979> handling<00:01:44.810> back

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
gravity lower for better handling back

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.910 
gravity lower for better handling back
here<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.920> oil<00:01:47.189> cooler<00:01:48.560> or<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.890> oil

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
here we have the oil cooler or the oil

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.530 
here we have the oil cooler or the oil
tank

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
tank

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.140 
tank
which<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> backswing<00:01:53.010> arm<00:01:53.340> which<00:01:54.120> is

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
which is in the backswing arm which is

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.290 
which is in the backswing arm which is
also<00:01:54.480> uh<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> concept<00:01:56.550> of<00:01:56.700> keeping<00:01:57.090> the

also uh to the concept of keeping the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.600 
also uh to the concept of keeping the
center<00:01:57.510> of<00:01:57.630> gravity<00:01:57.720> low<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.890> exhaust<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.490> all

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
center of gravity low the exhaust is all

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.160 
center of gravity low the exhaust is all
the<00:01:59.760> way<00:01:59.850> underneath<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.540> which<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.900> not

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the way underneath here which is not

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.220 
the way underneath here which is not
common<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.860> bikes<00:02:02.570> but<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.660> works<00:02:03.870> great<00:02:04.020> on

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
common on bikes but it works great on

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
this Buell movie from the back we see a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.090 
this Buell movie from the back we see a
180<00:02:09.300> tire<00:02:10.400> which<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.630> real<00:02:12.630> nice<00:02:12.900> as<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
180 tire which is real nice as to the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.030 
180 tire which is real nice as to the
handling<00:02:14.550> characteristics<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> bike<00:02:16.040> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
