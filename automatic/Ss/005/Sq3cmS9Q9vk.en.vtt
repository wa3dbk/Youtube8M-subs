of<00:05:33.660> thing<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.170> actually<00:05:34.380> a<00:05:34.940> passion<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.090> mine

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
of thing is actually a passion of mine
and<00:05:37.880> there<00:05:38.880> is<00:05:39.120> just<00:05:39.540> there's<00:05:40.260> no<00:05:40.940> comparison

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
and there is just there's no comparison

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:50.750 
and there is just there's no comparison
