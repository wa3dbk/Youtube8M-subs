00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
average computer and an average internet

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.850 
average computer and an average internet
speed<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.140> an<00:01:10.409> above-average

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
speed if you have an above-average

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
speed if you have an above-average

computer and above average internet
speed<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.470> slightly<00:01:13.680> faster<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.820> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
speed it will be slightly faster so you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.609 
speed it will be slightly faster so you
obviously<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> capture<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.259> gameplay

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
which takes however long it takes for

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
which takes however long it takes for
you<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> good<00:01:18.900> game<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.130> have

have<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.739> keep<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:19.190> mind<00:03:19.340> as<00:03:19.550> well<00:03:19.820> now

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
have to keep that in mind as well now

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.470 
have to keep that in mind as well now
this<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.470> big<00:03:21.980> one<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.670> think<00:03:23.120> not

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
this is the big one that I think not

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.660 
this is the big one that I think not
many<00:03:23.660> people<00:03:24.170> really<00:03:24.410> consider<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.190> nobody

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
many people really consider and nobody

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.570 
many people really consider and nobody
really<00:03:26.030> warns<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.420> about<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:27.560> will<00:03:27.950> gain

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
really warns you about you will gain

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.990 
really warns you about you will gain
less<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.170> do<00:03:30.410> right<00:03:30.980> now<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.820> is<00:03:31.970> a

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
less and then you do right now that is a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.790 
less and then you do right now that is a
given<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:32.780> kind<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:33.110> logical<00:03:33.560> when<00:03:33.709> you

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
given and it's kind of logical when you

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.050 
given and it's kind of logical when you
think<00:03:33.980> about<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:34.220> if<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.550> think<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:34.910> you're

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
think about it if you think that you're

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.000 
think about it if you think that you're
spending<00:03:35.239> three<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.780> four<00:03:36.019> hours<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.380> day<00:03:36.680> on<00:03:36.980> a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
spending three to four hours a day on a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.310 
spending three to four hours a day on a
video<00:03:37.489> that's<00:03:38.390> gonna<00:03:38.630> be<00:03:38.840> three<00:03:39.050> or<00:03:39.140> four

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
video that's gonna be three or four

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.870 
video that's gonna be three or four
hours<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.769> you're<00:03:39.920> not<00:03:40.070> gaming<00:03:40.519> it's

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
hours that you're not gaming it's

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.699 
hours that you're not gaming it's
especially<00:03:41.000> true<00:03:41.600> if<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.780> go<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.080> work<00:03:42.320> or<00:03:42.590> you

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
especially true if you go to work or you

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.949 
especially true if you go to work or you
go<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:42.890> school<00:03:43.280> because<00:03:43.850> that's<00:03:44.209> four<00:03:44.600> hours

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
so that's very important that you know

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.009 
so that's very important that you know
and<00:03:51.680> understand<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.370> it's<00:03:52.640> gonna<00:03:52.880> be<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.480> lot

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
and understand that it's gonna be a lot

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.840 
and understand that it's gonna be a lot
less<00:03:54.230> time<00:03:54.530> gaming<00:03:54.860> than<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.310> do<00:03:55.459> right<00:03:55.489> now

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
less time gaming than you do right now

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.000 
less time gaming than you do right now

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
you can still game a lot of course you

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.229 
you can still game a lot of course you
probably<00:03:58.190> gain<00:03:58.519> more<00:03:58.790> than<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.090> average

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
probably gain more than the average

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.500 
probably gain more than the average
person<00:03:59.680> but<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:01.250> will<00:04:01.580> gain<00:04:01.820> less<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:02.330> be
