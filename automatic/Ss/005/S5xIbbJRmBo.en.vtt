00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 and yes 0 net tv still on the roofs 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.830
 of Paris to make you discover everything 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.250
 throughout this month of August during your 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.620
 vacation 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.509
 these technological innovations that have 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.340
 marked in the last 30 years and we 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.759
 is now interested in an innovation 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.759
 French 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.920
 and so this French innovation that has 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.279
 upset the telecom landscape in 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.619
 la France 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.310
 Well, it's just free with 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.590
 his freebox 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 we are in 2002 yes but it is necessary 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.699
 even go back to the end of the years 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
 90 francs or 95 internet arrives in 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.390
 France there is still very little 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 of operators France Telecom thinks it 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.870
 will be the only one to offer the internet 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.269
 to the French except that from the year 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.910
 2000 it's unbundling the arrival of the 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.739
 competition is there a certain free ups 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.210
 shows the tip of his nose with a 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.400
 certain xavier niel then at the time 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.739
 no one knows him this gentleman has 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.800
 makes his fortune with services 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.410
 minitel and already he actually intends to create 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.960
 its own telephone network and they 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.910
 imagine and a device that is going 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.680
 have all of them now under our TV and 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.660
 yes it is said that with the internet one can 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.850
 bring more than just the web connection 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.350
 can now bring television and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.060
 Landline 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.560
 so he goes to the silicon valley 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.940
 look for the miracle device and well 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.920
 that's when they seek they seek 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.050
 they can not find an engineer in the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.759
 silicon valley who can make him his 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.619
 magic box then he returns to France 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
 all sheepish and it's here in the area 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.190
 Parisian with engineers he goes 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.039
 create the freebox 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.740
 here is an all-in-one device that offers 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.390
 three services hence its name the triple 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 play and it will be a real revolution 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.869
 then the success of the freebox we owe to 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.750
 How well just a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.090
 incredibly successful marketing 1 we have 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 a price that is very low 29 euros 99 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.800
 for that price we have three services the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.479
 television the phone the internet and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.860
 it's a lot cheaper of course 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.179
 competitors and yes at the time for 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.340
 have the equivalent in others 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.959
 operators must be at least 45 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.550
 euros is one of the highlights it's 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.080
 to have even integrated calls to 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.190
 abroad in his package at 30 euros 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.300
 remember that at the time it cost a 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.440
 fortune of a calling to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.810
 the stranger there was included in the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.729
 price then it's a real turning point 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.370
 because the other operators will have to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.260
 align themselves all the operators are going 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.550
 get out their triple play box is this 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.020
 that they do not do will disappear 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.720
 ronald and aol and tiscali clubs 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.319
 internet will disappear 1 face the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.050
 competition 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.330
 amazing fruit every operator 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.220
 obviously draws his box and we 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.650
 still remains today at this 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.640
 price of 30 euros per month for all and 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.379
 for all these services 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.359
 and here is this box that will become the 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.540
 standard that was still pretty lousy 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.920
 at the beginning we have to say it 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.360
 it's less than we can say it's 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.000
 that later we will see a 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.129
 freebox design and by philippe starck and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.939
 then free services at the beginning are a 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.189
 little chaotic 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.840
 users are mostly beta 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.489
 testers but the worst is that it's their 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.140
 Pleased to be state testers because he 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.340
 are still some innovations that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.569
 always happens for the same price it's 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.459
 that also the strength of fruits whose 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.799
 did you know that jérôme 1 where does the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.120
 name freebox and well free because it's 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.829
 free of course and then because during 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.569
 the whole period of focus we 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.310
 was just calling it the box 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.569
 internet that's it's done and then one 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.980
 employees of free who was coming back 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.540
 from south america had bought it there 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.159
 a pack of cigarettes that was called 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.950
 freebox they liked it 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.209
 and here is so called freebox to 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.780
 because of a package it's still 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.370
 unbelievable 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.500
 that's what we could say about 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.909
 this mythical box that has changed 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.340
 radically the telecom landscape 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.109
 french iconic high-tech objects 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.650
 it continues all summer on 01net tv on 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.650
 finds himself very quickly
