00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.160
 I welcome all viewers of this video 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.679
 in this video I will tell you how you can 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.150
 increase iphone working time 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:19.050
 that is, the standard here we take iphone 4s 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.990
 atom iphone 4s ordinary mean most like 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.850
 increase the time to work without 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.949
 recharge iphone use as 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.359
 can be longer 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.420
 accordingly, we need an external 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.279
 battery is an external battery 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.800
 for up to 30 000 milliamps at 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.110
 its capacity that is everything here when 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.360
 the conversation comes from the Tokyo current consumption 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.140
 we need to handle current numbers 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.000
 of consumption 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.059
 that is, we need to know how much 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.399
 consumes iphone and how much it consumes 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.410
 how much does our battery give us 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.730
 In this case, the battery costs it. 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 one and a half thousand rubles that is on average 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.600
 one and a half to two to two and a half 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.180
 that is, where will you find how much 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.530
 find the cheapest way and get 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 This price depends on different 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.809
 shopping and so this battery means what 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.799
 we have so modelka with 190 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.200
 white color that is white it means 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.619
 This battery is designed for 30 thousand 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.460
 milliamperes ie capacity 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.080
 so it says we have the 37th 30 to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.210
 for prototype digital technology 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.180
 universal battery it fits 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.150
 It means for an apple iphone on this and p 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.280
 yes even us for a number of all sorts of cellular 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 phones but written here on 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.700
 instructions that it is suitable for samsung 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.259
 aw it is not suitable for samsung galaxy 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.930
 tab and galaxy tab 2 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.420
 it doesn't fit checked and so let's 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.939
 calculate means let's get you started 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.840
 show you how this whole thing works 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.860
 open this battery remove to the side 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.899
 case 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.689
 then it comes with a cord and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.899
 successful regular standard to the concert 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.500
 at one end and yusbi connector at the other 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.540
 the end 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.250
 connector that allows us 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.060
 connect to it various 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 Adapters principle cord is not for me very 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.310
 long but so new 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.220
 will be enough 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.140
 bundled are various 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.430
 glaciers for different cell phones in 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.610
 particular times interested 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.620
 in this case for iphone 4s in general for 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.170
 iPhones ie for iphone 5 this is not 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.690
 suitable that is some kind of suitable for 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.980
 third iphone and its varieties for 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.700
 fourth iphone and his too 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.410
 varieties 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.720
 for iphone 5 for five out of five is another 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.320
 you will need a connector and so but what do we take 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.240
 so this connector is connected in this way 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:41.600
 way further 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:44.360
 Now take the battery itself here such 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.860
 of such dimensions to the batteries it is quite 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.680
 large principle for portable technology 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.750
 but nevertheless she is very powerful 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.250
 so we connect accordingly 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.730
 our one end of the cord into the battery the other 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.520
 the end of the ball since the adapter we have 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.709
 connect to our iphone here you see 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.830
 right indicator lights on 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.750
 signals that charging is in progress and 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.650
 on the iPhone itself we can also see in 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.810
 our top right icon badge 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.350
 recharging do not know you can see or not 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.430
 let's locked here you can see already 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.030
 there is charging going if we disconnect from 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.100
 batteries and charging immediately stops and 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.410
 so much so 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.390
 important now question mean percent i 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.640
 already said repeat batteries worth 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.739
 one and a half thousand this complete set 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.650
 with adapters with a wire and a half 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.420
 thousand baht and a half and above as far as we 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.080
 time enough that is if we have 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.900
 iphone is completely dead and we want 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.370
 feed it to this external battery if 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.130
 we have no source nearby 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.450
 if we can't recharge the iphone then 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.310
 here is this battery on power by the way 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.269
 how much time is useful to us 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.820
 enough and so iphone consumption and 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.560
 1430 milliamps per hour capacity of this 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.070
 batteries 30,000 milliampere 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.670
 accordingly we divide 30,000 by 1430 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:16.230
 Now I will share in computers 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:22.620
 so let's open the calculator 30,000 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:26.490
 and divide by 1430 and get twenty with 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.620
 superfluous hours that is almost 21 hours then 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.730
 have our iphone with you 3 or 4 without 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.890
 differences what version 4s is there or just 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.350
 43 there are some other varieties of power 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.260
 our iphone except 5 except the fifth iphone 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.450
 on the necks it will work for about 21 hours with 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.970
 fully discharged battery from 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.370
 this battery will last for 21 hours 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.320
 on drugs in perfect conditions on how 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.690
 would arithmetic not always help well i 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.760
 I think approach so there 20 hours 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.920
 maybe somewhere so it is a very 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.720
 good indicator 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.550
 Thank you all for watching. 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.730
 please comment on what you would like 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.660
 you still get any review and 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.760
 ask your questions will be glad 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.330
 comments likes and subscriptions to all 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.330
 Thanks for watching
