brilliant start to this one because that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.550 
brilliant start to this one because that
is<00:01:53.280> exactly<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.240> looking<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.600> we

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
is exactly what we are looking for we

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.410 
is exactly what we are looking for we

and with our fatal player and that way

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
and with our fatal player and that way
we<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.939> add<00:02:00.060> bigger<00:02:00.360> names<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> team

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
we can add bigger names to the team

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.249 
we can add bigger names to the team
though<00:02:02.100> looking<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:03.060> chemistry<00:02:03.540> reasons<00:02:04.079> in

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
though looking for chemistry reasons in

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.950 
though looking for chemistry reasons in
the<00:02:04.290> future<00:02:04.860> episodes<00:02:05.369> we're<00:02:06.180> probably<00:02:06.509> not

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the future episodes we're probably not

the future episodes we're probably not
going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.590> most<00:02:07.770> expensive<00:02:08.250> players

depending on how many coins we get

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.960 
depending on how many coins we get
because<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.560> don't<00:02:11.190> want<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.730> throw

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970

they're going to be on terrible
chemistry<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.350> we'll<00:02:16.530> see<00:02:16.800> how<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.640> kind<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
chemistry so we'll see how it kind of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.460 
chemistry so we'll see how it kind of
pans<00:02:18.300> out<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:18.960> can<00:02:19.080> do<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.290> our

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
pans out and what we can do with our

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.920 
pans out and what we can do with our
coins<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:20.190> kind<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.790> improve<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.600> squad<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
out with some buddies in an xbox live

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.250 
out with some buddies in an xbox live
party<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.770> my<00:02:56.130> luck<00:02:56.400> was<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:57.150> point<00:02:57.690> so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
party and I my luck was just on point so

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.600 
party and I my luck was just on point so
I'll<00:02:58.530> go<00:02:58.770> through<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.310> some<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.550> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
I'll go through and do some of the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.340 
I'll go through and do some of the
highlights<00:02:59.760> with<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.240> probably<00:03:00.690> look<00:03:01.200> I

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
highlights with that probably look I

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.660 
highlights with that probably look I
wasn't<00:03:01.530> recording<00:03:02.100> my<00:03:02.220> face<00:03:02.400> or<00:03:02.580> anything

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
wasn't recording my face or anything

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.040 
wasn't recording my face or anything
like<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.510> wouldn't<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:03.960> a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
like that so it wouldn't just be a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.050 
like that so it wouldn't just be a
reaction<00:03:04.440> I'll<00:03:05.130> probably<00:03:05.310> go<00:03:05.640> through<00:03:05.670> give

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
reaction I'll probably go through give

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.180 
reaction I'll probably go through give
you<00:03:06.150> guys<00:03:06.300> some<00:03:06.600> lists<00:03:07.050> or<00:03:07.380> do<00:03:07.710> maybe<00:03:07.920> I'll<00:03:08.070> do

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
you guys some lists or do maybe I'll do

free<00:06:08.949> inside<00:06:09.310> takes<00:06:09.580> me<00:06:09.759> down<00:06:09.969> and<00:06:10.300> that's

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
free inside takes me down and that's

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.320 
free inside takes me down and that's
gonna<00:06:11.169> be<00:06:11.349> 70<00:06:11.740> K<00:06:11.889> in<00:06:12.099> the<00:06:12.159> book<00:06:12.250> because<00:06:12.669> it<00:06:13.240> is

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
gonna be 70 K in the book because it is

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.050 
gonna be 70 K in the book because it is
going<00:06:13.479> to<00:06:13.539> be<00:06:13.569> Robin<00:06:14.139> on<00:06:14.349> this<00:06:14.710> penalty<00:06:15.069> well

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060
