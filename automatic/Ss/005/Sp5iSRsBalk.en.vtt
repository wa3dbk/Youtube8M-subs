00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 we wanted to win and we have the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.359
 first yourself over after playing with it 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.090
 not myself first was very good 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.059
 I found now for embroidery languages 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 but the second half was on our part 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.619
 too little because we have our agreements 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.699
 did not keep 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.650
 the lines at great value too far to 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.670
 how to fold each other in the middle 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.430
 out of your hands 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.199
 which the first ones clearly own in our possession 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.080
 was and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 well then you may be disappointed 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.590
 about not winning 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.000
 but we also have an opponent 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.950
 to make 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.790
 Imagine accelerating players then you 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790
 to peddle a little 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.800
 well we do it all together with or 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.420
 those players then disappoint you 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 I found that it was the first thing on the whole 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.129
 We played well and we talk about that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.980
 line further but need to embroider the two 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.340
 there or did we fail and 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 yes those are the things that you do now 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 cannot discuss but what you can 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.920
 take it back to the second half 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.080
 the competition is then the piece 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.220
 trust what the team is currently in 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.750
 probably misses itself 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.390
 no that has nothing to do with confidence 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.350
 that has to do with the assignments 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.610
 compliance and the team on the importance 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.090
 ask first 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.310
 that is much more important than that 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.560
 that's that others it's just about 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.690
 the individual is always concerned 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.330
 we have the team and the second half 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.360
 failed and have the first ones themselves 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.160
 there all responded great, I think 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.720
 may we as supporter still be there 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.420
 think or say a fifth title 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.190
 well that will be very difficult 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.260
 totally good any match where you 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.150
 lose points 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.830
 might deliver a bigger one for a long time 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.820
 backlog and it is becoming 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.869
 more difficult 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.790
 therefore how and everyone o disappears at 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.580
 watching from people to competition and we 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.470
 want very much but then you can 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.720
 loud from today you may not be right 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.820
 then you also have to play such a match 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.220
 you have to bring home and the 3 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.600
 Grabbing points now comes for a week or so 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.340
 a week and a half rest actually 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.989
 nice or say in autocad was prefer 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.530
 branch straight away i was happy 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.420
 continue molukse that we still have one 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.400
 certain stuff and I already thought so 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.730
 against Feyenoord today ds or and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.000
 Play it had which was something positive and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.310
 ok and trust in those groups was over 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.549
 to play that match after structure and 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.330
 well that's a shame it 's not 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.600
 succeeded 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.269
 those there who come in yes that is then 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.890
 fine to make smoothness cup-free 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.780
 and I also hope that the boys can 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.950
 enjoy a good new year that 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.799
 I wish now 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.450
 I also wish PSV fans a good one 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.280
 New Year and hope we have it 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.870
 next season 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.730
 yes a better second half could 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.269
 responsive than the first time we 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.269
 have played
