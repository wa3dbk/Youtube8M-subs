00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.760
 blade runner or download it 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.470
 move it 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.540
 k the move is for her from right to left 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.540
 and precisely because it makes for going wooden cut 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.410

 our colleagues from the costs 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.190
