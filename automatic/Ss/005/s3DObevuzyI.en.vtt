 I hope you are doing very well. 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.439
 if you are not going to stay because the program today is very good I already 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.679
 I want to start with a special message that means that we are counting 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:36.800
 regressive 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.050
 after all next Saturday but let's celebrate two years falling dollar 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.989
 for that 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.160
 but is preparing a care program 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.780
 as the theme teresina a retrospective of the history of the credential understood the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.329
 next tarsian program 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.329
 and today it is also worth pointing out that 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.060
 the automodelismo 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.060
 but who are 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 full violet 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.610
 Sling Spanish 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 and it's a model renata 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 about her 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.690
 while the olympics alongside china 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.410
 here in Brazil we chat with the young man who is learning to speak 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.650
 mandarin 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.890
 and I do not think they want to create a band that will pack the two-year 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.400
 program birthday 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 tarcísio meira 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 on Saturday with the Argentine delegation today's program 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.080
 who trains save relaxes the television the armed gymnast said 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.960
 quiet 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.440
 and so have some agent interest to start Let's talk about two engines 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.330
 times 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.200
 the small and 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.390
 only motor racing cars 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.700
 they are in love with cars 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.790
 so far so good because you indicate that you are doing well too 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.580
 the defeat since Saturday 10 reaches 100 kilometers per hour with just as the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.849
 marches 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.179
 to hand redecard 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:16.389
 today pending will speak of the small motorcycle cars two tries of the 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:21.019
 motoring, the actor already pilots car models of more than 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.090
 fifteen years already participated in championships between dirty palm groves 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.789
 of the canasta I hear from hp 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:32.829
 I found it never worth it on a day of 2001 2002 I gave you first place in class 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:33.379
 B 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.379
 is what points the leg with a day 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.439
 will enter the motoring class you need to pay out 9 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.999
 eight hundred reais in motorsports 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.819
 and the maintenance of a delicate 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.940
 Look, it's more fuel lost, I do not think so. 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.309
 He's going to play sim. 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.730
 small part of that team lost 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.970
 but if every fuel the automobile fuel is only found in stores 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.609
 specialized 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.060
 high consumption 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.959
 is one of the six minutes are required 75mm 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.089
 This is his car control. 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.420
 that the direction 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.919
 You play to the right and to the left car. 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.629
 and here is the trigger we hear as an accelerator 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.839
 and you pull the trigger you accelerate 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.309
 A little bit of it you brake the cart 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.569
 there are different scales of automodelismo 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.059
 from 24 until today 25 but the most common scale is today the leaders of any 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.209
 if you shoot down is what i think is that dublin 05 to it 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.519
 about 100 kilometers with two walking marches with no more or less 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.979
 cameras that had to be moralistic put certainty 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.070
 knowledge in celestial mechanics 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.139
 was also three more pilots 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.199
 htc train here practiced by its capital 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.499
 in difficult Austria 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.170
 Ours said the gasoline trolley and of speech yes that yes 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.210
 I changed the annual goal 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.210
 but existed electrically 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.939
 if you are a pilot in the question if you are going to be a good pilot here 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.509
 look not always 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.929
 because here the sensitivity also errs quite large 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:11.849
 the control 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.279
 is different and socially responsible 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.379
 is automatic and can not be controlled 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.379
 with remote control distance 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.839
 here where you practice accidents happen as happens on the street 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.460
 I had an accident and even a crash. 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.460
 with 170 thousand and many induced 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.509
 quite the opposite of it here 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.550
 to the whole world 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.550
 Hold it fine here. 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.210
 of these 16 out of six goals gave total loss 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.210
 until today no 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.439
 It's not the best thing about practicing your best. 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.009
 if you work all week here on the same day 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.770
 and when you get here in the first classic among friends are and after that 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.000
 you'll have distracted the pilot head to mclaren said everyone talks 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.969
 so the competition of this thing is nothing more than the kind friendship of

 My Photo 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.849
