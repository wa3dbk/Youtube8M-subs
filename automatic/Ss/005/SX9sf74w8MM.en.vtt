00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the rest of my hair but if you're dyeing

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.860 
the rest of my hair but if you're dyeing
your<00:02:38.400> virgin<00:02:38.730> hair<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.300> very<00:02:39.480> first<00:02:39.690> time

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
your virgin hair for the very first time

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720 
your virgin hair for the very first time
you<00:02:40.230> want<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.440> start<00:02:40.800> with<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> ends<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.490> do

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
you want to start with the ends and do

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.570 
you want to start with the ends and do
the<00:02:41.850> roots<00:02:42.090> last<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.590> reason<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.130> is

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
the roots last the reason for that is

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.460 
the roots last the reason for that is
color<00:02:44.940> develops<00:02:45.420> faster<00:02:45.600> closer<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
color develops faster closer to the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.440 
color develops faster closer to the
scalp<00:02:46.770> because<00:02:46.920> there's<00:02:47.400> heat<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.330> do

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
scalp because there's heat so if you do

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.210 
scalp because there's heat so if you do
your<00:02:48.600> roots<00:02:48.810> first<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.290> your<00:02:49.410> hair<00:02:49.560> less<00:02:49.830> then

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
your roots first and your hair less then

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.740 
your roots first and your hair less then
you<00:02:50.370> might<00:02:50.520> end<00:02:50.700> up<00:02:50.850> with<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.300> really<00:02:51.510> bright

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
you might end up with a really bright

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.880 
you might end up with a really bright
color<00:02:51.810> at<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.410> top

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
color at the top

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.100 
color at the top
I<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:53.850> dye<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> color<00:02:54.900> is

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
I like this dye because the color is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.170 
I like this dye because the color is
really<00:02:55.320> forgiving<00:02:55.890> if<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.190> miss<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> spot<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:57.030> not

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
really forgiving if I miss a spot is not

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.300 
really forgiving if I miss a spot is not
going<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.600> look<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.870> noticeable<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.590> also

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
going to look that noticeable and also

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.800 
going to look that noticeable and also
when<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.490> hair<00:02:59.760> starts<00:03:00.090> growing<00:03:00.300> out<00:03:00.540> there

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
when my hair starts growing out there

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.480 
when my hair starts growing out there
isn't<00:03:01.110> going<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.380> be<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> drastic<00:03:01.950> contrast

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
isn't going to be a drastic contrast

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.370 
isn't going to be a drastic contrast
which<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.180> why<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.720> walk<00:03:03.959> around<00:03:04.140> with

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
which is why I can walk around with

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.750 
which is why I can walk around with
black<00:03:04.590> boots<00:03:04.770> for<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> while<00:03:05.220> before<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.580> do

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
black boots for a while before I do

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.150 
black boots for a while before I do
another<00:03:05.910> touch-up<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.650> here<00:03:07.830> I'm<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:07.950> doing

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
another touch-up so here I'm just doing

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.370 
another touch-up so here I'm just doing
the<00:03:08.400> top<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.760> my<00:03:08.880> roots<00:03:09.090> last<00:03:09.420> because<00:03:09.900> my<00:03:10.170> hair

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
the top of my roots last because my hair

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.110
