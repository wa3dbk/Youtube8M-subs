00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
khayru I think it's pronounced I looked

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.740 
khayru I think it's pronounced I looked
at<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.670> cards<00:00:36.940> from<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:37.120> last<00:00:37.329> time<00:00:37.540> so<00:00:37.719> I

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
at the cards from the last time so I

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.850 
at the cards from the last time so I
have<00:00:37.870> a<00:00:37.899> better<00:00:38.110> idea<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.800> what<00:00:39.190> these<00:00:39.370> are<00:00:40.860> but

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
have a better idea of what these are but

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.460 
have a better idea of what these are but
I<00:00:42.040> still<00:00:42.640> don't<00:00:42.820> know<00:00:42.879> how<00:00:43.059> to<00:00:43.120> work<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:43.570> one<00:00:44.379> of

magic for younger kids but it didn't

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.229 
magic for younger kids but it didn't
take<00:01:01.449> off<00:01:01.979> so<00:01:02.979> cuz<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:03.369> asked<00:01:03.729> if<00:01:03.820> this<00:01:04.000> was<00:01:04.210> a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
take off so cuz I asked if this was a

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.950 
take off so cuz I asked if this was a
popular<00:01:04.509> game<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.229> he<00:01:06.070> said<00:01:06.280> no<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:07.540> idea

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
popular game and he said no this idea

popular game and he said no this idea
didn't<00:01:08.259> take<00:01:08.409> off<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:09.520> maybe<00:01:09.729> that's<00:01:09.880> why<00:01:10.060> I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
didn't take off so maybe that's why I

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.520

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.620 
so we've got this thing here which opens
up<00:01:39.120> how<00:01:40.120> does<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.360> open<00:01:40.390> up<00:01:42.120> just<00:01:43.120> pops<00:01:43.390> open

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
up how does it open up just pops open

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.580 
up how does it open up just pops open
yeah<00:01:44.229> pops<00:01:44.920> open<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.630> gives<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.140> 3d

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
yeah pops open and it gives you this 3d

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.750 
yeah pops open and it gives you this 3d
card<00:01:47.860> which<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.700> how<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.299> play<00:01:50.520> card<00:01:51.520> on<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
card which is a how to play card on the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.030 
card which is a how to play card on the
back<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:53.549> mean<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.940> idea<00:01:55.479> is<00:01:55.720> really<00:01:55.990> cool<00:01:56.320> but

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
back I mean the idea is really cool but

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.330 
back I mean the idea is really cool but
I<00:01:57.070> guess<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.460> didn't<00:01:57.670> take<00:01:57.700> off<00:01:57.970> for<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.360> kids

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I guess it didn't take off for the kids

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.330 
I guess it didn't take off for the kids
the<00:02:00.340> idea<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:00.909> being<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.210> 3d<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:03.040> being

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
the idea of it being a 3d and then being

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.280 
the idea of it being a 3d and then being
able<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.729> put<00:02:03.970> cards<00:02:04.360> over<00:02:04.570> top<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:05.049> to<00:02:05.170> make

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
able to put cards over top of it to make

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.160 
able to put cards over top of it to make
them<00:02:05.470> shoot<00:02:05.799> flames<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.060> whatnot<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.960> is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
them shoot flames and whatnot this is

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.809 
them shoot flames and whatnot this is
part<00:02:08.409> of<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.560> battle<00:02:08.890> set<00:02:09.659> let's<00:02:10.659> see<00:02:10.780> here<00:02:11.819> it

part of the battle set let's see here it

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.059 
part of the battle set let's see here it
just<00:02:13.030> gives<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.330> an<00:02:13.450> idea<00:02:13.629> how<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.170> works<00:02:14.379> kind

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
just gives you an idea how it works kind

put these two sets together to show you
yeah<00:02:43.190> one<00:02:43.460> silver<00:02:43.910> ones<00:02:44.150> gold<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:46.040> apparently

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
yeah one silver ones gold so apparently

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.100 
yeah one silver ones gold so apparently
you<00:02:46.700> slide<00:02:47.180> them<00:02:47.360> in<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:49.810> Wow

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
you slide them in like this Wow

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.600 
you slide them in like this Wow
I<00:02:51.140> don't<00:02:51.500> want<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.680> stay<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:52.040> very<00:02:52.190> well<00:02:52.430> do

I don't want to stay in very well do

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.030 
I don't want to stay in very well do
they<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.950> they<00:02:55.700> become<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.030> set<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.830> guess

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
they and they become a set and I guess

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.900

one here these are battle cards see the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.560 
one here these are battle cards see the
idea<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.410> really<00:03:27.800> cool<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:29.240> had<00:03:29.390> these

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
idea is really cool you you had these

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.140 
idea is really cool you you had these
cool<00:03:29.960> little<00:03:29.990> figures<00:03:30.620> or<00:03:30.890> really<00:03:31.220> cool<00:03:31.490> cards

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
cool little figures or really cool cards

cool little figures or really cool cards
that<00:03:32.330> do<00:03:32.510> stuff<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:34.400> put<00:03:34.580> them<00:03:34.700> on<00:03:34.850> top<00:03:35.120> of

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
that do stuff and you put them on top of

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.800 
that do stuff and you put them on top of
see<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.310> looks<00:03:37.490> really<00:03:37.760> cool<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:38.210> like

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
see that that looks really cool I like

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.570 
see that that looks really cool I like
the<00:03:38.960> idea<00:03:39.380> it's<00:03:39.800> just<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.130> little<00:03:40.400> over

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
the idea it's just a little over

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:52.500 
the idea it's just a little over
complicated<00:03:45.370> these<00:03:46.370> are<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.760> power<00:03:47.390> cards

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:04.190 

and<00:03:53.510> then<00:03:53.659> you<00:03:53.780> got<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.049> characters

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.350 

yeah<00:04:06.510> she's<00:04:07.510> pretty<00:04:07.690> cool

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
yeah she's pretty cool

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.870 
yeah she's pretty cool
and<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.780> guess<00:04:10.990> if<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.430> she's<00:04:12.430> already<00:04:12.670> got<00:04:12.850> a

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
and I guess if you she's already got a

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.789 
and I guess if you she's already got a
power<00:04:13.150> going<00:04:13.830> but<00:04:14.830> you<00:04:15.190> put<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.430> card<00:04:15.820> over<00:04:16.060> top

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
power going but you put a card over top

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.650 
power going but you put a card over top
and<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:18.459> looks<00:04:18.609> like<00:04:18.700> she's<00:04:19.000> doing<00:04:19.180> something

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
and it looks like she's doing something

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.990 
and it looks like she's doing something
else<00:04:19.870> with<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:21.330> was<00:04:22.330> just<00:04:22.540> kind<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.780> cool

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
else with it was just kind of cool

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.070 
else with it was just kind of cool
same<00:04:25.000> thing<00:04:25.240> with<00:04:25.420> maybe<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:26.320> guy<00:04:26.530> here<00:04:28.080> put

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
same thing with maybe this guy here put

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.690 
same thing with maybe this guy here put
this<00:04:29.230> right<00:04:29.440> here<00:04:29.500> it<00:04:29.950> looks<00:04:30.160> like<00:04:30.250> he's<00:04:30.490> got<00:04:30.640> a

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
this right here it looks like he's got a

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.570 
this right here it looks like he's got a
power<00:04:30.970> shot<00:04:31.360> or<00:04:31.540> a<00:04:32.100> energy<00:04:33.100> blast<00:04:35.310> coming<00:04:36.310> from

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
power shot or a energy blast coming from

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:44.700 
power shot or a energy blast coming from
his<00:04:36.760> arm<00:04:37.060> or<00:04:37.360> being<00:04:41.790> directed<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:43.390> know<00:04:43.710> taken

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
his arm or being directed you know taken

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.360 
his arm or being directed you know taken
out<00:04:45.960> so<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.080> idea<00:04:47.530> is<00:04:47.680> pretty<00:04:47.920> cool<00:04:48.190> with

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
out so the idea is pretty cool with

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.040 
out so the idea is pretty cool with
these<00:04:49.140> but<00:04:50.140> what<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:51.370> commenter<00:04:51.850> said<00:04:52.150> that

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
these but what I the commenter said that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.150 
these but what I the commenter said that
it<00:04:53.170> didn't<00:04:53.410> stick<00:04:53.590> around

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
it didn't stick around

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.840 
it didn't stick around
I<00:04:54.630> guess<00:04:55.630> they<00:04:55.780> go<00:04:55.960> in<00:04:56.110> here<00:04:56.550> they<00:04:57.550> set<00:04:57.820> down

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
I guess they go in here they set down

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.790 
I guess they go in here they set down
here<00:04:58.419> or<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:58.960> thought<00:04:59.169> put<00:04:59.440> them<00:04:59.530> in<00:04:59.620> here<00:04:59.770> I

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800

you<00:05:59.719> got<00:05:59.839> characters<00:06:00.409> you<00:06:01.249> can<00:06:01.430> use<00:06:01.610> them<00:06:01.819> with

00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:04.119 

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:10.929 

froze<00:06:05.119> up<00:06:05.389> frozen<00:06:05.749> oak<00:06:06.110> hairier<00:06:09.759> Ziggy<00:06:10.759> loss

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
froze up frozen oak hairier Ziggy loss

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:13.659 
froze up frozen oak hairier Ziggy loss
loose<00:06:11.539> they<00:06:12.469> got<00:06:12.619> names<00:06:12.830> Kenyon<00:06:13.309> pronounced

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
loose they got names Kenyon pronounced

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.570 
loose they got names Kenyon pronounced
like<00:06:14.509> you<00:06:14.659> say<00:06:14.839> you<00:06:15.110> could<00:06:15.259> pick<00:06:15.469> up<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:16.339> sea

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
like you say you could pick up the sea

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.739 
like you say you could pick up the sea
so<00:06:17.300> Ike

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:17.749 
so Ike

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:20.829 
so Ike
seismic<00:06:18.289> way<00:06:19.099> shake<00:06:19.699> or<00:06:19.969> quake<00:06:20.360> or<00:06:20.599> whatever

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:20.839 
seismic way shake or quake or whatever

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:21.219 
seismic way shake or quake or whatever
this<00:06:20.990> is

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
this is

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.010 
this is
shake<00:06:22.119> makes<00:06:23.119> it<00:06:23.240> look<00:06:23.419> like<00:06:23.449> he's<00:06:23.779> hitting

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
shake makes it look like he's hitting

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.809 
shake makes it look like he's hitting
the<00:06:24.319> ground<00:06:25.899> maybe<00:06:26.899> he's<00:06:27.319> doing<00:06:27.649> no<00:06:28.550> it

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
the ground maybe he's doing no it

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.929 
the ground maybe he's doing no it
doesn't<00:06:29.180> work<00:06:30.099> let's<00:06:31.099> see<00:06:31.249> maybe<00:06:31.430> he's<00:06:31.729> just

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:31.939 
doesn't work let's see maybe he's just

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:36.760 
doesn't work let's see maybe he's just
got<00:06:32.360> this<00:06:32.779> going<00:06:33.169> on<00:06:35.050> so<00:06:36.050> that's<00:06:36.499> how<00:06:36.649> it

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
got this going on so that's how it

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.999 
got this going on so that's how it
usually<00:06:36.979> works<00:06:37.459> I<00:06:37.669> guess<00:06:37.699> you<00:06:38.800> actually<00:06:39.800> don't

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
usually works I guess you actually don't

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.360 
usually works I guess you actually don't
know<00:06:40.339> I<00:06:40.749> like<00:06:41.749> the<00:06:41.899> idea<00:06:41.930> the<00:06:42.770> cars<00:06:43.069> are<00:06:43.249> really

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
know I like the idea the cars are really

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.619 
know I like the idea the cars are really
cool<00:06:43.729> they're<00:06:44.240> very<00:06:44.779> well<00:06:45.019> made<00:06:45.789> the<00:06:46.789> 3d<00:06:47.240> part

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629 
cool they're very well made the 3d part

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.850 
cool they're very well made the 3d part
of<00:06:47.779> it<00:06:47.930> is<00:06:48.050> cool<00:06:48.349> the<00:06:49.959> the<00:06:50.959> ridges<00:06:51.439> to<00:06:51.620> make<00:06:51.769> it

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
of it is cool the the ridges to make it

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.619 
of it is cool the the ridges to make it
look<00:06:52.009> like<00:06:52.129> they're<00:06:52.370> moving<00:06:52.699> it's<00:06:53.360> pretty

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:53.629 
look like they're moving it's pretty

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:57.489 
look like they're moving it's pretty
cool<00:06:53.979> so<00:06:54.979> the<00:06:55.099> idea<00:06:55.639> is<00:06:55.699> good<00:06:56.180> but<00:06:57.019> apparently

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:57.499 
cool so the idea is good but apparently

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:01.899 
cool so the idea is good but apparently
just<00:06:57.860> it<00:06:58.129> just<00:06:58.370> didn't<00:06:58.639> take<00:06:58.849> off<00:07:00.729> but<00:07:01.729> hey

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:01.909 
just it just didn't take off but hey

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:04.360 
just it just didn't take off but hey
what<00:07:02.330> are<00:07:02.360> you<00:07:02.479> gonna<00:07:02.599> do<00:07:02.889> that's<00:07:03.889> the<00:07:04.129> brakes

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
what are you gonna do that's the brakes

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.459 
what are you gonna do that's the brakes
you<00:07:04.550> come<00:07:04.699> out<00:07:04.819> on<00:07:04.969> a<00:07:04.999> new<00:07:05.209> game<00:07:05.719> trying<00:07:06.379> to

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:06.469
