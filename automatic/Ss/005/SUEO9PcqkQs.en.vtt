for<00:01:14.490> amateur<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.840> amateurs<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.560> are

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
for amateur you know amateurs that are

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.999 
for amateur you know amateurs that are
advanced<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.659> advanced<00:01:19.229> probably

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
advanced you know just advanced probably

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.520 
advanced you know just advanced probably
not<00:01:20.130> professional<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.509> get<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> point

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
not professional but you get the point

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.030 
not professional but you get the point
I<00:01:22.560> guess<00:01:23.780> background<00:01:24.780> noise<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.380> virtually

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
I guess background noise is virtually

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.710 
I guess background noise is virtually
non-existent<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.150> hear<00:01:27.390> I'll<00:01:27.570> be

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
non-existent as you can hear I'll be

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.999 
non-existent as you can hear I'll be
quiet<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> second<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:30.170> most<00:01:31.170> mics<00:01:31.560> don't

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
quiet for a second here most mics don't

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.810 
quiet for a second here most mics don't
have<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.460> level<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.060> voice<00:01:33.810> filtering<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
have that level of voice filtering and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.219 
have that level of voice filtering and
sort<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.000> talking<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.840> loud<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> think

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
sort of I'm talking kind of loud I think

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.810 
sort of I'm talking kind of loud I think
I'm<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.650> pretty<00:01:37.950> close<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> mic<00:01:38.670> in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
I'm actually pretty close to the mic in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
I'm actually pretty close to the mic in
this<00:01:38.939> video<00:01:39.210> I'll<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> bit<00:01:40.530> too<00:01:40.799> more

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
this video I'll get a bit too more

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.819 
this video I'll get a bit too more
medium<00:01:41.610> range<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> also<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
medium range and you know this is also a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.940 
medium range and you know this is also a
good<00:01:43.979> example<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> show<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.909> how<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:46.079> mic

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
good example to show of how the mic

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.170 
good example to show of how the mic
dilutes<00:01:47.490> sound<00:01:47.850> through<00:01:48.799> length<00:01:50.180> distance

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
dilutes sound through length distance

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.870 
dilutes sound through length distance
and<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.409> even<00:01:52.649> farther<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.399> farther

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and as I get even farther and farther

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.480 
and as I get even farther and farther
and<00:01:54.270> farther<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.229> further<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and farther and further I think it's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.539 
and farther and further I think it's
actually<00:01:56.610> further<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:58.619> hear<00:01:58.950> me<00:01:59.100> less<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
actually further you hear me less and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.600 
actually further you hear me less and
