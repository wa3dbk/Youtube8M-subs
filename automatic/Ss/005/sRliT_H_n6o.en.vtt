00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.910
 every morning millions of muscovites rush 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.309
 to hide behind the door wall window 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.469
 handrails inside the subway car 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.780
 familiar every detail is hard to imagine 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 that once it all looked different 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 see what were the first subway cars 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.960
 and again find themselves in the compositions are wrong 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.769
 long gone from the lines can be at the station 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.539
 partisan 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.090
 Today there was an exhibition of retro 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 wagons pride exhibition legendary 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 wagons of class namely such trains 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.260
 first appeared on the line of the Moscow metro 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.649
 80 years ago wondering if they would like it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.150
 modern passengers it is quite 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 comfortable option 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.080
 which are not considered soft chairs 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.379
 It is clear that they are made of 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.390
 variable 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.570
 insanely comfortable light natural tones 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.149
 materials would be desirable 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.760
 see modern in modern few 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.660
 wagons 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.120
 seals of the past good days these cars 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.460
 but some were equipped for storage 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.009
 some were quality wagons 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.430
 simulators which are easy to 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.310
 spare ways you have a very different plan 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.170
 historical research with veterans 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.930
 talked historical pictures 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.619
 plan and selection so to say light 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.180
 wagons and prehistoric photographs themselves 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.490
 veterans subway warmth and 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.649
 considering exposure many started 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.690
 working life with such cars and 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.729
 even today the rolling stock continues 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.979
 develop for the better for example in 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.899
 braking distance has decreased but old 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.899
 wagons for them are of particular value 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 a little complexity what control 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.340
 brakes 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.110
 And so in general, then logan are not bad 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.970
 design was designed outfit was taken for 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.300
 and already from the existing metro cars 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.570
 foreign samples that's why but all 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.700
 anyway 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.649
 nostalgia which besides passenger 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.870
 retro wagons on display are presented and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.270
 official service is the oldest track gauge 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.520
 released since the 50s of the last century 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.470
 and here is a battery contact electro 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.600
 There is still a total immersion in 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.400
 history would be impossible without staff 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.390
 uniforms for subway workers 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.010
 last century 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.440
 historical costumes were totally 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.510
 specially for the anniversary of the subway with precision 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.370
 down to the smallest detail since it 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.470
 railway started button 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.470
 rail sample like today 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.750
 this is a crossed wrench and a hammer 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.450
 worn especially and rail with 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.590
 green piping and epaulettes, and especially the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.420
 only the railway workers and 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.130
 metros were such stars a 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.520
 civilian belonging to different 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.930
 communication services such as machinists to 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.270
 administrative service was designated here 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.860
 these emblems Komi in where the train on me 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.590
 for example glad 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.750
 This is a time of reconstruction. 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.580
 plunge into the past of the Moscow metro 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.560
 can every passenger exhibition 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.560
