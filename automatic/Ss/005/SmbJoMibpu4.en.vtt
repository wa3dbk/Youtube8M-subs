00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
this particular LED now the reason I'm

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
this particular LED now the reason I'm
finagling<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.420> room<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.989> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
feature which allows the lens to be

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.240 
feature which allows the lens to be
moved<00:00:57.360> forward<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:59.750> there<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.250> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
moved forward and there you have the

moved forward and there you have the
tight<00:01:02.699> focus<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> tight

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
tight focus and as you see the tight

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.590 
tight focus and as you see the tight
focus<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:06.200> really<00:01:07.200> quite<00:01:08.070> tight<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.909> you're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
focus is really quite tight and you're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.840 
focus is really quite tight and you're
actually<00:01:09.750> looking<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.799> wrecked<00:01:11.130> at

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
actually looking at that wrecked at

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
actually looking at that wrecked at
those<00:01:12.420> rectangles<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> overall<00:01:13.619> square

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
those rectangles in the overall square

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
those rectangles in the overall square
shape<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.369> actually<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.970> circuit<00:01:15.450> board<00:01:15.689> for

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
shape is actually the circuit board for

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.010 
shape is actually the circuit board for
the<00:01:16.799> LED<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.460> question<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.479> kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> makes<00:01:18.960> me

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the LED in question it kind of makes me

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
the LED in question it kind of makes me
smile<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.680> could<00:01:19.740> actually<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> shape

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
smile you could actually see the shape

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.910 
smile you could actually see the shape
of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> circuit<00:01:21.840> board<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> light<00:01:22.560> itself

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
of the circuit board in the light itself

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
of the circuit board in the light itself
if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> pull<00:01:23.850> back<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:26.700> goes<00:01:26.970> into<00:01:27.240> flood<00:01:27.659> mode

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
if you pull back it goes into flood mode

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
if you pull back it goes into flood mode
again<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.320> mean<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.340> an<00:01:29.610> exact

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
again I mean this is not an exact

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
again I mean this is not an exact
process<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.140> can't<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.530> lock<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.040> in

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
process and you can't really lock it in

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.130 
process and you can't really lock it in
place<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.119> very<00:01:33.180> much<00:01:33.720> something<00:01:34.049> you're

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
place it is very much something you're

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.060 
place it is very much something you're
gonna<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:36.000> fingers<00:01:37.070> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
gonna have to do with your fingers to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
gonna have to do with your fingers to
hold<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.400> place<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> nice

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
hold it in place but it is a nice

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
hold it in place but it is a nice
feature<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.860> works<00:01:41.130> remarkably<00:01:41.340> well<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
feature and it works remarkably well I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510 
feature and it works remarkably well I
mean<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.710> tight<00:01:43.950> feet<00:01:44.220> tight

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
mean that is that's a tight feet tight

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.300 
mean that is that's a tight feet tight
focus<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.990> again<00:01:46.259> you've<00:01:47.070> got

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
focus right there and again you've got

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.440 
focus right there and again you've got
some<00:01:47.549> some<00:01:48.180> nice<00:01:49.549> flooding<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
some some nice flooding in that in that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.950 
some some nice flooding in that in that
regard<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:52.829> quite<00:01:53.009> cool<00:01:53.960> now

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.090 
think they missed an opportunity here
this<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> smooth<00:03:58.290> button<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:58.920> think

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
this is a smooth button and I think

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.380 
this is a smooth button and I think
would've<00:03:59.250> been<00:03:59.340> superior<00:03:59.880> if<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.060> had<00:04:00.210> some

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
would've been superior if it had some

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.420 
would've been superior if it had some
kind<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.600> texturing<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.830> think<00:04:02.070> they<00:04:02.190> also

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
kind of texturing and I think they also

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.370 
kind of texturing and I think they also
would<00:04:02.730> have<00:04:02.850> done<00:04:03.000> better<00:04:03.450> off<00:04:03.750> if<00:04:04.050> they<00:04:04.230> had

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
would have done better off if they had

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.080 
would have done better off if they had
made<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:04.770> from<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.010> material<00:04:05.460> that<00:04:05.610> was

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
made this from a material that was

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.160 
made this from a material that was
glow-in-the-dark

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
glow-in-the-dark

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.810 
glow-in-the-dark
it's<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.950> mist<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.430> know<00:04:08.520> it's<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.670> missed

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
it's a mist you know it's a missed

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.210 
it's a mist you know it's a missed
opportunity<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.810> know<00:04:10.220> nothing's

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
opportunity but you know nothing's

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.660 
opportunity but you know nothing's
perfect

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
perfect

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.370 
perfect
now<00:04:12.510> as<00:04:12.840> far<00:04:13.050> as<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.150> know<00:04:15.380> the

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
now as far as is this you know the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.280 
now as far as is this you know the
perfect<00:04:16.970> EDC<00:04:17.970> flashlight<00:04:18.420> no<00:04:18.570> no<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.020> is<00:04:19.140> not

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
perfect EDC flashlight no no it is not

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.440 
perfect EDC flashlight no no it is not
because<00:04:19.590> while<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.950> can<00:04:20.100> make<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.299> can

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
because while you can make this you can

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.990 
because while you can make this you can
easily<00:04:21.780> do<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.109> with<00:04:22.230> one<00:04:22.410> hand<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.850> can

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
easily do that with one hand and you can

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.780 
easily do that with one hand and you can
easily<00:04:24.150> hold<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.919> like<00:04:25.919> this

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
easily hold it like this

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.910 
easily hold it like this
or<00:04:27.570> if<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.650> prefer<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.190> finger<00:04:29.850> method<00:04:30.920> very

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
or if you prefer the finger method very

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.030 
or if you prefer the finger method very
comfortable<00:04:33.080> can't<00:04:34.080> hold<00:04:34.350> this<00:04:34.470> in<00:04:34.650> any

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
comfortable can't hold this in any

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.370 
comfortable can't hold this in any
position<00:04:35.450> let<00:04:36.450> go<00:04:36.600> but<00:04:36.780> as<00:04:36.900> soon<00:04:37.020> as<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.200> touch

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
position let go but as soon as you touch

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.530 
position let go but as soon as you touch
it<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.710> gonna<00:04:37.830> move<00:04:38.070> again<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:38.550> that's<00:04:39.390> a

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
it it's gonna move again so that's a

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.310 
it it's gonna move again so that's a
little<00:04:39.750> product<00:04:40.200> pop<00:04:41.390> problematic<00:04:42.390> is<00:04:42.810> it's

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
little product pop problematic is it's

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.230 
little product pop problematic is it's
just<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:44.190> know<00:04:44.280> aluminum<00:04:44.730> on<00:04:44.820> aluminum

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
just you know aluminum on aluminum

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.120 
just you know aluminum on aluminum
friction<00:04:46.230> there<00:04:46.410> so<00:04:46.650> there's<00:04:46.830> no<00:04:46.950> way<00:04:47.070> to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
friction there so there's no way to

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.610 
friction there so there's no way to
really<00:04:47.280> set<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:47.820> in<00:04:47.940> place<00:04:48.170> maybe<00:04:49.170> you<00:04:49.440> could

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
really set it in place maybe you could

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.990 
really set it in place maybe you could
get<00:04:49.740> some<00:04:49.950> tape<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.340> there<00:04:50.490> or<00:04:50.580> something<00:04:50.760> and

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
get some tape in there or something and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.160 
get some tape in there or something and
tighten<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.270> up<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.480> little<00:04:51.570> I'm<00:04:51.810> not<00:04:51.840> sure

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
tighten that up a little I'm not sure

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.260 
tighten that up a little I'm not sure
it's<00:04:52.350> really<00:04:52.710> it's<00:04:53.010> really<00:04:53.370> really<00:04:53.610> tight<00:04:53.760> as

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
it's really it's really really tight as

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
it's really it's really really tight as
far<00:04:54.510> as<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:54.690> don't<00:04:54.840> think<00:04:54.960> there's<00:04:55.080> a<00:04:55.110> lot<00:04:55.230> of

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
far as I don't think there's a lot of

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.860 
far as I don't think there's a lot of
space<00:04:55.470> in<00:04:55.530> there<00:04:55.860> maybe<00:04:56.580> one<00:04:56.910> layer<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.420> nylon

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
space in there maybe one layer of nylon

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.480 
space in there maybe one layer of nylon
tape<00:04:58.110> might<00:04:58.320> do<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.500> teflon<00:04:59.010> tape<00:04:59.130> or<00:04:59.280> something

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
tape might do a teflon tape or something

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.720 
tape might do a teflon tape or something
like<00:04:59.550> that<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:01.770> thing<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.160> don't<00:05:02.220> like<00:05:02.610> about

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
like that the thing I don't like about

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.450 
like that the thing I don't like about
this<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.300> this<00:05:03.630> right<00:05:04.110> here<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:04.950> what<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:05.280> have

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
this is this right here is what you have

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.760 
this is this right here is what you have
to<00:05:05.610> remove<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.900> get<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.110> battery<00:05:07.380> in<00:05:07.560> and

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
to remove to get the battery in and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.400 
to remove to get the battery in and
there<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.220> no<00:05:08.910> texturing<00:05:09.510> on<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:10.260> can

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
there is no texturing on this you can

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.020 
there is no texturing on this you can
grab<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.860> turn<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.190> but<00:05:11.370> it's<00:05:11.490> not<00:05:11.760> easy

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
grab it and turn it but it's not easy

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.640 
grab it and turn it but it's not easy
you<00:05:12.210> really<00:05:12.630> have<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.870> reef<00:05:13.110> on<00:05:13.290> it<00:05:13.410> to<00:05:13.500> get<00:05:13.590> it

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
you really have to reef on it to get it

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.070 
you really have to reef on it to get it
look<00:05:13.890> at<00:05:14.040> it<00:05:14.070> moving<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:15.390> I<00:05:15.480> would<00:05:15.660> prefer<00:05:15.810> if

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
look at it moving and I would prefer if

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.520 
look at it moving and I would prefer if
it<00:05:16.200> were<00:05:16.320> a<00:05:16.380> little<00:05:16.500> tighter<00:05:16.830> than<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:17.850> is<00:05:18.530> it's

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
it were a little tighter than it is it's

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.750 
it were a little tighter than it is it's
just<00:05:19.890> it's<00:05:20.220> kind<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.640> awkward<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:25.580> there<00:05:26.580> is

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
just it's kind of awkward and there is

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.840 
just it's kind of awkward and there is
an<00:05:26.910> o-ring<00:05:27.060> which<00:05:27.600> is<00:05:27.720> nice<00:05:28.340> again<00:05:29.340> single

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
an o-ring which is nice again single

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.980 
an o-ring which is nice again single
double<00:05:30.840> a<00:05:30.870> battery<00:05:31.670> spring<00:05:32.670> in<00:05:33.180> here<00:05:33.540> but<00:05:33.840> it's

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
double a battery spring in here but it's

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.230 
double a battery spring in here but it's
it's<00:05:34.560> kind<00:05:34.980> of<00:05:35.040> awkward<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:35.520> get<00:05:35.730> it<00:05:35.880> going

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
it's kind of awkward to get it going

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.000 
it's kind of awkward to get it going
because<00:05:36.560> there<00:05:37.560> we<00:05:37.680> go

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
because there we go

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.730 
because there we go
because<00:05:38.850> it's<00:05:39.030> it's<00:05:39.390> got<00:05:39.870> no<00:05:40.050> knurlings<00:05:40.590> and

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
because it's it's got no knurlings and

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.350 
because it's it's got no knurlings and
that's<00:05:40.950> the<00:05:41.100> one<00:05:41.280> place<00:05:41.490> that<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.880> think<00:05:42.000> you

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
that's the one place that I think you

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.300 
that's the one place that I think you
should<00:05:42.600> have<00:05:42.690> had<00:05:42.900> some<00:05:43.320> kind<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:43.770> texturing

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
should have had some kind of texturing

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.310 
should have had some kind of texturing
even<00:05:45.120> some<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.390> this<00:05:45.510> type<00:05:45.750> of<00:05:45.780> texturing

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
even some of this type of texturing

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.540 
even some of this type of texturing
right<00:05:46.440> there<00:05:46.680> which<00:05:46.890> they<00:05:47.070> obviously<00:05:47.460> they

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
right there which they obviously they

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.040 
right there which they obviously they
had<00:05:47.670> a<00:05:47.700> technology<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.240> do<00:05:48.390> it<00:05:48.420> they<00:05:48.840> could

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
had a technology to do it they could

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.930 
had a technology to do it they could
have<00:05:49.140> put<00:05:49.290> them<00:05:49.470> there<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.800> made<00:05:50.340> your<00:05:50.580> life<00:05:50.640> a

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
have put them there and made your life a

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.550 
have put them there and made your life a
little<00:05:51.120> easier<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:52.050> has<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.230> bunch<00:05:52.410> of

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
little easier it has a bunch of

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.690 
little easier it has a bunch of
extraneous<00:05:54.950> flutings<00:05:55.950> here<00:05:56.250> which<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.640> don't

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
extraneous flutings here which I don't

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.920 
extraneous flutings here which I don't
think<00:05:56.850> they<00:05:57.000> like<00:05:57.150> do<00:05:57.270> anything<00:05:57.600> this<00:05:57.690> isn't

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
think they like do anything this isn't

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.660 
think they like do anything this isn't
that<00:05:58.080> generate<00:05:58.380> enough<00:05:58.530> heat<00:05:58.560> really<00:05:59.250> require

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
that generate enough heat really require

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.630 
that generate enough heat really require
the<00:06:00.390> cooling<00:06:00.780> fins<00:06:00.960> but<00:06:01.740> I<00:06:01.920> mean<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.280> paid<00:06:02.460> like

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
the cooling fins but I mean I paid like

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.790 
the cooling fins but I mean I paid like
eight<00:06:02.880> bucks<00:06:03.120> for<00:06:03.420> this<00:06:03.540> so<00:06:03.990> I<00:06:04.320> think<00:06:04.560> it<00:06:04.710> was

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
eight bucks for this so I think it was

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.790 
eight bucks for this so I think it was
well<00:06:04.950> worth<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:06.030> cost<00:06:06.510> I<00:06:07.050> think<00:06:07.500> it's<00:06:07.590> a<00:06:07.650> cool

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
well worth the cost I think it's a cool

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.870 
well worth the cost I think it's a cool
little<00:06:07.920> flashlight<00:06:08.430> and<00:06:08.580> it's<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:08.790> one

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
little flashlight and it's the one

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.220 
little flashlight and it's the one
that's<00:06:09.060> sitting<00:06:09.180> on<00:06:09.330> my<00:06:09.450> desk<00:06:09.690> at<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:09.930> moment

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
that's sitting on my desk at the moment

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.090 
that's sitting on my desk at the moment
as<00:06:11.690> like<00:06:12.690> then<00:06:13.020> I<00:06:13.140> reach<00:06:13.410> for<00:06:13.440> when<00:06:13.830> I<00:06:13.920> need<00:06:14.070> to

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
as like then I reach for when I need to

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.730 
as like then I reach for when I need to
use<00:06:14.280> something
