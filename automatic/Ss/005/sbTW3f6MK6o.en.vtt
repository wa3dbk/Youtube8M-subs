hello<00:00:01.140> everyone<00:00:01.350> it's<00:00:01.439> been<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.680> while<00:00:01.890> since<00:00:02.129> I

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hello everyone it's been a while since I

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.300 
hello everyone it's been a while since I
recorded<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.939> video<00:00:03.360> so<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.929> thought<00:00:04.170> I'd<00:00:04.319> do<00:00:05.040> one

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
recorded a video so I thought I'd do one

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.240 
recorded a video so I thought I'd do one
on<00:00:05.549> some<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.690> nutritional<00:00:07.290> strategies

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
on some of the nutritional strategies

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.650 
on some of the nutritional strategies
that<00:00:08.400> athletes<00:00:08.820> use<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.330> try<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.540> improve

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
that athletes use to try and improve

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.799 
that athletes use to try and improve
their<00:00:10.080> performance<00:00:10.200> now<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.190> them<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.809> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
their performance now one of them is the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.400 
their performance now one of them is the
use<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.790> carbohydrate<00:00:14.790> gels<00:00:15.210> now<00:00:15.599> essentially

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
use of carbohydrate gels now essentially

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.340 
use of carbohydrate gels now essentially
what<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.970> pure<00:00:18.240> carbohydrates<00:00:19.199> in

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
what this is it is pure carbohydrates in

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.490 
what this is it is pure carbohydrates in
a<00:00:19.410> concentrated<00:00:20.070> form<00:00:20.570> basically<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.869> gel<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a concentrated form basically a gel and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.099 
a concentrated form basically a gel and
the<00:00:22.590> idea<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.490> eat<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.960> get

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the idea is that you eat it and you get

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
the idea is that you eat it and you get
a<00:00:25.140> massive<00:00:25.680> intake<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.810> carbohydrates<00:00:28.730> what

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
a massive intake of carbohydrates what

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.279 
a massive intake of carbohydrates what
you<00:00:29.849> need<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.240> however<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you need to do however is you need to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.290 
you need to do however is you need to
consume<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.890> water<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.969> don't

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
consume it with water so if you don't

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.209 
consume it with water so if you don't
then<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.290> slow<00:00:34.710> down<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
then you actually really slow down the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.690 
then you actually really slow down the
the<00:00:35.610> release<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:37.040> glucose<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.550> your

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the release of the glucose into your

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610 
the release of the glucose into your
muscles<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> makes<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> much<00:00:40.170> harder<00:00:40.230> for

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
muscles and it makes it much harder for

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.970 
muscles and it makes it much harder for
it<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.950> digest<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:42.629> benefits<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.649> needs<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it to digest so for benefits it needs to

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.459 
it to digest so for benefits it needs to
be<00:00:44.100> consumed<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:44.670> water<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> whole

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
be consumed with water and and the whole

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.380 
be consumed with water and and the whole
reason<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:46.920> people<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.820> they

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
reason that people do it is is they

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.430 
reason that people do it is is they
could<00:00:48.539> actually<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.379> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
could actually get in a lot of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.130 
could actually get in a lot of
carbohydrates<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.399> quickly<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:51.989> can

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
carbohydrates very quickly and they can

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680 
carbohydrates very quickly and they can
do<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> easily<00:00:52.500> while<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.329> obviously<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
do it easily while they obviously a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.930 
do it easily while they obviously a
riding<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.280> had<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> carry<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
riding or so on if you had to carry the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.330 
riding or so on if you had to carry the
equivalent<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.680> something<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.800> Gatorade

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
equivalent in something like Gatorade

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.330 
equivalent in something like Gatorade
then<00:00:59.760> you'd<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> carry<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> lot<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> them

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
then you'd have to carry a lot of them

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.979 
then you'd have to carry a lot of them
so<00:01:02.340> obviously<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.149> an<00:01:03.270> advantage<00:01:03.510> for

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so obviously it's an advantage for

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.410 
so obviously it's an advantage for
people<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.729> people<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> Tour<00:01:06.030> de<00:01:06.150> France

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
people like people in the Tour de France

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.960 
people like people in the Tour de France
or<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:08.010> they've<00:01:08.189> they<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.760> carry

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
or so on where they've they can carry

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.570 
or so on where they've they can carry
these<00:01:09.210> small<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.689> gels<00:01:10.220> quickly<00:01:11.220> eat<00:01:11.400> it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
these small little gels quickly eat it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.530 
these small little gels quickly eat it
get<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> massive<00:01:12.360> instant<00:01:13.290> boost<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.040> energy

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
get a massive instant boost of energy

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.050 
get a massive instant boost of energy
because<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.840> high<00:01:16.020> GI<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.939> know

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
because they are high GI and you know

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
because they are high GI and you know
obviously<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.570> able<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.500> exercise<00:01:20.009> for

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
obviously be able to to exercise for

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.780 
obviously be able to to exercise for
extended<00:01:20.640> periods<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.939> time<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.020> useful<00:01:22.950> in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
extended periods of time it is useful in

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
extended periods of time it is useful in
sports<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.990> higher<00:01:25.350> duration<00:01:25.920> of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
sports that have a higher duration of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
sports that have a higher duration of
greater<00:01:26.310> than<00:01:26.520> an<00:01:26.610> hour<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
greater than an hour and it is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.020 
greater than an hour and it is
absolutely<00:01:28.220> beneficial<00:01:29.220> you're<00:01:29.579> mean<00:01:29.700> sorry

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
absolutely beneficial you're mean sorry

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.840 
absolutely beneficial you're mean sorry
detrimental<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> consume<00:01:32.700> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
detrimental that you have to consume it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.670 
detrimental that you have to consume it
with<00:01:33.060> water<00:01:33.420> without<00:01:33.750> water<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
with water without water it's going to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.020 
with water without water it's going to
really<00:01:34.950> impact<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> speed<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:36.780> it's

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
really impact on the speed at which it's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.310 
really impact on the speed at which it's
consumed<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> readily<00:01:39.810> absorbed<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.229> the

consumed and readily absorbed in the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.100 
consumed and readily absorbed in the
body<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.280> goal<00:01:41.640> however<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.509> remain

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
body if your goal however is to remain

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.030 
body if your goal however is to remain
hydrated<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.460> by<00:01:45.180> keeping<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.320> fluid<00:01:46.740> levels

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
hydrated so by keeping your fluid levels

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.410 
hydrated so by keeping your fluid levels
high<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.610> exercising<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
high because you're exercising in a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.539 
high because you're exercising in a
humid<00:01:48.810> environment<00:01:48.899> you're<00:01:49.530> sweating<00:01:50.040> lots<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
humid environment you're sweating lots a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
humid environment you're sweating lots a
power<00:01:51.299> gel<00:01:51.600> isn't<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
power gel isn't going to be all that

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.670 
power gel isn't going to be all that
useful<00:01:53.090> because<00:01:54.170> you're<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.380> losing

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
useful because you're going be losing

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.109
