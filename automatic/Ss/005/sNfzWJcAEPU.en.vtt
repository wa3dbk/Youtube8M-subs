00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
of this type of suspension are twofold

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
of this type of suspension are twofold
one<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.590> saves<00:00:55.920> space<00:00:56.239> because<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.270> don't

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
one is it saves space because you don't

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.540 
one is it saves space because you don't
have<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> traditional<00:00:58.469> coil<00:00:58.829> over<00:00:59.219> shock

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
have the traditional coil over shock

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.209 
have the traditional coil over shock
tower<00:00:59.969> which<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.079> would<00:01:01.230> normally<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.920> able

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
tower which you would normally be able

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.660 
tower which you would normally be able
to<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.989> right<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.439> don't<00:01:04.920> exist

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
to see right here don't exist

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
to see right here don't exist
it<00:01:05.760> makes<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.810> suspension<00:01:07.380> itself<00:01:07.770> smaller

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it makes the suspension itself smaller

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
it makes the suspension itself smaller
and<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:09.420> turn<00:01:11.000> reduces<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.450> amount<00:01:12.659> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and in turn reduces the amount of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
and in turn reduces the amount of
intrusion<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> trunk<00:01:14.299> which<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> see

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
intrusion in the trunk which you can see

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
intrusion in the trunk which you can see
right<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.380> there's<00:01:16.590> no<00:01:17.090> towers<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
right here because there's no towers in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.640 
right here because there's no towers in
the<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.840> trunk<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.229> actually<00:01:19.500> pretty

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the way the trunk is actually pretty

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.760

has a controlled labor suspension which

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.200 
has a controlled labor suspension which
actually<00:01:34.200> looks<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.009> car<00:01:35.310> except

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
actually looks just like this car except

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.999 
actually looks just like this car except
you<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.110> differential<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

advantage of this type of suspension is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.679 
advantage of this type of suspension is
it<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:55.290> isolates<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.430> ride<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.060> handling

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
it is it isolates the ride and handling

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.709 
it is it isolates the ride and handling
components<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> suspension<00:01:59.430> in<00:02:00.360> order

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
strut tower but it also maintains the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.870 
strut tower but it also maintains the
handling<00:02:14.239> properties<00:02:15.069> now<00:02:16.069> there's<00:02:16.520> two<00:02:16.849> ways

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
handling properties now there's two ways

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.720 
handling properties now there's two ways
to<00:02:17.090> make<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> control<00:02:17.930> blade<00:02:18.080> vs.<00:02:18.530> pension<00:02:18.950> one

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
to make a control blade vs. pension one

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.600 
to make a control blade vs. pension one
is<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.569> design<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.080> see<00:02:21.110> right<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:21.610> with

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
is this design you see right here with

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.809 
is this design you see right here with
the<00:02:22.760> compact<00:02:23.239> shock<00:02:23.720> mounted<00:02:24.290> right<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:24.819> the

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
the compact shock mounted right here the

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.809 
the compact shock mounted right here the
other<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.360> do<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.830> have<00:02:27.980> just<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
other way to do it is to have just the

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.300 
other way to do it is to have just the
shock<00:02:29.209> in<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.810> original<00:02:30.380> place<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.040> coil

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
shock in the original place of a coil

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.940 
shock in the original place of a coil
over<00:02:31.519> shocks<00:02:31.700> suspension<00:02:32.660> which<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.769> how<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
over shocks suspension which is how the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.890 
over shocks suspension which is how the
focus<00:02:34.489> does<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.230> also<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.769> mark-5<00:02:37.040> jetta

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
focus does it and also the mark-5 jetta

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.089 
focus does it and also the mark-5 jetta
weight<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.080> still<00:02:39.349> saves<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.769> lot<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:39.950> space

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
weight and still saves a lot of space

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.160 
weight and still saves a lot of space
because<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.819> don't<00:02:41.060> have<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.390> coil<00:02:41.690> spring

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
because you don't have the coil spring

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.259 
because you don't have the coil spring
wrapped<00:02:42.920> around<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.400> shop<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:43.940> can<00:02:44.060> see

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
wrapped around the shop so you can see

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.390 
wrapped around the shop so you can see
it<00:02:44.390> right<00:02:44.540> there<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.130> still<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
it right there so it's still a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:54.100 
it right there so it's still a
space-saving<00:02:46.760> design<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.959> go<00:02:54.080> over

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
space-saving design so just to go over

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.309 
space-saving design so just to go over
the<00:02:54.440> parts<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.950> one<00:02:55.100> more<00:02:55.310> time<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:56.319> can
