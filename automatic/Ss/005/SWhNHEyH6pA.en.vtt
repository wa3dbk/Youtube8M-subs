00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
on it this is gonna be a tire roof and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.150 
on it this is gonna be a tire roof and
you<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.690> got<00:00:57.840> crickets<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.850> have

you see we got crickets and we have

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.929 
you see we got crickets and we have
their<00:01:02.160> valleys<00:01:02.550> valleys<00:01:03.860> be<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.939> beautiful

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
their valleys valleys be a beautiful

their valleys valleys be a beautiful
tile<00:01:06.270> roof<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.250> some<00:01:08.460> doors

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
tile roof but we have we have some doors

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.840 
tile roof but we have we have some doors
on<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> front<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.040> decide<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
on the front that we decide to do and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.420 
on the front that we decide to do and
copper<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.830> would<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.159> all

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
copper because that way we would do all

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.820 
copper because that way we would do all
the<00:01:15.119> soldering<00:01:15.570> together<00:01:18.619> getting<00:01:19.619> together

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the soldering together getting together
