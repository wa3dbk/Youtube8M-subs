 all mobile entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.759
 great harm to all dear friends of swami 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.249
 I pull on this heading turbo drain which 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.529
 designed to cheer you up a little 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:27.800
 mood to look at another drain 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.560
 chick replay dream teams like you already 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.020
 you know you send me to my 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.760
 official group in contact link to 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.520
 which is in the description send 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.670
 gets 500 gold today us 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.800
 the winner of the tank of 8 by the way I want 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.040
 notice that the battle on the map is a fishing bay 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.810
 and red pop them here are not so many 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.820
 there can see what is in principle 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.180
 normal fight that is even 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.530
 opponents are top and redder than ours 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.870
 respectively 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.240
 something not surprising from this battle that 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.910
 more precisely such a super fast strong 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.269
 expect but definitely not necessary and 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.130
 to logic, they all go to the city ​​and 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.010
 marched in battle three arta naturally 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.520
 I don't want to be substituted for it 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.240
 especially on the copper tanks and the whole crowd 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.970
 went to town 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.950
 it's okay in the meantime 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.650
 rivals decided to act very 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.440
 aggressively and as you can see 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.100
 just tucked under the stone as possible 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.020
 quickly precisely bulldog and 140 shine our 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.840
 all who keep on the left flank and 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.659
 very quickly take the score 03 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.409
 and only 20 minutes have passed it's tenth 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.460
 battle level 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.799
 and we have already played batik other barsha 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.500
 it is not even a significant teammate 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.940
 efficiency 1026 what is it at least 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.710
 not red respectively and tanks in battle 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.750
 could very well affect the battlefield 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.090
 eventually merged simply because bulldog 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.800
 fortieth ideally pursed i mean 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.610
 teamwork rivals like you already 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.160
 understand gives rise to the end 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.580
 score 14 thanks at least took away the enemies 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.740
 light now what happens is our 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.740
 eight accordingly began to decide 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.990
 go to the city with all the heavy but then 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.840
 accordingly it is clear that it is required 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.120
 help is on the left flank 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.550
 because from here most likely an hour 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.790
 primchatsya all stitches and with them there still 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.300
 Anyone to help already 54 facilitated 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.980
 here still the bulldog is 40 could already 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.990
 our tyazh guess what is required 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.000
 help but so far only 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.650
 our sovzvodny guessed and rushes to us 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.260
 to the rescue though simply because probably 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.980
 skype chatting and 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.820
 as you can watch thousands appear 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.010
 Turk lightweight drives in neatly 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.900
 here highlights 50 our 120 and guys 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.510
 the most interesting begins 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.110
 most of our heavy tanks 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.950
 which went to the city begins 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.970
 rest as incomprehensible to the mind as but they 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.180
 are dying 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.830
 surprising is actually a tactic is a 8 then 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.050
 does he have guns down very well 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.510
 She dropped or whether he purposely you goals shaft 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.150
 tower 140 when it was possible to lg thong 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.750
 in general, not too much attention 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.570
 drew 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.470
 but rivals somehow were 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.920
 to split 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.200
 so competently that their heaps 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.070
 two piles 1 left second right 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.130
 these are all piles and quite enough strength 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.200
 to disassemble all the left flank with us 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.970
 was already doomed to failure 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.700
 just because here our little 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.730
 hammer about the right flank to me honestly 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.850
 it's not clear because the whole crowd went there 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.830
 the whole crowd tank tenth level efficiency 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.410
 see for yourself there are normal players 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.430
 what are they doing and how are they 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.490
 managed to merge 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.350
 I do not understand exactly how and probably 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.720
 you do not understand we are in turn 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.130
 we can just sit at a loss 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.020
 can smile and look at 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.380
 epic acts because the devil brought 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.570
 that here just had been well and someone 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.100
 maybe remember your case and though 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.660
 would sigh with relief because and 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.359
 such a team he fortunately does not 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.040
 came across weight burn guys you run 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.840
 yourself in battle you look at Ali name 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.669
 you look at the remnants well, it would seem like 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.830
 more or less should get a fight well yes 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.229
 maybe defeat but not so 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.290
 scale when ours are for monics 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.590
 there are less than 500 hp who now have 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:37.330
 how 12,800 do you imagine that 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.850
 just this is the lowest from the indescribable 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.970
 from poor tiger too from and the gesture itself to them 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.580
 stay together and start getting 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.110
 most tomatoes tiger is left alone 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.000
 just sdyhaet 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.770
 Bulldog more precisely from waffles but to him 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.210
 squeeze a bulldog and takes most of it 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.160
 his remaining hp well now guys 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.070
 look at fast forward mode 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.380
 free camera and so guys are watching 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.210
 as in the beginning all our parting can be seen 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.030
 that light and medium tanks first go 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.860
 I went to the center of the strand a year 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:14.780
 spoke and our hero with the rest 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.070
 brave men are sent to the left flank 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.190
 specifically at the moment here only 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.810
 50 120 and from the bottom arrived at 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.730
 how do you understand the ninety spots 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.310
 died immediately surprisingly that 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.930
 customizes without put out or because how how 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.110
 pump up buttocks and stew is already burning 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.430
 often ok guys here actually 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.570
 in the meantime everyone decides for himself 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.030
 rushed already rushed unfortunately 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.730
 I can't show another flag because 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.500
 there is simply not enough colada drawing 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.700
 and we can not look beyond the epic 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.740
 actions of our cords 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.140
 Well, unfortunately we can not see, I would 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.850
 gladly wanted to see how 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.170
 most of the strands of stupid dreaming 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.100
 in the meantime here we have now 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.810
 the real mess begins rather 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.540
 quietly coming to this moment 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.750
 drove up 54-ka lightened here somewhere 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.870
 the same bulldog and 140 and the rest 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.600
 enemy tanks are also sent here 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.830
 if you noticed when we looked here 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.790
 tie a horse 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:21.540
 so that's got our set 20 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:25.340
 eight of the harp already toured it is 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:28.530
 same destroyed and now this whole mob 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.810
 rushes straight to the poor art which 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.970
 also played and now left alone 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.670
 alone and and e75 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.540
 which you also understood from all sides on 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:42.630
 received and died and then we have two 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.450
 poor tiger bus still alive waffle with 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.120
 Arta announcer them too will get tass 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:51.090
 guys do you understand how everything is fast and 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.290
 lightning happens poor waffle 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.790
 glows so well that the rest 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.310
 it will be rivals there with 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.520
 easy enough distance to 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.790
 light up and shoot off and here's a tiger too 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.220
 already left alone and as you understood everything 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.590
 ended very poorly results 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.240
 The battle you have on the screen is guys 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.610
 just an epic 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.710
 as I said, you can send 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.050
 your replays to the official band 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.930
 VKontakte tour rubric or link 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.630
 There is in the description and of course I wish you 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.190
 to not come across you here once 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.210
 a team like you 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.490
 you look like a normal but in the end 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.660
 as always in general then good luck to you guys 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.680
 bend over 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.680
 and happily

 and
