apart took the my lab detector I
realized<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.700> needed<00:00:47.940> extra<00:00:48.390> depth<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.989> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530

factory preset at the beginning of the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.410 
factory preset at the beginning of the
video<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.700> had<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.810> set<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:44.420> factory

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
video I had it set up like this factory

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.230 
video I had it set up like this factory
preset<00:01:45.960> well<00:01:46.350> later<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.890> you'll<00:01:47.340> notice<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
preset well later on you'll notice that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.319 
preset well later on you'll notice that
I<00:01:48.299> had<00:01:48.570> more<00:01:48.930> rejected<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.119> then

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
I had more rejected up in here so then

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
I had more rejected up in here so then
what<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.600> thought<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.890> found<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
what I thought I would do if I found a

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
what I thought I would do if I found a
few<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.640> silvers<00:01:54.420> I'd<00:01:55.049> make<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> simple

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
few more silvers I'd make a simple

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.450 
few more silvers I'd make a simple
change<00:01:56.189> again<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.750> user<00:01:58.020> friendly<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
change again very user friendly so I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.560 
change again very user friendly so I
rejected<00:02:00.329> everything<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.560> negative<00:02:02.009> 10<00:02:02.759> all

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
rejected everything from negative 10 all

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.039 
rejected everything from negative 10 all
the<00:02:03.960> way<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.530> 30<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> accepted

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the way up to 30 and then I accepted

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.609 
the way up to 30 and then I accepted
from<00:02:07.710> 30<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:09.030> 40<00:02:09.479> which<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.929> high<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.440> goes

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
from 30 to 40 which is high as it goes

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.670 
from 30 to 40 which is high as it goes
at<00:02:10.830> 40<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.580> was<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.239> my<00:02:12.420> screen<00:02:12.780> ended<00:02:13.080> up

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
at 40 it was so my screen ended up

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.170 
at 40 it was so my screen ended up
like<00:02:13.980> this

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.000 

okay<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.240> here's<00:02:19.630> my<00:02:19.690> cursor<00:02:20.350> right<00:02:20.500> there<00:02:20.860> at

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
okay so here's my cursor right there at

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.230 
okay so here's my cursor right there at
nine<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.640> I'm<00:02:22.390> going<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.720> block<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.470> out<00:02:23.590> and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
nine and I'm going to block it out and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.420 
nine and I'm going to block it out and
then<00:02:25.240> I'm<00:02:25.360> going<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.570> go<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:26.260> ten<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.800> block<00:02:27.250> it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
then I'm going to go to ten and block it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.750 
then I'm going to go to ten and block it
out<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:29.400> then<00:02:30.400> 30<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.150> above<00:02:32.550> we're<00:02:33.550> all
