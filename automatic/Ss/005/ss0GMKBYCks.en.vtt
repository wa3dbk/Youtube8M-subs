explain<00:00:00.810> firing<00:00:01.230> order<00:00:03.410> we<00:00:04.410> know<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.130> an

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
explain firing order we know that in an

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.799 
explain firing order we know that in an
ignition<00:00:05.640> system<00:00:07.550> the<00:00:08.550> distributor<00:00:09.240> passes

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
ignition system the distributor passes

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.509 
ignition system the distributor passes
the<00:00:09.929> spark<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.530> each<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.160> spark<00:00:11.460> plug

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the spark to each of the spark plug

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.470 
the spark to each of the spark plug
leads<00:00:12.240> one<00:00:12.719> at<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> time<00:00:13.700> so<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.089> say<00:00:15.269> that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
leads one at a time so we can say that

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.390 
leads one at a time so we can say that
in<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.900> revolution<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.650> number<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.010> sparks

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
in one revolution the number of sparks

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.580 
in one revolution the number of sparks
produced<00:00:17.820> by<00:00:18.000> distributor<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.810> equal<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
produced by distributor is equal to the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.970 
produced by distributor is equal to the
number<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> cylinders<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.670> engine<00:00:21.980> now

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
number of cylinders in the engine now

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.750 
number of cylinders in the engine now
let's<00:00:23.189> consider<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.609> 4-cylinder<00:00:24.359> engine<00:00:25.760> we

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
let's consider a 4-cylinder engine we

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.880 
let's consider a 4-cylinder engine we
know<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.240> cylinders<00:00:27.630> get<00:00:27.990> spawned<00:00:28.470> one

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
know that the cylinders get spawned one

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
know that the cylinders get spawned one
by<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:31.820> each<00:00:32.820> cylinder<00:00:33.239> requires<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
by one and each cylinder requires a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.670 
by one and each cylinder requires a
spark<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.860> every<00:00:35.280> 720<00:00:36.030> degrees<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.540> crankshaft

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
spark in every 720 degrees of crankshaft

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.970 
spark in every 720 degrees of crankshaft
revolution<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.290> say<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> spark

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
revolution so we can say that a spark

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
revolution so we can say that a spark
takes<00:00:41.309> place<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.790> every<00:00:42.210> 180<00:00:42.629> degrees<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
takes place in every 180 degrees of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.330 
takes place in every 180 degrees of
crankshaft<00:00:43.640> revolution<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.770> order<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.160> which

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
crankshaft revolution the order in which

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.639 
crankshaft revolution the order in which
the<00:00:47.550> cylinders<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> spark<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.780> called<00:00:49.110> firing

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the cylinders a spark is called firing

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.400 
the cylinders a spark is called firing
order<00:00:52.730> thus<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.090> define<00:00:54.420> firing<00:00:54.899> order<00:00:55.260> as

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
order thus we can define firing order as

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.170 
order thus we can define firing order as
the<00:00:55.559> order<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.010> sparking<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> cylinders

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the order of sparking in the cylinders

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.069 
the order of sparking in the cylinders
of<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.510> multi<00:00:57.899> cylinder<00:00:58.320> engine<00:00:59.750> firing<00:01:00.750> order

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

of a multi cylinder engine firing order
of<00:01:01.230> an<00:01:01.350> engine<00:01:03.769> depends<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> number<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
strokes also need to be equally placed

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490 
strokes also need to be equally placed
to<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.880> an<00:01:12.030> equally<00:01:12.479> balanced<00:01:12.990> movement<00:01:13.409> of

four cylinder engine we had considered

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.280 
four cylinder engine we had considered
let's<00:01:32.909> consider<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> first<00:01:33.960> cylinder

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
let's consider that the first cylinder

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
let's consider that the first cylinder
is<00:01:34.530> fired<00:01:36.950> now<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> force<00:01:38.310> F<00:01:38.520> acting

is fired now the force F acting
downwards<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.049> cylinder<00:01:40.759> gives<00:01:41.759> rise<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
downwards on this cylinder gives rise to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.830 
downwards on this cylinder gives rise to
