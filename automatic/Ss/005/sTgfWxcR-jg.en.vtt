see<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> light<00:00:47.280> inside<00:00:47.820> right<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
see the light inside right here this is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.170 
see the light inside right here this is
called<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> IR<00:00:49.680> sensor<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.730> infrared<00:00:51.149> light

called the IR sensor and infrared light

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.560 
called the IR sensor and infrared light
and<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:53.160> check<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:53.910> use<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.329> cell

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and to check it you can use your cell

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.420 
and to check it you can use your cell
phone<00:00:54.750> camera<00:00:54.960> every<00:00:55.620> circle<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> cell<00:00:56.250> phone

camera has a digital camera built into
it<00:00:58.350> usually<00:00:58.739> nowadays<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:00.469> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
it usually nowadays and this is a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.490 
it usually nowadays and this is a
universal<00:01:03.090> remote<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> got<00:01:03.719> from<00:01:03.989> RadioShack

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
universal remote I got from RadioShack

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.370 
universal remote I got from RadioShack
is<00:01:04.530> called<00:01:04.830> chameleon<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.840> hit<00:01:06.990> volume

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
is called chameleon and you hit volume

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
is called chameleon and you hit volume
up<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.710> when<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> hit<00:01:08.100> volume<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.510> human

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
up and when you hit volume up the human

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.570 
up and when you hit volume up the human
eye<00:01:09.930> cannot<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.860> white<00:01:11.070> light<00:01:11.310> this

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
eye cannot see this white light this

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.840 
eye cannot see this white light this
white<00:01:11.790> light<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.799> our<00:01:13.799> eyes<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.490> human<00:01:14.760> eye

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
white light is our eyes the human eye

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.810 
white light is our eyes the human eye
can't<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.409> our<00:01:17.400> eyes<00:01:17.580> aren't

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
can't see it because the our eyes aren't

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.640 
can't see it because the our eyes aren't
designed<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.630> infrared<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.470> light

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
designed to see infrared that light

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.910 
designed to see infrared that light
spectrum<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> digital<00:01:21.450> cameras<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.590> see

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
spectrum but the digital cameras can see

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.270 
spectrum but the digital cameras can see
that<00:01:23.070> light<00:01:23.250> spectrum<00:01:23.820> infrared<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.189> have

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
that light spectrum infrared so you have

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
that light spectrum infrared so you have
to<00:01:26.400> look<00:01:26.549> through<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> digital<00:01:27.270> camera<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.229> it's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to look through a digital camera if it's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.149 
to look through a digital camera if it's
a<00:01:28.829> white<00:01:29.070> bright<00:01:29.549> light<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.409> if

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
a white bright light then it's good if

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.609 
a white bright light then it's good if
it's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.520> weak<00:01:32.729> white<00:01:33.570> light<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.350> change

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
it's a weak white light then you change

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.550 
it's a weak white light then you change
out<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.799> batteries<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:36.360> there's<00:01:36.600> none<00:01:36.840> then

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
out your batteries if there's none then

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
out your batteries if there's none then
change<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.130> batteries<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.180> still

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
change out your batteries if you still

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.690 
change out your batteries if you still
don't<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.710> sensor<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.250> bad<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
don't get it then the sensor is bad I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
don't get it then the sensor is bad I
guess<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.000> dropped<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.509> or<00:01:42.689> someone<00:01:42.899> dropped

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
guess you dropped it or someone dropped

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.410 
guess you dropped it or someone dropped
it<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.310> sensor<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> be

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it on the sensor and this has to be

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.170 
it on the sensor and this has to be
replaced<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.280> replace<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.850> old

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
replaced and you can replace it with old

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
replaced and you can replace it with old
remotes<00:01:48.600> older<00:01:49.259> remote<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:49.890> not

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
remotes older remote that you're not

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.880
