gives a person time to ditch the phone

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.840 
gives a person time to ditch the phone
or<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.920> someone<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.220> gives<00:01:14.760> them

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
time to come up with an excuse so I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.880 
time to come up with an excuse so I
don't<00:01:17.720> think<00:01:18.720> that's<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.080> good<00:01:19.439> feature<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
don't think that's a good feature to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.789 
don't think that's a good feature to
enable<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.470> also<00:01:22.470> then

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
enable but do what you want also then

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.289 
enable but do what you want also then
there's<00:01:22.950> capture<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.610> number<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> wrong

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
there's capture on number of wrong

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.719 
there's capture on number of wrong
unlock<00:01:24.810> attempts<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.500> put<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
unlock attempts I put one just because I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.210 
unlock attempts I put one just because I
wanted<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> tap<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.479> away<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.590> don't

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
wanted to tap it right away I don't

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.460 
wanted to tap it right away I don't
typically<00:01:29.820> put<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> wrong<00:01:30.540> passcode<00:01:30.900> or

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
typically put in the wrong passcode or

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.940 
typically put in the wrong passcode or
or<00:01:32.280> pattern<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.869> think<00:01:33.930> ones<00:01:34.290> enough<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
or pattern so I think ones enough and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.399 
or pattern so I think ones enough and
they<00:01:35.430> might<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.479> than<00:01:36.509> once<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
they might not do it more than once so I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.830 
they might not do it more than once so I
think<00:01:37.740> after<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.579> safe<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> say<00:01:39.450> they

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
think after one it's safe to say they

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.490 
think after one it's safe to say they
should<00:01:40.110> send<00:01:40.829> me<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> picture<00:01:42.290> then<00:01:43.290> there's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
should send me a picture then there's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.359 
should send me a picture then there's
