see right there coming at you guys with

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.589 
see right there coming at you guys with
a<00:00:12.469> bypass<00:00:13.469> code<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.000> guys<00:00:15.150> just

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
a bypass code that one of you guys just

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.390 
a bypass code that one of you guys just
left<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.929> comment<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.410> my<00:00:16.560> other<00:00:16.680> bypass<00:00:17.130> code

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
left a comment on my other bypass code

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.160 
left a comment on my other bypass code
saying<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.150> code<00:00:18.420> did<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.500> work<00:00:19.860> well<00:00:20.370> I

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
saying that the code did not work well I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.630 
saying that the code did not work well I
just<00:00:22.170> tried<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.530> kill<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.920> about<00:00:23.130> five<00:00:23.400> minutes

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
just tried to kill it about five minutes

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.540 
just tried to kill it about five minutes
ago<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.240> it'll<00:00:24.450> and<00:00:24.690> it<00:00:24.810> worked<00:00:25.080> i<00:00:25.380> will<00:00:26.100> put

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
ago and it'll and it worked i will put

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.000 
ago and it'll and it worked i will put
the<00:00:26.610> code<00:00:27.030> backing<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.990> i'll<00:00:28.440> put<00:00:28.620> the<00:00:28.770> code<00:00:28.980> in

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the code backing in i'll put the code in

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.710 
the code backing in i'll put the code in
right<00:00:29.130> now<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.610> show<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.940> guys<00:00:30.030> that<00:00:30.180> I<00:00:30.450> will

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
right now to show you guys that I will

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.799 
right now to show you guys that I will
sign<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.989> everything<00:00:33.989> else<00:00:34.289> so<00:00:35.809> signed

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
sign in and everything else so signed

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.470 
sign in and everything else so signed
out<00:00:37.609> so<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:39.660> go<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> custom<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:41.329> already<00:00:42.329> have

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
out so you go to custom and already have

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.130 
out so you go to custom and already have
everything<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:44.030> I'll<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.210> skip<00:00:45.719> through<00:00:45.989> all

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
everything so I'll just skip through all

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.779 
everything so I'll just skip through all
this<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.300> boom<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:49.050> practice<00:00:49.800> every<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.640> see

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.610 

that<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> bypass<00:00:57.659> code<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.409> someone

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that is the bypass code that if someone

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.239 
that is the bypass code that if someone
told<00:00:58.920> me<00:00:59.100> did<00:00:59.339> not<00:00:59.519> work<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:01.100> of<00:01:02.100> now

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
told me did not work as them as of now

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.820 
told me did not work as them as of now
but<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.760> he's<00:01:03.239> literally<00:01:03.839> commented<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
but I he's literally commented about the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
but I he's literally commented about the
reality<00:01:05.220> doesn't<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.730> did<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.000> work<00:01:06.180> quite

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
reality doesn't it did not work quite

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.310 
reality doesn't it did not work quite
well<00:01:07.370> this<00:01:08.370> one<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> far<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.160> saying<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
well this one so far what I'm saying is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.560 
well this one so far what I'm saying is
that<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.740> should<00:01:13.980> work<00:01:14.190> with<00:01:14.430> me<00:01:14.580> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that this one should work with me so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.170 
that this one should work with me so
you'll<00:01:15.840> click<00:01:15.990> over<00:01:16.380> click<00:01:16.560> over<00:01:17.480> save<00:01:18.480> and<00:01:20.180> go

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
you'll click over click over save and go

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.630 
you'll click over click over save and go
back<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:21.810> signing<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.950> should<00:01:23.460> tie

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
back over here signing in and should tie

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.830 
back over here signing in and should tie
me<00:01:23.990> sure<00:01:24.990> sometimes<00:01:25.800> it<00:01:26.130> doesn't<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:27.540> got<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
me sure sometimes it doesn't you got to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.240 
me sure sometimes it doesn't you got to
give<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.260> try<00:01:28.470> sometimes<00:01:28.500> because

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
give it if you try sometimes because

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
give it if you try sometimes because
sometimes<00:01:29.640> he<00:01:29.910> signed<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.540> boom<00:01:30.810> enter<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
sometimes he signed in boom enter that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.210 
sometimes he signed in boom enter that
bypass<00:01:32.070> code<00:01:32.310> oh<00:01:32.780> yeah<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.620> is<00:01:37.800> working

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
bypass code oh yeah so that is working

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.900 
bypass code oh yeah so that is working
proof<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.510> bypass<00:01:39.930> code<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.320> working<00:01:40.910> as

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
proof that the bypass code is working as

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.770 
proof that the bypass code is working as
a<00:01:41.970> July<00:01:42.540> thirtieth<00:01:42.990> um<00:01:43.980> I<00:01:44.610> will<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.360> coming<00:01:45.540> at

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
a July thirtieth um I will be coming at

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.100 
a July thirtieth um I will be coming at
out<00:01:46.230> well<00:01:46.850> if<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.000> bypass<00:01:48.450> code<00:01:48.720> does<00:01:48.930> get

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
out well if this bypass code does get

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.740 
out well if this bypass code does get
Pat<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.830> soon<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.580> find<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.030> new<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.540> will

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
Pat as soon as I find the new one I will

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.290 
Pat as soon as I find the new one I will
be<00:01:51.900> coming<00:01:52.140> at<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.470> guys<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.480> um<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
be coming at you guys with it um so I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.450 
be coming at you guys with it um so I
will<00:01:57.300> also<00:01:57.480> leave<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:58.020> than<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.460> bypass

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
will also leave more than one bypass

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.100 
will also leave more than one bypass
code<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.850> here<00:02:00.030> i'll<00:02:00.120> leave<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.630> other<00:02:00.810> ones

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
code in here i'll leave the other ones

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.710 
code in here i'll leave the other ones
that<00:02:01.410> have<00:02:02.040> been<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.880> I've<00:02:03.090> been<00:02:03.240> reported
