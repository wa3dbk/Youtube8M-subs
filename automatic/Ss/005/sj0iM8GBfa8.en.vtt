00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.332
Different types of back hand flick

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:13.602
ok, How many types of flick are there on your back hand net

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:14.420
have a look

00:00:15.837 --> 00:00:21.602
when the people learn badminton for any years

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:27.087
or only have 1 year or 2 years experience

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:28.820
they normally do this kind of lift

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:31.570
like that and lift

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:37.755
that's a lift, normal lift

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:45.747
now second one is with in short action, much more deceptive

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.998
quick tap lift

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:51.920
hold and tap

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:55.238
hold like that and flick

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.953
hold tap

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:02.489
that way you give less time for your opponent to get ready

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.439
watch again

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.385
hold lift

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:08.815
hold lift

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.583
or number one simple normal lift, back and lift

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.900
but this technique is too easy for opponent to see it

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.336
so, if you are simply doing this one

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:32.849
you should practice hold and hit flick

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.236
this technique also can be used when you are late, low

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.519
ok, you are late shuttle goes down

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:49.052
you stretch and then flick from there

00:01:53.853 --> 00:01:55.052
stretch

00:01:56.736 --> 00:01:57.717
stretch

00:01:58.828 --> 00:02:02.745
rather than you are late go back and lift

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:10.081
you might be able to hit it but the hitting action is too long and takes too much of time

00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:14.712
so, number 1 normal lift

00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:18.763
number 2 hold flick lift more effective

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:24.129
you can do hold flick even when you are late

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:35.167
more advanced players at a final deceptive lift

00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:38.198
in the real match, hold

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:41.948
doing it together

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:44.282
and then lift

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.983
hold down and then lift

00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:54.978
so because he go down opponent may come forward and then flick lift

00:02:54.978 --> 00:03:00.700
but that kind of technique is for more experienced players
