what<00:00:08.849> I'd<00:00:09.120> like<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.599> demonstrate<00:00:09.809> today<00:00:10.260> is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
what I'd like to demonstrate today is

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.509 
what I'd like to demonstrate today is
something<00:00:11.309> called<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.849> fuel<00:00:12.480> cell<00:00:13.519> you've

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
something called a fuel cell you've

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.310 
something called a fuel cell you've
probably<00:00:14.849> heard<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.509> lot<00:00:15.540> about<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
probably heard a lot about it in the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.349 
probably heard a lot about it in the
news<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> fuel<00:00:17.220> cell<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> device<00:00:18.330> that

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
news but a fuel cell is a device that

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.480 
news but a fuel cell is a device that
will<00:00:19.260> take<00:00:19.680> hydrogen<00:00:20.430> gas<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.250> convert<00:00:23.250> that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
will take hydrogen gas and convert that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.359 
will take hydrogen gas and convert that
into<00:00:24.000> electricity

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
into electricity

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.339 
into electricity
but<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> doesn't<00:00:26.880> burn<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.449> hydrogen<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
but it doesn't burn the hydrogen the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.859 
but it doesn't burn the hydrogen the
hydrogen<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.250> burned<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> fuel<00:00:30.000> all

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
hydrogen is not burned as a fuel all

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.440 
hydrogen is not burned as a fuel all
we're<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.710> use<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.450> electrons

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
we're going to do is use the electrons

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.590 
we're going to do is use the electrons
off<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.200> hydrogen<00:00:34.739> gas<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> electric

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
off the hydrogen gas to be the electric

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.750 
off the hydrogen gas to be the electric
current<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.380> need<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.280> nice<00:00:38.489> thing

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
current that we need the nice thing

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.229 
current that we need the nice thing
about<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:39.059> fuel<00:00:39.420> cell<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.829> we<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.070> use<00:00:41.460> plain

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
about a fuel cell is we can use plain

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.850 
about a fuel cell is we can use plain
water<00:00:42.290> as<00:00:43.700> our<00:00:44.700> source<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.360> fuel<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:46.739> going

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
water as our source of fuel we're going

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.450 
water as our source of fuel we're going
to<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.190> some<00:00:47.399> energy<00:00:47.610> into<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.600> water<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
to put some energy into the water and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.709 
to put some energy into the water and
separate<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> water<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.360> its<00:00:51.510> two

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
separate the water into its two

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.770 
separate the water into its two
component<00:00:52.320> parts<00:00:52.820> hydrogen<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.030> oxygen<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
component parts hydrogen and oxygen and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.590 
component parts hydrogen and oxygen and
that's<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.920> we've<00:00:56.070> done<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.360> nice

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that's what we've done here and the nice

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.260 
that's what we've done here and the nice
thing<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.340> source<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.850> energy

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
thing about it is the source of energy

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.979 
thing about it is the source of energy
can<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> solar<00:01:01.469> cell<00:01:01.890> solar<00:01:02.879> energy<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
can be a solar cell solar energy the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.039 
can be a solar cell solar energy the
sunlight<00:01:04.470> sunlight<00:01:05.460> hits<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> solar<00:01:06.450> cell<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
sunlight sunlight hits the solar cell is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.770 
sunlight sunlight hits the solar cell is
converted<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.830> electricity<00:01:08.510> which<00:01:09.510> then

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
converted to electricity which then

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.830 
converted to electricity which then
converts<00:01:10.140> our<00:01:10.680> source<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.729> water<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.390> these

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
converts our source of water in these

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.700 
converts our source of water in these
tubes<00:01:13.229> into<00:01:13.680> its<00:01:14.390> component<00:01:15.390> parts<00:01:15.710> hydrogen

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
tubes into its component parts hydrogen

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.730 
tubes into its component parts hydrogen
and<00:01:16.860> oxygen<00:01:17.400> then<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.229> hydrogen

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and oxygen then I can use the hydrogen

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.719 
and oxygen then I can use the hydrogen
to<00:01:20.580> go<00:01:20.759> through<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> fuel<00:01:21.750> cell<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.729> create

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
to go through a fuel cell and create

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.270 
to go through a fuel cell and create
electricity<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.930> run<00:01:25.170> some<00:01:25.979> device<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:27.330> fan

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280

the byproduct of a fuel cell interesting

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.910 
the byproduct of a fuel cell interesting
enough<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.520> water<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:40.079> hydrogen<00:01:40.710> will

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
enough is water the hydrogen will

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.460 
enough is water the hydrogen will
recombine<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:42.030> oxygen<00:01:42.600> either<00:01:42.869> from<00:01:43.290> our

interesting enough a lot of the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
interesting enough a lot of the

what I've done is I've placed this in
the<00:02:12.330> Sun<00:02:12.569> I've<00:02:12.810> set

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the Sun I've set

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.720

what's called a hydrogen economy where
we<00:02:48.030> use<00:02:48.450> hydrogen<00:02:49.049> as<00:02:50.030> electric<00:02:51.590> energy

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
we use hydrogen as electric energy

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.800 
we use hydrogen as electric energy
source<00:02:53.989> because<00:02:54.989> it's<00:02:55.680> non<00:02:55.949> polluting<00:02:56.810> the

energy<00:03:05.069> sources<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:06.090> we're<00:03:06.239> not<00:03:06.359> burning

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
energy sources so we're not burning

fossil<00:03:06.989> fuels<00:03:07.439> or<00:03:07.680> anything<00:03:07.859> like<00:03:08.159> that<00:03:08.189> and

fossil fuels or anything like that and
