00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
start a conversation about it I'll start

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.120

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
steals but for that to make sense to us

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.999 
steals but for that to make sense to us
we<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> rewind<00:00:30.199> redefine<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.410> word<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
we have to rewind redefine that word and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
we have to rewind redefine that word and
look<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> way<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:32.969> interpret<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:33.840> means

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
look at the way we interpret it's means

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.799 
look at the way we interpret it's means
stealing<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.190> its<00:00:35.340> simplest<00:00:35.760> form<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.360> simply

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
stealing in its simplest form is simply

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.869 
stealing in its simplest form is simply
taking<00:00:37.320> something<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.250> yours<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
taking something that is not yours and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.450 
taking something that is not yours and
making<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.840> yours<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.710> somebody<00:00:40.950> steals<00:00:41.250> my

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
making it yours so if somebody steals my

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.760 
making it yours so if somebody steals my
wallet<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> ain't<00:00:42.450> theirs<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> now

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
wallet that ain't theirs but it is now

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
wallet that ain't theirs but it is now
because<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.370> ain't<00:00:44.489> got<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.700> no<00:00:44.910> more<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.270> they

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
because I ain't got it no more and they

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
because I ain't got it no more and they
got<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.469> big<00:00:46.710> difference<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.280> need<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.520> see

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
got it the big difference we need to see

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
got it the big difference we need to see
here<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.149> between<00:00:48.450> stealing<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> copying

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
here is between stealing and copying

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.939 
here is between stealing and copying
copying<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:51.000> much<00:00:51.510> more<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.930> plagiarism<00:00:52.649> for

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
copying is much more like plagiarism for

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.350 
copying is much more like plagiarism for
instance<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.340> take<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> classic<00:00:54.059> piece<00:00:54.210> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
instance if I take the classic piece of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.569 
instance if I take the classic piece of
literature<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.930> Old<00:00:55.079> Man<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.559> sea<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
literature the Old Man and the sea and I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.670 
literature the Old Man and the sea and I
copy<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> word<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.390> word<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> put<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.379> name<00:00:58.410> on

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
copy it word for word and put my name on

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
copy it word for word and put my name on
it<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.340> call<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> old<00:00:59.969> man<00:01:00.210> who

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it and then I call it the old man who

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.709 
it and then I call it the old man who
had<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.809> bad<00:01:01.079> luck<00:01:01.379> guess<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> is

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
had really bad luck guess what that is

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
had really bad luck guess what that is
that's<00:01:03.719> against<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> law<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:05.129> stealing

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
that's against the law that's stealing

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.490 
that's against the law that's stealing
in<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> negative<00:01:06.240> light<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:06.840> let's<00:01:07.080> look<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
in a negative light now let's look at it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.770 
in a negative light now let's look at it
from<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.710> positive<00:01:07.890> light<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.549> music<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.750> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
from a positive light in music what I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.810 
from a positive light in music what I
call<00:01:10.140> stealing<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> view<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.549> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
call stealing and the way I view it is

call stealing and the way I view it is
much<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.540> getting<00:01:12.810> inspiration<00:01:13.590> from

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
much more like getting inspiration from

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
drumming than just studying that one

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.470 
drumming than just studying that one
player<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.400> second<00:02:33.850> thing<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.090> need<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.270> do

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
player the second thing you need to do

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.780 
player the second thing you need to do
is<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.930> need<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.260> dissect<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:36.220> when<00:02:36.670> you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
is you need to dissect it when you

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.730 
is you need to dissect it when you
dissect<00:02:37.090> something<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.110> take<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> very<00:02:38.620> small

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
dissect something you take a very small

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.490 
dissect something you take a very small
snippet<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:39.700> maybe<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.970> 1<00:02:40.240> bar<00:02:40.480> fill<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.110> you

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
snippet so maybe a 1 bar fill and you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.440 
snippet so maybe a 1 bar fill and you
take<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.070> apart<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.520> look<00:02:43.090> at<00:02:43.210> each

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
take it apart you look at each

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.390 
take it apart you look at each
individual<00:02:44.170> beat<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.620> see<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.010> smaller

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
individual beat you see the smaller

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.890 
individual beat you see the smaller
stickings<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.120> they<00:02:46.210> did<00:02:46.420> within<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
stickings that they did within the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.620 
stickings that they did within the
larger<00:02:47.470> framework<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.280> then<00:02:48.640> what<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.880> do<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.480> I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
larger framework and then what I do is I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.600 
larger framework and then what I do is I
take<00:02:49.840> those<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.470> begin<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.830> chunk<00:02:51.340> those

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
take those and I begin to chunk those

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.790 
take those and I begin to chunk those
out<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:51.850> piece<00:02:52.240> those<00:02:52.570> out<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.260> begin<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.530> put

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
out I piece those out so I begin to put

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.470 
out I piece those out so I begin to put
those<00:02:53.980> around<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.520> drum<00:02:54.760> set<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.120> use<00:02:55.270> them

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
those around the drum set and use them

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.900 
those around the drum set and use them
in<00:02:55.570> isolated<00:02:56.320> manners<00:02:56.740> it's<00:02:57.010> very<00:02:57.340> similar<00:02:57.640> to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
in isolated manners it's very similar to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.190 
in isolated manners it's very similar to
learning<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.300> sentence<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.750> don't<00:02:58.870> just<00:02:59.050> want

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
learning a sentence you don't just want

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.330 
learning a sentence you don't just want
to<00:02:59.230> learn<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.590> sentence<00:02:59.950> you<00:02:59.980> want<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.220> learn

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
to learn that sentence you want to learn

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.800 
to learn that sentence you want to learn
all<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.610> words<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.270> that<00:03:01.300> sentence<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:01.750> you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
all the words in that sentence so you
