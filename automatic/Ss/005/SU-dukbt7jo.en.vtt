00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.130
 Hello and welcome to the pit stop by Moreno for the Case Bass 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.950
 Marin 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.360
 Relex parcel game is available since the sixth of September as 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.700
 normal sales version and at Exclusiv at Media Markt also in this 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.609
 standing behind me big collector indian 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:21.140
 and if the extra cost of around 20 euros is worth it we'll check buttons 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.339
 out 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.089
 This big box gives us both the PC and the export 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.410
 offset in Haiti, they are the same 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.489
 that lowers Thomas Albrecht Mayer 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.760
 just the size of the box is very impressive it is also very 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.520
 massive and budget as I think 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.480
 us 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.450
 With such an even nicer Inc Schober, Dr provided a lightweight OptiCat book 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.510
 and can also be opened laterally and there comes the first extra 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.180
 that's a few noodles that the Space Marines Percent for outstanding 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.140
 Bravery on the battlefield to get the League back out and around 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.490
 even as a fridge magnet sacks become very cool sometimes 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.580
 with it his grocery bag 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.480
 sticking 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.370
 that's not all because you can open the book even further 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.650
 and then receives a KH Wels book in the book 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.230
 that is a 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.100
 110 Hardt has always been a linked art logbook 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.660
 with a lot of concept drawings from the game and Sarah where you too 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.350
 nice as well the developer Relic the woa only Forke Kelly universe 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.250
 has retracted for me, however, is a pity and a given away 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.570
 Chance it to the intro page 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.630
 So no text gives any explanations 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.780
 to the drawings to the whole concepts 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.740
 As it came to these these I am I would have given me a missed opportunity though 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.070
 Nevertheless, the book is also excellent 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.690
 and SID chic you do not have to be ashamed of that 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.490
 then it went even further typically a collection of Serbian around here too 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 gives a brown as completely out of the game on CD 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.390
 Dollars that's more of a nasty card with self check cards 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.850
 all characters from the game 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.490
 where you can read on the back a few info about that is a 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.490
 But Natalie is also said to be a bit early, mostly like Halff 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.079
 Last but not least, there are only 8 of them in the collection 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.140
 Even the game itself in a normal DVD box came the term you have something 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.340
 the country has agreed this game has appeared completely unabridged in Germany 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.740
 but has a worst case smooth 18 so the percent only for 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.020
 Adults that too right because the violence in the game is the 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.949
 relatively explicit 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:43.359
 Contents 2 DVDs for installation and on the left side 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:48.009
 twelve-page manual black and white not much info in it but honest 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.979
 said the resort was not a thick handbook because the game is like that 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.809
 uncomplicated that is understood without a manual 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:58.770
 with a physical collection there are 2 unlock codes FÃ¼rth in 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.520
 Items a balustrade and a golden Happy sword also very nice 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.140
 the items that playfully have no effect 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.729
 but simply cosmetic 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.699
 One more word to install Space Marine's law forcing Steen ahead of that 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.849
 means you have to activate this game once online but it can also 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.989
 install on any other computer or laptop if you can 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.499
 the disadvantage of the whole story wants to be unlocked once and 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.859
 Linked to the Steam account is no longer for sale 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.159
 As I said, this whole box costs 70 Euro per cent, that is about 20 Euro more 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.209
 as a normal sale version I think that is quite a fair price alone 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.519
 the size of the box 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.859
 the impressive is very good on the shelf as a collector's artbook 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.930
 is beautifully processed Sun has many beautiful pictures the soundtrack is very 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.730
 good to listen to and after this with cards nice bonus on top and also 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.399
 the games against Chile are only cosmetic nature 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:58.119
 You can not have a very nice package after all 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.609
 From now on, I wish to wish such Kollek the emission and the Finnish 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:02.239
 now in the sights
