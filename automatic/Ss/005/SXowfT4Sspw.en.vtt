definitely<00:02:06.110> install<00:02:06.439> Chrome<00:02:07.009> OS<00:02:07.189> on<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.640> and

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
definitely install Chrome OS on this and

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
definitely install Chrome OS on this and
have<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:10.489> slightly<00:02:10.819> faster<00:02:11.480> CPU<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.310> sell<00:02:13.310> this

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
have a slightly faster CPU and sell this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.170 
have a slightly faster CPU and sell this
retail<00:02:14.209> $4.99<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.910> think<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.030> would<00:02:17.150> be

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
retail $4.99 and I think that would be

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.890 
retail $4.99 and I think that would be
home<00:02:18.110> run<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:21.680> all<00:02:21.800> these<00:02:21.950> colors<00:02:22.160> and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
home run so get all these colors and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.780 
home run so get all these colors and
it's<00:02:23.900> 60<00:02:24.769> US<00:02:25.220> bucks

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
it's 60 US bucks

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.170 
it's 60 US bucks
you<00:02:26.780> also<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.140> tablets<00:02:29.110> tablets<00:02:30.110> are
