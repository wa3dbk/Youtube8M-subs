00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
skirt and so what I've done because I

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.149 
skirt and so what I've done because I
wanted<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.630> 12<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.079> half<00:01:06.110> inches<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.100> I

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
wanted to 12 and a half inches so I

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.370 
wanted to 12 and a half inches so I
hadn't<00:01:07.490> made<00:01:07.609> it<00:01:07.639> 15<00:01:08.179> I<00:01:08.450> thought<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.109> is<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
hadn't made it 15 I thought this is the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.289 
hadn't made it 15 I thought this is the
center<00:01:09.709> right<00:01:09.859> here<00:01:09.889> so<00:01:10.759> I<00:01:10.789> would<00:01:11.119> imagine

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
center right here so I would imagine

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.629 
center right here so I would imagine
around<00:01:11.780> distance<00:01:12.229> as<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.380> circle<00:01:12.859> this<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.520> like

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:13.639 
around distance as a circle this is like

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.940 
around distance as a circle this is like
the<00:01:13.759> radius<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.600> went<00:01:14.899> around<00:01:15.139> and<00:01:15.649> I<00:01:15.770> put<00:01:15.920> a

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
the radius and I went around and I put a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.399 
the radius and I went around and I put a
pin<00:01:16.249> here<00:01:16.459> you<00:01:16.819> could<00:01:16.999> use<00:01:17.119> like<00:01:17.209> a<00:01:17.359> chalk<00:01:17.689> you

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
pin here you could use like a chalk you

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.959 
pin here you could use like a chalk you
want<00:01:18.619> because<00:01:18.829> mines<00:01:19.069> black<00:01:19.369> material<00:01:19.700> it's

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
want because mines black material it's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.639 
want because mines black material it's
too<00:01:20.090> annoying<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.450> get<00:01:21.079> like<00:01:21.229> a<00:01:21.259> colored

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
too annoying to get like a colored

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:22.539 
too annoying to get like a colored
marker<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.009> won't<00:01:22.130> be<00:01:22.189> able<00:01:22.249> to<00:01:22.369> see<00:01:22.490> it

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
marker you won't be able to see it

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.919 
marker you won't be able to see it
anyways<00:01:22.789> and<00:01:22.819> just<00:01:22.969> use<00:01:23.240> pins<00:01:23.509> as<00:01:23.719> you<00:01:23.749> can

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
anyways and just use pins as you can

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.440 
anyways and just use pins as you can
just<00:01:24.079> cut<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.729> go<00:01:25.729> around<00:01:26.029> like<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.270> and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
just cut it so go around like this and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.319 
just cut it so go around like this and
put<00:01:26.749> all<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.959> pins<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.819> continue<00:01:28.819> so<00:01:29.179> then

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
put all the pins in and continue so then

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.069 
put all the pins in and continue so then
you<00:01:29.450> have<00:01:29.659> like<00:01:29.689> a<00:01:30.020> big<00:01:30.170> circle<00:01:31.990> just<00:01:32.990> like

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
you have like a big circle just like

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.690 
you have like a big circle just like
this<00:01:33.289> and<00:01:33.529> then<00:01:33.619> we'll<00:01:33.709> add<00:01:33.859> more<00:01:33.889> pins<00:01:34.429> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
this and then we'll add more pins the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.419 
this and then we'll add more pins the
paper<00:01:34.880> just<00:01:34.999> use<00:01:35.240> for<00:01:35.420> marking<00:01:36.429> afterwards

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
paper just use for marking afterwards

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.309 
paper just use for marking afterwards
we're<00:01:37.849> gonna<00:01:37.939> cut<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:38.389> big<00:01:38.630> circle<00:01:38.959> out<00:01:39.049> and

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
we're gonna cut this big circle out and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.889 
we're gonna cut this big circle out and
then<00:01:40.130> we'll<00:01:40.249> cut<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.459> center<00:01:40.819> circle<00:01:41.029> for

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
then we'll cut the center circle for

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.489 
then we'll cut the center circle for
like<00:01:42.079> your<00:01:42.229> body<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:42.770> make<00:01:43.069> the<00:01:43.219> casing<00:01:44.499> okay

we're going to overlap this take there

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.580 
we're going to overlap this take there
and<00:02:25.340> then<00:02:25.580> cut<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:26.000> off<00:02:26.260> don't<00:02:27.260> worry<00:02:27.410> if<00:02:27.530> you

thinking like a plate or the small

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.640 
thinking like a plate or the small
circle<00:02:29.209> is<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> bit<00:02:29.690> way<00:02:29.930> too<00:02:29.990> small<00:02:30.350> for<00:02:30.560> you

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
circle is a bit way too small for you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.449 
circle is a bit way too small for you
because<00:02:31.459> well<00:02:31.700> as<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.830> whole<00:02:34.190> does

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
because well as it is this whole does

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.100 
because well as it is this whole does
kind<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.790> look<00:02:34.880> small<00:02:35.150> but<00:02:35.180> when<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.510> pick<00:02:36.080> it

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
kind of look small but when you pick it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.310 
kind of look small but when you pick it
up<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.650> becomes<00:02:36.980> bigger<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.200> see<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
up it becomes bigger and see it

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.260 
up it becomes bigger and see it
stretches<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.430> will<00:02:40.550> be<00:02:40.640> your<00:02:40.880> waist<00:02:41.120> and

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
stretches so that will be your waist and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.120 
stretches so that will be your waist and
so<00:02:41.390> we<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.660> do<00:02:41.750> take<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.110> light<00:02:42.410> place

so we want to do take this light place

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.940 
so we want to do take this light place
this<00:02:43.340> down<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:45.640> measure<00:02:46.640> your<00:02:46.850> hole<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.950> pull

this down and measure your hole and pull

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.250 
this down and measure your hole and pull
this<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.190> half<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.459> double<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.880> mine<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.750> 27

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
this in half to double it mine is 27

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.560 
this in half to double it mine is 27
inches<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:52.459> that's<00:02:52.640> how<00:02:52.850> long<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.239> want<00:02:53.390> the

inches so that's how long we want the
casing<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.050> be<00:02:54.170> so<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.160> have<00:02:55.280> 27<00:02:55.520> inches<00:02:55.880> here

the way around just a big tube I'm oh so
that's<00:03:43.970> there<00:03:44.150> because<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.870> want<00:03:45.049> to<00:03:45.110> sew
