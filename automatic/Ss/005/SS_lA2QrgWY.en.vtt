00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
on let's see it goes this way

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.630 
on let's see it goes this way
then<00:02:43.800> there<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.130> have<00:02:44.250> him<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.790> robot<00:02:45.090> form

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
then there you have him in robot form

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.220 
then there you have him in robot form
and<00:02:47.640> he<00:02:48.390> looks<00:02:48.570> pretty<00:02:48.690> cool<00:02:51.080> although<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230

better<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.930> guess<00:02:55.380> that's<00:02:55.740> thickest<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.280> my

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
better but I guess that's thickest of my

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.530 
better but I guess that's thickest of my
horrible<00:02:58.290> skills<00:02:58.680> at<00:02:58.890> putting<00:02:59.190> stickers<00:02:59.540> just

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
horrible skills at putting stickers just

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
basically this thing the drill does

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.040 
basically this thing the drill does
actually<00:03:23.070> open<00:03:23.459> up<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:26.250> open<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.580> up<00:03:27.050> let's

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
actually open up you open it up let's

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.370 
actually open up you open it up let's
fold<00:03:28.290> these<00:03:28.410> parts<00:03:28.739> back<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:30.080> think<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.260> all

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
fold these parts back I think you do all

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.810 
fold these parts back I think you do all
the<00:03:31.500> way<00:03:31.590> then<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.190> can<00:03:32.400> see<00:03:32.520> this<00:03:32.640> little

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
the way then you can see this little

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.380 
the way then you can see this little
tiny<00:03:32.970> arrow<00:03:34.100> little<00:03:35.100> bit<00:03:35.330> I've<00:03:36.330> no<00:03:36.540> idea<00:03:36.570> what

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
tiny arrow little bit I've no idea what

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.790 
tiny arrow little bit I've no idea what
you<00:03:39.390> would<00:03:39.510> do<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:42.350> if<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.470> ever<00:03:43.590> need

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
you would do that but if you ever need

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.030 
you would do that but if you ever need
to<00:03:48.230> if<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.290> want<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.560> use<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.739> little<00:03:49.950> tiny

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to if you want to use a little tiny

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.949 
to if you want to use a little tiny
arrow<00:03:50.250> bit<00:03:50.459> instead<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.850> big<00:03:51.030> jandreau<00:03:51.390> you

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
arrow bit instead the big jandreau you

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.229 
arrow bit instead the big jandreau you
could<00:03:52.080> do<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.610> this<00:03:53.610> part<00:03:53.850> doesn't<00:03:54.000> come

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
could do that this part doesn't come

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.640 
could do that this part doesn't come
with<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.420> separate<00:03:54.660> hand<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.170> just<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.500> big

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
with a separate hand it's just the big

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.180 
with a separate hand it's just the big
John<00:03:55.830> drove<00:03:56.270> like<00:03:57.270> so<00:03:57.480> okay<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:58.440> let's<00:03:59.100> go

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
John drove like so okay so let's go

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.220 
John drove like so okay so let's go
transform<00:03:59.640> into<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.270> little<00:04:00.690> mode<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:00.959> fast

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
transform into the little mode go fast

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.410 
transform into the little mode go fast
so<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:02.250> close<00:04:02.489> this<00:04:02.820> whole<00:04:03.030> thing<00:04:03.209> back

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
so you just close this whole thing back

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:12.740 
so you just close this whole thing back
up<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.810> really

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.580 

that's<00:04:13.750> basically<00:04:14.379> add<00:04:14.620> for<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.040> fun<00:04:15.220> part

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
that's basically add for the fun part

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.810 
that's basically add for the fun part
let<00:04:17.590> me<00:04:17.650> see<00:04:17.829> if<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:17.980> remember<00:04:18.400> correctly<00:04:20.820> and

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
you can rotate this a could fold these

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.460 
you can rotate this a could fold these
wheel<00:05:53.410> like<00:05:53.770> things<00:05:54.190> down<00:05:54.460> so<00:05:55.139> if<00:05:56.139> you<00:05:56.229> do<00:05:56.349> that

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
wheel like things down so if you do that

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.960 
wheel like things down so if you do that
then<00:05:56.740> you<00:05:56.830> have<00:05:56.889> the<00:05:57.070> entire<00:05:57.990> side<00:05:58.990> guys

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
then you have the buccal form I guess

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.379 
then you have the buccal form I guess
that's<00:06:06.220> a<00:06:06.510> drill<00:06:07.650> vehicle<00:06:08.650> slash<00:06:09.370> I<00:06:09.849> have<00:06:10.150> no

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
idea what this is but it could draw

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.719 
idea what this is but it could draw
enemies<00:06:13.539> to<00:06:13.630> death<00:06:13.750> and<00:06:14.139> as<00:06:15.070> a<00:06:15.160> big<00:06:15.400> time

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729
