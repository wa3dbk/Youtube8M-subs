00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.560
Hi, I'm Marian. Welcome to Thrive Gluten Free

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.261
where I'm all about showing you how easy it is to cook simple and delicious gluten free meals.

00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:12.862
Today, I'm going to show you how to make:

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:17.015
And what we are going to use instead of rice noodles are zucchini.

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:23.655
They are low in calorie, high in vitamin C, and they acually taste alot like pasta, which is pretty cool!

00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:29.143
and to make them, we are going to use a stand up spiralizer

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:34.835
over one of the hand held ones, just because you use more of the zucchini

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.604
so you get more for your money, basically.

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:41.153
So what you're going to do, is place the zucchini on the spiralizer

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.429
It's really easy to use

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.069
I will let my kids help spin it, while I hold it because it's sharp and I don't want it to get their fingers

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.329
(lively, happy music)

00:00:54.178 --> 00:01:00.098
Alright, so I have made the zucchini noodles. And this is what zucchini spiralized looks like.

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:07.472
Ok, so now, we are going to go ahead and make the sauce for the Lo-mein first. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.120
We want to make this first, so that the flavors have time to blend and infuse in 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.085
so that when we add it to all of the vegatables later, it tastes even. 

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:22.156
We're going to use half a cup of coconut aminos

00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:25.564
or you can use a gluten free soy sauce, which is tamari sauce

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.099
I use coconut aminos because I am sensitive to soy

00:01:37.892 --> 00:01:40.932
We're going to do a Tablespoon of oyster sauce

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:51.201
and a teaspoon of honey

00:01:53.038 --> 00:01:54.558
I'm going to eyeball it

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:03.783
and then we're going to chop and mince the ginger and garlic

00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:10.208
Fun fact about ginger, it is great for inflammation and pain management

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:15.304
If you struggle with a lot of pain, whether you're an athlete, and you exercise a lot

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.491
or you just have pain that you deal with, 

00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:23.481
a teaspoon of ginger every day, can really help alleviate symptoms

00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:27.188
just as much as a chronic pain reliever will

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.312
and now we're going to chop garlic.

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:45.115
Garlic is great because it has anti-viral and antibacterial properties

00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:48.531
and so if you're struggling with a weak immune system,

00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:52.297
incorporating garlic regularly is going to help keep your immune system strong

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.742
so you're not getting sick every time you are exposed to a "bug".

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.782
The garlic has been added to the sauce, and now we're going to add our thickener, which is arrow root starch

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:09.662
and we are going to use a generous amount, (about 3 Tablespoons) and the reason is,

00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:12.619
all the vegetables are going to drain when we are sauteing them,

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.669
and so this will just kind of help keep them covered in the sauce

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.410
I'm just going to mix that up

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.078
and set it aside. 

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:26.148
And now we're going to chop all of our vegetables

00:03:26.148 --> 00:03:30.096
Stir frys are great if you're trying to add more vegetables into your diet

00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:33.174
they taste delicious, they're simple. They take

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:33.907
as long as it takes for you to chop them. 

00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:36.731
10-15 min. then just saute them up, and you're done.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.286
Great for at the end of the week when you're tired, and you really just don't feel like doing much

00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:43.723
and you want to have a beverage, and relax!

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:54.423
These are grean onions. We're just going to thinly slice them.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.960
So, we are going to start pre-heating the pan on medium heat, 

00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:14.251
and I'm going to chop the carrots.

00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:16.401
I'm just going to thinly slice them.

00:04:18.679 --> 00:04:22.119
Those are chopped, and you can just see by the colors

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:23.677
just how gorgeous they are! We have the red, 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.598
the bright green, the orange

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.362
and it just makes it really vibrant and pretty!

00:04:28.362 --> 00:04:31.888
We are going to add some sesame oil to our pre-heated pan. 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.147
(a Tablespoon or two)

00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:37.356
And toss in our veggies. We have the snow peas

00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:40.593
and the carrots

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:49.154
We're going to stir fry these around until they get to your desired softness. 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.060
I prefer mine a little bit more crunchy, so I do about 5-6 minutes

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.688
you can definately do up to 8-9 min if you prefer them to be softer

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.980
It's been about 3 min, the color is starting to really get vibrant

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.780
it smells amazing!

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.193
We're going to go ahead and add our zoodles.

00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:14.822
We'll get these to start softening up a little bit.

00:05:16.453 --> 00:05:20.533
We don't want them too soft, but we don't want them necessarily raw either.

00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:31.763
The zoodles are starting to really soften up

00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:35.220
they would be what we would call "al dente" if we were cooking pasta

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.977
We're going to go ahead and add our shrimp, and the sauce

00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:47.493
add another little stir, get that arrow root starch stirred in.

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:51.574
We're going to mix it all together, and then let it cook for just another couple minutes

00:05:51.574 --> 00:05:53.236
just enough to warm up the shrimp

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.120
I used pre-cooked shrimp, because it is faster.

00:05:57.658 --> 00:06:00.858
and it just makes this meal less than 20 minutes,

00:06:00.858 --> 00:06:02.592
with  chopping and stir-frying

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:05.304
which is great! The faster the meal, the better, right?

00:06:05.304 --> 00:06:09.314
And for serving, I like to use my tongs. It's a little easier than a spoon

00:06:10.018 --> 00:06:12.738
the zoodles are soft, the shrimp is warm,

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:16.007
the vegetables are vibrant, the sauce is mixed in

00:06:16.007 --> 00:06:16.745
it just smells amazing!

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.769
And dinner is done!!

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:21.010
