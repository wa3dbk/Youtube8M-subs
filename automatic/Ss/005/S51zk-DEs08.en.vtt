00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:09.050
 continue communication here is another question 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.009
 how to breathe when running but here 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.780
 the poet writes a few words but deals 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:20.210
 I think it's interesting not only to those who 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.210
 it is interesting to run such a question fees 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.250
 interesting to all 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.760
 Well, we say well that's what I do not know in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.450
 middle lane to drain medium wants 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:37.860
 people who endure frosts yet 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:44.399
 us winter is not very warm well and here it is 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.430
 runs in the winter in general in the winter runs and his 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.539
 interested in the question of how to breathe correctly 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.890
 learn how to breathe correctly I already 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.260
 I don't want to tell on this 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.870
 stop doing that again 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.090
 video that is suitable in that video there 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.920
 link below 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.189
 breathing technique I told it at all 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.159
 basic principles but it is winter 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.610
 but this is my army and so me 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.040
 taught 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.700
 and you know these methods don't fit well 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.530
 here inhale well as well as exhale 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.270
 need mouth and nose 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.479
 emin but there are subtleties 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.400
 why you can not breathe only nose 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.020
 guys probably to cool the top 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.700
 airways will lay us at you and 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.700
 in general, your argument will end quickly 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.659
 mouth breathing 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.220
 there may be such problems 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.610
 painful pimples are so small 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.830
 Nalchik in the language you have them but they will be in 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.350
 in general it is carried over by that 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.619
 many times easier say than the same on 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.759
 recession laid down 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.320
 so as you need to breathe 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.509
 but here you need exactly 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.200
 practice well adjust well 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.229
 here look 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.230
 can you explain here i am closely that is and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.610
 sleep and this is the place that's where people 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 the upper teeth don't come out here and here you are 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.420
 put the tip of the tongue in response to this 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.760
 junction upper fate with gum 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.870
 here so I zyk at you there costs concerns and 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.730
 here's a look abode you air goes to 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.980
 nose and mouth at the same time but there 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.980
 nose can sometimes be there to delay 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.980
 that is, you feel yourself and here 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.790
 language movement it expands there in 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.709
 top down 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.829
 this is an experience you need to sit down 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.329
 try to see here so not externally 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.159
 can be seen as far as this air is concerned 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:07.049
 wraps around language from all sides 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:10.290
 so why is it done so well I donâ€™t take 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:15.989
 delving into the details let's say at the beginning but 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.269
 service there in one of the countries of asia into the yard 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.730
 high air in the mountains 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.040
 temperature drops are pretty cold well 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.260
 and here we took such courses where 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.109
 told here these planes and here 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.720
 this air flowing around your tongue will 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.689
 flooding 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.230
 that is, here's an open mouth so breathe 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.530
 elsa 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.659
 instant cold 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.569
 cold vorda if not worse there 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.359
 pneumonia is still something that's why 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.859
 it is all governed by language 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:51.989
 That is why you can not only nose but in 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.409
 first winter here is a natural reaction 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.769
 the organism here these ways are narrowed in order 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.049
 to block the air so that you neither 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:06.239
 picked up did not arrive honda therefore 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.590
 year we and here these air channels they 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.750
 shrink 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.670
 you held all that is air not 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.930
 enough you will be forced anyway 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.760
 grab the air of dollars and now to this 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.530
 regulate that's all regulated 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.889
 language movement means such a method is good 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.580
 also, with normal walking, don't beat up 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.949
 just output go somewhere there in strong 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.419
 frost ie have a nose to breathe and always 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.520
 it is advisable to avoid having fun 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.150
 simple so you press down there 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.660
 the tip of the tongue as one upper teeth and 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.430
 here breathe and regulating this stream 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.280
 air some wine sound is colder there 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.090
 it gets warmer it warms no worse than 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.400
 the nose is such a simple technique and technique 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.490
 breath work don't wanna repeat in i 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.850
 it already talked a little bit earlier 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.060
 this is this breathing adjustment method 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:11.370
 language will not let me, it is not only 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.190
 Well, when you are that 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:18.270
 a little bit then that is he nobody 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.510
 fit it was tested it tested 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.900
 it was just for the military in general too 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.200
 chose a lot of running cross and 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.510
 all sorts of but in the winter nobody was there 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.260
 pretty cold 8 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.390
 with 20 frost and it was necessary well, you know, I 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.500
 I understand then I was not so much 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.690
 how many now in general no one 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.910
 caught a particular cold it did not give 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.910
 some negative annals of us
