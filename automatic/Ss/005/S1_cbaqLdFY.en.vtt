00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
little pan nice little plastic key thing

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:46.329 
little pan nice little plastic key thing
and<00:00:39.670> instructions<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:45.350> don't<00:00:45.559> know<00:00:45.739> how<00:00:46.309> to

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
and instructions you don't know how to

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.760 
and instructions you don't know how to
use<00:00:46.699> a<00:00:46.909> pin

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.600 

Alyssa<00:00:52.230> press<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.410> little<00:00:53.590> button<00:00:53.740> and<00:00:54.400> then

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
it does all that instruction manual and

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.110 
it does all that instruction manual and
it's<00:00:58.780> called<00:00:59.050> a<00:00:59.170> froggy<00:00:59.940> robotic<00:01:00.940> pin<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.820> if

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
it's called a froggy robotic pin so if

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.850 
it's called a froggy robotic pin so if
you<00:01:04.239> can<00:01:04.390> see<00:01:04.600> a<00:01:04.630> frog<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:04.960> robotic<00:01:05.620> pin

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
you can see a frog a robotic pin

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.270 
you can see a frog a robotic pin
somewhere<00:01:06.250> else<00:01:07.110> well<00:01:08.110> there<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.320> go<00:01:08.470> Annie

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
somewhere else well there you go Annie

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
and it's all in English that's pretty

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.020 
and it's all in English that's pretty
good<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.670> guess<00:01:12.790> but<00:01:15.630> pretty<00:01:16.630> much<00:01:16.720> how<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.440> do

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
good I guess but pretty much how you do

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.160 
good I guess but pretty much how you do
let's<00:01:19.030> take<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.300> look<00:01:19.870> at<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.780> get<00:01:22.960> to

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
let's take a look at that so you get to

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.820 
let's take a look at that so you get to
