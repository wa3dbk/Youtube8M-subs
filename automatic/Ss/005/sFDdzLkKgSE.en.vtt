00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
what this body of work was based on Oh

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.229

Mina<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> coast<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.079> Ghana<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> did

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
Mina of the coast of Ghana and so I did

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.270 
Mina of the coast of Ghana and so I did
drawings<00:00:39.600> based<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.230> slave<00:00:40.500> council<00:00:41.070> but

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
drawings based on that slave council but

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.810 
drawings based on that slave council but
I<00:00:41.309> also<00:00:41.550> used<00:00:41.969> classical<00:00:42.690> music<00:00:43.110> within<00:00:43.820> some

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
I also used classical music within some
of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> imagery<00:00:45.300> thinking<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> music

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
of the imagery thinking about the music

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
of the imagery thinking about the music
that<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.829> played<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> music<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that was played and the music that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
that was played and the music that
people<00:00:48.539> listened<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> during<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.620> time

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
people listened to during that time

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220 
people listened to during that time
period<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:51.300> kind<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.199> know

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
period so it's kind of like you know

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.160 
period so it's kind of like you know
somewhat<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.250> soundtrack<00:00:53.780> almost<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:55.020> if

about<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:03.059> pieces<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> had<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
about these pieces is that I had to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.039 
about these pieces is that I had to
stink<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:04.979> early<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.360> work<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.720> wanted

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
stink about early on in my work I wanted

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.130 
stink about early on in my work I wanted
to<00:01:07.200> always<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.650> work<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.220> big<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
to always make work that was big and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.960 
to always make work that was big and
really<00:01:10.140> right<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> hardest<00:01:11.400> thing<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> do

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
really right now the hardest thing to do

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.660 
really right now the hardest thing to do
is<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.299> make<00:01:12.479> something<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.049> small<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
is to make something that small and so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
is to make something that small and so
these<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.570> much<00:01:15.720> paintings<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
these are pretty much paintings that I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.130 
these are pretty much paintings that I
travel<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.509> move<00:01:18.840> around

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140

collage<00:01:27.829> element<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.189> work<00:01:29.520> I've<00:01:30.000> always

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
collage element in this work I've always

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
collage element in this work I've always
been<00:01:30.479> fascinated<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> importance<00:01:31.979> in

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
been fascinated with the importance in

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.630 
been fascinated with the importance in
particular<00:01:32.939> pieces<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.659> way<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.930> stood<00:01:34.170> out

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
particular pieces and way they stood out

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.950 
particular pieces and way they stood out
and<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:36.060> me<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.540> randomly<00:01:36.900> picked<00:01:37.590> images<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
and for me I randomly picked images I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
and for me I randomly picked images I
choose<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.170> use<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.009> lot<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.670> images<00:01:42.090> where

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
choose to use like a lot of images where

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.310 
choose to use like a lot of images where
I<00:01:42.299> don't<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> lot<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> information

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
I don't really know a lot of information

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
I don't really know a lot of information
about<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.009> lot<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> times<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.820> gather

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
about a lot of times I gather

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.780 
about a lot of times I gather
information<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.140> make<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> work<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.579> one

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
information as I make the work that one

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.270 
information as I make the work that one
was<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.210> or<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.930> silhouette<00:01:49.470> image<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
was more or so the silhouette image of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.890 
was more or so the silhouette image of
Wimmer<00:01:50.820> coasts

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
Wimmer coasts

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.390 
Wimmer coasts
I'm<00:01:52.260> figuring<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.890> workers<00:01:58.040> it<00:01:59.040> was<00:01:59.160> more

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
I'm figuring the workers it was more

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.250 
I'm figuring the workers it was more
about<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.790> travel<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:01.790> know<00:02:02.790> from<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.540> slave

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
about the travel you know from a slave

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.850 
about the travel you know from a slave
council<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:06.830> @c<00:02:07.830> gone<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.460> new<00:02:08.610> world
