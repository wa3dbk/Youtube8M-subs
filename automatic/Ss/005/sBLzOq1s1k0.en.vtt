00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
like even the background is pics latest

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.170 
like even the background is pics latest
same<00:00:51.719> exact<00:00:51.960> background<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.460> waterfalls<00:00:53.879> are

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
same exact background the waterfalls are

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.600 
same exact background the waterfalls are
better<00:00:54.899> looking<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.680> move<00:00:55.890> faster<00:00:56.430> but

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
oh my god like this little angle change

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
oh my god like this little angle change
wasn't<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.729> necessary<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:28.200> these

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
wasn't really necessary just these

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
wasn't really necessary just these
little<00:01:28.439> switches<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> angle<00:01:29.430> weren't

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
little switches in the angle weren't

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.510 
little switches in the angle weren't
really<00:01:30.390> necessary<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.400> make

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
really necessary to be you know to make

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.450 
really necessary to be you know to make
it<00:01:32.729> feel<00:01:33.450> more<00:01:33.829> 3d<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.040> could<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.310> been<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
it feel more 3d it could have been a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
it feel more 3d it could have been a
straight<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.970> D<00:01:36.119> area<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> would<00:01:37.290> like

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
straight up to D area with it would like

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
straight up to D area with it would like
a<00:01:37.590> barrier<00:01:38.159> around<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> has<00:01:39.450> showed<00:01:39.659> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
a barrier around it and has showed in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.999 
a barrier around it and has showed in
the<00:01:39.869> 3d<00:01:40.110> plane<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.770> should<00:01:40.860> have

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the 3d plane like this it should have

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.399 
the 3d plane like this it should have
been<00:01:41.100> something<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> entire<00:01:42.090> time

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
been something like this the entire time

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.679 
been something like this the entire time
so<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> annoyed<00:01:44.399> me<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
so that kind of annoyed me and this is

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.210 
so that kind of annoyed me and this is
with<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> level<00:01:45.960> normally<00:01:46.470> end<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.070> have

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
with the level normally end but we have

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
with the level normally end but we have
a<00:01:47.250> nice<00:01:47.579> big<00:01:47.820> slope<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.509> goal<00:01:48.720> ring<00:01:48.930> which

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
a nice big slope and a goal ring which

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.240 
a nice big slope and a goal ring which
I'm<00:01:49.229> probably<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> see

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
I'm probably going to get like a see

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.840 
I'm probably going to get like a see
rank<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:50.850> something

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.530 

those<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.659> pretty<00:01:54.990> bad<00:01:55.229> run<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:57.390> can

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
those are pretty bad run you can

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
those are pretty bad run you can
speedrun<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> level<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.530> no<00:01:58.710> time<00:02:00.530> yeah<00:02:01.530> just

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
speedrun this level in no time yeah just

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.899 
speedrun this level in no time yeah just
like<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.909> speedrun<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.420> level<00:02:03.690> in<00:02:04.909> Sonic

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
like you can speedrun the level in Sonic

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.180 
like you can speedrun the level in Sonic
1<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.420> could<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.720> running<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.140> here<00:02:07.320> too<00:02:07.440> now

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
1 you could be running in here too now

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.770 
1 you could be running in here too now
i'm<00:02:08.280> actually<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.880> play<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.539> again

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
i'm actually going to play it again

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.669 
i'm actually going to play it again
because<00:02:09.989> i<00:02:10.110> want<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> see<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.530> i<00:02:10.619> could

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
because i want to see if i could

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.350 
because i want to see if i could
speedrun<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:11.880> won't<00:02:12.120> talk

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
speedrun it but I just won't talk

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.449 
speedrun it but I just won't talk
through<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.069> let's<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.250> i<00:02:14.310> can

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
through it so let's see if i can

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.800 
through it so let's see if i can
speedrun<00:02:14.640> it'll<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:15.330> less<00:02:15.600> than<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
speedrun it'll just be like less than a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.680 
speedrun it'll just be like less than a
minute<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.340> before<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.370> lets<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.540> that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
minute so before it lets go I like that

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.250 
minute so before it lets go I like that
starts<00:02:18.989> out<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> do<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.620> cool<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:21.110> I'm<00:02:22.110> no

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
starts out in to do that's cool I I'm no

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.900 
starts out in to do that's cool I I'm no
I'm<00:02:22.380> no<00:02:22.410> speed<00:02:22.830> runner<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.280> don't<00:02:23.430> expect

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I'm no speed runner so don't expect

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.990 
I'm no speed runner so don't expect
anything<00:02:24.470> what<00:02:28.610> all<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.730> sucks

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.050 

there<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:33.660> go

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.760 

and<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.900> can<00:02:38.170> actually<00:02:38.290> see<00:02:38.440> more<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
and now you can actually see more the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.530 
and now you can actually see more the
level<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.730> really<00:02:40.000> they<00:02:40.150> really<00:02:40.390> did

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
level they really they really did

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.360 
level they really they really did
recreate<00:02:41.020> every<00:02:41.200> single<00:02:41.470> alternate<00:02:42.040> path<00:02:42.190> and

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
recreate every single alternate path and

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.530 
recreate every single alternate path and
whatnot<00:02:42.610> search<00:02:42.819> really<00:02:43.060> cool

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.670 

although<00:02:51.540> one<00:02:51.689> thing<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.959> do<00:02:52.019> kind<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.349> prefer
