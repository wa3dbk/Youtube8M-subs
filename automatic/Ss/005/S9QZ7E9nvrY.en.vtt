health so some of the future areas of
use<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.060> think<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:40.020> anything<00:01:40.560> where<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
use I think like anything where you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.609 
use I think like anything where you
today<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.400> use<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> pin<00:01:42.210> code<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.259> a

today would use a pin code or or or a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.730 
today would use a pin code or or or a
key<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:44.070> card<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.030> payments<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.350> think<00:01:46.409> one

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
