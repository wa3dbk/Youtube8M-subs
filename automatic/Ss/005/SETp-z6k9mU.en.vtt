there's<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.600> lot<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.439> talk<00:01:37.740> about<00:01:38.009> whether<00:01:38.430> or

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
there's a lot of talk about whether or

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.550 
there's a lot of talk about whether or
not<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.119> good<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.840> cut<00:01:40.049> cataleya

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
not it's a good thing to cut cataleya

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.569 
not it's a good thing to cut cataleya
sheets<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:42.020> there<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.350> many<00:01:43.680> reasons<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
sheets and there are many reasons not to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
sheets and there are many reasons not to
do<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.869> first<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.409> foremost<00:01:46.950> reason

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
do it and the first and foremost reason

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.550 
do it and the first and foremost reason
that<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.390> sheath<00:01:48.810> offers<00:01:49.290> some

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that is that the sheath offers some

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.069 
that is that the sheath offers some
protection<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.490> flower<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.750> cut

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
protection to the flower so if you cut

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.539 
protection to the flower so if you cut
it<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.500> something

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
it and something

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
it and something
drips<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> ruin<00:01:55.500> your

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
drips in then it's going to ruin your

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.090 
drips in then it's going to ruin your
boat<00:01:55.979> now<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.969> year<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.329> had<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.020> cataleya<00:01:58.770> bob

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
boat now one year I had a cataleya bob

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.520 
boat now one year I had a cataleya bob
beth's<00:01:59.490> underneath<00:02:00.329> my<00:02:00.540> Vander's<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> I'd

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
beth's underneath my Vander's and I'd

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.340 
beth's underneath my Vander's and I'd
caught<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> sheath<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:03.240> left<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> vanda's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
caught the sheath and I left the vanda's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.100 
caught the sheath and I left the vanda's
dripping<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.610> water<00:02:05.850> dripped<00:02:06.600> into<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
dripping and the water dripped into the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.979 
dripping and the water dripped into the
sheath<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.610> spoiled<00:02:08.610> my<00:02:08.789> bud<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.720> that's<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
sheath and spoiled my bud so that's a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.350 
sheath and spoiled my bud so that's a
good<00:02:10.140> reason<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.920> cut<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> sheets

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
good reason not to cut the sheets

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.740 
good reason not to cut the sheets
but<00:02:13.110> here<00:02:13.830> I'm<00:02:14.040> gonna<00:02:14.250> show<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.790> reason<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
but here I'm gonna show you a reason to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
but here I'm gonna show you a reason to
cut<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.770> sheets<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.820> do

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
cut the sheets and I think it's to do

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.670 
cut the sheets and I think it's to do
with<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.180> particular<00:02:18.360> plant<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> would

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
with this particular plant so I would

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.550 
with this particular plant so I would
say<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:19.920> poor<00:02:20.790> Parata<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.960> cutting<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
say for poor Parata that cutting the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.790 
say for poor Parata that cutting the
sheets<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.100> good<00:02:23.430> idea<00:02:23.720> now<00:02:24.720> because<00:02:25.500> this

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
sheets is a good idea now because this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.790 
sheets is a good idea now because this
plant<00:02:26.250> came<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.910> spike<00:02:27.270> last<00:02:27.840> October<00:02:28.650> I

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
plant came in to spike last October I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.060 
plant came in to spike last October I
took<00:02:29.280> my<00:02:29.460> eye<00:02:29.850> off<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.360> ball<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.200> didn't

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
took my eye off the ball and I didn't

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.190 
took my eye off the ball and I didn't
realize<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.460> was<00:02:32.670> about<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.090> flower<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.630> I

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
realize I was about to flower and I

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080 
realize I was about to flower and I
forgot<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> cut<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.070> sheath<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.520> time<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
forgot to cut the sheath in time and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.420 
forgot to cut the sheath in time and
this<00:02:36.330> one<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:36.780> burst<00:02:37.080> through<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.100> if<00:02:38.280> we

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
this one here burst through and if we

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.160 
this one here burst through and if we
look<00:02:38.610> carefully<00:02:38.880> here<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.600> can<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:39.959> what's

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
look carefully here you can see what's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.880 
look carefully here you can see what's
happened<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.850> stem<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.570> flower<00:02:42.600> has<00:02:43.260> gone

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
happened the stem of the flower has gone

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.180 
happened the stem of the flower has gone

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
burst through the sheath now that could

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.449 
burst through the sheath now that could
have<00:02:49.680> been<00:02:49.800> fatal

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.520 
I quickly cut the sheath of the second
one<00:03:02.280> over<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.050> opened

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
flowers have come out beautifully so

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.670 
flowers have come out beautifully so
with<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.330> plant<00:03:21.690> I'll<00:03:22.019> certainly<00:03:22.440> be

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
with this plant I'll certainly be

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.340 
with this plant I'll certainly be
cutting<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.280> sheaths<00:03:23.549> in<00:03:23.880> future<00:03:24.390> now<00:03:25.170> when

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
cutting the sheaths in future now when

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.020 
cutting the sheaths in future now when
you<00:03:25.470> cut<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.830> sheath<00:03:26.070> what<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.549> need<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.850> do

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
you cut the sheath what you need to do

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.470 
you cut the sheath what you need to do
is<00:03:27.239> make<00:03:28.019> sure<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.549> have<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> sheath<00:03:30.120> that

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
is make sure that you have a sheath that

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.949 
is make sure that you have a sheath that
you<00:03:31.350> can<00:03:31.500> see<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.709> darkness<00:03:32.640> inside<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.690> sheath

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
you can see a darkness inside the sheath

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.170 
you can see a darkness inside the sheath
with<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.440> which<00:03:34.680> indicates<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> board

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
with it which indicates there is a board

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.470 
with it which indicates there is a board
and<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:37.500> need<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.860> know<00:03:38.040> which<00:03:38.700> kind<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.209> cat

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
and you need to know which kind of cat

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.660 
and you need to know which kind of cat
lay<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:40.860> example<00:03:41.280> with<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.610> one

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
lay it is so for example with this one

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.860 
lay it is so for example with this one
that<00:03:42.600> M<00:03:43.040> comes<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.489> sheath<00:03:44.760> like<00:03:45.269> months

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
that M comes in to sheath like months

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.900 
that M comes in to sheath like months
before<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.470> going<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.890> bloom<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.580> would<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.880> a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
before it's going to bloom it would be a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.539 
before it's going to bloom it would be a
very<00:03:48.090> bad<00:03:48.630> idea<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:49.470> cut<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.130> minute<00:03:50.400> you

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
very bad idea to cut it the minute you

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.610 
very bad idea to cut it the minute you
see<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.970> darkness<00:03:51.420> okay<00:03:51.900> if<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.170> cut<00:03:52.470> this

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
see that darkness okay if I cut this

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.789 
see that darkness okay if I cut this
back<00:03:52.890> in<00:03:53.070> October<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.690> know<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.530> buds

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
back in October and you know the buds

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.860 
back in October and you know the buds
would<00:03:56.250> have<00:03:56.400> gone<00:03:57.239> months<00:03:57.600> without

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
would have gone months without

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.289 
would have gone months without
protection<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.519> best<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.820> leave<00:04:00.090> with

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
protection so it's best to leave with

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.650 
protection so it's best to leave with
kind<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.750> till<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.110> last<00:04:01.290> minute

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
kind of till the last minute

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.940 
kind of till the last minute
unfortunately<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:03.870> particular<00:04:04.230> case<00:04:04.680> I

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
unfortunately in this particular case I

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.770 
unfortunately in this particular case I
took<00:04:05.070> my<00:04:05.370> eye<00:04:05.400> off<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.910> ball<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.330> left<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.750> a

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
took my eye off the ball and left it a

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.650
