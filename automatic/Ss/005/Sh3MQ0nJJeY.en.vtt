installing a new pool pump for your pool
equipment<00:00:08.040> there<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.150> Pentair<00:00:09.600> whisper

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
equipment there is a Pentair whisper

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.980 
equipment there is a Pentair whisper
flow<00:00:10.230> 3/4<00:00:10.950> horsepower<00:00:11.630> and<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.750> like<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
flow 3/4 horsepower and I like the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.270 
flow 3/4 horsepower and I like the
whisper<00:00:13.289> flow<00:00:13.500> because<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.860> has<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.010> really

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
whisper flow because it has a really

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.430 
whisper flow because it has a really
large<00:00:14.430> pump<00:00:14.820> area<00:00:15.209> here<00:00:15.539> you<00:00:15.900> see<00:00:16.139> here<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
large pump area here you see here the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.689 
large pump area here you see here the
basket<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.830> really<00:00:16.860> large<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.550> is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
basket is really large and this is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.260 
basket is really large and this is
important

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
important

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.480 
important
with<00:00:18.930> debris<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.440> your<00:00:19.470> flow<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.160> your<00:00:20.250> pool

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
with debris in your flow of your pool

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730 
with debris in your flow of your pool
and<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> first<00:00:21.960> part<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.140> go<00:00:22.439> honey

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and so in the first part I go honey

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.140 
and so in the first part I go honey
we'll<00:00:22.920> go<00:00:23.070> over<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.340> wiring<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> pump

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
we'll go over the wiring of the pump

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.120 
we'll go over the wiring of the pump
itself<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.289> comes<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> box<00:00:25.859> is

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
itself all that comes in the box is

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.370 
itself all that comes in the box is
actually<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.550> motor<00:00:26.759> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> pump<00:00:27.259> you<00:00:28.259> can

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
actually the motor in the pump you can

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.960 
actually the motor in the pump you can
use<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> existing<00:00:29.009> wiring<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.550> comes<00:00:29.880> out

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
use the existing wiring that comes out

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.939 
use the existing wiring that comes out
of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> time<00:00:30.359> clock<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.650> still<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.859> good

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
of the time clock if it's still in good

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.250 
of the time clock if it's still in good
shape<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.700> know<00:00:32.910> 1/4<00:00:33.390> socket<00:00:33.570> wrench<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.110> get

wires and one click note this is a 3/4

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.900 
wires and one click note this is a 3/4
horsepower<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.310> want<00:00:44.490> to<00:00:44.550> make<00:00:44.670> sure<00:00:44.790> you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
horsepower so you want to make sure you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
horsepower so you want to make sure you
match<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.540> pump<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:46.620> amount<00:00:46.800> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
match up your pump with the amount of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.530 
match up your pump with the amount of
flow<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.130> need<00:00:47.310> for<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.610> pool<00:00:47.790> now<00:00:48.330> go<00:00:48.480> ahead

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
flow you need for your pool now go ahead

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.270 
flow you need for your pool now go ahead
and<00:00:48.750> post<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.140> flow<00:00:49.320> rate<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> 3/4

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and post a flow rate for the 3/4

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
and post a flow rate for the 3/4
horsepower<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:50.970> also<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> other<00:00:51.390> ones<00:00:51.630> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
horsepower and also the other ones you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.780 
horsepower and also the other ones you
can<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:51.930> an<00:00:52.050> idea<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:53.280> flow<00:00:53.520> you're<00:00:53.670> going

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
can get an idea of the flow you're going

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:02.690 
can get an idea of the flow you're going
to<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.300> 20<00:00:54.600> feet<00:00:54.810> of<00:00:54.930> pipe

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.399 

that's<00:01:03.600> important<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.019> don't<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.320> go

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that's important you don't want to go

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
that's important you don't want to go
under<00:01:04.620> with<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> flow<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> also<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> have

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
under with the flow and also if you have

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.310 
under with the flow and also if you have
a<00:01:06.000> sand<00:01:06.300> filter<00:01:06.450> don't<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:06.960> over<00:01:07.200> with

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a sand filter don't want to go over with

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.750 
a sand filter don't want to go over with
the<00:01:07.440> flow<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.950> could<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.280> screw<00:01:08.610> up

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the flow because I could really screw up

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.600 
the flow because I could really screw up
the<00:01:08.909> filter<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.900> filtration<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:11.190> is<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the filter the filtration this is for a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
the filter the filtration this is for a
for<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> 220<00:01:12.630> volt<00:01:12.659> installation<00:01:13.320> sometimes

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
for a 220 volt installation sometimes

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
for a 220 volt installation sometimes
you<00:01:13.800> can<00:01:13.920> actually<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.640> pump<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.420> has

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you can actually get a pump that has

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
you can actually get a pump that has
both<00:01:15.840> wiring<00:01:16.409> configurations<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.250> back

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
both wiring configurations in the back

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
both wiring configurations in the back
of<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.210> only<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> 220

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
of it this one here is only for a 220

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.499 
of it this one here is only for a 220
volt<00:01:20.180> system

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.380 

the<00:01:26.049> both<00:01:26.229> inches<00:01:26.500> here<00:01:26.649> marked<00:01:26.920> on<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.100> side

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the both inches here marked on the side

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.820 
the both inches here marked on the side
the<00:01:27.510> pump<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:27.870> you<00:01:27.930> purchase<00:01:28.260> it<00:01:28.440> so<00:01:28.680> make

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
the pump when you purchase it so make

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:37.330 
the pump when you purchase it so make
sure<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.280> voltage

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.719 

a<00:01:37.369> 220<00:01:38.330> volt<00:01:38.360> pump<00:01:38.869> up<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.320> 110<00:01:39.860> breaker

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
a 220 volt pump up to a 110 breaker

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:41.980 
a 220 volt pump up to a 110 breaker
it'll<00:01:40.970> probably<00:01:41.090> burn<00:01:41.390> out<00:01:41.540> within<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.869> minute

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
it'll probably burn out within a minute

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.440 
it'll probably burn out within a minute
or<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:43.580> basically<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.090> wiring<00:01:44.390> is

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
or so and so basically the wiring is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.910 
or so and so basically the wiring is
very<00:01:44.479> simple<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:44.990> have<00:01:45.080> load<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.770> load

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
very simple you have load one and load

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.740 
very simple you have load one and load
two<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.369> just<00:01:46.400> hook<00:01:46.640> up<00:01:46.759> each<00:01:47.119> wire<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.630> each

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
two you just hook up each wire to each

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.600 
two you just hook up each wire to each
section<00:01:48.290> doesn't<00:01:48.710> matter<00:01:48.920> which<00:01:49.070> wire<00:01:49.280> and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
section doesn't matter which wire and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.490 
section doesn't matter which wire and
then<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.330> put<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.720> ground<00:01:51.020> wire<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.409> the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
then you put the ground wire on the

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.800 
then you put the ground wire on the
green<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.490> it's<00:01:52.610> really<00:01:52.729> basic<00:01:53.270> if<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.630> was<00:01:53.780> a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
green so it's really basic if this was a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.899 
green so it's really basic if this was a
dual<00:01:54.110> voltage<00:01:54.649> one<00:01:55.070> you'd<00:01:55.250> have<00:01:55.399> to<00:01:55.550> change

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
dual voltage one you'd have to change

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.399 
dual voltage one you'd have to change
some<00:01:56.090> wires<00:01:56.270> around<00:01:56.450> but<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:56.840> course<00:01:57.290> there's

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
some wires around but of course there's

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.109 
some wires around but of course there's
only<00:01:57.500> hookups<00:01:58.220> for<00:01:58.399> one<00:01:58.550> type<00:01:58.790> of<00:01:58.940> voltage

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
only hookups for one type of voltage

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.570 
only hookups for one type of voltage
here<00:01:59.450> in<00:01:59.570> this<00:01:59.690> particular<00:01:59.869> pump<00:02:00.399> I'll<00:02:01.399> make

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
here in this particular pump I'll make

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.130 
here in this particular pump I'll make
sure<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.759> turn<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.000> breaker<00:02:02.180> off<00:02:02.479> before<00:02:03.049> you

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
sure you turn the breaker off before you

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.320 
sure you turn the breaker off before you
do<00:02:03.229> anything<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.860> can<00:02:04.369> tell<00:02:04.460> us<00:02:04.520> at<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.820> 220

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
do anything you can tell us at the 220

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.940 
do anything you can tell us at the 220
because<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.020> breaker<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:06.409> a<00:02:06.470> double<00:02:06.740> breaker

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
because the breaker is a double breaker

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.249 
because the breaker is a double breaker
so<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.310> know<00:02:07.369> you<00:02:07.430> have<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> 220<00:02:08.179> volt<00:02:08.390> breaker

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
so you know you have a 220 volt breaker

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.840 
so you know you have a 220 volt breaker
here<00:02:09.530> versus<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> 110<00:02:10.429> which<00:02:10.610> would<00:02:10.729> look

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
here versus a 110 which would look

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.699 
here versus a 110 which would look
something<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:11.420> here<00:02:11.810> your<00:02:12.410> pump<00:02:12.620> of

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
something like this here your pump of

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.229 
something like this here your pump of
sucked<00:02:12.950> up<00:02:13.040> one<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.280> these<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.820> 110

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
sucked up one of these you have a 110

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.940 
sucked up one of these you have a 110
pump<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:15.080> got<00:02:15.230> some<00:02:15.380> room<00:02:15.530> here<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.680> can<00:02:15.860> see

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
pump as I got some room here I can see

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.350 
pump as I got some room here I can see
the<00:02:16.040> old<00:02:16.190> wiring<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.850> ground<00:02:17.120> wire

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
the old wiring this is a ground wire

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.320 
the old wiring this is a ground wire
here<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.290> green<00:02:18.530> ground<00:02:18.739> wire<00:02:19.030> take<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.209> one

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
here the green ground wire take that one

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.720 
here the green ground wire take that one
off<00:02:20.360> first<00:02:22.810> round<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:25.100> two<00:02:25.280> load<00:02:25.489> wires

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
off first round and the two load wires

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.090 
off first round and the two load wires
it<00:02:25.970> right<00:02:26.120> here<00:02:26.390> load<00:02:26.600> one<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.959> load<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
it right here load one and load to the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.800 
it right here load one and load to the
matter<00:02:28.370> which<00:02:28.550> one<00:02:28.760> we<00:02:28.790> wire<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.390> which<00:02:29.540> wire

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
matter which one we wire to which wire

matter which one we wire to which wire
with<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> new<00:02:30.440> pump<00:02:30.680> either<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> pulled

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
with a new pump either and so I pulled

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.470 
with a new pump either and so I pulled
those<00:02:34.130> three<00:02:34.370> wires<00:02:34.580> through<00:02:34.940> again

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
those three wires through again

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.729 
those three wires through again
the<00:02:35.569> green<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:35.989> ground<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.709> have

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
the green is the ground and you have

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.820 
the green is the ground and you have
load<00:02:37.130> one<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.519> low<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.770 

and<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.580> finish<00:02:43.850> wiring<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.300> now<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:44.630> got<00:02:44.720> a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
and we finish wiring it now that I got a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.240 
and we finish wiring it now that I got a
plumbed<00:02:45.080> in<00:02:46.960> puts<00:02:47.960> a<00:02:48.020> little<00:02:48.140> 90-degree<00:02:48.830> thing

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
plumbed in puts a little 90-degree thing

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.790 
plumbed in puts a little 90-degree thing
in<00:02:49.400> here<00:02:49.900> doesn't<00:02:50.900> come<00:02:50.990> with<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.560> if<00:02:51.680> you

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
in here doesn't come with it so if you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.050 
in here doesn't come with it so if you

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
have one of your existing pump you want

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.540 
have one of your existing pump you want
to<00:02:53.120> take<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.360> off<00:02:53.480> or<00:02:53.780> buy<00:02:53.930> one<00:02:54.220> feed<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.370> wires

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
to take it off or buy one feed the wires

just going to test it real quick there's
no<00:03:56.870> water<00:03:57.080> in<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.290> pump<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:57.709> it's<00:03:57.860> not<00:03:57.920> going

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
no water in the pump so it's not going

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.340 
no water in the pump so it's not going
to<00:03:58.160> ruin<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.430> plumbing<00:03:58.850> when<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.690> turn<00:03:59.900> on<00:03:59.930> real

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
to ruin the plumbing when I turn on real

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
this on here I have the timer off over

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.150 
this on here I have the timer off over
there<00:04:06.920> anyway<00:04:07.720> break<00:04:08.720> her<00:04:08.840> back<00:04:08.959> on<00:04:09.230> motor<00:04:09.980> it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
there anyway break her back on motor it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.040 
there anyway break her back on motor it
makes<00:04:10.310> any<00:04:10.490> noise

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
makes any noise

makes any noise
there<00:04:12.050> we<00:04:12.170> go

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.580 

Eston<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.630> got<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.840> do<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.080> take<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.350> ground

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
Eston you got to do is take the ground

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.050 
Eston you got to do is take the ground
wire<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.400> you'll<00:04:20.520> find<00:04:20.730> over<00:04:20.910> by<00:04:21.000> the

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
wire and you'll find over by the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.730 
wire and you'll find over by the
equipment<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.810> hook<00:04:21.960> it<00:04:22.050> on<00:04:22.170> to<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.440> whisper

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
equipment and hook it on to the whisper

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.010 
equipment and hook it on to the whisper
flow<00:04:22.920> it<00:04:23.040> goes<00:04:23.160> underneath<00:04:23.430> actually<00:04:24.090> back

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
flow it goes underneath actually back

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.530 
flow it goes underneath actually back
here<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.470> back<00:04:25.680> there's<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:26.760> little<00:04:27.180> screw

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
here in the back there's a little screw

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.060 
here in the back there's a little screw
for<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.870> ground<00:04:28.140> wire<00:04:28.380> right<00:04:28.620> there<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:29.010> I'm

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
for the ground wire right there so I'm

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.810 
for the ground wire right there so I'm
going<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.220> go<00:04:29.310> ahead<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.520> attach<00:04:29.580> it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.750 

and<00:04:34.300> it's<00:04:34.450> also<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.780> 1/4<00:04:35.290> nut<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:36.460> holds<00:04:36.520> the

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
and it's also a 1/4 nut that holds the

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.110 
and it's also a 1/4 nut that holds the
ground<00:04:36.970> wire<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.390> back<00:04:37.600> there<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.940> now<00:04:40.060> the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
ground wire on back there and so now the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.790 
ground wire on back there and so now the
pump<00:04:40.360> is<00:04:40.510> complete<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.230> wired<00:04:41.440> and

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
pump is complete I have it wired and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.150 
pump is complete I have it wired and
plumbed<00:04:41.940> in<00:04:42.940> there
