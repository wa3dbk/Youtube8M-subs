arrives<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.570> few<00:02:19.600> years<00:02:19.990> ago<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.370> needed

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
arrives a few years ago like I needed

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.910 
arrives a few years ago like I needed
another<00:02:22.000> device<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.810> talk<00:02:23.020> about<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.590> head

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
another device to talk about the head

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.120 
another device to talk about the head
and<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.360> helmet<00:02:26.100> became<00:02:27.100> an<00:02:28.000> alternative

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and so the helmet became an alternative

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.740 
and so the helmet became an alternative
debate<00:02:30.130> it's<00:02:30.459> still<00:02:30.670> concerns<00:02:31.150> ahead<00:02:31.420> but

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.149 
I feel I've had to leave the star behind
because<00:02:59.849> it's<00:03:01.109> it's<00:03:02.109> being<00:03:02.319> heavily<00:03:02.500> used<00:03:02.890> and

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
because it's it's being heavily used and

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.610 
because it's it's being heavily used and
I<00:03:04.709> feel<00:03:05.709> like<00:03:05.859> it's<00:03:06.069> lost<00:03:06.280> its<00:03:07.290> intensity<00:03:08.290> for

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
I feel like it's lost its intensity for

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.640 
I feel like it's lost its intensity for
me<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:09.120> still<00:03:10.120> work<00:03:10.329> you<00:03:10.659> know<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:11.200> my<00:03:11.379> personal

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
me I still work you know in my personal

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.559 
me I still work you know in my personal
work<00:03:12.219> like<00:03:12.579> in<00:03:12.760> work<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.150> doesn't<00:03:13.450> go

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
work like in work that doesn't go

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.069 
work like in work that doesn't go
outside<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:15.609> develops<00:03:16.180> continue<00:03:16.689> to<00:03:16.780> develop

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
outside and develops continue to develop

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.009 
outside and develops continue to develop
it<00:03:17.379> but<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.859> guess<00:03:18.280> it's<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.519> bit<00:03:18.700> like<00:03:18.909> you<00:03:19.870> know

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
it but I guess it's a bit like you know

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.160 
it but I guess it's a bit like you know
when<00:03:20.260> something<00:03:20.560> gets<00:03:20.680> chaotic<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.959> feel

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
when something gets chaotic and I feel

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.190 
when something gets chaotic and I feel
the<00:03:23.379> star<00:03:23.620> thing<00:03:23.920> came<00:03:24.129> artist

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
the star thing came artist

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.090 
the star thing came artist
unfortunately<00:03:27.200> inside

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.790 

absolutely<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:34.570> discusses<00:03:35.570> aspects<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
absolutely it discusses aspects of the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.490 
absolutely it discusses aspects of the
military-industrial<00:03:37.640> complex<00:03:38.200> which<00:03:39.200> is<00:03:39.320> now

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
military-industrial complex which is now

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.890 
military-industrial complex which is now
really<00:03:40.030> not<00:03:41.030> even<00:03:41.240> industrial<00:03:41.480> it's<00:03:41.810> a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
really not even industrial it's a

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.790 
really not even industrial it's a
corporate<00:03:42.290> complex<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:44.030> hobbit'<00:03:44.420> can

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
corporate complex so the hobbit' can

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.410 
corporate complex so the hobbit' can
discuss<00:03:45.800> a<00:03:45.920> whole<00:03:45.950> lot<00:03:46.460> of<00:03:46.490> ideas<00:03:46.820> that<00:03:47.150> the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
discuss a whole lot of ideas that the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.210 
discuss a whole lot of ideas that the
skull<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:48.140> limited

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
skull is limited

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.280 
skull is limited
the<00:03:50.520> limited<00:03:50.910> discussion<00:03:51.270> it's<00:03:51.630> much<00:03:51.870> more<00:03:52.170> of

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
the limited discussion it's much more of

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.970 
the limited discussion it's much more of
an<00:03:52.410> analog<00:03:52.800> mortality<00:03:53.580> as<00:03:53.880> well<00:03:53.940> though<00:03:54.980> the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
an analog mortality as well though the

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.710 
an analog mortality as well though the
helmet<00:03:56.370> looks<00:03:56.610> much<00:03:56.970> more<00:03:57.270> at<00:03:57.570> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
helmet looks much more at the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.490 
helmet looks much more at the
corporatization

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.440 

not<00:04:02.100> only<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.490> war<00:04:02.790> but<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.770> chemistry<00:04:04.770> or

not only of war but of chemistry or

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.820 
not only of war but of chemistry or
within<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.630> particular<00:04:06.900> group<00:04:07.470> their<00:04:07.710> only

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
within this particular group their only

within this particular group their only
gas<00:04:08.300> masters<00:04:09.300> so<00:04:10.340> there<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.460> night-vision

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
gas masters so there is a night-vision

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.200 
gas masters so there is a night-vision
goggles<00:04:13.380> behind<00:04:13.830> me<00:04:13.980> which<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.610> almost<00:04:14.820> like<00:04:15.150> a

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
goggles behind me which is almost like a

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.310 
goggles behind me which is almost like a
helmet<00:04:15.680> scenario<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.360> I<00:04:18.360> think<00:04:19.230> it

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
helmet scenario to it I think it

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.320 
helmet scenario to it I think it
discusses<00:04:19.769> much<00:04:19.980> more<00:04:20.310> about<00:04:20.610> complicity

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
discusses much more about complicity

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.200 
discusses much more about complicity
between<00:04:23.480> companies

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.719

and manufacturing objects that enable
that<00:04:30.000> grief<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.740> profit<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.280> taken<00:04:32.789> from

that grief and the profit is taken from

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.439 
that grief and the profit is taken from

it not the standing again the gas mask

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.490 
it not the standing again the gas mask
is<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:37.520> horrifying<00:04:38.520> image<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.600> think<00:04:40.050> everyone

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
is a horrifying image I think everyone

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.050 
is a horrifying image I think everyone
is<00:04:40.620> scared<00:04:40.830> by<00:04:41.039> gas<00:04:41.250> masks<00:04:41.729> it's<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.810> universal
