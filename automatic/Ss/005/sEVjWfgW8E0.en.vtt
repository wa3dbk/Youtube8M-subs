first<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.170> really<00:03:33.410> just<00:03:33.560> was<00:03:33.740> curious<00:03:34.040> how<00:03:34.400> much

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
first I really just was curious how much

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.980 
first I really just was curious how much
this<00:03:34.700> would<00:03:34.880> do<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.390> I<00:03:35.420> don't<00:03:35.660> know<00:03:35.780> if<00:03:35.840> he's

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
this would do and I don't know if he's

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.540 
this would do and I don't know if he's
specially<00:03:36.440> or<00:03:36.560> physically<00:03:36.920> defensive<00:03:37.370> but

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
specially or physically defensive but

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.150 
specially or physically defensive but
that<00:03:37.730> does<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.910> lot<00:03:38.000> regardless<00:03:38.960> because<00:03:39.140> as<00:03:40.070> I

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
that does a lot regardless because as I

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.700 
that does a lot regardless because as I
said<00:03:40.220> I'm<00:03:40.430> timid<00:03:40.730> modest<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.720> man<00:03:42.680> that

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
said I'm timid modest and the man that

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.370 
said I'm timid modest and the man that
does<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> lot<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.730> he<00:03:44.690> actually<00:03:44.870> doesn't<00:03:45.200> even

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
does a lot and he actually doesn't even

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.070 
does a lot and he actually doesn't even
finish<00:03:45.740> me<00:03:45.890> off<00:03:45.920> with<00:03:46.040> with<00:03:46.580> HP<00:03:47.240> ice<00:03:47.420> which<00:03:48.050> is
