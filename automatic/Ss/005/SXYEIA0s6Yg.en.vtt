purple color so I think it's nice to
have<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.280> contrast<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.390> helps<00:01:09.659> set<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
have that contrast it helps set up a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.350 
have that contrast it helps set up a
sense<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> depth<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
sense of depth and then here at the

and reach higher than perhaps i have
even<00:02:09.479> reached<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.400> it's<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.670> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.060> symbol

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
even reached so it's that kind of symbol

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.250 
even reached so it's that kind of symbol
ilysm<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.430> visual<00:02:14.090> language<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.780> metaphor

ilysm that visual language and metaphor
that<00:02:15.290> we're<00:02:15.590> using<00:02:15.799> in<00:02:16.069> here<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.459> I'd<00:02:16.549> like

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
that we're using in here that I'd like

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.460 
that we're using in here that I'd like
you<00:02:16.849> to<00:02:16.970> keep<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.269> mind<00:02:17.299> as<00:02:17.659> you're<00:02:18.049> composing

your paintings on what else all we'll

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.589 
your paintings on what else all we'll
just<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.159> little<00:02:22.400> bit<00:02:22.519> about<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.849> color<00:02:23.090> here

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
just a little bit about the color here

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.190 
just a little bit about the color here
what<00:02:24.560> I've<00:02:24.709> done<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:25.250> I've<00:02:25.909> used<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.599> lot<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.959> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
what I've done is I've used a lot of the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.830 
what I've done is I've used a lot of the
the<00:02:27.769> world<00:02:28.069> around<00:02:28.430> me<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.909> create<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.510> piece

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
the world around me to create this piece

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.680 
the world around me to create this piece
I<00:02:30.739> think<00:02:31.310> that's<00:02:31.730> very<00:02:31.819> important<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.629> think

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
I think that's very important I think

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.630 
I think that's very important I think
you<00:02:32.989> have<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.200> really<00:02:33.560> connect<00:02:34.129> with<00:02:34.220> your<00:02:34.430> art

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
you have to really connect with your art

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.059 
you have to really connect with your art
and<00:02:34.790> every<00:02:35.269> way<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.569> you<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> lot

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
and every way that you can and so a lot

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.039 
and every way that you can and so a lot
of<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.790> colors<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.360> I've<00:02:38.480> used<00:02:38.510> here

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
of the the colors that I've used here

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.589 
of the the colors that I've used here
are<00:02:39.230> from<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.860> local<00:02:40.220> flora<00:02:40.579> and<00:02:40.730> fauna<00:02:41.150> here

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
are from the local flora and fauna here

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.229 
are from the local flora and fauna here
and<00:02:41.659> dimension<00:02:42.230> Z<00:02:42.440> that's<00:02:42.950> necessary<00:02:43.700> for<00:02:44.060> me

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
and dimension Z that's necessary for me

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.650 
and dimension Z that's necessary for me
because<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.620> don't<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.489> any<00:02:46.760> stores<00:02:47.180> here

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
because I don't have any stores here

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.599 
because I don't have any stores here
there<00:02:47.900> are<00:02:48.140> no<00:02:48.379> art<00:02:48.590> supply<00:02:49.010> stores<00:02:49.340> and

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
there are no art supply stores and

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.180 
there are no art supply stores and
dimension<00:02:50.060> Z<00:02:50.239> it's<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:51.079> hellish<00:02:51.620> terrible

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
dimension Z it's a hellish terrible

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.119 
dimension Z it's a hellish terrible
dimension<00:02:52.640> ruled<00:02:52.910> by<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.540> villainous<00:02:54.500> overlord

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
dimension ruled by a villainous overlord

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.599 
dimension ruled by a villainous overlord
so<00:02:55.879> I<00:02:56.450> can't<00:02:57.290> really<00:02:57.440> go<00:02:57.709> down<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.190> buy<00:02:58.340> some

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
so I can't really go down and buy some

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.490 
so I can't really go down and buy some
paints<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.569> I<00:02:59.629> think<00:03:00.049> that<00:03:00.290> it's<00:03:00.440> really

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
paints but I think that it's really

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.069 
paints but I think that it's really
brought<00:03:01.190> out<00:03:01.220> something<00:03:01.849> even<00:03:02.299> more<00:03:02.450> personal

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
brought out something even more personal

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.780 
brought out something even more personal
than<00:03:03.109> me<00:03:03.349> I've<00:03:03.470> had<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.859> go<00:03:04.010> out<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.430> I've<00:03:04.549> had

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
than me I've had to go out and I've had

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.920 
than me I've had to go out and I've had
to<00:03:04.940> crush<00:03:05.659> plants<00:03:06.560> had<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.220> find<00:03:07.549> bugs<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.540> sort

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
to crush plants had to find bugs to sort

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.410 
to crush plants had to find bugs to sort
of<00:03:09.049> mole<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.799> mulch<00:03:10.129> into<00:03:10.640> into<00:03:11.060> some<00:03:11.299> of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
of mole and mulch into into some of

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.970 
of mole and mulch into into some of
these<00:03:11.540> cups<00:03:11.840> it's<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.319> this<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:12.709> this

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
these cups it's like this is this this

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.300 
these cups it's like this is this this
sort<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.840> middle<00:03:14.840> tone<00:03:15.379> here<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.190> we've

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
guess what will be Congress to a bile

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.699 
guess what will be Congress to a bile
duct<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.419> some<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.840> local<00:03:24.169> animals<00:03:24.590> you

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
duct and some of the local animals you

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.000 
duct and some of the local animals you
see<00:03:24.859> when<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.700> frocks<00:03:26.200> eat<00:03:27.200> these<00:03:27.530> animals

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
see when the frocks eat these animals

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.009 
see when the frocks eat these animals
they<00:03:28.190> use<00:03:28.400> all<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:29.000> parts<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.510> them<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.840> want

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
they use all the parts of them you want

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.349 
they use all the parts of them you want
to<00:03:30.109> use<00:03:30.200> everything<00:03:30.530> things<00:03:30.950> are<00:03:31.129> very

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
to use everything things are very

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.610 
to use everything things are very
resources<00:03:32.359> are<00:03:32.480> very<00:03:32.660> rare<00:03:32.959> here<00:03:33.349> which<00:03:33.500> I

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
resources are very rare here which I

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.800 
resources are very rare here which I
think<00:03:33.799> makes<00:03:33.919> them<00:03:34.099> very<00:03:34.250> special<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.540> use

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
think makes them very special so to use

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.869 
think makes them very special so to use
something<00:03:36.169> for<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.560> painting<00:03:36.889> to<00:03:37.250> take

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
something for a painting to take

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.180 
something for a painting to take
something<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.629> really<00:03:39.169> put<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.620> artistic

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
something and really put it to artistic

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.729 
something and really put it to artistic
use<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.579> very<00:03:40.790> necessary<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.870> important<00:03:42.560> and

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
use is very necessary and important and

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.949 
use is very necessary and important and
and<00:03:42.919> it<00:03:43.400> really<00:03:43.639> means<00:03:44.030> something<00:03:44.359> to<00:03:44.690> me<00:03:44.720> and

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
and it really means something to me and

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.839 
and it really means something to me and
mean<00:03:45.349> something<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:45.829> my<00:03:46.099> son<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.699> these

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
mean something to my son and to these

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.789 
mean something to my son and to these
people<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.419> have<00:03:47.599> this<00:03:47.810> art<00:03:48.109> really<00:03:48.440> sort<00:03:48.739> of

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
people to have this art really sort of

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.710 
people to have this art really sort of
brings<00:03:49.430> something<00:03:49.699> out<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.120> their<00:03:50.239> life<00:03:50.419> and<00:03:50.629> I

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
brings something out in their life and I

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.869 
brings something out in their life and I
