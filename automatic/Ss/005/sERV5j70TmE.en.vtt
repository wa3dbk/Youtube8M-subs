so<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.230> read<00:00:07.379> an<00:00:07.470> article<00:00:07.560> that's<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.099> catalyst

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
so I read an article that's a catalyst

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.890 
so I read an article that's a catalyst
for<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.849> video<00:00:09.150> about<00:00:09.300> boosting<00:00:09.870> your

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
for this video about boosting your

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.259 
for this video about boosting your
brainpower<00:00:10.320> by<00:00:11.160> doing<00:00:11.519> things<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.969> hard<00:00:12.000> way

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
brainpower by doing things the hard way

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.459 
brainpower by doing things the hard way
I<00:00:12.509> started<00:00:12.780> thinking<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.080> how<00:00:13.290> this

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
I started thinking about how this

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.259 
I started thinking about how this
translates<00:00:14.009> until<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> Apple<00:00:14.849> versus<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
translates until the Apple versus the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.970 
translates until the Apple versus the
world<00:00:15.599> debates<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.260> are<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.890> of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
world debates that are going on one of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.349 
world debates that are going on one of
the<00:00:17.039> more<00:00:17.190> common<00:00:17.520> complaints<00:00:17.850> about<00:00:17.940> Apple

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the more common complaints about Apple

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.720 
the more common complaints about Apple
users<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.810> they're<00:00:19.140> dumb<00:00:19.439> lazy<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.580> they

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
users is that they're dumb lazy and they

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.519 
users is that they're dumb lazy and they
like<00:00:20.939> doing<00:00:21.240> things<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.539> easy<00:00:21.570> way<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.230> they

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
like doing things the easy way and they

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.170 
like doing things the easy way and they
don't<00:00:22.650> know<00:00:22.800> anything<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.340> computers<00:00:23.609> now

power users and for Windows users for
similar<00:00:30.060> reasons<00:00:30.090> now<00:00:30.630> while<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> agree<00:00:31.230> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
similar reasons now while I agree that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.850 
similar reasons now while I agree that
things<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:31.980> easier<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> Mac

things can be easier on a Mac
understanding<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.010> easier<00:00:35.700> translates<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
understanding how easier translates to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.229 
understanding how easier translates to
being<00:00:37.020> dumber<00:00:37.730> I<00:00:38.730> mean<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.059> think<00:00:39.210> about

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
being dumber I mean when you think about

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
being dumber I mean when you think about

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
last month but I started thinking about

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
last month but I started thinking about
shows<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.720> Star<00:01:06.840> Trek<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.860> were

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
shows like Star Trek that really were

designed to show us how technology makes
things<00:01:10.890> easier<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> dream<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
things easier it was a dream of the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.700 
things easier it was a dream of the
creator<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.750> show<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.170> everyone
