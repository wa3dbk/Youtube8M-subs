quite a lot I would use Charizard but he

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.160 
quite a lot I would use Charizard but he
was<00:01:25.549> just<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:25.880> little<00:01:26.180> bit<00:01:26.299> too<00:01:26.479> slow<00:01:26.869> for<00:01:26.899> my

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
was just a little bit too slow for my

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.749 
was just a little bit too slow for my
liking<00:01:27.439> in<00:01:27.710> Super<00:01:27.950> Smash<00:01:27.979> for<00:01:28.399> this<00:01:28.490> brawl

hopefully<00:01:29.479> as<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.600> mega<00:01:29.810> evolution<00:01:29.869> is<00:01:30.380> a

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
hopefully as a mega evolution is a

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.709 
hopefully as a mega evolution is a
little<00:01:30.770> bit<00:01:30.890> faster<00:01:31.369> but<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.909> don't<00:01:32.479> think

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
little bit faster but I don't think

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.209 
little bit faster but I don't think
anything's<00:01:33.170> gonna<00:01:33.320> be<00:01:33.439> greninja<00:01:33.920> in<00:01:34.100> the

game and last but quite possibly the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.539

shown<00:01:58.009> as<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:58.700> said<00:01:58.880> earlier<00:01:59.210> yveltal<00:01:59.810> doesn't

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
shown as I said earlier yveltal doesn't

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.899 
shown as I said earlier yveltal doesn't
appear<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:00.289> be<00:02:00.439> present<00:02:01.039> but<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:01.429> know<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
appear to be present but you know the

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.819 
appear to be present but you know the
game<00:02:02.090> isn't<00:02:02.420> finished<00:02:02.689> with<00:02:03.020> production<00:02:03.469> yet

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
greninja probably takes the cake but

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.099 
greninja probably takes the cake but
