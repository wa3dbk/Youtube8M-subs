00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.240
 always check that my son is 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.000
 always above the pallet 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.050

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:17.040
 and then I always take the little 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.040
 sons like these young ones slips 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.180
 in the ring in the loop and that I 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.629
 made 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.629
 here 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:42.840
 i weigh my soul are the alsace is a 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.470
 week shooting on the big son 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.470
 which is done 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.590
 you see that I have my son who is 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.299
 always above the pallet 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.829
 why am I doing this because everything 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.379
 just that I'm going to make a trout 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.650
 the position of the trout of the hook 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.659
 we're going to end up with a thread 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.569
 who climb like that who does not touch 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:09.269
 the appliance of the house if I left 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.150
 my share my son underneath looking up like 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.700
 that and disney on the palette and could 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.010
 break often missing a fish 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.569
 they say she broke my class and because 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.790
 that just the son rubbed on 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.349
 the pallet has weakened and during the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.079
 fight 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.970
 this son has let go so it's very 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.859
 importantly I'm very careful about 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.169
 that monkey always above the 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.049
 palette 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.819
 then I make a decision and I 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.359
 chopped off 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.359
 the queue surplus 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.930
 this is my soul went up see it 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.940
 lasted a few seconds went very quickly 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.970
 do so often I prepare some 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.210
 souls at home at home I ride 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.490
 on a leader 1 / and I have them 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.650
 always available when I 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.120
 fishing it saves me from wasting time at 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.790
 edge of the good the times to fishing 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.620
 it's totally relative to the east 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.580
 I hope it helps you 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.580
