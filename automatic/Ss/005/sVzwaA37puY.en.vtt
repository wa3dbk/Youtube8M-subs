00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the overall speed oven that you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.980 
the overall speed oven that you
basically<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.190> jump<00:01:29.400> every<00:01:29.670> single<00:01:29.970> gap

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990

like you have to get to jump over every

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
like you have to get to jump over every
single<00:01:35.250> thing<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.910> even<00:01:36.060> hit<00:01:36.270> once

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.920 

I<00:02:12.300> wish<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> projectile<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.920> didn't<00:02:14.280> like

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
I wish the projectile it didn't like

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
I wish the projectile it didn't like
like<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> wasn't<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> boomerang<00:02:16.650> that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
like it wasn't like a boomerang that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.710 
like it wasn't like a boomerang that
actually<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:17.700> fired<00:02:17.940> straight<00:02:18.270> forward

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
actually just fired straight forward

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.380 
actually just fired straight forward
that<00:02:19.290> way<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.530> could<00:02:19.710> at<00:02:19.890> least<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.460> you

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that way you could at least like you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.120 
that way you could at least like you
know<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.840> available<00:02:22.020> because<00:02:22.800> likes

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
know have it available because likes

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.740 
know have it available because likes
like<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.120> can't<00:02:24.360> do<00:02:24.480> anything<00:02:24.510> about

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
like that like I can't do anything about

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.690 
like that like I can't do anything about
that<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.200> hits<00:02:25.350> once<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.550> goes

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
that because it hits once and it goes

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.920 
that because it hits once and it goes
through<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.030> doesn't<00:02:27.150> count<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> second

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
through it doesn't count for the second

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:37.580 
through it doesn't count for the second
hit<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> ninja<00:02:34.640> holy<00:02:35.640> balls<00:02:36.120> dude<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
hit of the ninja holy balls dude I I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.680 
hit of the ninja holy balls dude I I
don't<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.460> like<00:02:38.700> really<00:02:39.000> fast<00:02:39.270> games

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
don't know like I like really fast games

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.020 
don't know like I like really fast games
but<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.710> is<00:02:40.860> almost<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.220> little<00:02:41.460> bit<00:02:41.550> unfair

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
but this is almost a little bit unfair

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.330 
but this is almost a little bit unfair
because<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.170> speed<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.220> game

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
because it's like the speed of the game

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.760 
because it's like the speed of the game
makes<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.540> can't<00:02:45.810> even<00:02:45.990> react<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
makes it so that you can't even react to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.500 
makes it so that you can't even react to
some<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.130> shit<00:02:47.310> coming<00:02:47.610> up<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.910> terms<00:02:48.360> of

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
some of the shit coming up in terms of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.550 
some of the shit coming up in terms of
throwing<00:02:48.810> out<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.990> project<00:02:49.290> well<00:02:49.380> not<00:02:49.530> even

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
throwing out the project well not even

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.740 
throwing out the project well not even
that<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:49.950> can't<00:02:50.190> react<00:02:50.460> but<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.330> there's<00:02:51.690> a

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that you can't react but like there's a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
that you can't react but like there's a
lot<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.900> times<00:02:52.170> where<00:02:52.320> all<00:02:52.380> throughout<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
lot of times where all throughout the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.820 
lot of times where all throughout the
projectile<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.580> I'll<00:02:54.300> have<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:55.320> know<00:02:55.470> out

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
projectile and I'll have it you know out

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.220 
projectile and I'll have it you know out
in<00:02:56.100> front<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.400> me<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:57.510> can't<00:02:57.840> get<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.080> back

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
in front of me and I can't get it back

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.720 
in front of me and I can't get it back
in<00:02:58.380> time<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.680> hit<00:02:58.830> something<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.220> need<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.520> hit

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
in time to hit something I need to hit

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.180 
in time to hit something I need to hit
in<00:02:59.880> front<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.270> me<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:01.140> one<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.740> openings

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
in front of me like one of the openings

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.070 
in front of me like one of the openings
to<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.490> gateways<00:03:02.850> because<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> game<00:03:03.930> just

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
to the gateways because the game just

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.590 
to the gateways because the game just
goes<00:03:04.260> too<00:03:04.440> fast<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:05.160> would<00:03:05.850> say<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> projectile

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
goes too fast I would say the projectile

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.660 
goes too fast I would say the projectile
either<00:03:06.840> needs<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.110> be<00:03:07.260> sped<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.620> or<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.550> game

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
either needs to be sped up or the game

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.310 
either needs to be sped up or the game
needs<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:08.940> be<00:03:09.060> slowed<00:03:09.330> down<00:03:09.540> or<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:10.020> needs<00:03:10.140> to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
needs to be slowed down or it needs to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.750 
needs to be slowed down or it needs to
not<00:03:10.440> be<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> boomerang<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.730> a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
not be a boomerang and just be a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.190 
not be a boomerang and just be a
straight<00:03:12.060> for<00:03:12.270> projectile<00:03:12.660> shot<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.080> it'd<00:03:13.140> be

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
straight for projectile shot and it'd be

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.870 
straight for projectile shot and it'd be
a<00:03:13.230> lot<00:03:13.410> more<00:03:13.470> fair<00:03:16.190> because<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.370> projectiles

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
a lot more fair because the projectiles

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.190 
a lot more fair because the projectiles
pretty<00:03:18.090> much<00:03:18.240> just<00:03:18.360> like<00:03:18.510> guess<00:03:18.750> work<00:03:18.960> at<00:03:19.080> this
