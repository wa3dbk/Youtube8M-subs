 flight this map translates into Spanish 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.619
 as complex as we have just seen it is not 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.210
 compare you but the truth is that a 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.250

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.750
 facilities what you can understand more 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.640
 or less is that they are facilities of 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.440
 the uni how good they are to plan 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.289
 defensive attacks already know as a 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.210
 center of I do not know where in case of fall 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.620
 in emergencies where they can go and then 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.629
 to plan to restock or 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.640
 plan a good attack plan does not 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.399
 will you fulfill flash is that to me this 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.770
 map I really like here I can see 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.050
 these armors marks 5 if I do not 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.260
 mistaken 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.210
 marc 55 march and I do not remember well and 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.980
 good the armor that we have behind 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.530
 they are super cool is a guy with the 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.980
 carbine another time with the dmr and the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.990
 spartan that has the rifle the rigid the 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.400
 battle rifle look great from the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.470
 armor the truth is that I like 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.330
 very much I click on him quite a lot 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.580
 to be so good the armors in this 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.860
 part we can appreciate the with the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.930
 carbine that are firing at this one 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.550
 spartan and well, it's worth highlighting for 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.190
 those who have not heard that the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.290
 carbine is super powerful is to say 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.960
 so they have been able to play in the pack 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.000
 without 3 Carbine it is very very 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.040
 passed here in the state we can also 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.650
 see what the plasma rifle has 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 plasma gun and it's good you see that 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.460
 he just dropped all the blood with the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.380
 shot charged at this guy that's 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.000
 another very powerful combination like how 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.980
 I have to tell you for all those who do not 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.480
 they know it is the plasma pistolite with 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.950
 a bullet that gives you this low all 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.870
 blood I say it because there are people who do not 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.700
 he knows there are halo fans who do not know 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.890
 but for the last image here we 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.480
 they showed the flowers we can observe 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.030
 that two of them have a color 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:16.260
 yellowish and one has an orange color 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.180
 not so good I do not know if you can go 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.950

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.140
