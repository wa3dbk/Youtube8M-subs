00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Here he sat in it as the misfortune 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 happened now his truck is complete 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.500
 burnt out his existential basis 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.360
 destroyed 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.070
 At this sight come Harald 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.460
 Furtwängler suddenly remembers 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.859
 back up what happened a few days ago 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.720
 on the A 61 at Niederzissen in the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.970
 eifel has happened, he still can 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.289
 barely grasp 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 in the middle of the highway gets his 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.130
 truck in fire 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.920
 the straw that was loaded trailer 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.920
 caught fire and everything goes up in flames 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.960
 I started somewhere I do not know where 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.600
 I can not say it 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 the flames are high here because 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.350
 beaten and I have the flames 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.920
 seen and then the then top again 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.829
 straw 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.930
 We 're still driving with Harald Furtwängler 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.699
 once the distance that he the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.500
 has noticed the flames in time 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.960
 Truck driver to his passenger too 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.420
 owe and nicky is always there 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.570
 he is also sitting on the wrong day 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.570
 cabin 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 in front of the restaurant porch then had 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.110
 really wild and then has 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 really started me on the arm and wanted 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.720
 even umila has started to twist like that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.729
 migration routes then I looked around so 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.080
 and then behind the flames behind 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.750
 see me go up 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.800
 hunt niki just has its owner 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.990
 warned in time 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.790
 Harald Furtwängler drives up immediately 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.150
 a rest stop I just watched 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.310
 that I drive over here quickly 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.229
 come left past and at the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.810
 gas station and here here the burned 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.790
 here exactly the place the fire department is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.740
 Quick to set because it is cold and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.149
 the extinguishing water must freeze the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.000
 fight fire with foam 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.369
 but there is not much left over from the truck 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.320
 rule and dog remain unharmed 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.560
 They were able to break through 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.330
 The flames save how sensitive a dog 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.259
 can react if he suspects danger 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.360
 white petit l just took over a lot 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.479
 better sense organs than we in the sense 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.920
 from higher and from the smell and the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.299
 take what was natural and me 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.489
 find that the dog for the sixth 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.260
 are already yes why the fire 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.370
 should ever break out now 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.350
 clarify the report 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.420
 the damage will be 90,000 euros 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.459
 Harald Furtwängler is indeed appreciated 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.100
 he is assured but at most the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.140
 he refunds the truck's value 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.510
 for his future as a freelancer 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.610
 truck driver in this difficult 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:41.519
 situation gives him his german shepherd 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:43.320
 niki consolation niki has his master 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.940
 probably saved the life 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.739
 harald furtwängler becomes the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.140
 Vierbeiner therefore not only a faithful 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.709
 friend but also his guardian angel 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.709
 stay
