00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 still lies the airport or one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.279
 white snow cover and not even the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.319
 start and runway can be seen 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.940
 but three days after easter everyone should 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.740
 work to be completed and the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.750
 airport will be opened 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 on Tuesday morning were the first 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.980
 on-site statisticians the later 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.260
 process during check-in simulated 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.180
 a computer failure at full 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.539
 Airport operation is quite possible 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.039
 stood on the plan 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.869
 we're rehearsing this morning where today 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.260
 just stand the normal check in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 Operation under the scenario that the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 check in system has failed and that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.129
 be carried out manually check here 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.440
 must total groups the first 30 of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.469
 7,000 volunteers start operating the new 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.930
 airport from 14 april this year the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.670
 The day of the official opening should be everything 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.620
 to work smoothly or 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.890
 at least willmann always break 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.070
 can not happen unprepared 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.230
 face 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 The test persons receive for their 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.340
 work next to a lunch and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.800
 free drinks a chance every day 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.500
 air ticket to warmer regions 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.600
 jÃ¶rg ries managing director of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.810
 Flughafen gmbh is very confident 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.850
 in relation to the upcoming one 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.340
 Opening date in April 2013 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.600
 So we have the downtime now 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.689
 for example through snow and ice 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.380
 definitely result in the planning in it 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.150
 but that's just the infrastructure 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.439
 our operational preparation is also 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.729
 We have the processes 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.000
 We have the staff defined 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.670
 set and now we bring both 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.320
 Infrastructures staff together 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.700
 Airport construction and planning is currently 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 always in conversation 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.790
 the disaster of berlin almost makes 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.409
 daily the round 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.509
 also the press conference at the airport 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.700
 the managing director was asked the question 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.710
 why does that work in calden and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.869
 not in Berlin you can because one 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.140
 such mega project ever with one 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.490
 Compare such airport 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 So you can get it from the infrastructure 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.670
 her and the requirements of the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.320
 infrastructure brings to the example 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.790
 fire protection and other topics are not 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.829
 compare not compare at all 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.450
 if a small airport with 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.549
 clear infrastructure all 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.350
 things like the terminal are relatively small 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.880
 they see it 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.260
 he himself also simply structures that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.700
 is completely different in berlin is 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.900
 By the way, at my home airport 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.540
 frankfurt also very different 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.569
 But the question is always how to get one 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.510
 project organizes an expansion project 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.200
 in particular you have to mix there 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.100
 find your own team 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.830
 between a very good one 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.420
 project control the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.870
 management in the case then at 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.160
 Us here, so to speak, under the arms 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.610
 because they can not do it all alone 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.350
 do 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.970
 You must have the right planner 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.550
 you must also disconnect 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.720
 between planning and project control 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.510
 All these things are natural here 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.280
 also much easier and because we 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.900
 from fraport the good experiences in 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.209
 you have many many projects 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.860
 this know-how yes also bought the 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.959
 Opening of the airport in Kassel 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.440
 calden is therefore probably nothing more 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.840
 ways 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.670
 the plan has obviously worked out 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.530
 it remains to be hoped that this will happen 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.220
 Millions project on the way too 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.220
 worth
