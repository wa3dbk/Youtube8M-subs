00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.560
 Hello, my name is Martín Sati 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 and I'm a graphic designer and illustrator 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.020
 or vice versa, 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.980
 and I work with clients from all over the world 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.840
 within the advertising field. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.140
 [Music] 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.860
 And between work and work, I like to experiment 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.920
 and formulate creative processes 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.260
 to find unexpected results. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.660
 For example, one day draw a horse, 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.960
 that following a graphic process, 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.480
 I ended up in an explosion of colors, 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.820
 it was expanding, 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.240
 playing with the lines 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.980
 and ending by covering the initial idea of ​​the horse. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.360
 [Music] 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.100
 In this course we are going to create an illustration 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.860
 from the creative process. 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.660
 I will share with you 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.000
 one of my creative processes, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.720
 that will be worked through the concept of the micro-story. 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.540
 A micro story is a process, 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.240
 a development of an illustration 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 in ten steps that we will see in this course. 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.440
 [Music] 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.840
 We will begin by defining what a micro-story is 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.060
 and from there we will get a story. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.680
 Once we simplify the story, 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.980
 from the chemistry of the elements, 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.440
 let's create an image. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.080
 [Music] 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.390
 We are going to do a graphic development. 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.040
 Through a craft process 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.300
 we will build a piece 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.880
 and once this piece is built, 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.020
 let's work with a storyboard 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.580
 where do I do my project 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.980
 and I will finish with an audiovisual piece. 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.100

 a notebook where to write down important things 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.800
 and a vector program 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.340
 to develop your own creative process. 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.220
