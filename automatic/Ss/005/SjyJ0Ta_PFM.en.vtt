00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.690
 supporters 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.410
 the fringe 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.230
 What are they doing 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.230
 with our football 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.369
 they are aggressive 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009
 they explain at all times 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.369
 football became 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.369
 What you want 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.520
 but why would the fans be so aggressive? 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.190
 Where does violence come from? 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.620
 he will answer these questions is Dr. joÃ£o ricardo 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.770
 sport he specialized in the behavior of the fans 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.080
 very well, I think it's important that these 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.320
 I made an event on this issue of violence 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.510
 to the attention of the identity of the individual who goes to the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.750
 we often see 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.560
 people going to the stadium heads of household people of good team 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.430
 will try to identity its self-image we can say the opera of the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.930
 sting depending on the needs of the group's needs or he thinks 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.420
 passed the dissolved identity 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.760
 In order to give an account, I asked you to say 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.930
 within a collective in the case of the organized crowd in my view the sport 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.380
 being very little guarded and turned a land unprotected traction 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.100
 violent and aggressive behavior of people who do not find a way to 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.460
 of this aggressiveness and unfortunately ended up invading in space what 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.360
 theoretically 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.730
 pro-life 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.380
 the healthy space the actress had continuously turned into a land of 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 no one is a war space 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.820
 doctor entering middle age of soccer fan when team loses 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.209
 He wrote 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.220
 only in results of the stadium when the team wins they also break everything down 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:13.989
 what 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.989
 she listened to the soccer team's soccer lap every fan's lap 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:19.429
 ends 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:24.369
 within the concept of coffee siaca points out that a concept proposed by Freud 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:31.009
 erekat in which cia is the intense affective deposit redman energy the object in the case 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:35.519
 the object is football in the case the affective energy is inside these fans 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.309
 fanatics 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.599
 they channeled all the energy of good and evil 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.339
 called soccer team 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.339
 psyche researcher 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.829
 that the measure of these fans is capable 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.650
 who will administer feet 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.859
 in the field of football 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.849
 Not really, no, I guess. 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.090
 the level of tolerance there is a level of aggressiveness there is a level of 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.090
 mental and emotional structure 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.749
 can not be tolerated is in the coexistence inside the stadium I do not believe in the end 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.099
 of violence in football 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.099
 unfortunately 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.469
 and then Jocelito will be that soccer is a passion that builds 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.299
