00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.870 
mum and dad they can actually watch
underwater<00:03:38.230> as<00:03:38.590> well<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.220> they<00:03:39.400> can<00:03:39.430> kind<00:03:39.790> of

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
underwater as well so they can kind of

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.699
