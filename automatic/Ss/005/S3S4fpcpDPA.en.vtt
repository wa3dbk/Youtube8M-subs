00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello I'm on stage students of the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.480
 training designer and illustrator 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 because it was a small dream 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.310
 girl to become an illustrator and so 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 after my fine arts training 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.300
 I evolve dying specialized in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.930
 the illustration because my training had 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.930
 been very wide 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 so I did some small 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.719
 various school searches and the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.120
 wafer is much more the contact 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.309
 that I had with the reception was very 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.860
 very well passed I already felt 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.600
 very surrounded I saw the police of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.379
 teachers who loved me enormously 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.449
 also followed a training in 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 distance because it's a matter of 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.469
 character first of all i'm a bit of a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.170
 mule head and I have trouble working 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.640
 with a teacher above me said 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.820
 you have to correct if you have to correct that 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.159
 after there is an ease also part to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.080
 a school is very expensive when you 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.820
 account training plus the apartment 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.150
 if we are not from the city where is 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.430
 school so distance education and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.950
 what turned out to be best for 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.350
 I'm always in the process 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.549
 to question ourselves and we 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.960
 the impression of having the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.700
 teachers also just for us 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.820
 always in private lessons so 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.350
 it's a real pleasure to work 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.340
 after I enjoyed everything 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.460
 that they were 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.530
 pure and hard techniques with 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.799
 two ways where we actually make 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.280
 drawings so that's a pleasure to 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.229
 to work 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
 here I worked rather by 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.880
 internet by the way the teachers have 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.000
 been very responsive we have very strong answers 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.729
 quickly without ever losing then 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.219
 currently I opened my business 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.979
 there are about three years so I have a 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.869
 graphic design and illustration company 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.869
 and everything is going very well 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.010
 yes and without regret since this 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.150
 training was the pillar in fact of the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.590
 creation of my company 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.590
 so I'm very proud of it
