00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
for a folding pocket knife or a folding

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.289 
for a folding pocket knife or a folding
knife<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.130> should<00:01:49.310> say<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:49.969> might<00:01:50.149> be<00:01:50.270> a

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
knife I should say this might be a

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.519 
knife I should say this might be a
little<00:01:50.450> bit<00:01:50.599> too<00:01:50.749> big<00:01:50.929> for<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.109> pocket<00:01:51.319> knife

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:51.529 
little bit too big for a pocket knife

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:53.589 
little bit too big for a pocket knife
for<00:01:51.770> some<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.069> us<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.909> weight<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.209> six<00:01:53.389> point

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
for some of us the weight is six point

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.940 
for some of us the weight is six point
three<00:01:53.779> ounces<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.319> for<00:01:54.469> me<00:01:54.560> that's<00:01:54.709> a<00:01:54.829> little

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
three ounces and for me that's a little

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.679 
three ounces and for me that's a little
bit<00:01:55.069> too<00:01:55.189> heavy<00:01:55.340> for<00:01:55.819> an<00:01:56.060> EDC

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
bit too heavy for an EDC

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.120 
bit too heavy for an EDC
but<00:01:57.169> again<00:01:57.349> I'm<00:01:57.439> throwing<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.919> a<00:01:57.979> range

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
but again I'm throwing this in a range

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.649 
but again I'm throwing this in a range
bag<00:01:58.429> or<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.789> bag<00:01:58.939> when<00:01:59.119> I<00:01:59.179> head<00:01:59.299> out<00:01:59.329> to<00:01:59.569> the

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
bag or a bag when I head out to the

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.139 
bag or a bag when I head out to the
woods<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:01.369> know<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.609> weights<00:02:01.789> not<00:02:01.909> really

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
woods so you know the weights not really

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.760 
woods so you know the weights not really
a<00:02:02.179> huge<00:02:02.450> issue<00:02:02.659> when<00:02:02.929> it<00:02:03.020> comes<00:02:03.079> to<00:02:03.380> using<00:02:03.679> it

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
a huge issue when it comes to using it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.709 
a huge issue when it comes to using it
that<00:02:03.919> way<00:02:04.099> now<00:02:04.669> speaking<00:02:04.969> of<00:02:05.060> opening<00:02:05.419> it<00:02:05.539> it's

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
that way now speaking of opening it it's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.359 
that way now speaking of opening it it's
cool<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.139> way<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.289> do<00:02:06.439> that<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.159> get<00:02:07.219> this

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
cool the way you do that is you get this

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.979 
cool the way you do that is you get this
flipper<00:02:07.729> here<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.239> then<00:02:08.450> one<00:02:08.599> over<00:02:08.630> on<00:02:08.869> this

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
flipper here and then one over on this

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.630 
flipper here and then one over on this
side<00:02:09.050> here<00:02:09.500> basically<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.160> push<00:02:10.399> this<00:02:10.550> guy

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
side here basically you push this guy

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.180 
side here basically you push this guy
back<00:02:10.940> toward<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.270> handle<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.920> blade

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
back toward the handle and that blade

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.190 
back toward the handle and that blade
locks<00:02:13.490> open<00:02:13.940> really<00:02:14.480> nice<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.900> now<00:02:14.960> because

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
locks open really nice and now because

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.370 
locks open really nice and now because
of<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
of the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.990 
of the
weight<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.710> blade<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:16.610> swings

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
weight of the blade it really swings

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.330 
weight of the blade it really swings
fully<00:02:17.450> locks<00:02:17.900> into<00:02:18.080> place<00:02:18.230> nicely<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.950> you

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
fully locks into place nicely and you

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
fully locks into place nicely and you
know<00:02:19.460> I'm<00:02:19.520> not<00:02:19.670> worried<00:02:19.910> about<00:02:19.940> it

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
know I'm not worried about it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.420

getting<00:02:21.140> halfway<00:02:21.380> they're<00:02:21.740> not<00:02:21.980> locking<00:02:22.220> it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
getting halfway they're not locking it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.800 
getting halfway they're not locking it
fully<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.150> other<00:02:23.240> nice<00:02:23.390> thing<00:02:23.510> about<00:02:23.570> these

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.270 
design m16 14 zs F let's see a couple of
things<00:04:09.290> let's<00:04:09.500> talk<00:04:09.530> about<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.860> auto<00:04:10.010> lock

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
things let's talk about the auto lock

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.390 
things let's talk about the auto lock
system<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:11.170> for<00:04:12.170> a<00:04:12.260> lot<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.410> these<00:04:12.590> types<00:04:13.130> of

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
system so for a lot of these types of

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.880 
system so for a lot of these types of
knives<00:04:13.820> knives<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.900> have<00:04:15.020> the<00:04:15.140> locking<00:04:15.650> liner

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
knives knives you have the locking liner

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.010 
knives knives you have the locking liner
so<00:04:16.580> you<00:04:16.640> open<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.420> this<00:04:17.570> piece<00:04:17.810> of<00:04:17.840> metal

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
so you open it and this piece of metal

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.720 
so you open it and this piece of metal
slides<00:04:18.410> over<00:04:18.620> basically<00:04:18.980> locks<00:04:19.250> under<00:04:19.580> this

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
slides over basically locks under this

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.490 
slides over basically locks under this
bottom<00:04:20.090> part<00:04:20.299> underneath<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.080> blade<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.350> keep

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
bottom part underneath the blade to keep

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.560 
bottom part underneath the blade to keep
in<00:04:21.620> place<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:22.250> also<00:04:22.400> have<00:04:22.580> this<00:04:22.760> button<00:04:23.419> here

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
in place you also have this button here

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.510 
in place you also have this button here
which<00:04:23.630> is<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.870> auto<00:04:24.080> lock<00:04:24.290> system<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:24.919> when

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
which is the auto lock system so when

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.920 
which is the auto lock system so when
the<00:04:25.610> knife<00:04:25.729> clicks<00:04:26.000> in<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.180> place<00:04:26.390> that<00:04:26.750> goes

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
the knife clicks in a place that goes

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.780 
the knife clicks in a place that goes
over<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.620> auto<00:04:27.800> lock<00:04:28.040> system<00:04:28.370> clicks<00:04:28.610> in

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
over and the auto lock system clicks in

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.820 
over and the auto lock system clicks in
place<00:04:28.970> as<00:04:29.150> well<00:04:29.330> now<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.260> does<00:04:30.440> take<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.650> little

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
place as well now it does take a little

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.560 
place as well now it does take a little
training<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.640> get<00:04:31.790> yourself<00:04:32.090> comfortable<00:04:32.300> to

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
training to get yourself comfortable to

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.300 
training to get yourself comfortable to
do<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.750> with<00:04:32.840> one<00:04:33.020> hand<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.500> because<00:04:34.190> the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
do it with one hand and because the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.250 
do it with one hand and because the
weather<00:04:34.520> has<00:04:34.880> been<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.090> dry<00:04:35.570> my<00:04:35.750> hands<00:04:35.960> are<00:04:36.110> all

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
weather has been so dry my hands are all

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.690 
weather has been so dry my hands are all
like<00:04:36.500> beat<00:04:36.740> up<00:04:36.920> they're<00:04:37.130> just<00:04:37.160> totally

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
like beat up they're just totally

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.090 
like beat up they're just totally
chapped<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.240> got<00:04:38.690> cracks<00:04:39.050> on<00:04:39.260> my<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.650> tips<00:04:39.980> of

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
chapped and got cracks on my the tips of

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.860 
chapped and got cracks on my the tips of
some<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.340> my<00:04:40.400> fingers<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:40.730> stuff<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.450> got<00:04:41.780> to

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
some of my fingers and stuff so I got to

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.850 
some of my fingers and stuff so I got to
do<00:04:41.960> this<00:04:42.080> with<00:04:42.260> two<00:04:42.380> hands<00:04:42.590> now<00:04:42.830> but

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
do this with two hands now but

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.400
