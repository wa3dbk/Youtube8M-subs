white<00:02:08.940> should<00:02:09.330> look<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.020> image<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
white should look like in this image and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.010 
white should look like in this image and
it's<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.790> what<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.239> have

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it's not what we have

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.580 
it's not what we have
and<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.560> these<00:02:13.650> other<00:02:13.860> white<00:02:14.100> bits<00:02:15.590> we

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
and all of these other white bits we

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.930 
and all of these other white bits we
don't<00:02:16.770> need<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.220> go<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> complete<00:02:17.730> white

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
don't need this to go to complete white

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.580 
don't need this to go to complete white
but<00:02:18.210> if<00:02:18.330> white<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.570> all<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.990> way<00:02:19.080> over<00:02:19.320> here

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
but if white is all the way over here

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.260 
but if white is all the way over here
these<00:02:19.980> other<00:02:20.190> specular<00:02:20.640> highlights<00:02:21.000> should

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
these other specular highlights should

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.450 
these other specular highlights should
be<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.510> least<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.680> bright<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.250> if

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
be at least that that bright and if

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.250 
be at least that that bright and if
they're<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.940> bright<00:02:24.270> it's<00:02:24.780> gonna<00:02:24.960> brighten

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
they're that bright it's gonna brighten

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260 
they're that bright it's gonna brighten
up<00:02:25.410> some<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.710> these<00:02:25.800> tones<00:02:26.100> that's<00:02:27.030> going<00:02:27.210> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
up some of these tones that's going to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.750 
up some of these tones that's going to
allow<00:02:27.480> us<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.660> get<00:02:27.930> more<00:02:28.200> texture<00:02:28.740> on<00:02:29.010> here

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
allow us to get more texture on here

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.070 
allow us to get more texture on here
it's<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.210> just<00:02:30.480> give<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> image<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
it's going to just give the image a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.290 
it's going to just give the image a
little<00:02:31.110> more<00:02:31.380> punch<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:32.340> good<00:02:32.790> as<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.030> looks

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
little more punch as good as this looks

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.550 
little more punch as good as this looks
it<00:02:33.510> looks<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.930> little<00:02:34.260> muddy<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.400> blah<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.700> me

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
it looks a little muddy and blah to me

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.320 
it looks a little muddy and blah to me
and<00:02:37.560> it's<00:02:37.800> an<00:02:37.950> easy<00:02:38.160> thing<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.490> miss<00:02:38.940> when<00:02:39.240> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
and it's an easy thing to miss when the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.940 
and it's an easy thing to miss when the
image<00:02:39.510> first<00:02:39.750> comes<00:02:39.960> out<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.380> printer

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
image first comes out of the printer

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.620 
image first comes out of the printer
because<00:02:41.340> your<00:02:41.490> eye<00:02:41.520> will<00:02:41.970> look<00:02:42.000> at<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
because your eye will look at it and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.030 
because your eye will look at it and
make<00:02:42.780> sense<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.830> forth

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
make sense of it and so on and so forth

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.830 
make sense of it and so on and so forth
but<00:02:44.130> once<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.910> realize<00:02:45.210> there's<00:02:45.540> actually

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
but once you realize there's actually

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.570 
but once you realize there's actually
more<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.110> be<00:02:46.230> had<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:46.440> there's<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.400> very

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
more to be had there there's a very

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.890 
more to be had there there's a very
different<00:02:47.820> image<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.180> get<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.570> let's<00:02:48.720> go

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
different image you can get so let's go

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.180 
different image you can get so let's go
in<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.410> look<00:02:50.070> at<00:02:50.400> what<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.510> did<00:02:52.190> let's

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
in here and look at what you did let's

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.160 
in here and look at what you did let's
analyze<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.240> image<00:02:54.540> by<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.720> numbers

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
analyze this image by the numbers

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.780 
analyze this image by the numbers
looking<00:02:55.710> at<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.980> on-screen<00:02:56.220> obviously

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
looking at it on-screen obviously

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.250 
looking at it on-screen obviously
doesn't<00:02:57.120> tell<00:02:57.270> us<00:02:57.300> very<00:02:57.450> much<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.020> I'm<00:02:58.170> gonna

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
doesn't tell us very much so I'm gonna

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.110 
doesn't tell us very much so I'm gonna
go<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.010> add<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> levels<00:02:59.610> adjustment

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
go in here and add a levels adjustment

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.330 
go in here and add a levels adjustment
layer<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.650> as<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:01.770> look<00:03:01.920> at<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.100> histogram

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
layer so as we look at the histogram

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.710 
layer so as we look at the histogram
right<00:03:02.760> over<00:03:03.180> here

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
right over here

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.030 
right over here
what<00:03:04.170> are<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.650> seeing<00:03:06.470> right<00:03:07.470> there<00:03:07.500> which<00:03:07.890> is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
what are you seeing right there which is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:18.500 
what are you seeing right there which is
probably<00:03:09.410> it's<00:03:10.410> probably<00:03:10.710> this<00:03:16.700> yeah<00:03:17.700> so

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
probably it's probably this yeah so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.750 
probably it's probably this yeah so
thinking<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.680> way<00:03:19.920> do<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.490> have<00:03:20.550> an

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
thinking of it that way do you have an

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.160 
thinking of it that way do you have an
idea<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.360> different<00:03:21.750> white<00:03:21.900> point

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
idea of a different white point

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.350 
idea of a different white point
adjustment<00:03:22.680> now<00:03:23.010> technically<00:03:23.670> you're<00:03:24.060> okay

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
adjustment now technically you're okay

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.060 
adjustment now technically you're okay
you're<00:03:24.660> saying<00:03:24.930> well<00:03:25.440> I've<00:03:25.560> got<00:03:25.710> my<00:03:25.860> white

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you're saying well I've got my white

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.220 
you're saying well I've got my white
over<00:03:26.430> at<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.670> right<00:03:26.850> edge<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.240> my<00:03:27.360> data<00:03:27.600> well

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
over at the right edge of my data well

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.320 
over at the right edge of my data well
the<00:03:28.890> right<00:03:29.070> edge<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.340> your<00:03:29.400> data<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:30.030> this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
the right edge of your data is this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.900 
the right edge of your data is this
thing<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.840> bulk<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.350> your<00:03:31.890> data<00:03:32.190> all<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.820> this

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
thing the bulk of your data all of this

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.670 
thing the bulk of your data all of this
stuff<00:03:33.180> really<00:03:33.390> doesn't<00:03:33.660> start<00:03:33.990> till<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.320> here

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
stuff really doesn't start till in here

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.940 
stuff really doesn't start till in here
so<00:03:35.370> make<00:03:36.000> another<00:03:36.270> adjustment<00:03:36.710> see<00:03:37.710> if<00:03:37.830> you

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
so make another adjustment see if you

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.230 
so make another adjustment see if you
can<00:03:38.160> get<00:03:38.340> something<00:03:39.000> else<00:03:39.180> going<00:03:40.730> yeah<00:03:41.760> coming

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
can get something else going yeah coming

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.540 
can get something else going yeah coming
into<00:03:42.360> there's<00:03:42.570> making<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.080> difference<00:03:43.550> you

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
into there's making a difference you

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.580 
into there's making a difference you
thinking<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.850> midpoint<00:03:45.060> adjustment<00:03:45.830> okay<00:03:48.590> good

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
thinking a midpoint adjustment okay good

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.990 
thinking a midpoint adjustment okay good
because<00:03:49.920> as<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.220> moved<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.550> white<00:03:50.700> point

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
because as you moved the white point

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.790 
because as you moved the white point
over<00:03:51.450> you're<00:03:52.080> running<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.500> risk<00:03:52.650> of

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
over you're running the risk of

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.590 
over you're running the risk of
brightening<00:03:53.220> up<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.340> blacks<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.240> washing

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
brightening up the blacks and washing

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.270 
brightening up the blacks and washing
those<00:03:54.720> out<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.260> think<00:03:55.470> it's<00:03:55.620> smart<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:56.130> do

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
those out and I think it's smart to do

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.500 
those out and I think it's smart to do
that<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.640> did<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.790> right<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.240> did<00:03:57.390> that

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
that you did that right you did that

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.850 
that you did that right you did that
with<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.720> midpoint<00:03:58.110> adjustment<00:03:58.560> because<00:03:58.680> if

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
with the midpoint adjustment because if

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.860 
with the midpoint adjustment because if
you<00:03:58.920> had<00:03:59.040> done<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.310> blacks<00:03:59.870> then

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
you had done the blacks then

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.930 
you had done the blacks then
everything's<00:04:01.170> gonna<00:04:01.290> plunge<00:04:01.530> back<00:04:01.740> down<00:04:01.950> all

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
everything's gonna plunge back down all

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.100 
everything's gonna plunge back down all
right<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.150> what<00:04:03.480> are<00:04:03.570> we<00:04:03.630> getting<00:04:03.720> now<00:04:03.930> we're

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
right so what are we getting now we're

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.500 
right so what are we getting now we're
getting<00:04:04.490> turn<00:04:05.490> off<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.730> eyeball<00:04:05.850> let's<00:04:06.360> see

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
getting turn off the eyeball let's see

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.430 
getting turn off the eyeball let's see
it<00:04:06.600> before<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.050> after

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
it before and after

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.300 
it before and after
so<00:04:08.340> there's<00:04:08.760> before<00:04:09.620> there's<00:04:10.620> after<00:04:10.980> it's

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
so there's before there's after it's

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.340 
so there's before there's after it's
very<00:04:11.640> slight<00:04:12.000> it's<00:04:12.300> very<00:04:12.510> subtle<00:04:12.930> but<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:13.140> think

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
very slight it's very subtle but I think

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.840 
very slight it's very subtle but I think
it's<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.560> huge<00:04:13.860> change<00:04:14.280> that's<00:04:14.520> going<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.730> make

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
it's a huge change that's going to make

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.870 
it's a huge change that's going to make
a<00:04:14.880> big<00:04:15.090> difference<00:04:15.350> we<00:04:16.350> could<00:04:16.560> now<00:04:17.489> start

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
a big difference we could now start

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.370 
a big difference we could now start
looking<00:04:18.030> for<00:04:18.510> have<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.840> introduced<00:04:19.230> any

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
looking for have you introduced any

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.280 
looking for have you introduced any
overexposure<00:04:20.040> has<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.060> gone<00:04:21.330> out<00:04:21.540> these

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
overexposure has this gone out these

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.360 
overexposure has this gone out these
gone<00:04:22.650> out<00:04:24.050> turn<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.080> off<00:04:25.380> again<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:26.010> want<00:04:26.220> to

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
gone out turn it off again I want to

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.730 
gone out turn it off again I want to
look<00:04:26.430> at<00:04:26.520> this<00:04:26.639> pinky<00:04:27.090> right<00:04:27.240> here<00:04:27.479> yeah<00:04:28.470> we've

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
look at this pinky right here yeah we've

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.640 
look at this pinky right here yeah we've
lost<00:04:28.770> some<00:04:29.220> detail<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.900> we're<00:04:31.530> not

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
lost some detail there so we're not

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.110 
lost some detail there so we're not
going<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.889> be<00:04:32.010> able<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.250> get<00:04:32.400> around<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:32.850> with

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
going to be able to get around this with

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.240 
going to be able to get around this with
a<00:04:33.320> single<00:04:34.320> global<00:04:34.470> adjustment<00:04:35.040> we're<00:04:35.130> gonna

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
a single global adjustment we're gonna

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.620 
a single global adjustment we're gonna
need<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.580> do<00:04:35.699> some<00:04:35.729> local<00:04:36.180> adjustment

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
need to do some local adjustment

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.030 
need to do some local adjustment
localized<00:04:37.169> adjustments<00:04:37.680> we'll<00:04:37.800> look<00:04:37.919> at

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
localized adjustments we'll look at

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.590 
localized adjustments we'll look at
those<00:04:38.220> in<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.820> little<00:04:38.910> bit<00:04:39.150> let's<00:04:39.300> move<00:04:39.479> on<00:04:39.570> to

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
those in a little bit let's move on to

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.909 
those in a little bit let's move on to
some<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.840> these<00:04:39.930> other<00:04:40.110> images<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.500> see<00:04:40.740> where

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
some of these other images and see where

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.250 
some of these other images and see where
they<00:04:41.040> stand<00:04:41.100> this<00:04:41.940> picture<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.600> Hayley

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
they stand this picture of Hayley

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.480 
they stand this picture of Hayley
reflected<00:04:43.680> in<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.830> window<00:04:44.040> when<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.280> pull

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
reflected in the window when you pull

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.050 
reflected in the window when you pull
that<00:04:44.520> on<00:04:45.979> so<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.040> same<00:04:47.220> thing<00:04:47.460> make<00:04:47.669> a<00:04:47.699> levels

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
that on so the same thing make a levels

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.530 
that on so the same thing make a levels
adjustment<00:04:48.510> layer<00:04:53.090> okay<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.300> one's<00:04:54.479> a

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
adjustment layer okay this one's a

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.050 
adjustment layer okay this one's a
little<00:04:54.630> trickier<00:04:55.400> this<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.580> where<00:04:56.729> you<00:04:56.820> had<00:04:56.940> it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
little trickier this is where you had it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.219 
little trickier this is where you had it
set<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.540> again<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:57.810> did<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.050> right<00:04:58.169> thing

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
set and again you did the right thing

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.800 
set and again you did the right thing
you<00:04:58.620> found<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.919> right<00:04:59.039> edge<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.310> your<00:04:59.430> data

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
you found the right edge of your data

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.840 
you found the right edge of your data
but<00:05:00.810> there's<00:05:01.050> this<00:05:01.199> little<00:05:01.590> area<00:05:01.949> along<00:05:02.520> here

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
but there's this little area along here

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.629 
but there's this little area along here
that's<00:05:03.060> all<00:05:03.260> roughly<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.440> same<00:05:04.620> amount<00:05:05.490> of

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
that's all roughly the same amount of

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.969 
that's all roughly the same amount of
data<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.210> that's<00:05:06.780> probably<00:05:07.169> all<00:05:07.560> of<00:05:07.830> these

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
data and that's probably all of these

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.830 
data and that's probably all of these
tones<00:05:08.280> in<00:05:08.460> her<00:05:08.550> hand<00:05:08.820> these<00:05:09.270> bright<00:05:09.600> tones

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
tones in her hand these bright tones

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.670 
tones in her hand these bright tones
over<00:05:10.199> here<00:05:10.650> maybe<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.910> little<00:05:12.270> bit<00:05:12.419> in<00:05:12.539> here<00:05:12.870> as

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
over here maybe a little bit in here as

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.650 
over here maybe a little bit in here as
far<00:05:13.919> as<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.160> rest<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.639> the<00:05:14.729> image<00:05:15.000> goes<00:05:15.270> the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
far as the rest of the image goes the

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.140 
far as the rest of the image goes the
bulk<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.260> image<00:05:16.530> most<00:05:16.889> of<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.910> data

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
bulk of the image most of it the data

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.560 
bulk of the image most of it the data
doesn't<00:05:18.780> start<00:05:19.169> until<00:05:19.440> right<00:05:19.889> in<00:05:20.070> here<00:05:20.570> so

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
doesn't start until right in here so

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.820 
doesn't start until right in here so
let's<00:05:21.690> see<00:05:21.900> what<00:05:22.020> happens<00:05:22.289> if<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.500> move<00:05:22.650> the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
let's see what happens if you move the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.350 
let's see what happens if you move the
white<00:05:22.979> point<00:05:23.250> over<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.550> there<00:05:25.970> yeah<00:05:26.970> right

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
white point over to there yeah right

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.379 
white point over to there yeah right
into<00:05:27.570> there<00:05:27.750> now<00:05:28.620> obviously<00:05:29.310> we've<00:05:30.000> lost<00:05:30.180> your

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
into there now obviously we've lost your

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.600 
into there now obviously we've lost your
hand<00:05:30.599> this<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.200> gone<00:05:31.410> but<00:05:31.919> turn<00:05:32.460> that

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
hand this is gone but turn that

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.550 
hand this is gone but turn that
adjustment<00:05:32.970> layer<00:05:33.210> off<00:05:34.280> before<00:05:35.599> after<00:05:36.599> if<00:05:37.410> you

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
adjustment layer off before after if you

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.080 
adjustment layer off before after if you
notice<00:05:37.889> in<00:05:38.039> here<00:05:38.370> there's<00:05:38.700> not<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.880> lot<00:05:39.060> of

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
notice in here there's not a lot of

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.700 
notice in here there's not a lot of
differentiation<00:05:39.690> between<00:05:39.900> these<00:05:40.260> tones<00:05:40.530> and

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
differentiation between these tones and

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.129 
differentiation between these tones and
these<00:05:40.860> tones<00:05:41.160> overall<00:05:41.849> it's<00:05:42.539> a<00:05:42.630> lot<00:05:42.780> of<00:05:42.930> middle

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
these tones overall it's a lot of middle

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.440 
these tones overall it's a lot of middle
grade<00:05:43.320> tones<00:05:43.590> with<00:05:44.580> this<00:05:44.729> levels<00:05:45.030> adjustment

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
grade tones with this levels adjustment

we're<00:05:48.090> gonna<00:05:48.150> have<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.450> do<00:05:48.539> some<00:05:48.720> localized

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
we're gonna have to do some localized

we're gonna have to do some localized
things<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.680> fix<00:05:49.860> all<00:05:50.010> that<00:05:50.039> we'll<00:05:50.820> come<00:05:50.970> back

things to fix all that we'll come back

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.870 
things to fix all that we'll come back
to<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.300> let's<00:05:51.660> move<00:05:51.840> on<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.110> next<00:05:52.289> image

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
to that let's move on to the next image

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.219 
to that let's move on to the next image
and<00:05:53.880> let's<00:05:54.210> just<00:05:54.360> do<00:05:54.510> the<00:05:54.599> same<00:05:54.780> thing<00:05:54.990> here

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
and let's just do the same thing here

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:01.909 
and let's just do the same thing here
pull<00:05:55.620> up<00:05:55.710> the<00:05:55.830> levels<00:05:59.090> again<00:06:00.650> right<00:06:01.650> and

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
pull up the levels again right and

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.370 
pull up the levels again right and
that's<00:06:02.099> gonna<00:06:02.280> be<00:06:02.550> very<00:06:03.090> good<00:06:03.330> so<00:06:04.199> where<00:06:04.320> do

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
that's gonna be very good so where do

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.290 
that's gonna be very good so where do
you<00:06:04.440> think<00:06:04.470> we<00:06:04.650> ought<00:06:04.680> to<00:06:04.770> go<00:06:04.949> with<00:06:04.979> this<00:06:05.190> one

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.279 

exactly<00:06:09.300> and<00:06:09.479> that's<00:06:09.660> exactly<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:10.110> word

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
exactly and that's exactly the word

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.210 
exactly and that's exactly the word
thank<00:06:10.470> you<00:06:10.530> I<00:06:10.590> was<00:06:10.710> looking<00:06:10.919> for<00:06:11.039> that<00:06:11.099> word

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
thank you I was looking for that word

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.710 
thank you I was looking for that word
where<00:06:11.460> you<00:06:11.520> see<00:06:11.699> those<00:06:11.849> plateaus<00:06:12.180> you're

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
where you see those plateaus you're

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.120 
where you see those plateaus you're
looking<00:06:12.990> at<00:06:13.080> a<00:06:13.110> bunch<00:06:13.289> of<00:06:13.470> little<00:06:13.650> tones<00:06:13.919> that

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
looking at a bunch of little tones that

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.469 
looking at a bunch of little tones that
aren't<00:06:14.310> as<00:06:14.370> significant<00:06:14.820> as<00:06:14.910> these<00:06:15.030> big<00:06:15.270> piles

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
aren't as significant as these big piles

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.200 
aren't as significant as these big piles
of<00:06:15.810> tones<00:06:16.190> and<00:06:17.190> let's<00:06:17.580> see<00:06:17.729> it<00:06:17.820> before<00:06:18.090> and

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
of tones and let's see it before and

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.040 
of tones and let's see it before and
after<00:06:18.419> again<00:06:19.430> okay<00:06:20.430> again<00:06:20.880> real<00:06:21.300> real<00:06:21.630> subtle

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
after again okay again real real subtle

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.710 
after again okay again real real subtle
but<00:06:22.949> we've<00:06:23.580> just<00:06:23.820> picked<00:06:23.970> up<00:06:24.150> some<00:06:24.389> extra

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
but we've just picked up some extra

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.480 
but we've just picked up some extra
stuff<00:06:25.260> in<00:06:25.530> there<00:06:25.740> that's<00:06:26.010> gonna<00:06:26.130> give<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:26.460> a

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
stuff in there that's gonna give it a

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.020 
stuff in there that's gonna give it a
little<00:06:26.610> more<00:06:26.820> punch<00:06:27.120> so<00:06:28.820> even<00:06:29.820> if<00:06:29.910> these

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
little more punch so even if these

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.400 
little more punch so even if these
highlights<00:06:30.360> get<00:06:30.510> brighter<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:31.020> just<00:06:31.229> means

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
highlights get brighter it just means

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.930 
highlights get brighter it just means
there's<00:06:31.650> more<00:06:31.830> highlights<00:06:32.160> mère<00:06:32.490> coming<00:06:32.820> into

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
there's more highlights mère coming into

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.719 
there's more highlights mère coming into
her<00:06:33.120> in<00:06:33.270> that

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
her in that

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.360 
her in that
may<00:06:33.879> not<00:06:34.029> be<00:06:34.240> a<00:06:34.270> problem<00:06:34.509> so<00:06:35.409> you<00:06:35.889> were<00:06:36.039> real

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
may not be a problem so you were real

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.010 
may not be a problem so you were real
close<00:06:36.699> on<00:06:36.939> all<00:06:37.059> of<00:06:37.180> these<00:06:37.270> edits<00:06:37.629> again<00:06:37.900> you

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
close on all of these edits again you

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.659 
close on all of these edits again you
were<00:06:38.110> just<00:06:38.289> like<00:06:38.409> ten<00:06:38.710> percent<00:06:38.919> off<00:06:39.279> and<00:06:39.490> and

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
were just like ten percent off and and

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.399 
were just like ten percent off and and
it's<00:06:39.999> an<00:06:40.180> easy<00:06:40.419> mistake<00:06:40.539> to<00:06:40.870> make<00:06:41.020> you<00:06:41.259> were

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
it's an easy mistake to make you were

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:44.429 
it's an easy mistake to make you were
it's<00:06:41.879> it's<00:06:42.879> kind<00:06:43.120> of<00:06:43.180> heartbreaking<00:06:43.749> to<00:06:44.319> have

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:44.439 
it's it's kind of heartbreaking to have

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.420 
it's it's kind of heartbreaking to have
to<00:06:44.559> tell<00:06:44.740> you<00:06:44.830> because<00:06:45.039> you<00:06:45.219> were<00:06:45.339> doing

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
to tell you because you were doing

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.739 
to tell you because you were doing
exactly<00:06:45.849> the<00:06:45.999> right<00:06:46.029> thing<00:06:46.150> you<00:06:46.419> were<00:06:46.509> going

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:46.749 
exactly the right thing you were going

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:47.909 
exactly the right thing you were going
over<00:06:46.839> to<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.080> edge<00:06:47.169> of<00:06:47.259> the<00:06:47.349> histogram<00:06:47.620> it

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
over to the edge of the histogram it

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:49.709 
over to the edge of the histogram it
just<00:06:48.129> turns<00:06:48.309> out<00:06:48.460> that<00:06:48.669> the<00:06:49.150> edge<00:06:49.330> of<00:06:49.659> the

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719 
just turns out that the edge of the

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.869 
just turns out that the edge of the
histogram<00:06:50.080> is<00:06:50.529> not<00:06:51.039> actually<00:06:51.430> right<00:06:51.580> for<00:06:51.819> the

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:51.879 
histogram is not actually right for the

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.640 
histogram is not actually right for the
bulk<00:06:52.059> of<00:06:52.150> the<00:06:52.270> image<00:06:52.509> data<00:06:52.539> we<00:06:53.229> need<00:06:53.379> to<00:06:53.439> define

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
bulk of the image data we need to define

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.070 
bulk of the image data we need to define
the<00:06:53.710> significant<00:06:54.550> data<00:06:54.759> and<00:06:55.089> move<00:06:55.629> white<00:06:55.930> and

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
the significant data and move white and

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.959 
the significant data and move white and
black<00:06:56.229> to<00:06:56.469> there<00:06:56.710> and<00:06:56.949> as<00:06:57.249> you<00:06:57.460> pointed<00:06:57.909> out

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:57.969 
black to there and as you pointed out

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:59.969 
black to there and as you pointed out
there's<00:06:58.180> a<00:06:58.270> plateau<00:06:58.629> of<00:06:58.870> insignificant<00:06:59.469> data

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
there's a plateau of insignificant data

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.890 
there's a plateau of insignificant data
that<00:07:00.159> you<00:07:00.249> needed<00:07:00.490> to<00:07:00.550> go<00:07:00.699> away<00:07:00.879> from<00:07:01.599> so<00:07:01.779> now

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
that you needed to go away from so now

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.450 
that you needed to go away from so now
the<00:07:01.990> next<00:07:02.139> thing<00:07:02.409> is<00:07:02.529> to<00:07:02.559> get<00:07:02.740> some<00:07:02.919> masks<00:07:03.309> in

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
the next thing is to get some masks in

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.950 
the next thing is to get some masks in
place<00:07:03.610> to<00:07:04.270> ensure<00:07:04.539> that<00:07:04.659> we<00:07:04.749> haven't

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
place to ensure that we haven't

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.839 
place to ensure that we haven't
