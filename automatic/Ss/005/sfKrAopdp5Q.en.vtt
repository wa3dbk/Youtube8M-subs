00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.160 

in<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.920> speed<00:00:17.789> modeling<00:00:18.330> project<00:00:18.600> I'm

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
in this speed modeling project I'm

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.250 
in this speed modeling project I'm
trying<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> speed<00:00:20.520> model<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.090> r2d2<00:00:21.810> once

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
trying to do a speed model of r2d2 once

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.960 
trying to do a speed model of r2d2 once
again<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> goal<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.130> make<00:00:23.730> something

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
again the goal is to make something

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.679 
again the goal is to make something
similar<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.600> him<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.050> wonder<00:00:25.410> 3d<00:00:26.689> not

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
similar to him and wonder 3d not

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.200 
similar to him and wonder 3d not
necessarily<00:00:28.140> exactly<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.160> same<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.090> as

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
necessarily exactly the same but just as

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.380 
necessarily exactly the same but just as
close<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:31.019> quick<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:33.300> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
close as I can as quick as I can and I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.780 
close as I can as quick as I can and I
decided<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.559> his<00:00:34.710> body<00:00:34.950> since<00:00:35.219> he<00:00:35.370> has<00:00:35.520> so

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
decided to for his body since he has so

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
decided to for his body since he has so
much<00:00:35.940> stuff<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.420> him<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:37.140> actually<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.710> use<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
much stuff on him to actually just use a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.270 
much stuff on him to actually just use a
texture<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:38.879> using<00:00:39.180> GIMP<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.770> create

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
texture so I'm using GIMP here to create

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.369 
texture so I'm using GIMP here to create
a<00:00:41.700> texture<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:43.010> all<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.340> gadgets<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
a texture of all the gadgets on the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.709 
a texture of all the gadgets on the
front<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> his<00:00:46.980> body<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.600> basically

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
front of his body so this is basically

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
front of his body so this is basically
going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> 2d<00:00:49.829> image<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:50.640> creating

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
going to be a 2d image that I'm creating

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.180 
going to be a 2d image that I'm creating
they're<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> wrap<00:00:51.750> around<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.710> 3d

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they're going to wrap around the 3d

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
they're going to wrap around the 3d
model<00:00:55.850> halfway<00:00:56.850> through<00:00:57.000> doing<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.690> was

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
model halfway through doing this I was

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
model halfway through doing this I was
thinking<00:00:58.170> oh<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
thinking oh this is this is not going to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.790 
thinking oh this is this is not going to
look<00:00:59.640> good<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.180> let<00:01:01.109> me<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.440> product<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
look good and let me see I'm product I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.349 
look good and let me see I'm product I
think<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> actually<00:01:02.160> turned<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.730> pretty<00:01:02.789> good

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
think it actually turned out pretty good

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:29.000 
think it actually turned out pretty good
this<00:01:03.600> texture<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.350> body

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:02:14.780 

you

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:03:07.420 

you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.040 

this<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.670> part<00:03:08.850> here<00:03:09.240> where<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.480> start<00:03:09.960> to

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
this is the part here where I start to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.750 
this is the part here where I start to
get<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.230> little<00:03:10.290> lazy<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:10.980> don't<00:03:11.220> put<00:03:11.400> too<00:03:11.730> much

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
get a little lazy I don't put too much

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.950 
get a little lazy I don't put too much
detail<00:03:12.540> into<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.920> legs<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.700> r2d2<00:03:15.240> are<00:03:15.720> mine

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
detail into the legs of r2d2 are mine

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.210 
detail into the legs of r2d2 are mine
r2d2<00:03:16.640> loan<00:03:18.440> basically<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.470> made<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.830> shoulder

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
r2d2 loan basically I made the shoulder

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.500 
r2d2 loan basically I made the shoulder
joint<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:22.580> resized<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.360> leg

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
joint and I just resized it for the leg

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.470 
joint and I just resized it for the leg
joint<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.110> for<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.620> foot<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.310> may<00:03:27.000> actually<00:03:27.180> go

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
joint and for the foot I may actually go

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.810 
joint and for the foot I may actually go
back<00:03:27.660> into<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.050> project<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.190> future<00:03:29.580> and

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
back into this project in the future and

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.040 
back into this project in the future and
add<00:03:30.660> more<00:03:31.110> detail<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.830> legs<00:03:32.720> but<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:34.020> a

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
add more detail to the legs but for a

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.949 
add more detail to the legs but for a
quick<00:03:34.320> render<00:03:34.740> or<00:03:34.980> quick<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.750> modeling<00:03:36.750> project

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
quick render or quick a modeling project

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.740 
quick render or quick a modeling project
I<00:03:37.320> think<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.590> turned<00:03:37.770> out<00:03:37.950> pretty<00:03:38.160> good<00:03:38.490> and

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
I think this turned out pretty good and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.090 
I think this turned out pretty good and
I<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:39.930> think<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.650> could<00:03:40.740> have<00:03:40.920> done<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
I just think that I could have done a

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.440 
I just think that I could have done a
little<00:03:41.280> bit<00:03:41.430> better<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.940> legs<00:03:42.150> but

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
little bit better on the legs but

00:03:42.450 --> 00:04:37.670 
little bit better on the legs but
overall<00:03:42.690> I'm<00:03:42.930> pretty<00:03:43.020> happy

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:51.500 

Oh
