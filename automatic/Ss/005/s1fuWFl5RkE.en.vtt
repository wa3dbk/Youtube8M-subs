pokemon<00:01:26.759> ruby<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.299> pokemon<00:01:27.960> emerald<00:01:28.170> or

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
pokemon ruby or pokemon emerald or

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
pokemon ruby or pokemon emerald or
something<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.180> guys

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
something like that it's up to you guys

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.880 
something like that it's up to you guys
would<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> good

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
would you do you think this is a good

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.190 
would you do you think this is a good
idea<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.640> doing<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.270> multiple<00:01:33.780> Pokemon

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
idea to like doing in multiple Pokemon

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
idea to like doing in multiple Pokemon
games<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.950> already<00:01:35.189> tried<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.700> on

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
games and I already tried to do it on

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.340 
games and I already tried to do it on
Pokemon<00:01:36.150> firered<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.840> did<00:01:36.990> work<00:01:37.140> out

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
Pokemon firered and it did work out

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.399 
Pokemon firered and it did work out
pretty<00:01:37.560> well<00:01:37.680> although<00:01:38.570> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.869> catch<00:01:40.049> any<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
pretty well although if you catch any of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.580 
pretty well although if you catch any of
the<00:01:40.619> second<00:01:41.130> or<00:01:41.220> third<00:01:41.549> generation<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:43.259> will

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the second or third generation you will

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
the second or third generation you will
be<00:01:43.680> able<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.920> play<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.369> them<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.970> will

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
be able to play with them and you will

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.370 
be able to play with them and you will
able<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.420> level<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.960> stuff<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
able to level them and stuff like that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
able to level them and stuff like that
but<00:01:46.799> when<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.220> evolve<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.119> then

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but when they will evolve that it then

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
but when they will evolve that it then
it<00:01:48.659> starts<00:01:48.960> glitching<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it starts glitching and it just the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
it starts glitching and it just the
Pokemon<00:01:50.610> can't<00:01:50.820> evolve<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.450> mean<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.049> play

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
Pokemon can't evolve I mean you can play

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.870 
Pokemon can't evolve I mean you can play
them<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.649> level<00:01:52.890> them<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.159> level<00:01:53.369> 100<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
them you can level them to level 100 and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.060 
them you can level them to level 100 and
they<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> good<00:01:54.659> Pokemon<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.799> they

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
they will be good Pokemon but but they

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.859 
they will be good Pokemon but but they
can't<00:01:56.340> evolve<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> started<00:01:57.270> Pokemon<00:01:57.689> will

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
can't evolve so it started Pokemon will

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.600 
can't evolve so it started Pokemon will
remain<00:01:58.110> first<00:01:58.380> evolution<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.520> can

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
remain first evolution see as you can

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.249 
remain first evolution see as you can
see<00:01:59.759> here<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.180> made<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> made<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> second<00:02:01.170> piece

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
see here I made it made a second piece

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.920 
see here I made it made a second piece
of<00:02:01.290> grass<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.520> find<00:02:02.790> Espeon<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.570> umbreon

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
of grass you can find Espeon and umbreon

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.389 
of grass you can find Espeon and umbreon
here<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.229> well<00:02:04.439> because<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.890> can't<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.219> them

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
here as well because you can't get them

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.010 
here as well because you can't get them
from<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> stones<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.299> some<00:02:06.450> reason<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:06.869> did

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
from the stones for some reason they did

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.479 
from the stones for some reason they did
not<00:02:07.049> put<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> game<00:02:07.770> by<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> way<00:02:08.310> I've

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
not put that in a game by the way I've

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.460 
not put that in a game by the way I've
tried<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.060> Pokemon<00:02:09.479> firered<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:10.050> think<00:02:10.410> I

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
tried that on Pokemon firered I think I

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.390 
tried that on Pokemon firered I think I
understand<00:02:10.860> why<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.160> is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
understand why that is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.780 
understand why that is
give<00:02:11.910> them<00:02:12.180> your<00:02:12.390> base

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
give them your base

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.530 
give them your base
I'm<00:02:13.120> trying<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:14.280> evolve<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.579> book<00:02:15.939> you<00:02:16.090> booked

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
I'm trying to evolve a book you booked

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.059 
I'm trying to evolve a book you booked
one<00:02:16.689> from<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> first<00:02:17.049> generation<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
one from the first generation to the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.399 
one from the first generation to the
second<00:02:18.430> generation<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.180> when<00:02:19.659> you<00:02:19.780> try<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> do

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
second generation and when you try to do

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.589 
second generation and when you try to do
that<00:02:20.590> yeah<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.069> just<00:02:21.129> doesn't<00:02:21.459> work<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:21.849> it's

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
that yeah it just doesn't work so it's

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.720 
that yeah it just doesn't work so it's
also<00:02:22.810> impossible<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.680> change<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.159> so<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.549> you

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
also impossible to change it so that you

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.869 
also impossible to change it so that you
can<00:02:24.879> evolve<00:02:25.420> onyx<00:02:25.959> into<00:02:26.170> steelix<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.219> guy<00:02:27.459> he

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
can evolve onyx into steelix this guy he

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.240 
can evolve onyx into steelix this guy he
managed<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.689> for<00:02:29.200> some<00:02:29.349> reason

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
managed to do it for some reason

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.220 
managed to do it for some reason
so<00:02:30.519> yeah<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.849> really<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.659> a<00:02:31.689> lot<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.900> respect

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
this and check it out by the way what do

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.379 
this and check it out by the way what do
you<00:02:59.500> think<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.829> mine<00:03:00.010> map<00:03:00.250> making<00:03:00.549> skills<00:03:01.000> and

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
you think of mine map making skills and

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.330 
you think of mine map making skills and
it<00:03:01.930> actually<00:03:02.109> is<00:03:02.409> a<00:03:02.439> bit<00:03:02.680> harder<00:03:03.040> than<00:03:03.250> it

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
it actually is a bit harder than it

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.909 
it actually is a bit harder than it
looks<00:03:03.639> and<00:03:03.939> I<00:03:04.409> think<00:03:05.409> it<00:03:05.530> works<00:03:05.680> out<00:03:05.859> pretty

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
looks and I think it works out pretty

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.069 
looks and I think it works out pretty
well<00:03:06.069> like<00:03:06.639> it<00:03:07.060> looks<00:03:07.299> as<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.659> is<00:03:07.689> just

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
well like it looks as if it is just

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.830 
well like it looks as if it is just
meant<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.709> be<00:03:08.889> hey<00:03:09.099> if<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.340> know<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.489> mean<00:03:09.840> it

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
meant to be hey if you know I mean it

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.270 
meant to be hey if you know I mean it
was<00:03:11.019> actually<00:03:11.349> kind<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.590> like<00:03:11.739> puzzling<00:03:12.189> and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
was actually kind of like puzzling and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.559 
was actually kind of like puzzling and
stuff<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:12.579> that<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.879> finding<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.359> rides

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
stuff like that and finding the rides

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.270 
stuff like that and finding the rides
but<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.049> finding<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.409> right<00:03:14.439> ground<00:03:14.769> pieces

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
but it's finding the right ground pieces

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.949 
but it's finding the right ground pieces
and<00:03:15.430> stuff<00:03:15.549> like<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.909> eventually<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.870> did

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
and stuff like that eventually I did

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.300 
and stuff like that eventually I did
manage<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.290> get<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.709> get<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.919> to<00:03:18.010> look<00:03:18.129> like

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
manage to get it to get it to look like

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.979 
manage to get it to get it to look like
this<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.239> can<00:03:19.389> also<00:03:19.510> catch<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.780> lot<00:03:19.930> of

this so you can also catch a lot of

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.210 
this so you can also catch a lot of
return<00:03:20.229> and<00:03:20.290> stuff<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.709> now<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.040> would
