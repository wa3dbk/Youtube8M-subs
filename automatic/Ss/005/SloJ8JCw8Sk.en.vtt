yesterday<00:00:03.689> when<00:00:04.080> I<00:00:04.110> left<00:00:04.319> out<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.620> tifton

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
yesterday when I left out of tifton

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.010 
yesterday when I left out of tifton
georgia<00:00:05.190> i'm<00:00:05.670> away<00:00:05.970> down<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.240> Jacksonville<00:00:06.779> I

georgia i'm away down the Jacksonville I

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.629 
georgia i'm away down the Jacksonville I
didn't<00:00:07.680> stop<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.010> bother<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.429> check<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
didn't stop the bother to check the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.190 
didn't stop the bother to check the
system<00:00:08.940> because<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.389> felt<00:00:09.599> rather<00:00:09.719> confident

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
system because I felt rather confident

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.249 
system because I felt rather confident
about<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.559> what<00:00:11.400> had<00:00:11.519> happened<00:00:11.849> was<00:00:12.259> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
about it what had happened was the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.220 
about it what had happened was the
ground<00:00:13.530> wire<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:15.360> grounds<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> entire

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
ground wire the grounds out the entire

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.580 
ground wire the grounds out the entire
fuel<00:00:16.560> cell<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.609> put<00:00:18.240> an<00:00:18.359> extension<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.470> that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
fuel cell I put an extension on so that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.130 
fuel cell I put an extension on so that
can<00:00:19.740> carry<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> two<00:00:20.220> cells<00:00:20.779> where<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> put<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
can carry the two cells where I put the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.210 
can carry the two cells where I put the
extension<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.970> electrical<00:00:23.970> tape<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.240> around

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
extension on electrical tape that around

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.400 
extension on electrical tape that around
as<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> has<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.050> insulator<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:30.260> it's<00:00:31.260> not

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
as it has a insulator but it's not

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.950 
as it has a insulator but it's not
foolproof<00:00:31.650> obviously<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:33.210> happened<00:00:33.570> was<00:00:33.719> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
foolproof obviously what happened was is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.420 
foolproof obviously what happened was is
I'll<00:00:34.320> show<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.800> here<00:00:34.860> look<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I'll show you right here look at the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
I'll show you right here look at the
camera<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:43.230> wire<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:44.329> here<00:00:45.649> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
camera the wire is here you can see the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.930 
camera the wire is here you can see the
electrical<00:00:47.579> tape<00:00:48.739> there<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.579> there's<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
electrical tape there and there's the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.310 
electrical tape there and there's the
bolt<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.300> goes<00:00:51.329> through<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> connects<00:00:52.140> this

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
bolt that goes through the connects this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.069 
bolt that goes through the connects this
wire<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.370> main<00:00:53.579> ground<00:00:53.910> well<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.930> was

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
wire and the main ground well that was

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.240 
wire and the main ground well that was
hanging<00:00:55.260> down<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.980> lower<00:00:56.190> fuel<00:00:56.520> cell

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
hanging down on that lower fuel cell

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.889 
hanging down on that lower fuel cell
down<00:00:59.250> here<00:01:01.219> it<00:01:02.219> was<00:01:02.879> actually<00:01:03.329> making<00:01:03.750> contact

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
down here it was actually making contact

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.390 
down here it was actually making contact
with<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> positive<00:01:04.890> side<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.439> not<00:01:07.439> good<00:01:07.740> when

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
with the positive side and not good when

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.359 
with the positive side and not good when
you<00:01:08.520> short<00:01:08.790> out<00:01:08.970> your<00:01:09.000> positive<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
you short out your positive and

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.990 
you short out your positive and
basically<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.880> burnt<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.689> inline<00:01:13.229> fuse<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
basically it burnt the inline fuse and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.710 
basically it burnt the inline fuse and
what<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.270> out

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.170 

so<00:01:18.380> for<00:01:20.560> 204<00:01:21.560> about<00:01:21.710> 200<00:01:22.130> miles<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.850> trip

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
so for 204 about 200 miles of that trip

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.000 
so for 204 about 200 miles of that trip
of<00:01:23.480> a<00:01:23.600> 600-mile<00:01:24.140> trip<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:25.460> basically<00:01:26.090> ran<00:01:27.010> with

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
of a 600-mile trip I basically ran with

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.180 
of a 600-mile trip I basically ran with
a<00:01:28.040> no<00:01:28.520> production<00:01:28.910> on<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.510> fuel<00:01:29.780> cell<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.890> I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
a no production on the fuel cell so I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.860 
a no production on the fuel cell so I
got<00:01:31.400> back<00:01:31.550> here<00:01:31.760> this<00:01:31.910> morning<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.360> Perry<00:01:32.660> and

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
got back here this morning to Perry and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.760 
got back here this morning to Perry and
I<00:01:32.900> gas<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.320> back<00:01:33.500> up<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.120> I<00:01:35.140> realized<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:36.470> mount

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
I gas to back up and I realized I mount

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.800 
I gas to back up and I realized I mount
my<00:01:36.980> mileage<00:01:37.340> had<00:01:37.490> dropped<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:38.030> six<00:01:38.330> point<00:01:38.660> five

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
my mileage had dropped to six point five

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.900 
my mileage had dropped to six point five
four<00:01:39.170> miles<00:01:39.440> per<00:01:39.680> gallon<00:01:39.890> which<00:01:40.580> is<00:01:40.730> still

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
four miles per gallon which is still

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.400 
four miles per gallon which is still
good<00:01:41.180> but<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.420> want<00:01:41.660> to<00:01:41.720> also<00:01:41.870> want<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.200> show<00:01:42.350> you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
something here even though I ran 200

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.770 
something here even though I ran 200
miles<00:01:45.710> yesterday<00:01:46.870> 400<00:01:47.870> was<00:01:48.050> with<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:49.780> field

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
miles yesterday 400 was with the field

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.960 
miles yesterday 400 was with the field
sales<00:01:50.990> running<00:01:51.229> 200<00:01:51.380> was<00:01:51.680> without<00:01:51.890> look<00:01:52.850> at

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
sales running 200 was without look at

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.469 
sales running 200 was without look at
the<00:01:53.060> dryer<00:01:53.440> okay<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.680> was<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.830> hot<00:01:55.190> hot<00:01:55.520> day<00:01:55.760> this

was it was a very very hot day which

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.390 
was it was a very very hot day which
required<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.049> fuel<00:02:48.470> cells<00:02:48.739> themselves<00:02:48.980> to

was a bad report of 6.54 and still

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.450 
was a bad report of 6.54 and still
better<00:03:31.350> than<00:03:31.440> what<00:03:31.710> the<00:03:31.830> truck<00:03:32.010> was<00:03:32.190> getting

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
better than what the truck was getting

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.860 
better than what the truck was getting

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.080 
before the fuel cells and what they came
around<00:03:39.890> it's<00:03:40.890> still<00:03:41.070> better<00:03:41.250> than<00:03:41.370> what<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.880> had

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
around it's still better than what I had

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.030 
around it's still better than what I had
was<00:03:42.180> getting<00:03:42.420> before<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.750> fuel<00:03:43.020> cells<00:03:43.260> but

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
was getting before the fuel cells but

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.590 
was getting before the fuel cells but
it's<00:03:44.370> still<00:03:44.640> not<00:03:44.910> bad<00:03:46.040> even<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.600> shoddy

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
it's still not bad even with a shoddy

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.090 
it's still not bad even with a shoddy
day<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:49.230> production<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:51.290> normally<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.560> was<00:03:52.710> 95

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
day of production so normally it was 95

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.030 
day of production so normally it was 95
degrees<00:03:53.460> in<00:03:53.730> Florida<00:03:54.090> yesterday<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:55.620> without

that<00:03:56.190> dryer<00:03:56.580> on<00:03:56.850> there<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.270> would<00:03:57.930> have<00:03:57.990> been

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
that dryer on there I would have been

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.600 
that dryer on there I would have been
down<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.650> five<00:03:58.890> mile<00:03:59.190> per<00:03:59.400> gallon<00:04:00.060> range<00:04:01.610> 5855

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
down the five mile per gallon range 5855

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.260 
down the five mile per gallon range 5855
I've<00:04:03.300> seen<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.690> before<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.980> stay<00:04:05.220> up<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.580> you

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
I've seen it before so to stay up a you

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.480 
I've seen it before so to stay up a you
know<00:04:06.390> at<00:04:06.690> 65<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:10.230> was<00:04:10.740> more<00:04:10.980> likely<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.430> was

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
know at 65 it was more likely it was

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.060 
know at 65 it was more likely it was
higher<00:04:11.700> than<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.150> because<00:04:12.690> i<00:04:13.320> had<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.770> recoup

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
higher than that because i had to recoup

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.229 
higher than that because i had to recoup
one-third<00:04:14.490> of<00:04:14.580> my<00:04:14.640> trip<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:16.609> like<00:04:17.609> i<00:04:17.700> said<00:04:17.730> i

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
one-third of my trip so like i said i

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.840 
one-third of my trip so like i said i
got<00:04:18.540> no<00:04:18.690> indication<00:04:19.260> otherwise<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:20.190> had

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
got no indication otherwise that had

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.480 
got no indication otherwise that had
everything<00:04:21.090> lined<00:04:21.570> up<00:04:21.750> correctly<00:04:22.250> this<00:04:23.250> would

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
everything lined up correctly this would

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.780 
everything lined up correctly this would
have<00:04:23.580> been<00:04:23.610> pulling<00:04:23.970> down<00:04:24.090> seven<00:04:25.460> now<00:04:26.460> today

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
have been pulling down seven now today

pull<00:06:02.750> down<00:06:02.900> about<00:06:03.050> seven<00:06:03.320> so<00:06:04.190> this<00:06:04.550> is<00:06:04.580> the

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
pull down about seven so this is the

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.060 
pull down about seven so this is the

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
all the same parts in pieces so i'll

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.710
