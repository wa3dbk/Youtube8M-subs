00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
way down to the end this is where a

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.959 
way down to the end this is where a
knife<00:00:53.050> most<00:00:53.589> commonly<00:00:54.010> slips<00:00:54.370> off<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.760> bone

and you can hit your non-dominant hand
with<00:00:56.949> it<00:00:57.129> once<00:00:57.489> we<00:00:57.670> make<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:58.000> first<00:00:58.420> initial

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
with it once we make that first initial

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.349 
with it once we make that first initial
slice<00:00:59.440> we're<00:00:59.920> gonna<00:01:00.010> start<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.460> peel<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.120> rack

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
slice we're gonna start to peel the rack

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.930

of<00:01:01.570> ribs<00:01:01.809> off<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.710> primary<00:01:03.160> muscle<00:01:03.339> because

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
of ribs off the primary muscle because

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.730 
of ribs off the primary muscle because
it's<00:01:04.180> crescent-shaped<00:01:04.780> we'll<00:01:05.350> need<00:01:05.439> to<00:01:05.619> make

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
it's crescent-shaped we'll need to make

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.440 
it's crescent-shaped we'll need to make
multiple<00:01:06.100> slices<00:01:06.670> we're<00:01:06.790> going<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:07.000> slide

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
multiple slices we're going to slide

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.620 
multiple slices we're going to slide
down<00:01:07.479> not<00:01:08.610> interrupting<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:10.000> main<00:01:10.210> part<00:01:10.570> of

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
down not interrupting the main part of

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.390 
down not interrupting the main part of
the<00:01:10.750> muscle<00:01:11.079> we're<00:01:11.229> just<00:01:11.590> taking<00:01:11.770> this<00:01:12.070> rib

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
the muscle we're just taking this rib

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.090 
the muscle we're just taking this rib
slab<00:01:12.729> off<00:01:13.000> so<00:01:13.420> after<00:01:13.900> every<00:01:14.200> slice<00:01:14.500> we<00:01:14.710> want<00:01:14.979> to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
slab off so after every slice we want to

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.370 
slab off so after every slice we want to
give<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:15.369> just<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.820> little<00:01:16.000> pull<00:01:16.540> just<00:01:17.170> to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
give it just a little pull just to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.230 
give it just a little pull just to
separate<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.159> bone<00:01:18.430> from<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.759> meat<00:01:19.030> and

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
separate that bone from the meat and

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.060 
separate that bone from the meat and
make<00:01:19.570> sure<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.990> we're<00:01:20.140> not<00:01:20.170> interrupting

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
make sure that we're not interrupting

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.800 
make sure that we're not interrupting
the<00:01:21.159> muscle<00:01:21.549> with<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.939> knife<00:01:22.119> once<00:01:22.509> we<00:01:22.689> get

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the muscle with the knife once we get

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.690 
the muscle with the knife once we get
down<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.320> end<00:01:23.470> where<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.070> nearly<00:01:24.430> off

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
down to the end where it's nearly off

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.100 
down to the end where it's nearly off
the<00:01:24.939> rib<00:01:25.119> bone<00:01:25.270> towards<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.720> chine<00:01:25.930> bone

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
the rib bone towards the chine bone

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.100 
the rib bone towards the chine bone
takes<00:01:26.439> an<00:01:26.680> extreme<00:01:27.250> left<00:01:27.759> turn<00:01:28.030> peel<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.780> rib

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
takes an extreme left turn peel that rib

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.780 
takes an extreme left turn peel that rib
back<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.619> then<00:01:29.890> change<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.280> direction<00:01:30.430> of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
back and then change the direction of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
our knife to go right across the top of

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.440 
our knife to go right across the top of
those<00:01:33.009> bones<00:01:33.310> right<00:01:33.729> where<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.030> chine<00:01:34.270> bone

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
those bones right where the chine bone

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.510 
those bones right where the chine bone
was<00:01:34.659> removed<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:35.350> that's<00:01:35.920> how<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.130> remove

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
was removed and that's how you remove

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.060 
was removed and that's how you remove
the<00:01:37.000> rib<00:01:37.180> bones<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.600> favorite<00:01:38.140> way<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.560> my<00:01:38.710> dad
