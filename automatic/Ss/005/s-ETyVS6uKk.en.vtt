chess<00:01:41.110> is<00:01:41.140> not<00:01:41.290> an<00:01:41.680> easy<00:01:41.830> sport<00:01:42.280> but<00:01:42.760> requires

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
chess is not an easy sport but requires

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.270 
chess is not an easy sport but requires
a<00:01:43.510> lot<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.870> concentration<00:01:44.170> from<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.040> players

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
a lot of concentration from the players

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.520 
a lot of concentration from the players
side<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:45.850> it's<00:01:46.300> precisely<00:01:46.990> in<00:01:47.380> these

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
side and it's precisely in these

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.590 
side and it's precisely in these
episodes<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.729> have<00:01:48.970> your<00:01:49.119> chance<00:01:49.420> to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
episodes that you have your chance to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600 
episodes that you have your chance to
develop<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:50.140> technique<00:01:50.500> where<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.100> keep<00:01:51.369> your

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
develop a technique where you keep your

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.330 
develop a technique where you keep your
calm<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.150> stressful<00:01:52.180> situations<00:01:52.950> which<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.160> a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
calm in stressful situations which is a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.300 
calm in stressful situations which is a
chef<00:01:54.820> essential<00:01:55.450> for<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.750> chess<00:01:55.960> player<00:01:56.310> but

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
chef essential for a chess player but

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.340 
chef essential for a chess player but
now<00:01:57.520> let's<00:01:58.030> take<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.420> look<00:01:58.690> on<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.869> solution

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
now let's take a look on the solution

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.950 
now let's take a look on the solution
first<00:02:00.160> of<00:02:00.490> all<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:00.910> see<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.210> we<00:02:01.540> have<00:02:01.720> two

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
first of all we see that we have two

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.530 
first of all we see that we have two
strong<00:02:02.350> roots<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.100> D<00:02:03.340> line<00:02:03.580> waiting<00:02:04.180> to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
strong roots in the D line waiting to

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.260 
strong roots in the D line waiting to
checkmate<00:02:04.810> on<00:02:05.229> d8<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.550> would<00:02:06.729> indeed<00:02:07.210> be

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
checkmate on d8 and it would indeed be

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.749 
checkmate on d8 and it would indeed be
checkmate<00:02:07.990> if<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.770> knight<00:02:08.950> couldn't<00:02:09.520> be<00:02:09.610> able

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
checkmate if the knight couldn't be able

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.790 
checkmate if the knight couldn't be able
to<00:02:09.940> take<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.479> route<00:02:10.660> as<00:02:10.840> soon<00:02:11.320> as<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.620> came

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
to take the route as soon as it came

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.670 
to take the route as soon as it came
down<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.480> knight<00:02:13.690> wouldn't<00:02:14.260> stand<00:02:14.530> on

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
down but if the knight wouldn't stand on

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.520 
down but if the knight wouldn't stand on
s7<00:02:15.550> at<00:02:15.760> all<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.450> would<00:02:16.870> still<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.470> be

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
s7 at all it would still not be

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.430 
s7 at all it would still not be
checkmate<00:02:18.250> because<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.090> f7<00:02:19.630> squared<00:02:20.110> would

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
checkmate because the f7 squared would

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.759 
checkmate because the f7 squared would
then<00:02:20.709> be<00:02:20.980> an<00:02:21.190> escape<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.180> black<00:02:22.390> King<00:02:22.769> but

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
then be an escape for the black King but

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.310 
then be an escape for the black King but
we<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.190> get<00:02:24.430> around<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.910> anyway<00:02:25.360> we<00:02:25.959> start

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
we can get around it anyway we start

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.410 
we can get around it anyway we start
with<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.709> rook<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.100> DA<00:02:27.280> check<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.209> knight

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
with the rook to DA check the knight

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.020 
with the rook to DA check the knight
takes<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.170> now<00:02:29.709> we'll<00:02:30.130> play<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.610> cunning

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
takes it and now we'll play that cunning

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.740 
takes it and now we'll play that cunning
move<00:02:31.360> Bishop<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.989> h5<00:02:32.950> check<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.420> check

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
move Bishop to h5 check the check

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.440 
move Bishop to h5 check the check
removes<00:02:35.200> f7<00:02:35.980> as<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.130> potential<00:02:36.790> escape<00:02:37.150> square

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
removes f7 as a potential escape square

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.620 
removes f7 as a potential escape square
forcing<00:02:38.350> black<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.830> play<00:02:39.010> either<00:02:39.280> King<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.180> SH

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
forcing black to play either King to SH

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.120 
forcing black to play either King to SH
or<00:02:40.989> nice<00:02:41.799> blocks<00:02:42.280> on<00:02:42.489> f7<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.959> what<00:02:44.230> do<00:02:44.500> we<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.860> if

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
or nice blocks on f7 so what do we do if

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.610 
or nice blocks on f7 so what do we do if
black<00:02:45.430> chooses<00:02:45.940> one<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.420> two<00:02:46.720> moves<00:02:46.989> find

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
black chooses one of the two moves find

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:58.530 
black chooses one of the two moves find
out<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:47.950> night<00:02:56.160> well<00:02:57.160> if<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.730> King<00:02:58.000> goes<00:02:58.269> to
