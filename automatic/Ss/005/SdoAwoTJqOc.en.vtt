on<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:12.959> airplane<00:00:13.730> one<00:00:14.730> thing<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:14.999> surprised

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:15.659 
on the airplane one thing that surprised

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.929 
on the airplane one thing that surprised
me<00:00:15.869> after<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> did<00:00:16.980> get<00:00:17.099> up<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> air<00:00:17.490> too<00:00:17.730> was

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
me after I did get up in the air too was

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.060 
me after I did get up in the air too was
that<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.420> had<00:00:18.689> to<00:00:18.929> completely<00:00:19.439> reframe<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that I had to completely reframe the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.939 
that I had to completely reframe the
airplane<00:00:20.460> again<00:00:21.289> since<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.439> last<00:00:22.619> light<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
airplane again since the last light I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.070 
airplane again since the last light I
had<00:00:23.130> painted<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.000> course<00:00:24.179> I<00:00:24.509> had<00:00:24.689> added

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
had painted it of course I had added

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560 
had painted it of course I had added
some<00:00:25.259> foam<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.800> get<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.369> buoyancy<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
some foam to get the buoyancy and the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
some foam to get the buoyancy and the
way<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.839> wrote<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.589> the<00:00:28.679> water<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.009> little

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
way it wrote on the water a little

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.549 
way it wrote on the water a little
better<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:35.120> those<00:00:36.120> things<00:00:36.539> I<00:00:36.809> guess<00:00:37.050> combined

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
better and those things I guess combined

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.930 
better and those things I guess combined
to<00:00:38.370> change<00:00:38.670> some<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> trims<00:00:40.520> so<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> first

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to change some of the trims so the first

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.920 
to change some of the trims so the first
flight<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.449> a<00:00:42.510> was<00:00:43.199> not<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.680> smooth<00:00:44.070> or<00:00:44.430> as

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
flight was a was not as smooth or as

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.420 
flight was a was not as smooth or as
nice<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.140> I'd<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.859> is<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
nice as I'd like here is one of the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
nice as I'd like here is one of the
roles<00:00:47.640> i<00:00:47.940> did<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> slow<00:00:48.539> roll<00:00:48.750> i<00:00:48.780> did<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
roles i did a slow roll i did in the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.869 
roles i did a slow roll i did in the
first<00:00:50.039> flight<00:00:51.079> off<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.410> water<00:00:52.620> third<00:00:53.550> flight

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
first flight off the water third flight

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.479 
first flight off the water third flight
again<00:00:54.120> overall<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.949> I've<00:00:56.070> spliced

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
again overall and here I've spliced

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.639 
again overall and here I've spliced
together<00:00:56.699> from<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.510> flight<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> series

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
together from the first flight a series

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.169 
together from the first flight a series
of<00:00:59.420> skins<00:01:00.620> splashes<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> various<00:01:02.609> kinds<00:01:03.059> of

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
of skins splashes and various kinds of

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.050 
of skins splashes and various kinds of
ways<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:04.080> touching<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> water<00:01:04.769> you'll<00:01:05.729> notice

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
ways of touching the water you'll notice

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
ways of touching the water you'll notice
that<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.360> does<00:01:06.540> handle<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:06.930> nice<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.560> does

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that it does handle very nice and does

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.390 
that it does handle very nice and does
land<00:01:08.009> very<00:01:08.280> nice<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> very<00:01:11.189> nice

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
land very nice that was a very nice

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.929 
land very nice that was a very nice

thrust static in a four pound total

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.289 
thrust static in a four pound total
weight<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:39.520> plenty<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:39.969> vertical

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
weight that's plenty of vertical

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.120 
weight that's plenty of vertical
capability<00:01:40.960> when<00:01:41.079> I<00:01:41.109> like<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.710> use<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
capability when I like to use the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.059 
capability when I like to use the
throttle<00:01:43.500> most<00:01:44.500> of<00:01:44.649> these<00:01:44.740> landings<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.429> was

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
throttle most of these landings I was

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.169 
throttle most of these landings I was
bringing<00:01:48.069> the<00:01:48.189> throttle<00:01:48.549> down<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.759> about<00:01:49.119> a

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
bringing the throttle down to about a

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.209 
bringing the throttle down to about a
third<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:49.840> then<00:01:49.990> taking<00:01:50.409> it<00:01:50.590> down<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:50.829> about<00:01:50.979> a

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
third and then taking it down to about a

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.149 
third and then taking it down to about a
quarter<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.810> touchdown<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.439> find<00:01:53.709> it<00:01:53.859> flies

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
quarter for a touchdown I find it flies

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.069 
quarter for a touchdown I find it flies
a<00:01:54.189> little<00:01:54.729> bit<00:01:54.850> better<00:01:55.060> if<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.359> keep<00:01:55.569> some<00:01:55.780> pedal

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
a little bit better if I keep some pedal

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.710 
a little bit better if I keep some pedal
on<00:01:58.500> here's<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.590> loop<00:02:00.310> from<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.789> first<00:02:01.450> flight

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
on here's a loop from the first flight

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.749 
on here's a loop from the first flight
you'll<00:02:01.959> note<00:02:02.200> in<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.530> second<00:02:03.220> flight<00:02:03.459> over

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
you'll note in the second flight over

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.959 
you'll note in the second flight over
and<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.060> order<00:02:05.099> since<00:02:06.099> I<00:02:06.189> had<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.369> trims<00:02:06.729> all

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
and the order since I had the trims all

and the order since I had the trims all
up<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.509> was<00:02:07.719> really<00:02:08.019> concentrating<00:02:08.890> more

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
up and I was really concentrating more

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.369 
up and I was really concentrating more
on<00:02:09.099> just<00:02:09.519> having<00:02:09.670> fun<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.299> an<00:02:10.690> air<00:02:10.869> show<00:02:11.110> that

on just having fun and an air show that
I<00:02:11.769> do<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.819> much<00:02:13.060> better<00:02:13.090> job<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.920> wowing<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
I do a much better job of wowing the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.890 
I do a much better job of wowing the
audience<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.670> had<00:02:15.879> collected<00:02:16.450> quite<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.690> few

second<00:02:20.769> flight<00:02:24.870> okay<00:02:25.870> I'm<00:02:26.019> coming<00:02:26.200> by<00:02:26.560> for

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
second flight okay I'm coming by for

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.039 
second flight okay I'm coming by for
just<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.250> nice<00:02:27.459> fly<00:02:27.849> by<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.480> get<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:28.660> sense<00:02:28.720> of

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
just a nice fly by so you get a sense of

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.660 
just a nice fly by so you get a sense of
the<00:02:29.110> excess<00:02:29.860> looks<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:32.220> did<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.519> first

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
the excess looks I did on the first

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.809 
the excess looks I did on the first
flight<00:02:33.940> roll<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.389> inverted<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.019> do<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.819> low

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
flight roll it inverted and do a low

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.240 
flight roll it inverted and do a low
inverted<00:02:37.299> pass<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:38.380> doesn't<00:02:38.799> look<00:02:38.889> as<00:02:39.130> low

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
inverted pass this doesn't look as low

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.920 
inverted pass this doesn't look as low
as<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.489> actually<00:02:39.880> was<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.120> was<00:02:40.480> probably<00:02:40.690> more

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
as it actually was I was probably more

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.920 
as it actually was I was probably more
like<00:02:41.170> seven<00:02:41.620> or<00:02:41.650> eight<00:02:41.799> feet<00:02:41.950> off<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.160> water

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
like seven or eight feet off the water

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.180 
like seven or eight feet off the water
we<00:02:43.930> didn't<00:02:44.260> get<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.470> water<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:44.889> frame<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
we didn't get the water in the frame to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.199 
we didn't get the water in the frame to
see<00:02:45.609> that

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.420 

there's<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.390> four-point<00:02:51.349> role<00:02:51.560> going<00:02:51.920> downwind

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
there's a four-point role going downwind

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.710 
there's a four-point role going downwind
and<00:02:52.930> preparation<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.049> believe<00:02:54.409> for<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:55.720> final

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
and preparation I believe for the final

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.710 
and preparation I believe for the final
landing<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.290> first<00:02:57.500> flight<00:03:01.390> here<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.540> see

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
landing of the first flight here you see

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.420 
landing of the first flight here you see
me<00:03:02.750> lining<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.560> sort<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.860> flew<00:03:04.159> it<00:03:04.280> into

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
me lining up and I sort of flew it into

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.250 
me lining up and I sort of flew it into
the<00:03:04.579> water<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.030> on<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:05.420> particular<00:03:05.599> what

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
the water that on this particular what

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.970 
the water that on this particular what
it<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:07.010> course<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.519> just<00:03:07.760> sort<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.030> skips<00:03:08.329> and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
it of course it just sort of skips and

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.229 
it of course it just sort of skips and
shakes<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.159> off<00:03:12.459> handling<00:03:13.459> on<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.790> water<00:03:14.000> was

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
shakes it off handling on the water was

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.089 
shakes it off handling on the water was
very<00:03:14.269> good<00:03:14.840> i<00:03:14.959> don't<00:03:15.079> have<00:03:15.379> a<00:03:15.409> water<00:03:15.709> rudder<00:03:16.010> on

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
very good i don't have a water rudder on

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.440 
very good i don't have a water rudder on
this<00:03:16.420> plane<00:03:17.420> but<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.840> does<00:03:18.019> have<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> very<00:03:18.890> large

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
this plane but it does have a very large

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.920 
this plane but it does have a very large
tail<00:03:20.450> surface<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.790> does<00:03:22.790> pivot<00:03:23.239> around<00:03:23.329> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
tail surface and does pivot around the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.750 
tail surface and does pivot around the
wetted<00:03:24.349> surface<00:03:24.769> very<00:03:25.040> well<00:03:27.609> I'll<00:03:28.609> be

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
wetted surface very well I'll be

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.250 
wetted surface very well I'll be
interested<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.329> see<00:03:29.599> in<00:03:29.870> windy<00:03:30.230> conditions

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
interested to see in windy conditions

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.140 
interested to see in windy conditions
how<00:03:30.889> well<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.280> can<00:03:31.519> turn<00:03:31.909> it<00:03:33.069> but<00:03:34.069> certainly<00:03:35.000> in

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
how well I can turn it but certainly in

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.420 
how well I can turn it but certainly in
these<00:03:35.329> almost<00:03:36.139> calm<00:03:36.470> conditions<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:37.250> was

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
these almost calm conditions it was

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.670 
these almost calm conditions it was
excellent<00:03:38.680> anyway<00:03:39.680> thanks<00:03:40.069> for<00:03:40.129> watching
