00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
in the beginning they had like a trivia

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.899 
in the beginning they had like a trivia
thing<00:06:17.680> they<00:06:17.860> said<00:06:18.070> guess<00:06:18.340> how<00:06:18.490> many<00:06:18.580> people

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
thing they said guess how many people

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.820

the trail there are a hundred and five
scare<00:06:22.750> actors<00:06:23.080> and<00:06:23.320> I<00:06:23.440> would<00:06:23.650> imagine<00:06:23.800> we

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
scare actors and I would imagine we

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.280 
scare actors and I would imagine we
maybe<00:06:24.280> saw<00:06:24.520> 30<00:06:24.790> so<00:06:25.420> I<00:06:25.450> think<00:06:25.930> they<00:06:26.080> might<00:06:26.230> be

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
maybe saw 30 so I think they might be

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.140 
maybe saw 30 so I think they might be
fibbing<00:06:26.950> about<00:06:27.010> their<00:06:27.370> numbers<00:06:27.700> a<00:06:27.730> little<00:06:28.030> bit

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
fibbing about their numbers a little bit

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.800 
fibbing about their numbers a little bit
or<00:06:28.390> the<00:06:28.570> size<00:06:29.190> it<00:06:30.190> had<00:06:30.370> so<00:06:30.610> much<00:06:30.640> potential<00:06:31.180> and

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
or the size it had so much potential and

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.300 
or the size it had so much potential and
it<00:06:31.930> was<00:06:32.020> a<00:06:32.080> good<00:06:32.230> price<00:06:32.410> to<00:06:32.620> like<00:06:32.800> well<00:06:33.130> this

one was twenty bucks but it normally is

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.590 
one was twenty bucks but it normally is
fifteen<00:06:35.050> bucks<00:06:35.260> a<00:06:35.440> person<00:06:35.730> but<00:06:36.730> it<00:06:37.300> had<00:06:37.450> so

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
fifteen bucks a person but it had so

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.350
