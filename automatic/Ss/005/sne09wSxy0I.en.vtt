00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.080
 the potato put mesh 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.600
 gl 34c from grimmel you can see here 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.210
 unlike others she is using a gps 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.980
 antenna a job computer and one 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.930
 electro-hydraulic steering valve 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.000
 equipped the wheels of the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.830
 Machine controls in addition controlled 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.310
 a steering angle sensor the position of the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.010
 bikes 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.110
 a dutch farmer has here 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.480
 the laying machine with a saving 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.160
 Machine combines the team is long 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.230
 and confusing the tractor 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.090
 also with gps and with one 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.090
 equipped with automatic steering 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.880
 this is operated via the touchscreen 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.380
 Terminal in the cabin 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.930
 in the row steers the tractor 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.370
 automatically put the potato falls 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.410
 Follow the tug on the premises 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.120
 the driver has to steer himself while 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.310
 The tractor is already in the curve 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.230
 the laying machine is still running for so long 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.220
 straight on until you end up in rows 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.410
 has arrived 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.800
 then the lounger mechanism switches 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.140
 automatically off and the wheels of the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.479
 Machine steer the tractor behind 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.280
 and so that the device is exactly 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.240
 just in the next planting row 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.240
 can enter 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.420
 the electrohydraulically controlled 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.490
 Impellers correct for this with small ones 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.580
 steering the direction is this 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.860
 exactly fits thanks to the gps antenna on the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.140
 Nearby machine also recognizes the system where 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.240
 start the potato purely in each case and 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.170
 should end 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.820
 Accordingly, the lege turns 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.350
 automatically switching mechanism 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.880
 or from during the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.920
 potato life can become the driver 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.720
 fully on his tools 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.040
 focus and when needed 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.260
 Change settings 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.110
 the tractor and the machine steer yes 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.780
 Even the result rows straight 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.200
 which all start in a line and 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.200
 end up
