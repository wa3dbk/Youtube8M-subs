00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.029 
cool from scene to scene but I can't
think<00:04:49.780> of<00:04:49.990> anything<00:04:50.289> like<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.560> didn't

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
think of anything like it didn't

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.129 
think of anything like it didn't
captivate<00:04:51.669> me<00:04:51.699> it's<00:04:52.030> like<00:04:52.120> okay<00:04:52.389> this<00:04:52.960> is<00:04:53.020> the

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
captivate me it's like okay this is the

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.719 
captivate me it's like okay this is the
Avengers<00:04:53.650> coming<00:04:53.979> you<00:04:54.039> know<00:04:54.159> this<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.430> this

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
Avengers coming you know this is this

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.519 
Avengers coming you know this is this
personally<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.180> just<00:04:55.300> didn't<00:04:55.810> get<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.319> and

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:56.529 
personally I just didn't get that and

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.320 
personally I just didn't get that and
then<00:04:56.889> I<00:04:56.919> think<00:04:57.159> he<00:04:57.250> left<00:04:57.550> some<00:04:57.759> of<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:57.909> action

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
then I think he left some of the action

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.390 
then I think he left some of the action
sequences<00:04:58.479> flat<00:04:59.020> for<00:04:59.229> me<00:04:59.349> like<00:04:59.830> I<00:04:59.949> said<00:05:00.009> in<00:05:00.370> my

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
sequences flat for me like I said in my

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.860 
sequences flat for me like I said in my
review<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:00.939> only<00:05:01.180> action<00:05:01.389> sequence<00:05:01.689> I<00:05:01.750> can

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
review the only action sequence I can

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.510 
review the only action sequence I can
remember<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.259> because<00:05:02.590> because<00:05:03.009> it<00:05:03.129> was<00:05:03.219> Hulk

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
remember is because because it was Hulk

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.990 
remember is because because it was Hulk
and<00:05:04.889> Hulkbuster<00:05:05.889> suit<00:05:05.919> that<00:05:06.310> little<00:05:06.759> is<00:05:06.879> it

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
and Hulkbuster suit that little is it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.249 
and Hulkbuster suit that little is it
everything<00:05:07.210> else<00:05:07.449> was<00:05:07.629> kind<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:07.900> like<00:05:07.990> at

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
everything else was kind of like at

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.589 
everything else was kind of like at
school<00:05:08.439> action<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.279> his<00:05:09.370> dies<00:05:09.550> but<00:05:09.879> nothing

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
school action and his dies but nothing

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.779 
school action and his dies but nothing
but<00:05:10.719> i<00:05:10.750> think<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.229> score<00:05:11.650> was<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.009> main<00:05:12.219> thing

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
but i think the score was the main thing

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.209 
but i think the score was the main thing
that<00:05:13.000> because<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.569> got<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.840> movie<00:05:14.740> with<00:05:14.889> a<00:05:14.979> very

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
that because you got a movie with a very

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.820 
that because you got a movie with a very
generic<00:05:15.400> score<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.479> also<00:05:17.259> did<00:05:17.439> you<00:05:17.529> know<00:05:17.650> like

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
generic score and also did you know like

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.610
