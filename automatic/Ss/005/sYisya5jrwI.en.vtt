hi everyone this is aaron for xolo tech
and<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.400> be<00:00:08.519> comparing<00:00:09.030> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
and we're going to be comparing the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.100 
and we're going to be comparing the
YouTube<00:00:10.139> application<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:11.099> ipad<00:00:11.820> 1<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.450> ipad<00:00:12.840> 2

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
YouTube application on ipad 1 and ipad 2

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.770 
YouTube application on ipad 1 and ipad 2
to<00:00:13.860> see<00:00:14.070> how<00:00:14.280> fast<00:00:14.700> they<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.030> load<00:00:15.420> we're<00:00:15.660> on

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
to see how fast they can load we're on

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.480 
to see how fast they can load we're on
the<00:00:15.870> same<00:00:16.020> Wi-Fi<00:00:16.260> network<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.190> figured

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
the same Wi-Fi network and we figured

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.920 
the same Wi-Fi network and we figured
we'd<00:00:17.609> give<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.970> shot<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.420> people<00:00:18.690> want<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
we'd give it a shot some people want to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.840 
we'd give it a shot some people want to
see<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.230> comparison<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.039> I'm<00:00:20.369> trying<00:00:20.640> to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
see that comparison and I'm trying to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.550 
see that comparison and I'm trying to
show<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.060> all<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.630> comparisons<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.289> want<00:00:22.470> to

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
show you all the comparisons you want to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.960 
show you all the comparisons you want to
see<00:00:22.710> as<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.250> see<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> screen<00:00:23.820> brightness

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
see as you can see the screen brightness

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.660 
see as you can see the screen brightness
is<00:00:24.390> set<00:00:24.720> by<00:00:25.590> me<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.130> auto<00:00:26.400> brightness

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
is set by me it's not auto brightness

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
is set by me it's not auto brightness
and<00:00:27.119> they're<00:00:27.240> about<00:00:27.359> half<00:00:27.689> each<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.650> some

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and they're about half each I know some

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.259 
and they're about half each I know some
people<00:00:28.890> had<00:00:29.220> mentioned<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.760> another<00:00:29.910> video

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
people had mentioned in another video

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.959 
people had mentioned in another video
that<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.410> brightness<00:00:31.859> seemed<00:00:32.130> brighter<00:00:32.850> on

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
that the brightness seemed brighter on

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.260 
that the brightness seemed brighter on
the<00:00:33.120> ipad<00:00:33.540> 2<00:00:34.670> honestly<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.210> were

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the ipad 2 honestly I think they were

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
the ipad 2 honestly I think they were
looking<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> auto<00:00:37.559> brightness<00:00:37.860> or

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
looking at the auto brightness or

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.530 
looking at the auto brightness or
setting<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> settings<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.210> little<00:00:39.420> bit

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
setting the settings a little bit

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
setting the settings a little bit
differently<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.079> some<00:00:40.260> reason<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.710> let's<00:00:40.860> go

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010

loading so you can see it's hits
definitely<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> difference<00:01:17.729> I've<00:01:18.479> actually

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
definitely a difference I've actually

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.080 
definitely a difference I've actually
noticed<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.950> using<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> myself<00:01:20.549> how

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
noticed that just using it myself how

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.840 
noticed that just using it myself how
much<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> difference<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> ipad<00:01:22.380> 2<00:01:22.850> can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
much of a difference the ipad 2 can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
much of a difference the ipad 2 can
handle<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.540> our<00:01:24.810> video<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.740> things<00:01:26.130> playing

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
handle I our video and things playing

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.219 
handle I our video and things playing
streaming<00:01:27.060> off<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> web<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.720> seems<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
streaming off the web it just seems to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
streaming off the web it just seems to
be<00:01:28.590> able<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> handle<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.369> quickly<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
be able to handle a lot more quickly and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.910 
be able to handle a lot more quickly and
obviously<00:01:31.170> that's<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.650> some

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
obviously that's going to be some

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
obviously that's going to be some
because<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> processor<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.270> i'm

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
because of the processor but i'm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
because of the processor but i'm
guessing<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.200> ram<00:01:34.470> has<00:01:34.680> something<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> do

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
guessing the ram has something to do

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.609 
guessing the ram has something to do
that<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.610> there<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.600> finally<00:01:36.780> played<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.409> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that and there it finally played on that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
that and there it finally played on that
video<00:01:37.920> pretty<00:01:38.490> crazy<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.030> difference

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
video pretty crazy the difference

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.010 
video pretty crazy the difference
between<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> two<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:41.540> that's<00:01:42.540> how<00:01:42.720> much<00:01:42.869> it's

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
between the two and that's how much it's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.719 
between the two and that's how much it's
loaded<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.310> that's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
loaded there you can see it's that's

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.749 
loaded there you can see it's that's
about<00:01:45.000> even<00:01:45.299> let's<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.079> ahead<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.500> back

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
about even let's go ahead and go back

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.889 
about even let's go ahead and go back
let's<00:01:47.759> try<00:01:48.030> something<00:01:48.329> we'll<00:01:48.630> try<00:01:48.780> another

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899

enough and I don't know we're on
wireless<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.140> should<00:02:32.349> be<00:02:32.470> loading<00:02:32.799> just

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
wireless and it should be loading just

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.390 
wireless and it should be loading just
as<00:02:33.220> well<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:33.940> fast<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:35.260> that's<00:02:35.950> really

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
as well just just fast so that's really

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.759 
as well just just fast so that's really
an<00:02:36.730> interesting<00:02:37.150> comparison<00:02:37.510> let's<00:02:38.470> go<00:02:38.620> ahead

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
an interesting comparison let's go ahead

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.660 
an interesting comparison let's go ahead
and<00:02:38.890> exit<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:40.349> there<00:02:41.349> we<00:02:41.470> go<00:02:41.620> can<00:02:42.190> see<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:42.579> a

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
and exit this there we go can see it's a

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.069 
and exit this there we go can see it's a
little<00:02:43.000> bit<00:02:43.090> slower<00:02:43.329> now<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.510> do<00:02:43.599> have<00:02:43.720> some

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
little bit slower now I do have some

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.800 
little bit slower now I do have some
