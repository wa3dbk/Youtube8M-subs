say in the video that if you followed
this<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> would<00:00:53.730> build<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> plane<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
this then you would build the plane and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
this then you would build the plane and
once<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> build<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> plane<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.920> could<00:00:56.039> fly

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
once you build the plane you could fly

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.099 
once you build the plane you could fly
off<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> island<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.690> obviously<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
off the island because obviously the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
off the island because obviously the
prison<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> island<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.370> once<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.640> fly

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
prison is on the island and once you fly

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
prison is on the island and once you fly
off<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> island<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:00.870> away<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.949> I'm

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
off the island then get away so I'm

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.470 
off the island then get away so I'm
thinking<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> main<00:01:03.210> thing<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
thinking that's the main thing that

thinking that's the main thing that
you've<00:01:03.690> gotta<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.159> can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
you've gotta do and to do that you can

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.250 
you've gotta do and to do that you can

this yet so I'm just following of what i

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
this yet so I'm just following of what i
think<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.509> giving<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.960> guys<00:01:28.140> an<00:01:28.290> idea<00:01:28.380> on

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
think and giving you guys an idea on

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.469 
think and giving you guys an idea on
what<00:01:28.799> i<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.340> picture<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
what i think of this picture and what I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.999 
what i think of this picture and what I
think<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.810> links<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.560> could<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.740> in

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
think it links to what it could be in

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.280 
think it links to what it could be in
the<00:01:32.100> easter<00:01:32.400> egg<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.329> basically<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.110> can

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the easter egg so basically as you can

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.289 
the easter egg so basically as you can
see<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.220> gone<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.579> second<00:01:36.060> page<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
see if you gone to the second page of

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.420 
see if you gone to the second page of
the<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.259> hand<00:01:37.439> side<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.009> says

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the so the right hand side it says

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.390 
the so the right hand side it says
remember<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:40.380> forget<00:01:40.680> so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
remember all this and don't forget so

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
remember all this and don't forget so
basically<00:01:41.670> got<00:01:41.880> remember<00:01:42.210> everything<00:01:42.479> on

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
basically got remember everything on

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.210 
basically got remember everything on
this<00:01:42.899> pager<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.590> obviously<00:01:43.890> means<00:01:44.009> it's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this pager this obviously means it's

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.950 
this pager this obviously means it's
quite<00:01:44.490> important<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.600> underneath<00:01:45.840> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
quite important and then underneath that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.010 
quite important and then underneath that
s<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> escape<00:01:47.100> plan<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:48.210> step<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
s is the escape plan I'm step one is to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
s is the escape plan I'm step one is to
find<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> wardens<00:01:49.829> key<00:01:50.159> how<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:50.790> find<00:01:51.149> this

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
find the wardens key how we find this

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.240 
find the wardens key how we find this
key<00:01:51.479> i'm<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:52.049> sure<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.320> i'm<00:01:52.590> gonna<00:01:52.740> say<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
key i'm not sure but i'm gonna say that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
key i'm not sure but i'm gonna say that
sort<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> right<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> says<00:01:54.420> find<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
sort of right that it says find the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.959 
sort of right that it says find the
poles<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.920> poles<00:01:56.250> are<00:01:56.520> actually<00:01:56.850> in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
poles and the poles are actually in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.760 
poles and the poles are actually in
after<00:01:57.329> line<00:01:57.450> check<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:58.020> last<00:01:58.200> video<00:01:58.409> guys

after line check out my last video guys

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
after line check out my last video guys
are<00:01:59.450> uploaded<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.509> bit<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.719> Arthur<00:02:01.020> life

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
are uploaded a bit of Arthur life

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.929 
are uploaded a bit of Arthur life
gameplay<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> new

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
gameplay it's going to be the new

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.510 
gameplay it's going to be the new
gameplay<00:02:03.420> inside<00:02:03.930> mob<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> dead<00:02:05.040> so

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
gameplay inside mob of the dead so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.950 
gameplay inside mob of the dead so
basically<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.210> step<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.659> find<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
basically for the step one to find the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
basically for the step one to find the
wardens<00:02:07.290> keys<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.520> find

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
wardens keys I think you have to find

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.460 
wardens keys I think you have to find
portals<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.420> side<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> portals<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
portals and side the portals is going to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.690 
portals and side the portals is going to
be<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> wardens<00:02:11.039> key<00:02:11.250> or<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.550> might<00:02:11.640> be

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
be the wardens key or it might be

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.309 
be the wardens key or it might be
somewhere<00:02:12.120> else<00:02:12.180> about

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
somewhere else about

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.929 
somewhere else about
so<00:02:13.409> once<00:02:13.590> you've<00:02:13.739> found<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.069> warden<00:02:14.459> key<00:02:14.670> then

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
so once you've found the warden key then

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.190 
so once you've found the warden key then
you<00:02:15.060> could<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.359> going<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.659> have<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.109> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
you could then going to have to get the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.589 
you could then going to have to get the
plane<00:02:16.409> parts<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.609> think<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.879> plane<00:02:18.180> parts

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
plane parts and I think the plane parts

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.089 
plane parts and I think the plane parts
if<00:02:18.749> you<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:18.959> on<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.139> first<00:02:19.349> page<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.829> on<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
if you go on the first page so on the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.160 
if you go on the first page so on the
left-hand<00:02:20.310> side<00:02:20.489> screen<00:02:20.879> around<00:02:21.749> the<00:02:21.900> plane

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
left-hand side screen around the plane

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.559 
left-hand side screen around the plane
if<00:02:22.469> you<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.189> guys<00:02:23.400> you've<00:02:23.639> got<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.790> few<00:02:24.060> parts

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
if you see guys you've got a few parts

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.839 
if you see guys you've got a few parts
you<00:02:24.719> got<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.079> couple<00:02:25.590> pipes<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.370> like

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
you got like a couple pipes and like

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.489 
you got like a couple pipes and like
some<00:02:27.060> sort<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.269> engine<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.870> propeller<00:02:27.959> and

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
some sort of engine and propeller and

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.949 
some sort of engine and propeller and
with<00:02:29.370> em<00:02:29.459> sort<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.760> parts<00:02:30.209> they've<00:02:30.599> got<00:02:30.750> loads

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
with em sort of parts they've got loads

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.119 
with em sort of parts they've got loads
of<00:02:31.079> different<00:02:31.200> parts<00:02:31.560> i<00:02:31.650> think<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:31.980> have

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
of different parts i think you can have

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.699 
of different parts i think you can have
to<00:02:32.219> find<00:02:32.459> all<00:02:32.730> these<00:02:32.879> pots<00:02:33.209> on<00:02:33.480> screen<00:02:33.900> now<00:02:34.469> so

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
to find all these pots on screen now so

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.140 
to find all these pots on screen now so
you<00:02:34.799> know<00:02:35.069> these<00:02:35.400> are<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.760> parts<00:02:36.060> are

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you know these are what the parts are

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.270 
you know these are what the parts are
going<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.329> look<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.599> guys<00:02:36.989> step<00:02:37.889> 3<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.099> going

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
going to look like guys step 3 is going

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.409 
going to look like guys step 3 is going
to<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.430> able<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.639> build<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.939> plane<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.329> the

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:39.419 
to be able to build the plane on the

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.839 
to be able to build the plane on the
roof<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.709> important<00:02:41.219> the<00:02:41.370> planes<00:02:41.609> built

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
roof so it is important the planes built

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.720 
roof so it is important the planes built
on<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.299> roof<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.659> the<00:02:43.139> prison<00:02:43.499> once<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.519> go<00:02:44.669> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
on the roof of the prison once you go to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.860 
on the roof of the prison once you go to
play<00:02:44.969> on<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.239> roof<00:02:45.419> they<00:02:45.569> know<00:02:45.689> that<00:02:45.780> you're

play on the roof they know that you're
obviously<00:02:46.049> going<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.319> be<00:02:46.409> able<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.620> fly<00:02:46.859> it<00:02:46.919> and

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
obviously going to be able to fly it and

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.459 
obviously going to be able to fly it and
so<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:47.879> need<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.629> build<00:02:48.900> on<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.139> roof<00:02:49.319> so

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
so you need is to build on the roof so

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.409 
so you need is to build on the roof so
you<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> good<00:02:49.980> takeoff<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.060> you're<00:02:51.209> high

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
you get a good takeoff and you're high

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.089 
you get a good takeoff and you're high
enough<00:02:51.449> to<00:02:51.930> take<00:02:52.169> off<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.590> get<00:02:52.739> off<00:02:52.889> that

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
enough to take off and get off that

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.069 
enough to take off and get off that
Island<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:54.000> basically<00:02:54.359> you're<00:02:54.540> gonna<00:02:54.659> have<00:02:54.930> to

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
Island so basically you're gonna have to

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.990 
Island so basically you're gonna have to
make<00:02:55.260> sure<00:02:55.469> all<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.859> parts<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.819> should

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
make sure all the parts and there should

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.819 
make sure all the parts and there should
be<00:02:57.120> some<00:02:57.329> sort<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.569> workshop<00:02:58.079> or<00:02:58.290> building<00:02:58.680> and

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
be some sort of workshop or building and

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.640 
be some sort of workshop or building and
shop<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.579> build<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.359> place<00:03:00.569> way<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.260> top<00:03:01.439> of<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
shop a build in place way on top of the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.839 
shop a build in place way on top of the
roof<00:03:01.859> so<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.129> can<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> find<00:03:02.639> a<00:03:02.730> way<00:03:02.760> to

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
roof so you can have to find a way to

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.369 
roof so you can have to find a way to
the<00:03:03.030> top<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.299> roof<00:03:03.480> look<00:03:03.959> for<00:03:04.079> this<00:03:04.169> build

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
the top of the roof look for this build

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.869 
the top of the roof look for this build
in<00:03:04.500> place<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.949> then<00:03:05.069> take<00:03:05.219> all<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.549> parts

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
in place and then take all the parts

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.339 
in place and then take all the parts
there<00:03:06.060> once<00:03:06.269> you've<00:03:06.449> found<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.719> wardens<00:03:07.169> key

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
there once you've found the wardens key

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.110 
there once you've found the wardens key
I'm<00:03:07.769> step<00:03:08.069> four<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.310> basically<00:03:08.790> get<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:08.969> hell

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
I'm step four is basically get the hell

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.670 
I'm step four is basically get the hell
off<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.329> island<00:03:09.449> so<00:03:10.049> it's<00:03:10.230> gonna<00:03:10.349> mean<00:03:10.620> that

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
off the island so it's gonna mean that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.990 
off the island so it's gonna mean that
everyone<00:03:11.040> has<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.340> get<00:03:11.430> inside<00:03:11.699> the<00:03:11.819> plane

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
everyone has to get inside the plane

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.909 
everyone has to get inside the plane
jump<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:12.719> the<00:03:12.780> plane<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.169> get<00:03:13.590> off<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.769> island

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
jump in the plane and get off the island

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.470 
jump in the plane and get off the island
and<00:03:14.219> I'm<00:03:14.310> assuming<00:03:14.639> that's<00:03:14.909> how<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.180> complete

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
and I'm assuming that's how you complete

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.599 
and I'm assuming that's how you complete

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:15.719 
gets quite dark on the right-hand side

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.120 
gets quite dark on the right-hand side
guys<00:04:16.079> but<00:04:16.320> if<00:04:16.409> you<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:16.620> see<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.829> thing<00:04:16.979> where

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
guys but if you can see the thing where

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.409 
guys but if you can see the thing where
it<00:04:17.190> says<00:04:17.340> volts<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.789> it<00:04:17.880> looks<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.120> some

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
it says volts and it looks like some

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.909 
it says volts and it looks like some
sort<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.630> generate<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.079> has<00:04:19.199> like<00:04:19.409> an<00:04:19.500> electric

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
sort of generate it has like an electric

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.469 
sort of generate it has like an electric
sign<00:04:20.130> in<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.340> i'm<00:04:20.459> not<00:04:20.489> sure<00:04:20.789> exactly<00:04:21.120> what<00:04:21.329> is

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
sign in it i'm not sure exactly what is

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.480 
sign in it i'm not sure exactly what is
i'm<00:04:21.930> pretty<00:04:22.320> sure<00:04:22.469> you<00:04:22.650> can<00:04:22.889> have<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.130> fire<00:04:23.310> the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
i'm pretty sure you can have to fire the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.219 
i'm pretty sure you can have to fire the
electric<00:04:23.849> at<00:04:24.029> this<00:04:24.479> when<00:04:25.050> you're<00:04:25.199> in

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
electric at this when you're in

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.140 
electric at this when you're in
afterlife<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.889> this<00:04:26.010> is<00:04:26.099> gonna<00:04:26.219> be<00:04:26.340> behind

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
afterlife and this is gonna be behind

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.020 
afterlife and this is gonna be behind
the<00:04:27.419> power<00:04:27.660> on<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.949> basically<00:04:29.550> on<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.850> left

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
the power on and basically on the left

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.310 
the power on and basically on the left
side<00:04:30.150> there<00:04:30.240> isn't<00:04:30.540> much<00:04:30.630> more<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.900> talk<00:04:31.259> about

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
side there isn't much more to talk about

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.350

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
right hand side because it was quite

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.350 
right hand side because it was quite
dark<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:40.919> can<00:04:41.100> see<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.460> properly<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:42.210> this

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
is the step skies and also on the right

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.860 
is the step skies and also on the right
