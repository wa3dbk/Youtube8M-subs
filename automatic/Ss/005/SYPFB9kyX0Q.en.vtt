taking photos at night and what it
actually<00:03:58.690> does<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.140> very<00:03:59.320> clever<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.920> uses<00:04:00.220> the

actually does is very clever it uses the
accelerometer<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.480> phone<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:02.170> detect

when you're holding it as still as

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.850 
when you're holding it as still as
possible<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.480> then<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:05.110> snaps<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.620> picture

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
possible and then it snaps the picture

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.020 
possible and then it snaps the picture
for<00:04:06.070> you<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:06.310> there<00:04:06.430> might<00:04:06.519> be<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:06.700> little<00:04:06.850> bit

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
for you so there might be a little bit

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.880 
for you so there might be a little bit
of<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.180> delay<00:04:07.450> in<00:04:07.690> between<00:04:08.230> when<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.560> decide

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
of a delay in between when you decide

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.930 
of a delay in between when you decide
you<00:04:09.040> want<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> take<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.459> picture<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:09.730> when<00:04:09.850> it

you want to take the picture and when it

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.880 
you want to take the picture and when it
takes<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.269> probably<00:04:10.989> not<00:04:11.170> great<00:04:11.380> for<00:04:11.680> things

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
takes it probably not great for things

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.410

dogs or maybe race cars or something but
it's<00:04:16.120> great<00:04:16.390> if<00:04:16.510> you're<00:04:16.600> trying<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.840> take<00:04:16.930> a
