00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.680
 friends gamers and friends gameuse hello to 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.450
 all and good day to all these strider and 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.549
 I decided to make this video 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.230
 extremely short to let you know 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.970
 from an experience happened to me ago at 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.110
 hardly two days of that in a 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.180
 public event 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.220
 the toulouse game show that took place 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.680
 November 30 and December 1 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.570
 the images that you will see date from 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.250
 November 30 is almost a week 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.990
 after the release of the xbox one is 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.910
 exactly a toulouse game show on 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.930
 could indulge in the new console 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.539
 from microsoft 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.460
 if console that to be precise was 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.829
 so that playable on the stand and we 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.890
 could test hard at 5 among others and 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.360
 the fifa win for the general public while 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.190
 just been a little bit new 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.390
 gameplay that we propose the console of 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.800
 microsoft 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.210
 but it turns out that unfortunately 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.710
 I did not really want to 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.149
 to play these games there and I wanted to 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.470
 taste that extinguished them since the 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.000
 console dashboard 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.920
 so that's what I did as you 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.690
 can see it on these images and as 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.730
 we also see it b we do not have 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.590
 killer instinct logo that is displayed as 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.299
 a little bit on the 360 ​​when you want 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.020
 taste a game without being connected to xbox 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.820
 live 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.979
 so after a pretty long loading time 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.200
 long and a pretty disturbing blue screen 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.240
 Thursday though still insisting to launch 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.619
 killer extinct and after that so that this 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.920
 black screen a little bit long you go 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.100
 see appear attention watch well 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.439
 a fantastic green screen at this trio who 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.359
 right away sparked a geese from 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.770
 public behind you can see that 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.149
 here are people starting to tighten up 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.979
 a little bit of which I decide to hide 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.389
 all with the xbox guide we have the guts 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.709
 with all audiences what is displayed 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:39.009
 and then again at each 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:40.810
 loading every drop of the console 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.609
 we have this green screen that persist 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.560
 until I press the x key 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.999
 bob did the clash a small valve for 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.149
 show that she is the screen is matching 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:51.219
 to all aboard advertising xbox one to 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.049
 side of the same green color like what 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.189
 so these green screens at this price 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.189
 usually we saw them at the time 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.469
 on Rome mounds of emulators of 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.840
 arcade terminals and it turns out that my 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.880
 20 years later we find this same error 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.829
 loading on a next-gen console this 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.080
 which is not necessarily a good thing 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.310
 so here I just wanted to show that 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.399
 on a screen so we can see through 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.980
 a lure 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.060
 black of the telly that a pile of 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.040
 people immediately went very quickly 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.390
 closer to the screen to be able to see 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.220
 what was happening on the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.989
 borders because good the noise started 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.670
 to ride people wanted to see a little 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.959
 little what was happening more fear than 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.909
 evil to the instinct killer and well 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.280
 taste you see in the process of being able 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.109
 start the game but still good at a 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.359
 week of a console next gen see of 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.170
 such mistakes are still 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.239
 pretty amazing 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.700
 I should have even tried hard 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.109
 the experience of not pressing the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.489
 xbox button guide to ballast the screen 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.000
 to even longer and see if that 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.739
 could persist but hey I preferred 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.079
 still abstain and stop there 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.190
 thiviers to laugh with my friends they 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.109
 surrounded and who were around 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.489
 the screen with me so we imagine 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.030
 sure that there will be patches 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.700
 patch 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.480
 it must also be similar on the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.010
 playstation 4 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.200
 we must necessarily have small 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.150
 guilty of errors was on the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.120
 console since the console is 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.599
 exit in a very interesting way but 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.099
 voila 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.540
 before leaving the consoles would 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.430
 still for developers and that 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.200
 it's a personal message check the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.730
 material and pay attention especially on 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.680
 events that events like 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.859
 advertising where we are supposed to show 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.230
 consoles to players think to avoid 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.419
 such such small mistakes or to 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.859
 try to hide them from the month so 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.989
