00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
that would just work out too well but

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.289 
that would just work out too well but
I'm<00:03:19.739> definitely<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.370> real<00:03:20.519> time<00:03:20.760> use<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.120> found

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
sort of buggy um although when I did use

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.979 
sort of buggy um although when I did use
swype<00:03:27.900> keyboard<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.970> worked<00:03:30.269> fine<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:30.840> I

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
swype keyboard it worked fine but I

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.930 
swype keyboard it worked fine but I
personally<00:03:31.769> am<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.130> not<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.310> swype<00:03:32.640> keyboard

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
lag like lag eNOS with this which I

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.849 
lag like lag eNOS with this which I
don't<00:03:39.630> imagine<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.200> should<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.500> because

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
don't imagine I should have because

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.550 
don't imagine I should have because
you're<00:03:41.250> really<00:03:41.670> only<00:03:41.790> pressing<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.600> couple

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
you're really only pressing it a couple

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.309 
you're really only pressing it a couple
times<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:44.069> use<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.370> keyboard<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.870> anyways

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
times you use the keyboard so anyways

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.110 
times you use the keyboard so anyways
this<00:03:46.739> phone<00:03:47.040> freezes<00:03:47.900> not<00:03:48.900> horribly<00:03:49.880> but<00:03:50.880> it's

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
this phone freezes not horribly but it's

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.090 
this phone freezes not horribly but it's
definitely<00:03:51.389> noticeable<00:03:52.079> also<00:03:52.920> it's

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
definitely noticeable also it's

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.309 
definitely noticeable also it's
noticeable<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.180> bit<00:03:54.359> choppy<00:03:54.720> like<00:03:55.139> if

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
noticeable is it's a bit choppy like if

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.490 
noticeable is it's a bit choppy like if
you<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.650> me<00:03:55.769> going<00:03:56.100> through<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> home<00:03:56.579> screen

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
it's not the smoothest but it's

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.050 
it's not the smoothest but it's
definitely<00:04:01.709> doable<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.579> it's<00:04:02.730> not<00:04:02.910> like

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
definitely doable and it's not like

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.300 
definitely doable and it's not like
certain<00:04:03.450> android<00:04:03.810> phones<00:04:04.079> where<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.650> swipe

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
certain android phones where you swipe

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.910 
certain android phones where you swipe
across<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.200> trying<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.590> haul

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
across and it's like trying to like haul

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.580 
across and it's like trying to like haul
is<00:04:08.130> with<00:04:08.340> him<00:04:08.549> but<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:09.269> definitely<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:10.260> feel

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590

some jittery going on and when opening
applications<00:04:13.560> i<00:04:14.190> had<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.430> turn<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
applications i had to turn the

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.770 
applications i had to turn the
animations<00:04:16.169> off<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.729> things<00:04:18.599> would

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
animations off just so that things would

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.369 
animations off just so that things would
just<00:04:18.959> flow<00:04:19.729> faster

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:22.379 
just flow faster

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:27.930 
just flow faster
anyways<00:04:23.379> the<00:04:23.800> camera<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:25.020> can't<00:04:26.580> say<00:04:27.580> anything

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
anyways the camera I can't say anything

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.820 
anyways the camera I can't say anything
good<00:04:28.270> about<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.720> um<00:04:29.669> it's<00:04:30.750> horrible<00:04:31.750> if<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.620> go

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
good about it um it's horrible if I go

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.710 
good about it um it's horrible if I go
and<00:04:33.069> just<00:04:33.129> take<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> picture<00:04:33.699> it<00:04:33.970> has<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.180> fixed

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
and just take a picture it has a fixed

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.999 
and just take a picture it has a fixed
focus<00:04:35.259> which<00:04:36.129> is<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.539> terrible<00:04:37.830> because<00:04:38.830> it

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
focus which is a terrible because it

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.469 
focus which is a terrible because it
means<00:04:39.159> it<00:04:39.370> won't<00:04:39.550> focus<00:04:39.849> it's<00:04:41.759> set<00:04:42.759> to<00:04:42.789> focus

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
means it won't focus it's set to focus

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.270 
means it won't focus it's set to focus
on<00:04:43.629> a<00:04:43.659> certain<00:04:43.870> range<00:04:44.229> it<00:04:44.440> can't<00:04:44.949> go<00:04:45.250> any

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
on a certain range it can't go any

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.309 
on a certain range it can't go any
closer<00:04:45.729> so<00:04:46.150> if<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.360> wanted<00:04:46.629> to<00:04:46.690> take<00:04:47.080> like<00:04:47.289> a

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
closer so if I wanted to take like a

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.339 
closer so if I wanted to take like a
nice<00:04:47.560> up<00:04:47.770> close<00:04:47.949> shot<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.699> won't<00:04:49.509> focus<00:04:49.750> on<00:04:50.199> it

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
nice up close shot it won't focus on it

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.379 
nice up close shot it won't focus on it
because<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.800> doesn't<00:04:51.159> know<00:04:51.250> how<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.550> basically

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389
