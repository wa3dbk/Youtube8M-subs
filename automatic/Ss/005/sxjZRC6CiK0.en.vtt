go

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.140 

looks<00:02:21.349> like<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.980> original<00:02:22.610> storm<00:02:22.879> is<00:02:23.030> getting

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
looks like the original storm is getting

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:45.670 
looks like the original storm is getting
a<00:02:23.360> head<00:02:23.540> start

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.740 

and<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:46.430> looks<00:02:46.549> like<00:02:46.760> both<00:02:46.909> pages<00:02:47.180> are<00:02:47.420> popping

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
and it looks like both pages are popping

00:02:47.750 --> 00:03:00.150 
and it looks like both pages are popping
up<00:02:47.840> at<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.109> same<00:02:48.319> time

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.340 

and<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.910> looks<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:01.570> original<00:03:02.080> storm

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
and it looks like the original storm

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.860 
and it looks like the original storm
actually<00:03:02.590> finishes<00:03:03.250> first<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.690> is

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
actually finishes first and this is

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.870 
actually finishes first and this is
basically<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.710> same<00:03:05.860> experience<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.760> I've

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
basically the same experience that I've

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.540 
basically the same experience that I've
had<00:03:07.140> playing<00:03:08.140> with<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.440> device<00:03:08.710> it<00:03:09.370> looks

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
had playing with the device it looks

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.130 
had playing with the device it looks
like<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.850> original<00:03:10.300> storm<00:03:10.540> actually<00:03:10.720> renders

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
like the original storm actually renders

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.440

original storm via a software upgrade
package<00:04:05.290> in<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.770> future<00:04:06.130> but<00:04:06.490> if<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:06.760> just

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
package in the future but if you just

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.610

flick<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:07.450> scroll<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.990> would<00:04:08.110> actually<00:04:08.260> take

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
flick and scroll it would actually take

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.010 
flick and scroll it would actually take
you<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:09.040> lot<00:04:09.670> further<00:04:09.940> through<00:04:10.090> your<00:04:10.420> list<00:04:10.690> than

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
you a lot further through your list than

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.780 
you a lot further through your list than
on<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.440> storm<00:04:11.740> one<00:04:12.010> which<00:04:12.370> will<00:04:12.580> actually

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
on the storm one which will actually

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.670 
on the storm one which will actually
just<00:04:13.180> pause<00:04:13.450> let's<00:04:13.870> go<00:04:14.050> ahead<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.230> take<00:04:14.620> a

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
just pause let's go ahead and take a

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.260 
just pause let's go ahead and take a
look<00:04:14.770> at<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.430> scrolling<00:04:16.030> on<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.989> storm<00:04:17.320> one

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
look at the scrolling on the storm one

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.180 
look at the scrolling on the storm one
go<00:04:19.270> ahead<00:04:19.480> and<00:04:19.660> go<00:04:19.780> back<00:04:19.959> out<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.980> if<00:04:21.070> you

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
go ahead and go back out so if you

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.220 
go ahead and go back out so if you
scroll<00:04:21.520> it<00:04:22.240> would<00:04:22.360> actually<00:04:22.480> just<00:04:22.840> pause<00:04:23.020> in

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
scroll it would actually just pause in

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.659 
scroll it would actually just pause in
the<00:04:23.290> middle<00:04:23.350> of<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.680> list<00:04:23.890> here<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.460> then<00:04:24.550> you

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
the middle of the list here and then you

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.790 
the middle of the list here and then you

Wireless that program is called city ID

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.659 
Wireless that program is called city ID
which<00:04:46.840> allows<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.440> actually<00:04:47.650> look<00:04:48.190> up<00:04:48.400> the

which allows you to actually look up the
city<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.180> state<00:04:49.630> if<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.080> know<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.440> area<00:04:50.770> code

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
city and state if you know the area code

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.180 
city and state if you know the area code
and<00:04:51.130> phone<00:04:51.310> number<00:04:51.760> or<00:04:52.000> if<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.900> caller<00:04:53.620> calls<00:04:53.950> in

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
and phone number or if a caller calls in

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.710 
and phone number or if a caller calls in
it<00:04:54.400> would<00:04:54.550> actually<00:04:54.880> show<00:04:55.090> their<00:04:55.330> city<00:04:55.570> &amp;

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720

it would actually show their city &amp;
state<00:04:55.840> location<00:04:56.680> on<00:04:56.890> your<00:04:56.919> caller<00:04:57.310> ID<00:04:57.580> display

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
state location on your caller ID display

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.860 
state location on your caller ID display
so<00:04:58.900> that's<00:04:59.140> a<00:04:59.440> cool<00:04:59.950> part<00:05:00.250> with<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.820> city<00:05:01.150> ID

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
so that's a cool part with the city ID

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.100 
so that's a cool part with the city ID
application<00:05:02.970> there's<00:05:03.970> also<00:05:04.180> now<00:05:04.510> cut<00:05:04.840> copy

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
application there's also now cut copy

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
actually select copy or cut so let's go

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.920 
actually select copy or cut so let's go
ahead<00:06:13.780> and<00:06:13.930> zoom<00:06:14.080> in<00:06:14.439> a<00:06:14.469> little<00:06:14.740> and<00:06:15.659> tap<00:06:16.659> with

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
you can actually move that indicator

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.230 
you can actually move that indicator
there<00:06:41.950> and<00:06:42.370> then<00:06:42.520> there's<00:06:42.730> a<00:06:42.790> bottom
