from<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.810> time<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.320> they<00:01:18.410> still<00:01:18.440> stand<00:01:19.130> up

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.960 

it<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.440> sets<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> benchmark<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.460> filmmaker

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it really sets a benchmark and filmmaker

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.719 
it really sets a benchmark and filmmaker
and<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> time<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.170> grows<00:01:25.530> two<00:01:26.130> million<00:01:26.549> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and at the time it grows two million to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.600 
and at the time it grows two million to
actually<00:01:27.030> produce<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.690> going<00:01:28.049> back<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.610> 1927

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
actually produce now going back to 1927

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.450 
actually produce now going back to 1927
I<00:01:29.810> couldn't<00:01:30.810> even<00:01:30.960> guess<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:31.979> amount

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I couldn't even guess what that amount

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:44.850 
I couldn't even guess what that amount
of<00:01:32.549> money<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:33.180> worth

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.399 

we<00:01:45.860> go<00:01:46.009> another<00:01:46.310> well<00:01:46.610> one<00:01:46.939> groups<00:01:47.409> forbidden
