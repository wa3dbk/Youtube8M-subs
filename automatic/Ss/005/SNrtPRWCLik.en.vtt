00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Vilsack regards itself as you think 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.609
 why is the North Korean leader kim jong yn 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.330
 so angry and dissatisfied but apart 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.040
 hairstyles 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.990
 because he does not know how to walk 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.700
 shopping and to choose juice 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.070
 or some yogurt he has to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.199
 carry with you a whole army and that one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.000
 monotonous routine and very monotonous 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.260
 the process of selecting a product in the commission 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.180
 shopping can be done quite 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.730
 fascinating with the help of modern 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.590
 what technologies now tell you go 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 Apple discounts to all subscribers from 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.189
 partner and apple store jesus. 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.750
 I have you in general all people 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.910
 who go shopping often 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.980
 stupor and what kind of goods in this 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.200
 categories better to buy especially when 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 wife sends you shopping for example 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 with a list of type buy yeast starch 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 dough as well as no tooth to foot 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 thing and especially which brands are better 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.610
 choose when to call and clarify 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.590
 I advise you to do it especially now 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 send baby things from your 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.149
 I share the experience and you can say the secret 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.520
 but today's technologies allow 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.010
 such things are most easily solved 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.480
 quickly and as she said fascinating and you 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 already understood what application it is today 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.500
 I want to advise this price rating on 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.210
 he has already stumbled several times 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 the internet and some remained 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.470
 the impression that the type of well advertising probably 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.600
 In general, in such applications the most 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.479
 important it is of course the base it is usually 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.009
 limp on all two legs and generally do 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.140
 there is a draw but what was mine 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.180
 surprise when the goods that I 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.520
 needed to scan find out about him 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.920
 information rating will not only be 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.020
 identified but also as it turned out here 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.659
 huge amount of quiet fishes 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.549
 which will allow you the most complete 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.530
 probably read what kind of product 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.689
 Firstly, these are photos of users 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.570
 others who download it themselves 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.640
 reviews that describe the merits 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.799
 shortcomings of the goods to each comment 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.630
 there is also an estimate of how much he was 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.159
 very helpful when you start at all 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.049
 it is diving it turns out that's it 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 Here is the application that fiscal 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.880
 and waited and she really works in the database 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.740
 four and a half million goods or 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.659
 something so know this very much 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.130
 cool in the scan interface there 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.020
 ability to turn on mute 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.119
 vibration but there is no option to activate 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.110
 flash the highlight is for her to be 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.090
 very much but 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.310
 on because the scanner is very tenacious even 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.770
 in a dark very 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.420
 well recognize data but if 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.150
 developers watch this video to them 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.920
 Respect Hi and Respect think 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.900
 such a thing but imagine sitting 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.030
 a man in a dark corner with a box from under 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.220
 galaxy s4 scans her not all 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.260
 it turns out and you are so waiting for a hard life 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.550
 let's at least help here how are you 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.530
 understood the application is also on 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.050
 android but about galaxy s4 just kidding of course 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.060
 phone to your honest 7 points and you 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.070
 You know, in general, I am with this rating 2 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.990
 degrees all day when found it for 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.180
 I was straight revelation you sit a whole 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.090
 day you scan something and the main thing 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.310
 enter the game such and what products are what 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.380
 Products that thing I do not know honestly I'm all 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.989
 house clambered in search of what can 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.170
 slip and that was not recognized and in 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.959
 90 probably 5 percent of cases base 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.910
 I would beat me need but everything is there and 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.700
 all have any feedback 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.770
 people have already scanned it added 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.480
 the photos are very cool but if something 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.060
 I did not understand that you can 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.890
 yourself handles it all beat to base it 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.140
 check admin moderator and 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.600
 then it hits and you know cho cool 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.360
 I read about this service it turned out that 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.880
 per day people scan 50 thousand items 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.870
 makes some hundreds of thousands of his data 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.030
 to base 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.680
 there are still some draws in common and 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.709
 leave comments that 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.720
 gain a lot of famous likes and you 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.030
 You can win money in general except 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.600
 the fact that the service is really cool 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.060
 Also our cool guys are organized 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.730
 work and when I'm on a whole heavy 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.980
 as artillery magazine in May Little Pony I 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.410
 it seemed that there were 9 reviews and 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.530
 A bunch of photos already knows how to finally 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.780
 conquered that is a service like this 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.940
 kind he lives solely by 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.940
 community of people who are in it all 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.160
 brewed are present you know it turned out 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.750
 what really works and even if 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.000
 you don't want to scan something or 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.030
 you don't have anything you can always find it 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.880
 through search and after that for example 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.530
 understand you need to buy a similar product 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.090
 or not and in the opposite direction if you 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.040
 something scanned it is not in the database 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.600
 can add barcode to clipboard 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.010
 and then try to find it in the same 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.440
 coals you know about know on monitor 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.580
 appstore for interesting 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.250
 applications and it's hard to surprise me with something 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.350
 but rated subdued in the first place 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.160
 that the project is quite ambitious 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.140
 which are built on a base on that 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.080
 how active is present here 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.900
 participants he flew and this patch is nice 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.240
 what kind of service works and 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.070
 Well, I only lived for him success and 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.870
 further development because on 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.670
 Well done I liked the way they have in the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.560
 The site has an interactive map on 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.450
 which immediately shows that who 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.730
 scans very cool looks in 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.800
 Generally there is nothing to complain about 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.900
 design needs a little bit under ios 7 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.250
 update and then it would be most ideal and he 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.030
 was vilsack subscribe to the channel 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.070

 subscribe to my twitter instagram 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.730
 take off continuing to hurt but then soon 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.980
 get better and write in the comments that 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.550
 you think about a certain rubric here 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.780
 Type this and useful interesting and necessary 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.730
 applications, well , obviously it is necessary 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.070
