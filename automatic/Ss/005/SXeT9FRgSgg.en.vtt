little for me when she contracts about
halfway<00:00:53.270> releases<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.690> she's<00:00:54.900> going<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
halfway releases and then she's going to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410 
halfway releases and then she's going to
fire<00:00:55.440> through<00:00:55.829> okay<00:00:56.790> is<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.150> there's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
fire through okay is that way there's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.850 
fire through okay is that way there's
going<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.630> be<00:00:57.660> no<00:00:57.840> tension<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.410> band<00:00:58.590> when

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
going to be no tension on the band when

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.910 
going to be no tension on the band when
she<00:00:58.950> creates<00:00:59.310> that<00:00:59.520> first<00:01:00.420> impulse<00:01:00.989> so

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
she creates that first impulse so

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
she creates that first impulse so

rester generally speaking after that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.920 
rester generally speaking after that
maybe<00:03:00.959> we<00:03:01.230> do<00:03:01.350> one<00:03:01.620> side<00:03:01.890> breast<00:03:02.370> 1520<00:03:03.299> even

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
maybe we do one side breast 1520 even

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.870 
maybe we do one side breast 1520 even
longer<00:03:04.110> 30<00:03:04.440> seconds<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.340> all<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.640> fast

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
longer 30 seconds that all that fast

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.300 
longer 30 seconds that all that fast
twitch<00:03:06.299> fiber<00:03:06.930> recruited<00:03:07.500> stuff<00:03:07.709> re<00:03:07.920> recruit

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
twitch fiber recruited stuff re recruit

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.150 
twitch fiber recruited stuff re recruit
and<00:03:08.519> then<00:03:09.209> we're<00:03:09.390> gonna<00:03:09.480> give<00:03:09.690> her<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:11.130> I

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
and then we're gonna give her a that I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.690 
and then we're gonna give her a that I
get<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> little<00:03:11.579> swingle<00:03:12.120> speed<00:03:12.420> swing<00:03:13.700> good

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
get a little swingle speed swing good

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.030 
get a little swingle speed swing good
all<00:03:15.299> right<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.290> what<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.590> were<00:03:16.709> trying<00:03:16.920> to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
all right so what we were trying to

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.740 
all right so what we were trying to
accomplish<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.910> increase<00:03:18.510> their

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
accomplish is the increase their

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.199 
accomplish is the increase their
recruitment<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.320> fast<00:03:19.560> twitch<00:03:19.829> fibers<00:03:20.340> so

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
recruitment of the fast twitch fibers so

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.930 
recruitment of the fast twitch fibers so
off<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.959> band's<00:03:22.200> teacher<00:03:22.650> how<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.859> outrun<00:03:23.670> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
off the band's teacher how to outrun the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.420 
off the band's teacher how to outrun the
tension<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.900> band<00:03:25.200> then<00:03:25.769> come<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.220> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
tension of the band then come in and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.470 
tension of the band then come in and
apply<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:27.120> discharge<00:03:28.049> rate<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.620> her<00:03:29.480> golf

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
apply that discharge rate to her golf

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.660 
apply that discharge rate to her golf
club<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.230> those<00:03:31.709> are<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.920> kind<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.280> order<00:03:32.549> of

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
club so those are the kind of order of

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.430 
club so those are the kind of order of
things<00:03:32.850> there<00:03:33.180> hit<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> quick<00:03:34.200> twitch

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
things there hit the quick twitch

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.979 
things there hit the quick twitch
increase<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.400> discharge<00:03:35.820> rate<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.359> then

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
increase the discharge rate and then

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:52.490 
increase the discharge rate and then
apply<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.650> our<00:03:37.680> golf<00:03:37.980> swing

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.560
