okay<00:00:03.670> so<00:00:03.730> we're<00:00:04.480> going<00:00:04.569> to<00:00:04.689> do<00:00:04.840> a<00:00:04.870> comparison

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.410 
okay so we're going to do a comparison

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.870 
okay so we're going to do a comparison
here<00:00:05.939> benchmark<00:00:06.939> wise<00:00:07.149> with<00:00:07.510> the<00:00:07.720> galaxy<00:00:08.530> s1

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
here benchmark wise with the galaxy s1

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.730 
here benchmark wise with the galaxy s1
galaxy<00:00:09.880> s2<00:00:10.030> galaxy<00:00:11.020> s3<00:00:12.450> okay<00:00:13.450> and<00:00:13.690> just<00:00:14.650> to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
galaxy s2 galaxy s3 okay and just to

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.650 
galaxy s2 galaxy s3 okay and just to
clarify<00:00:14.890> of<00:00:15.250> all<00:00:15.519> I<00:00:15.670> believe<00:00:16.299> I<00:00:16.420> had<00:00:16.539> the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
clarify of all I believe I had the

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.090 
clarify of all I believe I had the
current<00:00:17.140> version<00:00:17.289> up<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.800> date<00:00:17.980> on<00:00:18.280> all<00:00:19.270> these

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
current version up to date on all these

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.150 
current version up to date on all these
firmware<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:25.210> the<00:00:25.390> galaxy<00:00:25.869> s<00:00:25.930> 1<00:00:26.140> 4g<00:00:26.590> had<00:00:26.680> run<00:00:26.890> on

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
firmware so the galaxy s 1 4g had run on

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.910 
firmware so the galaxy s 1 4g had run on
firmware<00:00:27.490> version<00:00:28.090> 2<00:00:28.770> 36<00:00:30.840> little<00:00:31.840> gingerbread

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.790 

galaxy<00:00:35.920> s2<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:37.210> came<00:00:37.329> out<00:00:37.449> that<00:00:37.629> upgrade<00:00:37.929> to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
galaxy s2 just came out that upgrade to

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.689 
galaxy s2 just came out that upgrade to
ice<00:00:38.920> cream<00:00:39.190> sandwich<00:00:40.409> t-mobile<00:00:41.409> I<00:00:41.620> did<00:00:42.579> have

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
ice cream sandwich t-mobile I did have

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:51.379 
ice cream sandwich t-mobile I did have
read<00:00:42.879> it<00:00:42.969> through<00:00:43.149> keys<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.399> it<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.239> on<00:00:47.370> 403<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:51.389 
read it through keys so it is on 403 and

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:54.660 
read it through keys so it is on 403 and
the<00:00:52.389> three<00:00:53.199> I<00:00:53.499> believe<00:00:53.859> came<00:00:54.100> with<00:00:54.280> ice<00:00:54.399> cream

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
the three I believe came with ice cream

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.599 
the three I believe came with ice cream
sandwich<00:00:55.089> I<00:00:55.179> think<00:00:55.329> it's<00:00:56.729> 4.0<00:00:57.729> for<00:00:59.609> not

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
sandwich I think it's 4.0 for not

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.970 
sandwich I think it's 4.0 for not
mistaken<00:01:01.149> haven't<00:01:01.809> even<00:01:01.899> checked<00:01:02.170> it

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
mistaken haven't even checked it

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.440 
mistaken haven't even checked it
now<00:01:04.720> 4.04<00:01:05.720> for<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.380> galaxy<00:01:06.650> s3<00:01:07.180> so<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.330> all

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
now 4.04 for the galaxy s3 so the all

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.240 
now 4.04 for the galaxy s3 so the all
three<00:01:08.690> own<00:01:08.810> different<00:01:09.320> version<00:01:09.620> of<00:01:09.680> Android

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.260 

not<00:01:13.250> too<00:01:13.400> different<00:01:13.610> on<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.909> two<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.210> the

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
not too different on the two and the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.780 
not too different on the two and the
three<00:01:15.040> all<00:01:16.040> right<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.340> we're<00:01:16.400> going<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.640> run<00:01:16.729> a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
three all right so we're going to run a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.109 
three all right so we're going to run a
benchmark<00:01:17.360> with<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.780> quadrant<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.010> I<00:01:19.909> just

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
benchmark with the quadrant and I just

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.590 
benchmark with the quadrant and I just
did<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.800> antutu<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:23.060> want<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.270> see<00:01:23.360> how<00:01:23.479> my

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
did the antutu you want to see how my

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.990 
did the antutu you want to see how my
channel<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.080> can<00:01:24.170> find<00:01:24.410> it<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:24.650> there<00:01:25.000> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
channel you can find it on there and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.150 
channel you can find it on there and
also<00:01:26.210> do<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.509> unboxing<00:01:26.750> for<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.380> galaxy<00:01:27.770> s3

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
also do the unboxing for the galaxy s3

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.230 
also do the unboxing for the galaxy s3
since<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:28.580> just<00:01:28.759> got<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:29.000> today<00:01:29.290> jun<00:01:30.340> 24<00:01:31.340> 2012<00:01:31.910> is

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
since I just got it today jun 24 2012 is

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.530 
since I just got it today jun 24 2012 is
launch<00:01:32.479> day<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:32.930> apparently<00:01:33.920> 29<00:01:34.430> cities<00:01:34.610> got

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
launch day and apparently 29 cities got

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.240 
launch day and apparently 29 cities got
the<00:01:35.600> phone<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:36.170> stones<00:01:36.380> want<00:01:36.649> them<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.009> i

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
the phone and you stones want them so i

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.830 
the phone and you stones want them so i
happen<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:37.940> find<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.149> store<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.390> add<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.780> in

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
happen to find a store to add it in

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.540 
happen to find a store to add it in
stock<00:01:39.050> so<00:01:40.390> let's<00:01:41.390> go<00:01:41.509> ahead<00:01:41.539> and<00:01:41.780> run<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
stock so let's go ahead and run the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.380 
stock so let's go ahead and run the
benchmark<00:01:43.550> test<00:01:44.649> or<00:01:45.649> pull<00:01:45.920> quadrant<00:01:46.520> i<00:01:46.759> just

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
benchmark test or pull quadrant i just

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.230 
benchmark test or pull quadrant i just
did<00:01:47.509> a<00:01:47.539> factory<00:01:47.750> set<00:01:48.140> on<00:01:48.229> all<00:01:48.320> three<00:01:48.560> phones

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
did a factory set on all three phones

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.219 
did a factory set on all three phones
all<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.300> sim<00:01:50.960> cards<00:01:51.229> removed<00:01:53.170> trying<00:01:54.170> to

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
all the sim cards removed trying to

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.350 
all the sim cards removed trying to
bounce<00:01:54.800> out<00:01:55.130> everything<00:01:55.610> toward<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.030> tests

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
bounce out everything toward the tests

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.540 
bounce out everything toward the tests
are<00:01:56.450> accurate<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:59.140> I<00:02:00.369> updated<00:02:01.369> all<00:02:01.460> the

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
are accurate and I updated all the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.370 
are accurate and I updated all the
software<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.179> i<00:02:02.210> didn't<00:02:02.539> try<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.810> update<00:02:02.960> the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
software so i didn't try and update the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.590 
software so i didn't try and update the
phones<00:02:03.679> in<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.009> middle<00:02:04.420> brain<00:02:05.420> the
