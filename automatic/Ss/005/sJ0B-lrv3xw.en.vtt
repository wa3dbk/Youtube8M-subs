00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.670
 shark is a house specialized in 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.130
 production of helmets worldwide 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.140
 one of the leaders is a French home e 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.480
 many of you will already know it because 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.070
 shark helmets are worn by 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.850
 some pilots products at the level 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.710
 world 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.120
 and their racing helmets are 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.080
 absolutely at the top of the range in the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.780
 production 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.730
 but the real novelty of eicma 2012 is that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.559
 sharks and thrown headlong too 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.930
 in the production of jet helmets with 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.030
 visor then the shark as you said 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.670
 is rightly passed is passing by 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.960
 racing parts to the part plus one meter per 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.280
 this we have developed this new 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.140
 in the event that a single dwarf cap was there 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.410
 rowe version is a very version 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.450
 aggressive of a jet helmet 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.000
 primarily for a purpose 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.180
 scooter roster or colonization of a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.340
 certain of a certain power to a place 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.369
 with a mask they are all and two and 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.619
 removable it has the possibility clearly 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.289
 to be remembered even in position 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.930
 open is aimed at an audience 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.250
 clearly much more aggressive and much more 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.080
 more trendy 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.640
 we have also developed on the same 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.110
 a city helmet with a helmet 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.450
 long and very protective visor a 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.390
 sun visor clearly operable from 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.270
 from inside and a helmet this one more 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.040
 narrow more citizen and I must say that i 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.390
 especially young people will go crazy for 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.820
 we hope for a great deal about this 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.920
 on this market clearly for us is 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.630
 a market that we opened with buoys 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.270
 line we opened with g 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.189
 we hope to continue and increase the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.570
 our penetration on this range of 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.570
 market probably thanks
