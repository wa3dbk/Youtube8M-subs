00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the sign to select it then you can do

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.880 
the sign to select it then you can do
slash<00:00:34.230> lock<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.840> then<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> line<00:00:37.230> number<00:00:37.620> so

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
slash lock it then the line number so

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.639 
slash lock it then the line number so
the<00:00:38.010> line<00:00:38.190> number<00:00:38.489> would<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.640> three<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.649> then

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the line number would be three and then

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.290 
the line number would be three and then
you<00:00:41.040> write<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:41.370> text<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.120> add

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you write your text so you can add

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.900 
you write your text so you can add
another<00:00:42.420> player's<00:00:42.899> name<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:44.040> I'll<00:00:44.489> put<00:00:44.700> daddy

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
another player's name so I'll put daddy

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.479 
another player's name so I'll put daddy
1<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.600> instance

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
1 for instance

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.250 
1 for instance
so<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:47.640> us<00:00:47.879> two<00:00:48.149> would<00:00:48.300> both<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.750> able<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.110> use

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so now us two would both be able to use

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.010 
so now us two would both be able to use
the<00:00:49.440> door<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> could<00:00:51.210> add<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> fourth<00:00:51.719> flower

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.319 
the door and I could add a fourth flower
with<00:00:52.230> 4<00:00:56.090> or<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.629> add<00:00:57.780> lock<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:59.329> bracket

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
with 4 or I can add lock it for bracket

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.740 
with 4 or I can add lock it for bracket
timer<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.250> 2<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.850> every<00:01:03.090> time<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> open<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
timer and 2 and every time I open the

timer and 2 and every time I open the
door<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:05.220> automatically<00:01:05.790> closed<00:01:06.119> after<00:01:06.420> about

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
door it automatically closed after about

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.490 
door it automatically closed after about
2<00:01:06.990> seconds<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.750> 1<00:01:09.750> 2<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.409> very

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
2 seconds so 1 2 so this can be very

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.690 
2 seconds so 1 2 so this can be very
helpful<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.130> protecting<00:01:14.760> your<00:01:14.880> land

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.310 

this<00:01:18.700> can<00:01:18.880> also<00:01:19.030> be<00:01:19.240> used<00:01:19.570> on<00:01:19.720> double<00:01:20.080> doors

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
this can also be used on double doors

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.710 
this can also be used on double doors
and<00:01:20.700> when<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.820> right-click<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.450> door<00:01:22.630> it

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
will open both doors and once again the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:34.420 
will open both doors and once again the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
instance I could do bracket put admin

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
instance I could do bracket put admin
and<00:01:54.690> then<00:01:54.780> closed<00:01:55.170> bracket<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.220> then<00:01:56.370> all

then everyone can use it or a select
user<00:02:02.280> group<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.910> if<00:02:02.970> you've<00:02:03.120> got<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.330> plug-in

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
user group so if you've got a plug-in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200 
user group so if you've got a plug-in
that<00:02:03.990> lets<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.920> define<00:02:05.100> user<00:02:05.580> groups<00:02:05.940> you

that lets you define user groups you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.880 
that lets you define user groups you
could<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.540> enable<00:02:06.990> all<00:02:07.080> builders<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.740> be

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
could just enable all builders to be

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.380 
could just enable all builders to be
allowed<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.759> whatever<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.179> call

automatically<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.400> could<00:02:56.730> obviously<00:02:57.090> change

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
automatically I could obviously change

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.500 
automatically I could obviously change
that<00:02:57.630> if<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.810> wanted<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.790> but<00:02:59.790> one<00:02:59.970> sign<00:03:00.299> will

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
that if I wanted to but one sign will

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180 
that if I wanted to but one sign will
protect<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> whole<00:03:01.080> chest<00:03:01.410> anyway<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:01.920> you

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
protect the whole chest anyway so you

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.650 
protect the whole chest anyway so you
may<00:03:02.310> as<00:03:02.430> well<00:03:02.459> just<00:03:02.580> leave<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.090> as<00:03:03.209> one<00:03:03.239> unless

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
may as well just leave it as one unless

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.700 
may as well just leave it as one unless
you're<00:03:03.840> adding<00:03:04.049> more<00:03:04.200> users

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.740

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
so you can right-click and then I could

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.140 
so you can right-click and then I could
add<00:03:08.890> users<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.160> sign<00:03:10.490> if<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.760> wanted<00:03:11.000> to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
add users to this sign if I wanted to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.520
