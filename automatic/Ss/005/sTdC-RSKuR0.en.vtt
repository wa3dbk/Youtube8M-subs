00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
737-800 what I really got right what I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.649 
737-800 what I really got right what I
really<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.590> about<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:26.009> plane<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
really like about this plane is that the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.950 
really like about this plane is that the
design<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.590> tail<00:01:28.890> look<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:30.600> that's

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
design on the tail look I think that's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.410 
design on the tail look I think that's
just<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:32.130> cool<00:01:32.369> design<00:01:32.400> right<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
just a really cool design right there I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.740 
just a really cool design right there I
think<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.259> design<00:01:35.479> say<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.600> this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
think it's a little design say at this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.330 
think it's a little design say at this
place<00:01:36.960> actually<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> them<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> was
