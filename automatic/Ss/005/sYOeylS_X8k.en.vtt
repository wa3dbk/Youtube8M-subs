00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.849
 and talking about people with 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:07.750
 problems yesterday on channel 4 returned to 

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:07.750
 be evaristo mejía 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.290
 Of course now it has worked well for us 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.650
 no no no no has failed again has returned 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.390
 to fail 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.640
 evaristo evaristo lately it's like 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.990
 one of those very expensive firecrackers you know that 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.060
 what you light the wick waiting for 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.380
 see something spectacular and when the wick 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.120
 reaches the end of the firecracker fails and it 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.700
 it remains in a small well 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.130
 may indeed message the first insult 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.130
 Evaristo was the same as last time 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.949
 why 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.680
 - very depressed 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.030
 because I come to this section to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.100
 make friends as everyone knows 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.100
 and it does not work out well, it seems like it does not know 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.680
 the other day 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.800
 unintentionally I guess 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.340
 Well, nano clown and silly blonde 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.340
 they got with me 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.380
 but since I do not know if you're a 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.330
 specialist in getting you with all the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.860
 good world there is more but you are the king 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.060
 but I do not understand 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.190
 I do not throw anything 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.370
 I was watching TV 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.370
 and suddenly I saw this forward video 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.090
 forward video it seems to me that there is no 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.240
 video rest not 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 [Applause] 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.020
 I forgot that in this program we 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.409
 we recycle garbage from others 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.409
 [Music] 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.450
 I feel terrible already I also 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.490
 is that you know what bothers me that 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.710
 evaristo up or cojonudo 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.150
 has had a big color moment let's go 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.640
 to watch the video 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.250
 we'll see 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.960
 it's not true I forget that we 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.470
 we recycle trash there we put it 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.470
 well stuck 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.810
 why evaristo is police is clear 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.700
 and it is also saved another blow of 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.080
 effect is that the thing does not end and if 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.420
 when I was fascinated by the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.700
 ingenuity evaristo took a turn of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.200
 nut more and something happened that made me 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.200
 stand up for the genius 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.450
 you make peace with them that I want 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.210
 make peace really I've 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.170
 dedicated this shirt that does not even fucking 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.170
 idea of what you did 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.440
 because we talk about the roll 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.330
 [Music] 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.970
 is that it is there is that it is there is that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.410
 it is a power is incredible is a pity 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.540
 that's why it's a pity that they have not 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.000
 images of evaristo arriving at 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.500
 Channel 4 wardrobe in plan is the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.330
 Dwarf clown and the silly blonde are going to 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.370
 end take plan that is sticker to me 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.860
 this shirt that they are going to shit on there 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.080
 wardrobe with this why is it true that 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.370
 it is very worrying that equal barista 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.630
 just gave you an idea the gentlemen of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.070
 the sixth and we have to make a special 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.280
 let it be called no fucking idea of ​​what 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.740
 did you do 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.390
 If that happens, the present is ready to 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.770
 anyway the thing did not end there he had a 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.770
 couple of comments more listening 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.620
 They do not know who I am that I do not have 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.209
 wit I do not know how to criticize others 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.900
 I do not know they told me things like they told me 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.900
 almost handsome 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.760
 why do you complain seen 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.760
 [Music] 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.320
 the truth is true and I take away the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.330
 hat I have a lot to learn from 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.820
 they do have ingenuity to me 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.740
 the criticism that made me the truth that 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.740
 it made me laugh that he still showed laughing 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.629
 they called my attention because it is 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.629
 difficult to understand they called me evaristo 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.040
 and what's your name is my name is risto but if 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.040
 they want me, my name is manuela vallés 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:13.970
 And besides all this anna without a script because 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.070
 they go like this to hair and canned laughter 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.459
 because it's not like here or is there 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.880
 there are really people really laughing 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.949
 everyday 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.190
 it's really amazing me from here they 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.770
 I send a kiss and I wish you I wish you 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.710
 happen to me and that they dedicate themselves to people 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.249
 people who are at your level 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.680
 [Applause] 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.840
 but it stayed dry 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.630
 with people who are very well I mean 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.840
 to the tomato a3bandas all that that 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.840
 like 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:50.230
 that's why it happened to us that our 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:52.140
 lives are canned with our money 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:57.960
 or hope 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:00.300
 [Applause] 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.669
 There's another bar that laughs are 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.020
 canned 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.030
 that's a lie if I know it's a lie 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.069
 in fact in fact to prove it 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.180
 I want all of Spain to see that the laughs 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.130
 of this program are from our audience 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.330
 please let our audience demonstrate 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.800
 teach the public that the public are 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.220
 Real, I think you're real. 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.220
 our laughs 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.999
 and there it is 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.389
 we have already made it clear that here the 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.009
 People laugh because there are only happens in 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.360
 people in our program laughs because 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.900
 he has a good time and he who says 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.970
 opposite is lying 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.389
 and you can not go and thank you very much 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.389
 you 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.060
 I have a little bit of the escarpment 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.890
 I'm telling you that that's all Evaristo does not 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.090
 I would worry more about other things, not me 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.440
 I would worry a lot about what he says 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.450
 barista thinks that his comments for 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.610
 offend have been dwarf and blonde clown 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.170
 silly, it's good if Pedro tells you 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.910
 piqueras should hurt but said by 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.530
 someone who collaborates on channel 4 together 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.510
 to ana garcía siñériz, because I know how 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.970
 that loses strength and the other has been that 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.490
 we are that we are super ingenious why 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.930
 because of course how are we going without a script and that 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.430
 he says it while hitting the cards 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.710
 with what he has to say in his 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.240
 true knee and the last thing they do not 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.950
 They are dedicated to taking misery out of others 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.020
 programs and good if you say something like that 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.740
 it does not make much sense then 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.740
 do this 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.150
 do not 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.410
 is that I forgot that in this 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.960
 program we recycle trash from the 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.480
 this is very serious alfonso puts 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.140
 serious journalists high journalists 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.910
 high level yesterday evening as already 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.560
 everyone knows by now 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.930
 because it will be scheduled late 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.080
 they carried out the following sequence 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.080
 we'll see 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.689
 [Applause] 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.850
 [Music] 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.620
 Well, this is what happened in a 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:14.820
 Spanish television program in a 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.110
 political debate before I was 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.960
 I forgot that in this program we 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.050
 we recycle garbage from others 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.050
 [Music] 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:28.030
 is to say 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.740
 is what is wrong with not wanting to assume that 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.479
 after all be the most ingenious of 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.580
 ot it has only served you to finish 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.320
 having a zapping section that in 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.430
 a program that we 're going

 no god because good we do 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.039
 we do but because to us to 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.210
 times any shit is worth to us 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:47.130
 Fill 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:49.230
 by the way this video that I teach 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.290
 Evaristo was not the same as hours before 

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.270
 he had taken dani mateo yes yes yes of 

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.490
 done we could already say that evaristo is 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:00.410
 the gonzalo looked at danny a little look 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.410
 more things and more things
