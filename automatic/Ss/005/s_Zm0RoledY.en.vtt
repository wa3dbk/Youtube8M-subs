00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 the ndrangheta in Calabria and for years 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.809
 she entered the palaces not only that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.160
 of local authorities as like like this 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.350
 once the intimidating force of the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.369
 Ndrangheta is this her 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 ability to infiltrate everyone and no one is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.220
 immune from a possibility or at least from 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.750
 a possible infiltration attempt 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 one must have the capacity to resist 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 the mayors are elected and of course for 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.390
 being elected we need the consent is the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.570
 organized crime and maybe maybe 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.120
 bearer of electoral consent e 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.870
 so even when you have the best 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 intentions 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.780
 the consensus often arrives also from whom 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.030
 should not arrive or otherwise 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.320
 should be ascended to those who accept 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.010
 votes but so you can't refuse 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 but here there is more that not only comes the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.800
 consent or in any case the cost comes into 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.530
 some required measures come i 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.290
 relationships are such that of course one 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.820
 is directed towards a faction and instead 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.200
 towards a sa but here I would say that there is more 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.299
 because the commission concerns 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.000
 not only the electoral consent but 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.950
 concerns a whole tourist facility 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.810
 what this place they want to accomplish 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.479
 a group of but you are in minutes 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.429
 Calabria also using thick 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.860
 subsidized contribution for the areas of 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.259
 noon of Italy is here this 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.229
 structure is a problem is a problem 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.000
 because the problem is a serious problem 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.259
 because I go even though of course with the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.369
 controlling it wants to be a security guard 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.920
 when I don't know how they're doing 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.500
 things of the guardian are not enough they want 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.660
 money 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.860
 and for strongly inserted the same 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.260
 the mayor who seems to be the contact 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.150
 with one of the two factions that command 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 looked at the factions of the cosca 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.050
 gallace the mayor and relations with one 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.170
 of these two fairly tight factions 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.459
 we have a carabinieri weapon 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.950
 developed an investigation that has us 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.300
 allowed to verify a situation 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.830
 in the municipality of guardavalle di 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.400
 real infiltration in the area 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.220
 of everyday society by the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.080
 local ndranghetist crime e 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.660
 so the gal always talk of course 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.050
 of the gallace thigh a well company 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.850
 structured with well-defined subjects 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.290
 with 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.760
 I'll give an example of the same neighbor 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.740
 gallace said so mino was il 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.640
 so-called not only responsible for 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:54.250
 governing body of the gallaceous thigh but 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:58.210
 also of the so-called we could say of the 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.630
 so-called welfare fund for 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.720
 affiliates for affiliates therefore had 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.600
 certain characters who dealt with 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.240
 of relations is obviously with the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:16.960
 external pockets on the lower Jonathan sover 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.320
 both with obviously external subjects to the 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.000
 cosca is for the activities 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.840
 entrepreneurship for both small businesses 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.350
 work activities the survey carried out 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.570
 with technical activity and of course with 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.840
 traditional survey systems such as 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.280
 tracking observation allowed by the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.459
 forehead too 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.140
 the exact identification of the roles that 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:49.940
 obviously allowed us to 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:53.480
 to make a certain reality be 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.630
 practically distorted by the presence of 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.030
 a thigh an example the village of the 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.900
 bathing establishments damage 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.840
 that there were no such villages 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.000
 they had a purpose for example which one can 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.340
 being lace but had a purpose 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.770
 to insure certain companies i 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.690
 renovation works therefore 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.150
 actually it is an infiltration 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.630
 in the socio-economic area of ​​the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.630
 community
