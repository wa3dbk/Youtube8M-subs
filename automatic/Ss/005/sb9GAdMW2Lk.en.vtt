00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to be in this video so here he is again

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.249 
to be in this video so here he is again
and<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.159> decided<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> highlight<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and I decided to use a highlight so I

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
and I decided to use a highlight so I
just<00:01:16.530> took<00:01:16.710> booty<00:01:17.100> call<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> that's<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.180> on

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
just took booty call and that's going on

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
just took booty call and that's going on
my<00:01:18.390> inner<00:01:18.689> corner<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> also<00:01:19.530> my<00:01:19.680> brow<00:01:19.890> bone

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
my inner corner and also my brow bone

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.010 
my inner corner and also my brow bone
and<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> big<00:01:23.909> part<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.240> Taylor's<00:01:24.659> look

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
and I think a big part of Taylor's look

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.929 
and I think a big part of Taylor's look
is<00:01:25.229> using<00:01:25.619> liquid<00:01:25.799> eyeliner<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
is using liquid eyeliner so this is a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.420 
is using liquid eyeliner so this is a
black<00:01:27.240> liquid<00:01:27.509> liner<00:01:27.659> from<00:01:28.229> nicks<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> I'm

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
black liquid liner from nicks and I'm

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
black liquid liner from nicks and I'm
just<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.700> take<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.420> top<00:01:30.720> lash

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
just going to take this on my top lash

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.679 
just going to take this on my top lash
line<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> extend<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
line and I'm going to extend it out to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
line and I'm going to extend it out to
create<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> winged<00:01:34.350> eyeliner<00:01:34.619> look

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.830 

so<00:01:39.400> this<00:01:39.550> is<00:01:39.670> what<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:39.850> have<00:01:40.060> now<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.510> I'm<00:01:40.750> just
