00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
good time than we I think we made a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.270 
good time than we I think we made a
difference<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.530> toady<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:04.979> Cottman

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
difference and then toady and Cottman

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.160 
difference and then toady and Cottman
showed<00:02:05.520> up<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> race<00:02:06.479> director<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
showed up as a race director there and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.900 
showed up as a race director there and
made<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> really<00:02:07.799> big<00:02:08.069> difference<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.640> kind<00:02:08.879> of

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
made a really big difference and kind of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.660 
made a really big difference and kind of
showed<00:02:09.119> me<00:02:09.470> showed<00:02:10.470> me<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> real

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
showed me showed me you know a real

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
showed me showed me you know a real
different<00:02:12.000> perspective<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.540> officiating<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
different perspective on officiating and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.410 
different perspective on officiating and
fortunately<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.370> got<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.819> go<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> American

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
fortunately I got to go to the American

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.420 
fortunately I got to go to the American
LeMans<00:02:15.540> Series<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.440> get<00:02:16.740> some<00:02:17.069> great

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
LeMans Series and and get some great

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.120 
LeMans Series and and get some great
experience<00:02:18.209> officiating<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.050> made<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> real

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
experience officiating and made a real

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.360 
experience officiating and made a real
difference<00:02:20.160> there<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.770> was<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.190> think

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
difference there and so that was I think

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.830 
difference there and so that was I think
that<00:02:23.550> was<00:02:23.700> good<00:02:24.000> training<00:02:24.209> but<00:02:24.480> not

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that was good training but not

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.330 
that was good training but not
everything<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.319> need<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.530> know<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.040> job

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
everything I need to know for this job

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.430 
everything I need to know for this job
but<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.790> feel<00:02:27.090> confident<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.290> make<00:02:28.410> a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
but I feel confident that I can make a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.120 
but I feel confident that I can make a
difference<00:02:28.800> here

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
difference here

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.430 
difference here
from<00:02:29.730> an<00:02:29.819> officiating<00:02:30.360> standpoint<00:02:30.900> I've

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
from an officiating standpoint I've

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.430 
from an officiating standpoint I've
tended<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.310> sort<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.760> find<00:02:32.940> myself<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.080> a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
tended to sort of find myself and in a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.350 
tended to sort of find myself and in a
zone<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> speak<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.370> any<00:02:35.760> athlete<00:02:35.910> might

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
zone so to speak like any athlete might

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.740 
zone so to speak like any athlete might
speak<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.420> it's

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
speak of and you know it's it's

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.400 
speak of and you know it's it's
important<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.940> look<00:02:42.239> at<00:02:42.450> an<00:02:42.720> incident<00:02:43.319> or

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
important to to look at an incident or

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.699 
important to to look at an incident or
situation<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.660> absolutely<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.930> face<00:02:46.260> value

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
situation for absolutely it's face value

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.949 
situation for absolutely it's face value
I<00:02:46.950> tend<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.640> look<00:02:47.880> at<00:02:48.060> incidents<00:02:48.330> without

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
I tend to look at incidents without

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.350 
I tend to look at incidents without
regard<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.500> who's<00:02:49.920> driving<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.640> car<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:51.209> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
regard to who's driving the car to the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.930 
regard to who's driving the car to the
car<00:02:51.600> number<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.200> color<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.890> car<00:02:53.100> any<00:02:53.519> of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
car number the color of the car any of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.729 
car number the color of the car any of
that<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.390> try<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> look<00:02:54.870> at<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.290> as<00:02:55.500> black

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
that you try to look at that as black

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.710 
that you try to look at that as black
and<00:02:55.920> white<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.130> possible<00:02:56.459> when<00:02:57.360> people<00:02:57.630> are

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
and white as possible when people are

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.210 
and white as possible when people are
longing<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.110> black<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.590> white<00:02:58.680> rules<00:02:59.069> I

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
longing for black and white rules I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.949 
longing for black and white rules I
think<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.550> really<00:02:59.760> allows<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.420> make<00:03:00.660> the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
think that really allows you to make the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.280 
think that really allows you to make the
right<00:03:01.170> decision<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.940> grew<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:03.360> around<00:03:03.660> racing

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
right decision I I grew up around racing

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.790 
right decision I I grew up around racing
so<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:05.569> really<00:03:06.569> think<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.959> any<00:03:07.200> American

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
so I really think that any American

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.430 
so I really think that any American
driver<00:03:08.310> looks<00:03:08.819> at<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.030> Indy<00:03:09.269> 500<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.930> that's

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
driver looks at the Indy 500 and that's

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.500 
driver looks at the Indy 500 and that's
what<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.620> grew<00:03:10.860> up<00:03:10.890> grew<00:03:11.790> up<00:03:11.940> dreaming<00:03:12.300> about

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
what I grew up grew up dreaming about

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.590 
what I grew up grew up dreaming about
from<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.800> driver<00:03:14.100> standpoint<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.880> then<00:03:15.390> from

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
from a driver standpoint and then from

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.300 
from a driver standpoint and then from
an<00:03:15.690> officiating<00:03:16.260> standpoint<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.069> it

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
an officiating standpoint it's a it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.340 
an officiating standpoint it's a it
really<00:03:17.640> represents<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.480> pinnacle<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:19.079> any<00:03:19.230> of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
really represents the pinnacle of any of

really represents the pinnacle of any of
my<00:03:19.470> ambition<00:03:20.010> or<00:03:20.130> aspirations<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:22.380> I'm
