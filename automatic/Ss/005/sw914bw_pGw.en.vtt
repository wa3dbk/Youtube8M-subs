00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.220 

today<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.299> looking<00:00:15.539> at<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:15.780> method<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
today we're looking at one method of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.380 
today we're looking at one method of
recording<00:00:16.680> good<00:00:17.010> quality<00:00:17.460> audio<00:00:17.700> while<00:00:18.240> we're

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
recording good quality audio while we're

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.180 
recording good quality audio while we're
shooting<00:00:18.570> our<00:00:18.840> video<00:00:19.050> we're<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.100> look

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
shooting our video we're going to look

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.550 
shooting our video we're going to look
at<00:00:20.400> double<00:00:20.880> system<00:00:21.270> sound<00:00:21.540> and<00:00:21.840> basically

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
at double system sound and basically

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.650 
at double system sound and basically
what<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.950> is<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.640> when<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.120> use<00:00:24.300> two

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
what this is it's when we use two

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.360 
what this is it's when we use two
different<00:00:24.990> devices<00:00:25.200> one<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.950> record<00:00:26.280> the

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
different devices one to record the

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.400 
different devices one to record the
audio<00:00:26.520> and<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.600> to<00:00:27.750> record<00:00:27.870> the<00:00:28.170> video

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
audio and one to record the video

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.890 
audio and one to record the video
separately<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.430> why<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:29.940> you<00:00:30.120> ask<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.690> need

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
separately now why do you ask do I need

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.049 
separately now why do you ask do I need
two<00:00:31.260> systems<00:00:31.740> my<00:00:32.189> camera<00:00:32.579> has<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> built-in

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
two systems my camera has a built-in

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.020 
two systems my camera has a built-in
microphone<00:00:33.320> yeah<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.559> probably<00:00:34.920> does<00:00:35.070> most<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
microphone yeah it probably does most of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
microphone yeah it probably does most of
today's<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.690> point<00:00:36.899> shoot<00:00:37.109> cameras<00:00:37.530> shoot

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
today's little point shoot cameras shoot

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.119 
today's little point shoot cameras shoot
real<00:00:38.460> quality<00:00:39.030> high<00:00:39.359> def<00:00:39.659> video<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.710> problem

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
real quality high def video the problem

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
real quality high def video the problem
is<00:00:41.309> most<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.969> them<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.449> not<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:43.019> a<00:00:43.199> microphone

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
is most of them do not have a microphone

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.389 
is most of them do not have a microphone
input<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.570> audio<00:00:45.929> you<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.559> fine<00:00:47.129> if

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
input so the audio you get is fine if

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.709 
input so the audio you get is fine if
you're<00:00:47.519> standing<00:00:47.850> close<00:00:48.179> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.480> camera

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you're standing close to the camera

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.450 
you're standing close to the camera
because<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.589> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> pick<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.159> my<00:00:50.280> voice

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
because it's going to pick up my voice

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
because it's going to pick up my voice
but<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.569> move<00:00:52.199> further<00:00:52.679> away<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
but as I move further away from the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.469 
but as I move further away from the
camera<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.940> sound<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.479> it<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.839> distant<00:00:58.339> I

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.240 

said<00:01:03.479> you<00:01:04.050> probably<00:01:04.320> won't<00:01:04.440> hear<00:01:04.920> anything

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
said you probably won't hear anything

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
said you probably won't hear anything
I'd<00:01:05.489> say<00:01:05.519> well<00:01:06.299> my<00:01:06.420> back<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.899> turned<00:01:07.140> away<00:01:07.290> from

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I'd say well my back is turned away from

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.160 
I'd say well my back is turned away from
the<00:01:07.590> camera<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.579> the<00:01:09.299> microphone<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.110> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the camera because the microphone is in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.859 
the camera because the microphone is in
there<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:11.399> we<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.570> put<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
there what we want to do is put a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.749 
there what we want to do is put a
microphone<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.890> me<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.509> I've<00:01:15.630> done<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
microphone on me so what I've done is

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.209 
microphone on me so what I've done is
put<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.390> pocket<00:01:18.630> an<00:01:18.990> audio<00:01:19.530> recording

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
put in my pocket an audio recording

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.350 
put in my pocket an audio recording

device this particular one I'll show you
that<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.619> zoom<00:01:25.890> h1<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:28.079> is<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that this is the zoom h1 and this is a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.789 
that this is the zoom h1 and this is a
small<00:01:29.100> digital<00:01:29.610> audio<00:01:30.420> recorder<00:01:30.899> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
small digital audio recorder this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.270 
small digital audio recorder this
records<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.299> high<00:01:33.930> fidelity<00:01:34.350> stereo

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
records a really high fidelity stereo

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.760 
records a really high fidelity stereo
sound<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:36.329> small<00:01:36.750> lightweight<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.649> they

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
sound it's small lightweight now they

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.670 
sound it's small lightweight now they
make<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.579> expensive<00:01:39.119> units<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.439> line

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
make more expensive units in this line

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
make more expensive units in this line
bigger<00:01:41.039> ones<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.549> more<00:01:41.759> inputs<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.840> they're

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
bigger ones with more inputs and they're

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.679 
bigger ones with more inputs and they're
very<00:01:43.229> expensive<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.159> costs<00:01:44.549> about<00:01:44.689> $100

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
very expensive this one costs about $100

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.260 
very expensive this one costs about $100
which<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> still<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.859> lot<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> money<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:48.179> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
which is still a lot of money but you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.810 
which is still a lot of money but you
can<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.570> good<00:01:48.750> quality<00:01:48.899> sound<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.920> now

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
can get good quality sound with it now

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.200 
can get good quality sound with it now
it's<00:01:51.119> got<00:01:51.329> built-in<00:01:51.869> stereo<00:01:52.289> mics<00:01:52.710> or<00:01:53.219> you<00:01:53.969> can

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
it's got built-in stereo mics or you can

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.319 
it's got built-in stereo mics or you can
plug<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.369> clip-on<00:01:56.369> mic<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.179> I'm

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
plug in a clip-on mic which is what I'm

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.529 
plug in a clip-on mic which is what I'm
using<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.679> get<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.219> best<00:01:59.429> sound<00:01:59.700> now<00:02:00.179> let

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
using here to get the best sound now let

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.599 
using here to get the best sound now let
me<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.749> demonstrate<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.289> unplug<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.770> you

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
me just demonstrate if I unplug this you

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.459 
me just demonstrate if I unplug this you
see<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> mics<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.479> top<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:04.020> actually

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
see the mics on the top are actually

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.870 
see the mics on the top are actually
picking<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> sound<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.700> good

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
picking up the sound and it is good

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
picking up the sound and it is good
quality<00:02:05.909> sound<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:07.409> then<00:02:07.499> I<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.679> to<00:02:07.799> hold

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
quality sound but then I have to hold

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.029 
quality sound but then I have to hold
this<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.910> handheld<00:02:09.479> microphone<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.590> if

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
this like a handheld microphone and if

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.100 
this like a handheld microphone and if
there's<00:02:11.220> any<00:02:11.370> wind<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.269> gonna<00:02:12.480> pick<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.959> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
there's any wind it's gonna pick up on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.610 
there's any wind it's gonna pick up on
those<00:02:13.260> as<00:02:13.470> well

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.710 

this<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:16.860> clip-on<00:02:17.430> microphone<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.569> way

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
this little clip-on microphone that way

you've got everything set up when the
cameras<00:03:32.370> rolling<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:33.060> your<00:03:33.269> audio<00:03:33.630> device<00:03:33.900> is

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
cameras rolling and your audio device is

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.129 
cameras rolling and your audio device is
recording<00:03:34.829> bang<00:03:35.609> your<00:03:35.849> hands<00:03:36.269> together<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.930> a

recording bang your hands together in a
clapping<00:03:37.590> motion<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.220> makes<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.459> lot<00:03:38.579> of

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
clapping motion that makes a lot of

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.009 
clapping motion that makes a lot of
noise<00:03:38.700> like<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:41.329> now<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.389> reason<00:03:42.750> we<00:03:42.840> did

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
noise like this now the reason we did

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.680 
noise like this now the reason we did
that<00:03:43.049> now<00:03:43.980> we<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.310> an<00:03:44.459> audio<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.480> video

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
that now we have an audio and a video

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.349 
that now we have an audio and a video
cue<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.919> I<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.280> synchronize<00:03:47.790> up<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.180> my

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
cue that I can synchronize up on my

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.750 
cue that I can synchronize up on my
computer<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.380> audio<00:03:49.680> cue<00:03:50.010> obviously<00:03:50.639> when

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
computer the audio cue obviously when

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.580 
computer the audio cue obviously when
our<00:03:50.880> hands<00:03:51.239> come<00:03:51.510> together<00:03:51.690> you'll<00:03:52.380> see<00:03:52.560> a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
our hands come together you'll see a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.180 
our hands come together you'll see a
spike<00:03:53.069> in<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.970> audio<00:03:54.450> track<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.859> visual

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
spike in the audio track and the visual

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.120 
spike in the audio track and the visual
cue<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.639> my<00:03:56.910> hands<00:03:57.450> as<00:03:57.599> they<00:03:58.079> touch<00:03:58.349> so

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
cue is my hands as they touch so

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.309 
cue is my hands as they touch so
basically<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.609> line<00:04:00.060> those<00:04:00.329> up<00:04:00.359> on<00:04:00.959> your

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
basically just line those up on your

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.960 
basically just line those up on your
editing<00:04:01.620> system<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.459> one<00:04:02.639> track

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
editing system you have the one track

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.970 
editing system you have the one track
with<00:04:03.120> your<00:04:03.239> video<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.810> see<00:04:04.260> your<00:04:04.590> hands

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
with your video so you see your hands
