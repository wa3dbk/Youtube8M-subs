00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
 No point 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.779
 it was navas we are going with the last recipe that recorded this summer 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.199
 a plum jam to eat her 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.560
 Palermo to make preserves and not to eat immediately 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.320
 and we are going to do it with a kilo of plums a couple of apples and about 250 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.880
 grams of sugar the first thing to do is to remove the plums 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.439
 if you want it more firmly the time to go through the Chinese does not need to be 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.610
 remove 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.080
 because you can not separate as soon as you pass through the Chinese 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.070
 a friend I like to live together everything took bone apples in this case 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.730
 they are thickeners another bad apples that does not fall apart if the other is 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.110
 small if you then pass through the Chinese for your expected 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.250
 a very thin jam 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.510
 and if not then against the groups of the apple 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.510
 it is a matter of taste 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.610
 b 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.720
 We are going to put the piles and the apple in a pan over a very slow fire and we are going to 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
 wait for it to come undone 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.280
 Stirring occasionally 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.470

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.710

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.409
 When it is well disposed ect we can add the sugar 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.840
 if this were a preserve, I would need a lot more sugar, almost the same 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.430
 amount of sugar 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.240
 Perez yruela 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.659
 but as it is to eat she does not need to add so much sugar 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.790
 And I personally like it - sweet the fence is about ten minutes with 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.790
 the sugar and you're ready you can not pack 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.469
 and if it's to preserve the greens that depose in the bain-marie but I 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:14.449
 tomorrow I will return to the sides with this novel I hope you like a hug to
