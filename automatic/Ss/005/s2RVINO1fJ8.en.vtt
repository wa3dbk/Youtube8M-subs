tongue-tied so let's take a look at the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.389 
tongue-tied so let's take a look at the
flanges<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.649> that's<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.159> makes

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
flanges because that's what really makes

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.609 
flanges because that's what really makes

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
there we go this is the lower level so

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.940 
there we go this is the lower level so
this<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:24.050> puddle<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.230> ground
