how everything comes together it works
really<00:00:57.799> nice<00:00:58.069> it's<00:00:58.639> how<00:00:58.789> it's<00:00:59.449> how<00:00:59.569> we<00:00:59.690> work

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
really nice it's how it's how we work

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.829 
really nice it's how it's how we work
everyday<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.679> best<00:01:00.889> part<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.339> is<00:01:02.209> how<00:01:02.449> surface

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839

pro 3 the pen and OneNote I'll come

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.520 
pro 3 the pen and OneNote I'll come
together<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.690> be<00:01:05.810> able<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.050> make<00:01:06.230> design

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
together to be able to make design

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.130 
together to be able to make design
collaboration<00:01:07.160> easy<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.360> here<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:08.600> have<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.780> CAD

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
collaboration easy so here we have a CAD

collaboration easy so here we have a CAD
model<00:01:09.170> up<00:01:09.530> again<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:10.070> find<00:01:10.760> something<00:01:11.120> that<00:01:11.270> may

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
model up again I find something that may

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.710 
model up again I find something that may
be<00:01:11.720> an<00:01:11.870> issue<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:13.190> double<00:01:13.670> click<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.910> pen<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:14.360> get

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
be an issue I double click the pen I get

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.710 
be an issue I double click the pen I get
a<00:01:14.750> screenshot<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:15.760> select<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.880> area<00:01:17.150> that<00:01:17.210> that

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
a screenshot I select the area that that

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.430 
a screenshot I select the area that that
I<00:01:17.780> have<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:17.930> question<00:01:18.110> about<00:01:18.910> right<00:01:19.910> and<00:01:20.000> open

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
I have a question about right and open

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:30.040 
I have a question about right and open
can<00:01:21.440> we<00:01:22.690> make<00:01:23.690> this<00:01:24.580> shorter<00:01:27.970> now<00:01:29.050> because

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
can we make this shorter now because

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.320 
can we make this shorter now because
OneNote<00:01:30.380> synced<00:01:30.770> everybody<00:01:31.760> on<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.940> team<00:01:32.090> can

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
OneNote synced everybody on the team can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.490 
OneNote synced everybody on the team can
see<00:01:32.510> this<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.870> doesn't<00:01:32.990> matter<00:01:33.200> if<00:01:33.350> they're

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
see this it doesn't matter if they're

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.410 
see this it doesn't matter if they're
across<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.890> room<00:01:34.070> or<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:34.370> China<00:01:34.670> we<00:01:35.210> can<00:01:35.330> have

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
across the room or in China we can have

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.940 
across the room or in China we can have
a<00:01:35.450> real<00:01:35.690> time<00:01:35.870> conversation<00:01:36.530> about<00:01:36.740> this

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
a real time conversation about this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.830 
a real time conversation about this
issue<00:01:37.010> get<00:01:37.940> it<00:01:38.030> solved<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:38.450> get<00:01:38.540> on<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.720> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
issue get it solved and get on to the
