00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.160
 tomorrow the volcano that is not my feet 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.050
 are legs 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.670
 I'm bubbles to have carried the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.730
 Hot but precise new fields 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:31.779
 get up and get to know a plant 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.779
 native who can help me 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 This is what I was looking for a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.300
 vine and congested in the square comes here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.400
 it's barbosa 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.590
 because of these things try to return to the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.059
 team and I'm going to take a role in locking 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.059
 this in the cafe 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.930
 the proposal contains enzymes 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.770
 anti-inflammatory and can treat 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.240
 burns blisters and cuts 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.080
 We used our mouths extensively in shampoos and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.820
 soaps 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.110
 you can also use the director of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.690
 plant 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.280
 the best way to get a port shows 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.649
 the leaf is cutting in order to go in the river 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.320
 as if to count the sheet in two 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.320
 Dig a bit like this 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.000
 So I'm going to start running right now. 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.000
 You can see here running down here. 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:45.509
 and that 's what I want all my 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 feet are still there are only 130 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.740
 kilometers of christmas 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.450
 the volcano is at the southern end of the island and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.310
 now there should be only a few of us 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:00.420
 they did not expect to find the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.020
 civilization through the jungle seems 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.020
 endless
