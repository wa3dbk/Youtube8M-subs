00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello the most beautiful so today 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.730
 I'm going with a video 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.019
 first impressions so this is a 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.929
 league 2 is a first in fact 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.419
 by the way for for this series of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.880
 videos there so I think that henceforth 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.920
 I will be able if I will try to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.570
 make videos 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.680
 first impressions of evidence 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.609
 new products that I have is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.910
 so there for once I tried the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.189
 range the body shop of brand So here 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.120
 I really never bought anything from 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.500
 them and there for once I found 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.630
 a private sale of a body shop so 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.150
 I took the opportunity to buy 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.820
 products and I have a girlfriend also they 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.060
 have offered so here I wanted to test 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.000
 and you talk about it then what I already have 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.370
 bought month in private sale this is the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.950
 products it's body scrubs 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.110
 so you have one here chocolate 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.570
 so this one is hot as anja 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.460
 body scrub and this one to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.400
 lemon so they are really 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.430
 wonderful product I hated 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.850
 in the shower frankly you have the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.520
 soft skin right after and so 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.080
 after ben you have the smell that stays and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.700
 this is the top so this one 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.850
 this is how it really looks 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.250
 a really chocolate paw and smell 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.040
 chocolate and frankly there really 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.540
 she is super super super top these 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.630
 products there are really good I have 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.390
 really liked i really appreciated 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.280
 so here's the body scrub 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.990
 excluding bodily you have it too 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.909
 with lemons then this one I think that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.260
 I tested them but I think I 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.510
 will keep it too for the summer because 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.050
 that it's true that lemon summer is 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.930
 this is going to be saying that ravigote is so 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.479
 it seems to really feel the comment 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.510
 the one with lemon marmalade and its 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.300
 super good censorship and the grains are 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.310
 still pretty thick enough not very 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.810
 p but still enough for a good 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.280
 sugar rice buzz that its marks and 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.320
 trends it's wrong extracting body 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.770
 to sugar and so in every pot like 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.650
 this you have 200 220 200 milliliters 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.450
