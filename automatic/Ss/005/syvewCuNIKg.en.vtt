00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
minging this is a great ability to get

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
minging this is a great ability to get
some<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:29.670> powerful<00:01:30.360> weapons<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.590> can

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
some of these powerful weapons you can

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.499 
some of these powerful weapons you can
get<00:01:31.979> their<00:01:32.159> weapons<00:01:32.490> very<00:01:32.729> easily<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.270> by

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
get their weapons very easily just by

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
get their weapons very easily just by
typing<00:01:33.780> slash<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.350> however<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:35.009> ability

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
typing slash but however this ability

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.569 
typing slash but however this ability
has<00:01:35.490> only<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.740> use<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.070> only<00:01:38.220> one

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
has only one use you can use it only one

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
has only one use you can use it only one
time<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> disadvantage<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.500> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
time so that is a disadvantage to this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.679 
time so that is a disadvantage to this
kit<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.909> careful<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.390> when<00:01:42.540> using

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
kit but I would be careful of when using

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.590 
kit but I would be careful of when using
this<00:01:43.020> kit<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> bodies<00:01:45.240> too

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this kit is not to go to bodies too

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
this kit is not to go to bodies too
easily<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.380> remember<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.399> person<00:01:47.790> who

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
easily because remember the person who

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.850 
easily because remember the person who
killed<00:01:48.210> them<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.689> still<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.229> around<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.740> if

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
killed them could still be around so if

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770 
killed them could still be around so if
you<00:01:49.950> try<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.250> pick<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.579> any<00:01:50.759> items<00:01:51.329> they<00:01:51.540> could

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you try and pick up any items they could

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
you try and pick up any items they could
try<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:51.990> kill<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:53.579> careful<00:01:54.000> about

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
try and kill you and be careful about

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.179 
try and kill you and be careful about
betting<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> wrong<00:01:55.140> person<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.040> bet

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
betting on the wrong person if you bet

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.830 
betting on the wrong person if you bet
on<00:01:56.219> something<00:01:56.579> too<00:01:56.790> early<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.210> game<00:01:57.299> or

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
on something too early in the game or

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
on something too early in the game or
somebody<00:01:58.259> who<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.560> doesn't<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> lot

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
somebody who really doesn't have a lot

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.370 
somebody who really doesn't have a lot
of<00:01:59.520> stuff<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.600> die<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.170> look<00:02:01.290> at

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
of stuff and then they die you look at

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.749 
of stuff and then they die you look at
what<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.680> had<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:02.430> only<00:02:02.549> had<00:02:02.729> a
