00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
your pole coming down to a three-way

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.029 
your pole coming down to a three-way
swivel<00:00:29.119> off<00:00:29.630> from<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:29.990> 3-way<00:00:30.380> swivel<00:00:30.860> there's

a short distance down to a sinker and

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.340 
a short distance down to a sinker and
then<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:35.329> other<00:00:35.510> direction<00:00:35.899> there's<00:00:36.289> a

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
then the other direction there's a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.450 
then the other direction there's a
longer<00:00:37.659> piece<00:00:38.659> of<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.019> fishing<00:00:39.649> line<00:00:39.890> going

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
longer piece of the fishing line going

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.290 
longer piece of the fishing line going
out<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:40.760> his<00:00:40.879> hook

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
out to his hook

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.509 
out to his hook
now<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.019> hook<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.499> crayfish<00:00:42.739> through<00:00:43.159> the<00:00:43.309> tail

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
now you hook a crayfish through the tail

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:44.919 
now you hook a crayfish through the tail
he's<00:00:43.789> got<00:00:43.999> a<00:00:44.030> hook<00:00:44.210> through<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.510> tail<00:00:44.690> as<00:00:44.899> you

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
he's got a hook through the tail as you

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.919 
he's got a hook through the tail as you
can<00:00:45.170> see<00:00:45.350> right<00:00:45.530> there<00:00:45.589> and<00:00:46.479> the<00:00:47.479> other<00:00:47.510> thing

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
can see right there and the other thing

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.660 
can see right there and the other thing
is<00:00:48.079> is<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.379> want<00:00:48.589> to<00:00:48.679> take<00:00:48.889> the<00:00:49.039> pinchers<00:00:49.429> off

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
is is you want to take the pinchers off

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.209 
is is you want to take the pinchers off
the<00:00:49.879> front<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:50.539> that<00:00:50.929> they<00:00:51.229> don't<00:00:51.350> snip<00:00:51.920> at<00:00:52.100> the

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
the front so that they don't snip at the

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.219 
the front so that they don't snip at the
fish<00:00:52.519> because<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.420> way<00:00:53.569> makes<00:00:53.839> it<00:00:53.960> easier

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
fish because that way makes it easier

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.009 
fish because that way makes it easier
for<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.440> fish<00:00:54.649> to<00:00:54.679> bite<00:00:55.010> on<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.460> hang<00:00:55.609> on<00:00:56.019> so

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
for the fish to bite on and hang on so

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.419 
for the fish to bite on and hang on so
we're<00:00:57.229> going<00:00:57.319> to<00:00:57.379> try<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.589> do<00:00:57.769> is<00:00:58.010> right<00:00:58.219> along

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
we're going to try to do is right along

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.910 
we're going to try to do is right along
this<00:00:58.579> wall<00:00:58.879> over<00:00:59.209> here<00:00:59.530> because<00:01:00.530> we<00:01:00.679> know<00:01:00.769> the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
this wall over here because we know the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.860 
this wall over here because we know the
bass<00:01:01.129> like<00:01:01.489> structure<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.089> cover<00:01:02.420> we're

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
bass like structure and cover we're

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.500 
bass like structure and cover we're
going<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:03.229> go<00:01:03.530> ahead<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:03.979> cast<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:05.030> along<00:01:05.299> this

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
going to go ahead and cast in along this

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.100 
going to go ahead and cast in along this
wall<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.110> see<00:01:06.350> if<00:01:06.500> one<00:01:06.830> will<00:01:07.690> bite<00:01:08.690> our<00:01:08.840> drop

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
wall and see if one will bite our drop

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:22.070 
wall and see if one will bite our drop
shot<00:01:09.380> set<00:01:09.650> up

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.090 

sometimes<00:01:23.080> when<00:01:23.230> you're<00:01:23.380> fishing<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:23.860> it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
sometimes when you're fishing this it

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.820 
sometimes when you're fishing this it
works<00:01:24.280> good<00:01:24.580> just<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:24.970> keep<00:01:25.150> your<00:01:25.330> lines

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
works good just to keep your lines

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.800 
works good just to keep your lines
slightly<00:01:26.830> tight<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.580> can<00:01:27.760> feel<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
slightly tight so that you can feel the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.700 
slightly tight so that you can feel the
fish<00:01:29.020> hit<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.470> hook<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.840> also<00:01:32.020> helps<00:01:32.500> if

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
fish hit the hook and it also helps if

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.800 
fish hit the hook and it also helps if
that<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:32.980> stand<00:01:33.250> up<00:01:33.490> high<00:01:33.700> on<00:01:34.030> your<00:01:34.360> boat

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
that you stand up high on your boat

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.470 
that you stand up high on your boat
as<00:01:35.320> you<00:01:35.560> can<00:01:35.680> see<00:01:35.920> Ed<00:01:36.100> is<00:01:36.310> climbed<00:01:37.000> all<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.360> way

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
as you can see Ed is climbed all the way

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.000 
as you can see Ed is climbed all the way
up<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.830> that<00:01:39.370> allows<00:01:39.670> him<00:01:39.700> with<00:01:40.270> his

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
up and that allows him with his

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.380 
up and that allows him with his
polarized<00:01:42.010> lenses<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.640> see<00:01:42.670> down<00:01:43.000> into<00:01:43.300> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
polarized lenses to see down into the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.720

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
higher too and I'll see if you guys can

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.190 
higher too and I'll see if you guys can
see<00:01:48.790> down<00:01:48.970> into<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.330> water<00:01:49.510> better<00:01:49.780> as<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.080> get

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
see down into the water better as I get

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.050
