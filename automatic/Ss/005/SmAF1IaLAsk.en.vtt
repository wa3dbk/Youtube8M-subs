prophecy<00:03:13.440> would<00:03:13.740> be<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.490> written

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
prophecy would be one that is written

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.560 
prophecy would be one that is written
down<00:03:15.510> before<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.440> event<00:03:16.740> happens<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.570> nobody

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
down before the event happens and nobody

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.480 
down before the event happens and nobody
knows<00:03:18.810> about<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.410> hidden<00:03:19.890> away<00:03:20.130> in<00:03:20.370> a

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
knows about it it's hidden away in a

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.450 
knows about it it's hidden away in a
capsule<00:03:21.000> let's<00:03:21.150> say<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:23.040> future<00:03:23.250> if

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
capsule let's say then in the future if

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.670 
capsule let's say then in the future if
that<00:03:23.760> event<00:03:24.120> actually<00:03:24.360> happened<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.590> was

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
that event actually happened and it was

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.630 
that event actually happened and it was
very<00:03:25.950> unique<00:03:26.190> event<00:03:27.590> then<00:03:28.590> they<00:03:29.250> opened<00:03:29.580> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
very unique event then they opened the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.060 
very unique event then they opened the
capsule<00:03:30.210> up<00:03:30.600> or<00:03:30.840> whatever<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.380> then<00:03:32.040> they

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
capsule up or whatever and then they

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.930 
capsule up or whatever and then they
read<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.550> prophecy<00:03:33.030> after<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.170> fact<00:03:34.940> then

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
read the prophecy after the fact then

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.350 
read the prophecy after the fact then
that<00:03:35.970> would<00:03:36.360> prove<00:03:36.740> that<00:03:38.030> beforehand<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.240> was

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
that would prove that beforehand it was

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.720 
that would prove that beforehand it was
prophesized<00:03:39.930> before<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.010> event<00:03:41.310> happened

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
prophesized before the event happened

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.240 
prophesized before the event happened
but<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.780> can't<00:03:43.050> tell<00:03:43.560> everybody<00:03:43.860> about<00:03:44.100> a

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
but you can't tell everybody about a

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.460 
but you can't tell everybody about a
prophecy<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.450> everybody<00:03:45.840> knows<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.260> and

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
prophecy so that everybody knows it and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.190 
prophecy so that everybody knows it and
the<00:03:47.340> prophecy<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.000> something<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.570> man<00:03:48.870> can

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
the prophecy is something that man can

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.730 
the prophecy is something that man can
fulfill<00:03:49.710> I<00:03:50.070> mean<00:03:50.700> show<00:03:50.970> me<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> prophecy<00:03:51.780> where

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
only God could fulfill that prophecy

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.590 
only God could fulfill that prophecy
through<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.710> miracle<00:03:56.340> or<00:03:56.550> something<00:03:56.610> so

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
through a miracle or something so

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.660 
through a miracle or something so
mind-blowing<00:03:58.200> we<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.830> can't<00:03:59.070> believe<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.550> as

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
mind-blowing we just can't believe it as

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.270 
mind-blowing we just can't believe it as
humans<00:04:00.090> something<00:04:00.840> humans<00:04:01.290> cannot<00:04:01.710> do<00:04:01.980> or

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
humans something humans cannot do or

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.120 
humans something humans cannot do or
achieve<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.510> that's<00:04:04.230> what's<00:04:04.410> funny<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.890> that

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
achieve and that's what's funny is that

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.020 
achieve and that's what's funny is that
