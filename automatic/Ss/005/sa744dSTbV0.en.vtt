00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:17.460
 Human brain signals in the United States through the Internet 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.460
 I was able to convey to another person in the remote location 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:29.070
 An experiment that conveys human brain signals to distant people in America 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.350
 It is a great technology that succeeded but there is no concern that others will be playing 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.770
 Or 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.600
 Hey How do I know I am afraid 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.690
 I have this 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 I wonder if 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.910
 A certain meaning here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.860
 It is Internet technology or PC technology 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.210
 Because it has developed 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.040
 Even as a mechanism of hearing 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.970
 Is it very likely to come out 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.750
 It became easy to explain that 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.680
 Now on the internet 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.339
 Oh dear 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 By interpolating the Zubo' for still it is and I ne Japan-South Korea war priority by interpolating with another another person also Zubo' 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.710
 Are 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.640
 Also connected by wired in this case is to suppress the None button 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.640
 I will press 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.040
 Already 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.540
 This is temporarily 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.710
 It's kind of priority but it looks like wi-fi It's telepathic if you fly with radio waves 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.780
 Wonderful life 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.049
 Control the other party's coverage with force 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.370
 In other words, in this experiment, it is easy to understand 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:43.820
 So this because I stand to do TV game 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.820
 I fact, it's more distant and do before lost away 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.090
 The Boob 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 Boo Boo 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:24.850
 Booby Imagination 8 author Clover hard anuno 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.110
 Positive that say so'm 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.200
 I was able 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.040
 What smoked 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:37.830
 Somewhat basically the brain's activity electrical 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.250
 Place as a typical physical fat Come to run but it is strong 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.950
 Can be reduced 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.140
 What 's so to speak radio waves from people of the actual Ya of psychics from then to possibly place ESP 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.130
 Say that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.600
 There is a song, and the bellflower that is famous for spoon bending is from the head 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.160
 fm wave is also out 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.440
 Nmaa 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.990
 Resident 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.440
 Oh I Yari say so Deshiba base something before plants can receive Well then ended bought new 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.440
 Seed 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:16.630
 Tsu each are various just understand that because it is the right hand meeting pretty radio I Burger 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:21.069
 There is a possibility of being a little inside, this is all that all 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.620
 Deep interest in the days of the ground does not think that well be able to elucidate 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:28.620
 Because it is a little 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:32.180
 Although the intention Sakuya Mr. Tteyuu want a button here is the preferred 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:38.060
 I wonder we are led to Tsunaze mind to the sled's 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.599
 That's why you can say that the brain and brain are connected to some kind of signal sound 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.670
 So I'm running with the L'Auberge Vance l much is for me 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.620
 Hmm 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.000
 It looks like it 's going to be true 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.000
 I'm scared if it is done 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.840
 Boo Boo 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.190
 Hmm 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.190
 Movement Mr. Khan 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:31.800
 It's all about being able to buber. 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:36.210
 It is Nyan manner Te Russuyo saying Boo Boo 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:41.190
 That 's why I think I have done my contribution 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.400
 Hey really tell the truth Well in the previous wi-fi Do may have been lobbying toward him 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:59.080
 There is no problem 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:59.080
 He Ateun
