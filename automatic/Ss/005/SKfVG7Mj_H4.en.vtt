for<00:01:12.160> what<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.460> would<00:01:12.550> be<00:01:12.580> like<00:01:12.670> if<00:01:12.970> these

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
for what it would be like if these

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.730 
for what it would be like if these
actually<00:01:13.420> happen<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.959> the<00:01:14.319> reason<00:01:14.709> that

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
actually happen and the reason that

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.100 
actually happen and the reason that
these<00:01:14.979> are<00:01:15.160> such<00:01:15.369> intense<00:01:15.819> moments<00:01:16.270> for<00:01:17.080> the
