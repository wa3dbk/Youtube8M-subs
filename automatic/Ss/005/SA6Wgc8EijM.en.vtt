00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
reason but now i'm gonna go Scizor again

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.590 
reason but now i'm gonna go Scizor again
and<00:02:36.800> just<00:02:36.860> go<00:02:37.010> for<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.250> turn<00:02:37.460> because<00:02:37.820> i<00:02:38.180> know

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
and just go for you turn because i know

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.170 
and just go for you turn because i know
that<00:02:39.080> he<00:02:39.770> probably<00:02:39.920> want<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.250> stay<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.460> looking

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
that he probably want to stay in looking

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.910 
that he probably want to stay in looking
at<00:02:41.300> if<00:02:41.450> he's<00:02:41.600> most<00:02:41.840> likely<00:02:41.900> choice<00:02:42.440> cuz

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
at if he's most likely choice cuz

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.680 
at if he's most likely choice cuz
actually<00:02:43.520> that<00:02:44.060> makes<00:02:44.180> sense<00:02:44.360> because<00:02:44.510> my

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
actually that makes sense because my

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.360 
actually that makes sense because my
jirachi<00:02:44.990> reaches<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> high<00:02:45.920> amount<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.220> speed

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
jirachi reaches a high amount of speed

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.970

so<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.850> tyranitar<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.810> starved<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.530> just

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
so that tyranitar is starved so just

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.140 
so that tyranitar is starved so just
kidding<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.220> turn<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.490> apologize<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:50.000> just

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
rocks at least I was assuming it would I

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.730 
rocks at least I was assuming it would I
still<00:05:06.510> want<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.750> play<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:06.900> safe<00:05:07.080> just<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.560> case

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
still want to play it safe just in case

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.800 
still want to play it safe just in case
it<00:05:07.950> had<00:05:08.160> like<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.820> one<00:05:09.150> percent<00:05:09.570> that<00:05:09.600> made

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
it had like that one percent that made

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.340 
it had like that one percent that made
it<00:05:09.930> live<00:05:10.139> but<00:05:11.060> fortunately<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.630> does<00:05:12.930> not<00:05:13.110> live

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
it live but fortunately it does not live

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.290 
it live but fortunately it does not live
so<00:05:13.380> it<00:05:13.889> does<00:05:14.070> die<00:05:14.280> but<00:05:14.850> he<00:05:14.880> goes<00:05:15.030> into

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
so it does die but he goes into

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.640 
so it does die but he goes into
