in<00:02:59.709> fact<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.639> was<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.879> fight<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.269> night

in fact that was the fight of the night

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.440 
in fact that was the fight of the night
even<00:03:01.750> though<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.900> was<00:03:02.079> on<00:03:02.200> under<00:03:02.530> car<00:03:02.790> now<00:03:03.790> he

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
even though it was on under car now he

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.729 
even though it was on under car now he
was<00:03:04.569> almost<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.019> fight<00:03:05.230> where<00:03:05.409> he<00:03:05.560> was

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
was almost in a fight where he was

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.979 
was almost in a fight where he was
untelevised<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:07.239> I'm<00:03:07.329> thinking<00:03:07.689> well<00:03:07.810> how're

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
untelevised so I'm thinking well how're

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.599 
untelevised so I'm thinking well how're
you<00:03:08.290> really<00:03:08.590> building<00:03:08.950> him<00:03:09.069> up<00:03:09.159> okay<00:03:09.340> you're

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
you really building him up okay you're

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.979 
you really building him up okay you're
building<00:03:09.909> him<00:03:09.939> up<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.239> getting<00:03:10.389> wins<00:03:10.629> under

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
building him up and getting wins under

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.990 
building him up and getting wins under
his<00:03:11.139> belt<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.010> guess<00:03:12.099> when<00:03:12.400> he<00:03:12.459> gets<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.670> title

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
his belt so I guess when he gets a title

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.220 
his belt so I guess when he gets a title
shot<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.269> could<00:03:13.359> say<00:03:13.540> well<00:03:13.720> he's<00:03:13.840> won<00:03:14.019> five

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
shot you could say well he's won five

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.080 
shot you could say well he's won five
straight<00:03:14.260> since<00:03:14.829> then<00:03:14.980> or<00:03:15.129> whatever<00:03:15.430> but
