00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
installed the CB radio in my Xterra this

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.480 
installed the CB radio in my Xterra this
is<00:00:06.720> just<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.080> cheap<00:00:07.500> Cobra<00:00:08.189> 19<00:00:09.150> ultra<00:00:09.750> 3<00:00:10.490> came

is just a cheap Cobra 19 ultra 3 came
from<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.150> think<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.450> Radio<00:00:12.750> Shack<00:00:13.080> or<00:00:13.349> Publix

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
from I think like Radio Shack or Publix

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.129 
from I think like Radio Shack or Publix
alright<00:00:14.160> not<00:00:14.309> Publix<00:00:14.780> Radio<00:00:15.780> Shack<00:00:15.990> or

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
alright not Publix Radio Shack or

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.560 
alright not Publix Radio Shack or
Walmart<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:16.740> something<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.820> can't

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570

Walmart or something like that I can't
really<00:00:18.930> remember<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.350> got<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.850> here's<00:00:21.480> how

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
really remember I got it but here's how

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.439 
really remember I got it but here's how
I<00:00:21.630> mounted<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.740> took<00:00:23.039> an<00:00:23.220> L<00:00:23.400> bracket<00:00:23.880> it

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
I mounted it I just took an L bracket it

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.000 
I mounted it I just took an L bracket it
usually<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.840> comes<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.170> an<00:00:25.350> L<00:00:25.529> bracket<00:00:25.920> or

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
usually it comes with an L bracket or

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.140 
usually it comes with an L bracket or
something<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.849> don't<00:00:26.910> have

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
something like that but I don't have

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
something like that but I don't have
this<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.779> took<00:00:27.900> an<00:00:28.050> L<00:00:28.199> bracket<00:00:28.619> took

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
this so I just took an L bracket took

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.780 
this so I just took an L bracket took
two<00:00:28.949> screws<00:00:29.840> screw<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> side<00:00:31.790> right

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
two screws screw it into the side right

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.160 
two screws screw it into the side right
there<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.510> hot<00:00:33.719> glue<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:34.110> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
there this is just hot glue because I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.510 
there this is just hot glue because I
had<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.410> hooked<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.010> stuff<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.399> there

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
had it hooked all that stuff on there

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.880 
had it hooked all that stuff on there
was<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.940> had<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.390> hot<00:00:36.540> glued<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
was I had it hot glued on to there and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.240 
was I had it hot glued on to there and
then<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.070> fell<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> screwed<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:40.250> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
then it fell so I screwed it in here the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.270 
then it fell so I screwed it in here the
coax<00:00:41.760> comes<00:00:42.270> out<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> bottom<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.280> goes

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
coax comes out of the bottom and goes

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680 
coax comes out of the bottom and goes
underneath<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> center<00:00:45.059> console<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.600> I'll

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
underneath the center console and I'll

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.479 
underneath the center console and I'll
show<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> wired<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.800> stuff<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
show you how it wired all that stuff and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
show you how it wired all that stuff and
the<00:00:47.820> power<00:00:48.030> cable<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.719> also<00:00:49.410> under<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:49.950> as

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the power cable is also under there as

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.200 
the power cable is also under there as
well<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.809> power<00:00:51.989> cable<00:00:52.440> comes<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:53.210> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
well the power cable comes out it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
well the power cable comes out it
actually<00:00:54.390> comes<00:00:54.809> through<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:57.230> underneath

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
actually comes through the underneath

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.130 
actually comes through the underneath
this<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.550> run<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.930> just

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
this and then is run up here this just

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.280 
this and then is run up here this just
kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> comes<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.680> sometimes<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:03.290> power

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
kind of comes out sometimes but power

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
kind of comes out sometimes but power
cable<00:01:04.619> comes<00:01:04.769> out<00:01:04.949> goes<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.210> through

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
cable comes out goes all the way through

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.609 
cable comes out goes all the way through
here<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.220> ran<00:01:08.400> into<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.850> fuse<00:01:09.180> box<00:01:09.619> you

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
here and it's ran into my fuse box you

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.240 
here and it's ran into my fuse box you
can<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.920> pick<00:01:11.070> any<00:01:11.250> fuse<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:13.250> usually

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
can just pick any fuse that is usually

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.370 
can just pick any fuse that is usually
12<00:01:14.850> volts<00:01:15.240> which<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.840> most<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.200> are

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
12 volts which I think most of them are

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.999 
12 volts which I think most of them are
so<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.780> pull<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> fuse<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.680> stick

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so you just pull the fuse out and stick

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.230 
so you just pull the fuse out and stick
the<00:01:20.189> power<00:01:20.400> cable<00:01:20.729> through<00:01:20.880> there

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the power cable through there

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.289 
the power cable through there
you<00:01:21.720> take<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.170> ground<00:01:22.920> cable<00:01:23.280> from<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> CB

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you take the ground cable from the CB

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
you take the ground cable from the CB
radio<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.750> well<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.409> find<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> grounding

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
radio as well and you find the grounding

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.399 
radio as well and you find the grounding
point<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.939> doesn't<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.299> matter<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:28.320> as

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
point it doesn't really matter just as

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.670 
point it doesn't really matter just as
long<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.890> touching<00:01:29.220> metal<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.790> your

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
long as it's touching metal on your

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.270 
long as it's touching metal on your
vehicle<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> coax<00:01:33.750> no<00:01:34.409> yeah<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> do

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
vehicle so for the coax no yeah I do

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.100 
vehicle so for the coax no yeah I do
have<00:01:35.400> coax<00:01:35.790> coming<00:01:36.090> through<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.930> is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
have coax coming through here this is

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.940 
have coax coming through here this is
the<00:01:37.200> coax<00:01:37.500> cable

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the coax cable

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
the coax cable
it's<00:01:38.340> supposed<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.729> stuck<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.450> more

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
it's supposed to be stuck up there more

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's supposed to be stuck up there more
-<00:01:40.220> it's<00:01:41.220> run<00:01:42.020> into<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.829> little<00:01:44.040> side<00:01:44.430> panel

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
- it's run into this little side panel

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.590 
- it's run into this little side panel
comes<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.130> runs<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> way<00:01:47.579> down<00:01:47.670> comes

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
comes out runs all the way down comes

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.760 
comes out runs all the way down comes
out<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.259> bit<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.619> cuz<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
out right here a little bit just cuz I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.660 
out right here a little bit just cuz I
don't<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.009> anywhere<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> put<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
don't have anywhere to put it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.920 
don't have anywhere to put it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.440 

runs<00:01:59.930> all<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.170> way<00:02:00.289> through<00:02:00.590> here<00:02:01.180> up<00:02:02.180> and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
runs all the way through here up and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.999 
runs all the way through here up and
then<00:02:02.719> that<00:02:03.049> comes<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:03.409> right<00:02:03.530> here<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.799> little

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
then that comes out right here a little

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.090 
then that comes out right here a little
bit<00:02:04.100> too<00:02:04.280> as<00:02:04.700> well<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:06.170> because<00:02:06.860> there's

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
bit too as well just because there's

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.960 
bit too as well just because there's
really<00:02:07.219> nowhere<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.610> run<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.300> then<00:02:11.560> see

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
really nowhere to run that and then see

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.259 
really nowhere to run that and then see
come<00:02:13.970> down<00:02:14.540> through<00:02:14.780> here<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.970> runs<00:02:16.970> all<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
come down through here and runs all the

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.559 
come down through here and runs all the
way<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.540> back<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.819> coiled<00:02:23.480> up

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
way to the back and it is coiled up

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.650 
way to the back and it is coiled up
inside<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.799> panel<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.000> inside<00:02:26.450> in

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
inside of the panel on the inside in

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.050 
inside of the panel on the inside in
here<00:02:26.959> it's<00:02:27.890> all<00:02:27.980> coiled<00:02:28.220> up<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.549> there<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
here it's all coiled up in there for the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.690 
here it's all coiled up in there for the
XS<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:30.819> coax<00:02:31.819> comes<00:02:32.120> out<00:02:32.390> right<00:02:32.989> here<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.280> is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
XS the coax comes out right here and is

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.780 
XS the coax comes out right here and is
ran<00:02:34.880> up<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.269> CB<00:02:35.599> antenna<00:02:36.579> this<00:02:37.579> is<00:02:37.760> a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
ran up to the CB antenna this is a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.910 
ran up to the CB antenna this is a
mirror<00:02:38.450> mount<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.410> mountain<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.799> little

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
mirror mount the mountain is a little

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.410 
mirror mount the mountain is a little
plastic<00:02:40.190> piece<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.730> actually<00:02:40.910> lost<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
plastic piece I actually lost the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.890 
plastic piece I actually lost the
plastic<00:02:41.810> piece<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.079> I<00:02:42.140> made<00:02:42.319> my<00:02:42.470> own<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.690> this

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
plastic piece so I made my own so this

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.240 
plastic piece so I made my own so this
will<00:02:45.049> be<00:02:45.140> like<00:02:45.319> white<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.769> it'll<00:02:45.950> be<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> lot

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
will be like white and it'll be a lot

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.660 
will be like white and it'll be a lot
smaller<00:02:46.459> but<00:02:47.799> so<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.190> mirror<00:02:49.430> mount

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
smaller but so this is the mirror mount

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.600 
smaller but so this is the mirror mount
right<00:02:49.819> here<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.930> little<00:02:51.140> metal<00:02:51.500> piece<00:02:51.739> is

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
right here this little metal piece is

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.400 
right here this little metal piece is
something<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.239> made<00:02:53.510> myself<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:54.200> you

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
something that I made myself to you

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.289 
something that I made myself to you
mount<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:56.569> just<00:02:56.980> took<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.040> piece<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.370> aluminum

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
mount it I just took a piece of aluminum

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.660 
mount it I just took a piece of aluminum
Maiden<00:02:59.690> L<00:02:59.840> bracket<00:03:00.230> screwed<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.620> all<00:03:00.709> in<00:03:00.890> put

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
Maiden L bracket screwed it all in put

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.819 
Maiden L bracket screwed it all in put
two<00:03:01.819> screws<00:03:02.090> through<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:05.209> frame<00:03:05.840> or<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.290> body

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
two screws through the frame or the body

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.129 
two screws through the frame or the body
and<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.700> also<00:03:07.940> Jamie<00:03:08.420> welded<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.870> in<00:03:08.989> there

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
and I also Jamie welded it in there

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.449 
and I also Jamie welded it in there
because<00:03:09.230> he<00:03:09.350> was<00:03:09.500> wiggling<00:03:09.680> around<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.160> lot<00:03:10.310> and

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
because he was wiggling around a lot and

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.240 
because he was wiggling around a lot and
the<00:03:10.549> screws<00:03:10.760> would<00:03:10.880> come<00:03:11.030> on<00:03:11.060> Lynn<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:12.319> this<00:03:13.040> is

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
the screws would come on Lynn so this is

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.400 
the screws would come on Lynn so this is
a<00:03:13.489> Radio<00:03:14.420> Shack<00:03:14.480> antenna<00:03:15.639> for<00:03:16.639> feet<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.389> it<00:03:18.290> is

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
a Radio Shack antenna for feet and it is

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.780 
a Radio Shack antenna for feet and it is
adjustable<00:03:18.920> make<00:03:19.310> sure<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.549> get<00:03:19.670> an

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
adjustable make sure you get an

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.640 
adjustable make sure you get an
adjustable<00:03:20.180> antenna<00:03:20.799> they<00:03:21.799> helped<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.040> lot<00:03:22.280> I

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
adjustable antenna they helped a lot I

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.870 
adjustable antenna they helped a lot I
don't<00:03:24.650> really<00:03:24.829> know<00:03:24.980> how<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.220> set<00:03:25.489> up<00:03:25.519> an<00:03:25.700> into

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
don't really know how to set up an into

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.819 
don't really know how to set up an into
no<00:03:25.970> that's<00:03:26.180> not<00:03:26.299> adjustable<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:28.480> ya<00:03:29.480> hold<00:03:30.139> just

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
no that's not adjustable so ya hold just

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.440 
no that's not adjustable so ya hold just
go<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:32.030> front<00:03:32.389> again<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.970> will<00:03:35.150> show

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
go to the front again and I will show

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.449 
go to the front again and I will show
you

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
you

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.000 
you
so<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.609> CB<00:03:37.910> only<00:03:38.150> turns<00:03:38.389> on<00:03:38.600> whenever<00:03:38.989> I<00:03:39.079> turn

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
so the CB only turns on whenever I turn

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.260 
so the CB only turns on whenever I turn
my<00:03:40.130> car<00:03:40.280> around

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.570 

so<00:03:45.270> there<00:03:45.420> we<00:03:45.510> go

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:56.090 

turn<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.360> CB<00:03:54.319> look<00:03:55.319> at<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.680> signal

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
turn on the CB look at a lot of signal

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.550 
turn on the CB look at a lot of signal
out<00:03:56.250> here<00:03:56.840> just<00:03:57.840> because<00:03:57.990> I'm<00:03:58.170> kind<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.410> in<00:03:58.530> the

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
your CB radio you can usually go to a

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.480 
your CB radio you can usually go to a
truck<00:04:27.470> stop<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:27.949> can<00:04:28.100> get<00:04:28.190> one<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.340> these
