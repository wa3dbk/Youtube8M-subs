00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone today we will have 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.140
 New Year's package unpacking 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.120
 which came to me from china package with 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.469
 one very interesting knife in the whole 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.259
 category 80 dollars 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.240
 this knife is here for a reason 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.020
 in that inside this box is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.640
 its copy of cheap chinese and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 actually you will see a comparison with 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 bottom I generally plan to say let's say 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
 so comparison on all fronts that is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.490
 this first will be a visual comparison 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.929
 and technical secondly it will be 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.520
 comparison is functional that is 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.820
 try something to tell you these 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.500
 knives well and actually the box hope 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.399
 that this knife is sitting there and first 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.710
 I would like to turn in this 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.969
 make sure 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 to those people who ask me a question 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.739
 as to why I am so rare 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.020
 began to upload videos of such people 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.809
 by the way a little 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.480
 here I am still inside answer to that is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.789
 three reasons first reason she 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.699
 is that I already get 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.890
 eight days or nine days as more than 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.610
 given seriously with a voice that is and here 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.000
 only now more or less began to speak 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.689
 here and this is my best sound for these days 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.619
 your family second reason is 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.299
 the fact that my home was quite noisy 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.640
 and this can not be avoided almost nothing 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.560
 probably recorded from the fifth attempt review 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.770
 single knife called becker 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.460
 like that igloo I doubt it worth it 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.150
 lay out 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.350
 because mutants periodically say 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.350
 so there are extraneous sounds 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.080
 there is another reason not really 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.880
 some some degree 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.290
 fell enthusiasm is due it mostly with 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.600
 so that the package came 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.860
 marry christmas apparently the Chinese know already 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.880
 will be on time delivery 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.400
 so they immediately decided that it would be on 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.970
 flight but can but so here is christmas i'm 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.970
 your food. 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.290
 package that is a little dropped enthusiasm 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.590
 regarding my video channel connected 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.360
 that's basically what the thing is that those 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.400
 videos that I really spend my 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.160
 forces and over which I try 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.750
 and I work they gain very little 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.790
 views 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.790
 but the video in which I do not know there 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.620
 the titles have evil anboxing they are gaining 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.900
 immediately there are two three thousand views for 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.570
 short term time that is there for 23 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.130
 of the day and honestly it is not a little bit 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.620
 understandable because over this video I 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.820
 literally don't hit fingers let's finger 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.260
 let's check the experiments 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.140
 let's see how much actually 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.580
 pick up this video in two or three days with 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.269
 New year boxing title 2 mainly 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.690
 such reasons 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.440
 but really under which we 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.260
 agreed 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.970
 and let's not compare to 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.680
 original well 1 flip 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.840
 I first have them clean so visually 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.890
 I can say what a feeling that so 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:13.130
 slightly heavier wedge is exactly 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:17.360
 To the center this knife is very similar in thickness. 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:21.019
 really at all you node and I see by 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.730
 it's hard for me to say it 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.040
 Now I think that anyway you need 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.080
 will take a look over 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.930
 in detail 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.580
 in terms of lining she processed 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.730
 absolutely exactly the same here in this 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.680
 area thickness of the blade at first glance 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.670
 identical really knives are very 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.620
 similar here at first sight he even 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.770
 the clip is very similar there is a difference in 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.050
 screws flipout knife original here 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.270
 way here is bearing now 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.220
 Well, let's say so long ago did not contact but 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.620
 the less flip here is very good me 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.780
 begins let's try how to lead 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.890
 yourself chinese up to your own that's for sure 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.800
 also a bit like that rough move 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.740
 there is a knife you need to rinse lubricate the backlash 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:11.810
 no, that is very good 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.990
 blade shape let's see it 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.910
 actually say the same thing 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.540
 a little more clearly this face 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.300
 descent i mean let me show such 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.940
 that's the way 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.590
 a little bit she stands out more vividly here 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.990
 us 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.750
 grease factory written spider mow 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.070
 from 204 n I doubt that from here 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.970
 left well in general 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.590
 what the hell is not joking down on the first 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.430
 look thicker we need to measure but 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.130
 at least 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.380
 carts immediately see that it is not a robot with this 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.980
 parties at least here at first 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.090
 sight 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.240
 the feed seems wider than the other 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.350
 to the side 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.880
 blade processing is so exact 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:03.290
 nice stonewash otherwise everything too 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.360
 very well yes absolutely the same yes 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.169
 there is obtained a slight difference 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.490
 blade dimensions of the original well, a little bit 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.289
 for it a little bit slightly 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.940
 such here are two knives one of them is worth 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.960
 remind there the area of ​​two hundred and three hundred 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.360
 250 bucks is the cheapest thing I saw in 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.419
 Russia for sale 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.650
 8 9 thousand rubles this I bought for 78 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.539
 dollars with delivery 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.330
 at the same time his company delivered me 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.740
 Sdek so-called and here since u 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.610
 I have time I literally have a couple of words 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.979
 they will tell 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.030
 the fact is that this office, let's say 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.650
 it is slightly better than the same m s but in 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.300
 principle is not much better that is 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.400
 it's serious enough too 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.900
 hat if you do not want extra there 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.500
 the hassle then it seems to me better not 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.870
 to contact 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.699
 I'm probably still on the second channel already 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.110
 when I have a voice I will write down the video 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:58.099
 just so you are short with your 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.199
 recall working this company think that 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.849
 many will be interesting and useful here 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.710
 such a pre-Christmas video if I have time 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.729
 get well then I promise to congratulate you 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.610
 separately happy new year 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.039
