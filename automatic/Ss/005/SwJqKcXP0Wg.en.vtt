 cheaper and more democratic I built sedatives 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.789
 but they are also present in the day to day 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.749
 is exactly that consumerism is seen on television in the outside media and 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.079
 activations is very much in the 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.780

 the recorder the message you're sending is one of the ways to insure 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.420
 this confrontation 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.799
 in the message you are going to pass is what we believe communication 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.439
 Modernity relies on three large groups

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.440
 how to solve a day d we restore it or help aids in the world at best 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.950
 possible place the least possible time with at least three possible I missed the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.049
 device utility 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.700
 or you go pro side of entertainment you will pay a surety territory 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.760
 it will deliver 3 consumer content entertainment 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.130
 that has to do with the area of ​​action of markit in a bank for example speak 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.759
 of financial rating 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.209
 makes more success 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 uses the internet to talk 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.200
 how depends on what each brand that is 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.940
 as if it were a function on the internet and today there are some families that you 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.050
 go adopt is that you will have many people seeing the one who is the darling 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.340
 access worten to the part that you have placed a large portal this is not the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.429
 more difficult to achieve today the residual contact 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:03.049
 after the game on the internet is not a game made worms and appears generally 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.979
 generate a very large impact if commented and thereafter 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:07.450
 to empty 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.900
 what we try to hire the fies on the internet is something that is getting the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.060
 that you make investments by the sector in the cotton pond 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.699
 but beats walking alone by the navy itself 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:22.419
 To do this, it must be consistent with the scope of these surgeries. 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.030
 facials 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.340
 the ball bonbons of the time is the school of the people with that mark can take advantage 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.660
 of these social networks the notes exchanged between the beginning of the mandate by decision 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.900
 of the series c if they want to dialogue or 8% 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.939
 no use for old and special maps is an extension of a plan 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.659
 with a marketing plan you have one more strategic line 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.709
 I jest that social networks are so step that the precedent of the company has 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.589
 do not owe marketing because this affects the whole process within 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:55.579
 of the company as the consumer reacts with the level of transparency 67 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.829
 or social media is a common process is not a short-term thing 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.619
 is it easy for you to do what the treatment may entail next week jokes 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.650
 internal traffic will be remembered 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.970
 a consistent work a depression just like with ps as hotel 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.850
 work is to change the future of the peace process between the different 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.919
 brands 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.449
 before that 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.709
 It's the Brazilian propaganda. 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.160
 it is already working on the internet with the due value it deserves in. 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.710
 of planning 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.710
 depends on seven months that was formed by Chávez in sectors such as the sector 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.990
 financial sector highlighted 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.860
 the athlete of the result of the excellent work 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.719
 it is harder to realize that it is very outdated overall if you can get date 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:41.880
 vetoed inter-media of iab exists a gap people made a prisoner in triumph 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.949
 incarnated by brazilian publicist 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.090
 for digital 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.710
 river - pissus connected in police custody said that I only grew up 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.130
 this is a geometric progression three sets to two digits of the nba in the 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.710
 sized agencies there is a spicy flavor that there was 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.050
 every test faster but I think everyone tastes communication 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.120
 communication business applied in vein ae 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 the crazed draw that this past Friday 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:15.469
 Look, I think this is the challenge of 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:19.669
 is it he goes into the edict and listen that I must open those who work in 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.110
 several different agencies 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.310
 not only here but out there offensive word that do not try to avoid the worst 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.400
 the portfolio has some digital is actually a concern with 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.710
 this makes it possible to make way faster with the slowest lap time 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.930
 Let's talk more I asked for this revolution that he's going to bring to market. 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.979
 I was seeing how clean it is. 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.189
 the global stock market is the legal team that is nothing 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.189
 on the offensive 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.639
 potential it will have to fork out a number of means of victimizing 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.490
 malnutrition the government of rondônia explains 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.490
 there were year cases 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.290
 the right and even bigger than the iphone and turkey the decision of the screen and the 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.500
 afternoon shoes 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.950
 brings deep that you had no notion of such as comfort 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.500
 and the media consumption has many people saying there is then asks the positive of 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.050
 media consumption is an electronic book 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.099
 a video player is much more than that who is able to become a 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.819
 fever in Brazil as well as the United States or do you think it grows 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:18.550
 still go 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.099
 make it appropriate in your favor like estonia in brazil 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.629
 is a niche product in this government and sectors that grow in Brazil compared 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:26.979
 with the salary of Brazil 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.129
 it's too small so I wait lose in Brazil I think he'll have a 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:33.770
 reach with the iphone had a footprint in the sector dynamics j 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.080
 another subject to early prescription 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.080
 more recessed
