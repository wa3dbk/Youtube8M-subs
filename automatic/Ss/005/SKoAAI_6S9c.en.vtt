00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.970
 media not really 8.0 I want 2.0 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.280
 simply because you are fast all and 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.320
 it's pretty huge for a laptop to be 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.590
 proud to add a phone so that's it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.940
 it's a life phone pose so 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.980
 is uncertain and it will not pay for 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.750
 other dances between blake or rate 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.260
 way to drink well entry 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.080
 since a median processor huawei quad 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.829
 core clocked at 2.6 GHz accompanied 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.850
 in giga of ram 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.550
 Yukos 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.129
 Yes 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.829
 a little moreover actually lives in fact 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.449
 rather good 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.519
 for the camera then the camera 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.649
 rear photo it's a camera of 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.579
 5 mega pixels the front camera 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.670
 term basic camera 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.880
 this one not for what it is 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090
 the communities 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.079
 so we have 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.449
 I know it 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.370
 cattier so that's a phone 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.379
 mobile 4g ​​so it was very nice 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 to get on the internet that starts 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.950
 to make calls like mans 6 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.450
 because she gives birth to software 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.490
 we installed in it we will check that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.490
 right away without it eliminates 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.130
 it's the jelly bean 4.2 so that's 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 hope anyway maybe a bet to 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.990
 day around 80 points to 4.4 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.990

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.040
 bush 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.159
 the 2.0 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.700
 go on 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.700
 it's an overlay game 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.290
 not have application launcher 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.180
 did not have on the dock that gathers 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980
 installed applications 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.930
 a kind of drawer we see everything that 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.000
 is shared you really have everything on 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.440
 the home screen 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.250
 the downloaded app installs itself 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.170
 directly on convicts 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.100
 in any case it's nice is that 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.400

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.990

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.260
 completely he did come back like that 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.570

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.950
 normally bawa he coded for taton at 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.569
 time 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.459
