one<00:02:09.710> question<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.310> year<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.840> what<00:02:11.840> happens

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
one question of the year is what happens

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.020 
one question of the year is what happens
when<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.470> battery<00:02:12.620> depletes<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.790> course

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
when the battery depletes and of course

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.240 
when the battery depletes and of course
the<00:02:14.180> answer<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.990> generator<00:02:15.440> comes<00:02:15.770> on<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
the answer is the generator comes on and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.330 
the answer is the generator comes on and
you<00:02:16.550> keep<00:02:16.700> driving<00:02:16.990> as<00:02:17.990> far<00:02:18.319> as<00:02:18.440> my<00:02:18.560> fuel<00:02:18.890> costs

one<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.260> benefits<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.830> having<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.370> heavy

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
one of the benefits of having a heavy

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.240 
one of the benefits of having a heavy
battery<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.050> car<00:02:43.290> has<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> low<00:02:43.770> center<00:02:44.220> of

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
battery is the car has a low center of

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.690 
battery is the car has a low center of
gravity<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.060> takes<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.450> turns<00:02:45.720> very<00:02:46.080> well

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
gravity so it takes the turns very well

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:57.200 
gravity so it takes the turns very well
it<00:02:47.700> really<00:02:48.060> grips<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.480> road<00:02:55.940> also<00:02:56.940> it

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
it really grips the road also it

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:08.770 
it really grips the road also it
accelerates<00:02:57.780> off<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.200> line<00:02:58.380> very<00:02:58.710> fast

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.240 

one<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.960> things<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.410> enjoyed<00:03:10.800> during<00:03:11.040> the

one of the things I enjoyed during the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.420 
one of the things I enjoyed during the
year<00:03:11.580> was<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.660> massive<00:03:13.440> hard<00:03:13.740> drive<00:03:14.070> way<00:03:14.310> it

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
year was this massive hard drive way it

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.280 
year was this massive hard drive way it
could<00:03:14.550> store<00:03:14.880> up<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.240> about<00:03:15.360> ten<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.870> eleven

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
could store up to about ten to eleven

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.250 
could store up to about ten to eleven
thousand<00:03:16.830> songs<00:03:17.040> into<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.820> got<00:03:18.240> almost<00:03:18.450> 1500

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
in here also I found myself pausing and

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.910 
in here also I found myself pausing and
rewinding<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:23.010> live<00:03:23.220> radio<00:03:23.640> or<00:03:24.510> XM<00:03:25.050> which<00:03:25.770> is

rewinding the live radio or XM which is
a<00:03:25.950> great<00:03:26.250> feature<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:26.940> don't<00:03:26.970> normally

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
a great feature that you don't normally

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
see within the first few weeks of

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.860 
see within the first few weeks of
getting<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.820> car<00:03:30.000> many<00:03:30.300> people<00:03:30.600> are<00:03:30.750> asking

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
getting the car many people are asking

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.780 
getting the car many people are asking
me<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.410> an<00:03:31.500> electric<00:03:31.950> car<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.550> the

me is that an electric car is that the
new<00:03:33.090> hybrid<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.380> decided<00:03:34.710> to<00:03:34.800> get<00:03:34.890> this

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
new hybrid so I decided to get this

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.100 
new hybrid so I decided to get this

sticker extended range electric vehicle
or<00:03:37.290> ear<00:03:37.560> F<00:03:38.030> because<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.060> drives<00:03:39.480> most<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.080> the

time<00:03:40.440> in<00:03:40.740> electric<00:03:41.370> mode<00:03:41.640> like<00:03:42.360> an<00:03:42.660> Eevee<00:03:43.290> I

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
time in electric mode like an Eevee I

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.100 
time in electric mode like an Eevee I
liked<00:03:44.370> how<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.610> Volt<00:03:44.970> handled<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.780> snow

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
liked how the Volt handled in the snow

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.410 
liked how the Volt handled in the snow
during<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.620> past<00:03:46.920> winter<00:03:47.150> probably<00:03:48.150> because

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
during this past winter probably because

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.450 
during this past winter probably because
it<00:03:48.570> does<00:03:48.750> have<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.050> 400-pound<00:03:49.680> battery<00:03:50.100> running

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460

it does have a 400-pound battery running
through<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.790> also<00:03:51.710> what<00:03:52.710> was<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> great

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
through it also what was a great

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
surprise was the enjoyment of driving

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.870 
surprise was the enjoyment of driving
with<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.470> one<00:03:55.710> pedal<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.280> one<00:03:56.460> pedal

driving field when you have an L regen
mode<00:03:59.550> is<00:03:59.850> a<00:04:00.420> great<00:04:00.750> thing<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.050> experience<00:04:01.440> as

does that really get a hundred miles per
gallon<00:05:16.730> and<00:05:16.940> my<00:05:17.030> answer<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.450> no<00:05:17.660> mind<00:05:18.080> it's<00:05:18.290> 300

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.680 
gallon and my answer is no mind it's 300
miles<00:05:18.890> per<00:05:19.070> gallon<00:05:19.490> but<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:20.030> average<00:05:20.180> volt

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
miles per gallon but the average volt

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.690 
miles per gallon but the average volt

sixteen kilowatts in the battery itself

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.100 
sixteen kilowatts in the battery itself
now<00:06:00.410> you<00:06:00.470> can't<00:06:00.980> overcharge<00:06:01.910> it<00:06:02.090> above<00:06:02.720> 80%

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
now you can't overcharge it above 80%

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.530 
now you can't overcharge it above 80%
and<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:03.740> charge<00:06:04.340> level<00:06:04.640> won't<00:06:04.970> drop<00:06:05.300> below

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
and the charge level won't drop below

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.130 
and the charge level won't drop below
much<00:06:06.110> below<00:06:06.440> 30%<00:06:07.220> so<00:06:08.090> after<00:06:08.660> about<00:06:08.900> eight

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
much below 30% so after about eight

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.200 
much below 30% so after about eight
years<00:06:09.350> 100,000<00:06:10.100> miles<00:06:10.250> you<00:06:10.640> should<00:06:10.820> expect

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
years 100,000 miles you should expect

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.020 
years 100,000 miles you should expect
that<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.450> battery<00:06:11.870> will<00:06:12.770> lose<00:06:13.010> about<00:06:13.430> 10<00:06:13.790> to

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
that the battery will lose about 10 to

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.170 
that the battery will lose about 10 to
30%<00:06:14.360> of<00:06:14.870> its<00:06:15.050> capacity<00:06:15.430> now<00:06:16.430> if<00:06:16.669> the<00:06:16.970> average

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
30% of its capacity now if the average

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.480 
30% of its capacity now if the average

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
range now in eight years if they have

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
the full 30% capacity loss they're only

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.250 
the full 30% capacity loss they're only
looking<00:06:25.820> at<00:06:26.210> you<00:06:26.419> know<00:06:26.510> twenty<00:06:26.900> eight<00:06:27.020> mile

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
looking at you know twenty eight mile

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.980 
looking at you know twenty eight mile
battery<00:06:27.710> range<00:06:28.010> so<00:06:28.880> why<00:06:29.090> anyone<00:06:29.450> would<00:06:29.780> ever

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
battery range so why anyone would ever

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.659 
battery range so why anyone would ever
even<00:06:30.169> think<00:06:30.530> of<00:06:30.650> replacing<00:06:30.770> the<00:06:31.280> battery

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
even think of replacing the battery

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.780 
even think of replacing the battery
after<00:06:32.660> five<00:06:32.900> ten<00:06:33.350> years<00:06:33.380> it<00:06:34.310> makes<00:06:34.520> no<00:06:34.760> sense

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
after five ten years it makes no sense

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.390 
after five ten years it makes no sense
so<00:06:35.780> even<00:06:36.169> if<00:06:36.260> you<00:06:36.410> only<00:06:36.560> get<00:06:36.830> twenty<00:06:37.280> eight

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
so even if you only get twenty eight

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.550 
so even if you only get twenty eight
miles<00:06:37.610> evey<00:06:38.030> range<00:06:38.330> eight<00:06:38.750> to<00:06:39.020> ten<00:06:39.200> years<00:06:39.410> from

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
miles evey range eight to ten years from

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.460 
miles evey range eight to ten years from
now<00:06:39.650> that's<00:06:40.250> still<00:06:40.610> double<00:06:41.510> what<00:06:41.780> a<00:06:41.810> brand<00:06:42.229> new

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470
