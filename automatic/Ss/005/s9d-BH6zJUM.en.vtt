I currently though looking at the cache
of<00:03:27.030> these<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.330> looks<00:03:27.420> like<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.750> Russians<00:03:27.930> have

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
of these it looks like the Russians have

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.680 
of these it looks like the Russians have
taken<00:03:28.230> more<00:03:28.620> than<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.830> pulse<00:03:29.210> judging<00:03:30.210> by<00:03:30.630> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
taken more than the pulse judging by the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.710 
taken more than the pulse judging by the
amount<00:03:30.960> of<00:03:31.020> yellow<00:03:31.440> here<00:03:31.800> versus<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.280> red

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
amount of yellow here versus the red

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.080

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
ultimately now red versus the yellow the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.670 
ultimately now red versus the yellow the
polls<00:03:36.270> are<00:03:36.420> also<00:03:36.570> more<00:03:36.870> centered<00:03:37.290> here<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.590> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
polls are also more centered here in the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.950 
polls are also more centered here in the
center<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:39.060> looks<00:03:39.240> like<00:03:39.360> they<00:03:39.510> have<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> more

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
center it looks like they have a more

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.710 
center it looks like they have a more
stable<00:03:40.260> battle<00:03:41.250> group<00:03:41.400> going<00:03:41.730> at<00:03:41.820> it<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.090> the

the<00:03:51.330> battle<00:03:51.540> isn't<00:03:51.690> over<00:03:51.930> yet<00:03:52.020> I'd<00:03:52.200> say<00:03:52.410> it's

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
the battle isn't over yet I'd say it's

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.070 
the battle isn't over yet I'd say it's
around<00:03:52.670> 6040<00:03:53.670> right<00:03:53.850> now<00:03:53.970> for<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.210> pulse<00:03:54.450> so

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
around 6040 right now for the pulse so

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.780 
around 6040 right now for the pulse so
the<00:03:55.260> Polish<00:03:55.470> troops<00:03:55.770> might<00:03:56.220> as<00:03:56.400> well<00:03:56.520> bring

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the Polish troops might as well bring

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:27.450 
the Polish troops might as well bring
this<00:03:57.000> home

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.520 

the<00:04:28.000> Russians<00:04:28.479> have<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:28.840> fortified<00:04:29.320> this

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
the Russians have that fortified this

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.680 
the Russians have that fortified this
bit<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.889> house<00:04:30.040> here<00:04:30.340> they<00:04:30.639> were<00:04:30.699> that<00:04:31.600> guy

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
bit of the house here they were that guy

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.490 
bit of the house here they were that guy
got<00:04:31.840> hidden<00:04:31.990> heart<00:04:34.020> it's<00:04:35.020> cuz<00:04:35.169> you're<00:04:35.290> moving

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
got hidden heart it's cuz you're moving

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.140 
got hidden heart it's cuz you're moving
up<00:04:35.560> slowly<00:04:35.919> covering<00:04:36.639> each<00:04:36.759> other<00:04:36.940> it's

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
up slowly covering each other it's

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.350 
up slowly covering each other it's
pretty<00:04:37.750> cool<00:04:37.960> like<00:04:38.229> saying<00:04:39.030> he's<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.210> trying

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
pretty cool like saying he's just trying

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.640 
pretty cool like saying he's just trying
to<00:04:40.389> shoot<00:04:40.570> him<00:04:40.690> like<00:04:40.870> shooting<00:04:41.259> fish<00:04:41.440> in<00:04:41.470> a

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
to shoot him like shooting fish in a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.219 
to shoot him like shooting fish in a
pond<00:04:45.180> there's<00:04:46.180> still<00:04:46.389> a<00:04:46.419> lot<00:04:46.600> of<00:04:46.630> lot<00:04:47.110> of

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
pond there's still a lot of lot of

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.300 
pond there's still a lot of lot of
Russians<00:04:47.470> around<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:47.710> building<00:04:47.949> over<00:04:48.190> on

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
Russians around this building over on

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.820 
Russians around this building over on
the<00:04:48.460> other<00:04:48.490> side<00:04:48.729> of<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.880> road<00:04:49.169> we<00:04:50.169> have<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.650> lot

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
the other side of the road we have a lot

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.529 
the other side of the road we have a lot
of<00:04:50.860> Russians<00:04:51.190> pinned<00:04:51.490> down<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:52.030> polls<00:04:52.360> are

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
of Russians pinned down the polls are

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.540 
of Russians pinned down the polls are
getting<00:04:52.810> closer<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.139> closer<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.740> night<00:04:53.860> they

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
getting closer and closer and night they

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.710 
getting closer and closer and night they
could<00:04:54.699> safe<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.060> say<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.300> they've<00:04:55.419> captured

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
could safe to say that they've captured

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.420 
could safe to say that they've captured
the<00:04:55.960> city<00:04:56.169> center<00:04:56.470> by<00:04:56.590> now<00:04:59.160> obviously<00:05:00.160> this

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
the city center by now obviously this

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.180 
the city center by now obviously this
map<00:05:00.669> is<00:05:00.850> not<00:05:01.060> symmetric<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:02.410> it'll<00:05:02.800> have<00:05:03.010> an

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
map is not symmetric so it'll have an

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.779 
map is not symmetric so it'll have an
impact<00:05:03.280> on<00:05:03.699> how<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:05.350> units<00:05:05.650> will<00:05:05.860> will<00:05:06.220> work

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
impact on how the units will will work

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.170 
impact on how the units will will work
and<00:05:07.090> how<00:05:07.210> how<00:05:07.810> much<00:05:08.380> or<00:05:08.680> little<00:05:09.669> of<00:05:10.030> an

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
and how how much or little of an

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.330 
and how how much or little of an
advantage<00:05:10.449> they<00:05:10.810> will<00:05:10.960> have<00:05:11.139> so<00:05:11.889> we<00:05:11.979> see<00:05:12.100> the

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
advantage they will have so we see the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.689 
advantage they will have so we see the
polls<00:05:12.550> going<00:05:12.850> up<00:05:13.000> against<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.419> Russians<00:05:13.870> here

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
polls going up against the Russians here

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.560 
polls going up against the Russians here
it's<00:05:15.699> going<00:05:15.789> to<00:05:15.850> turn<00:05:16.000> on<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.210> corner<00:05:16.479> there

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
it's going to turn on the corner there

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.610 
it's going to turn on the corner there
so<00:05:19.570> I'd<00:05:19.630> say<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.900> Russians<00:05:20.169> are<00:05:20.260> in<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.380> fairly

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
so I'd say the Russians are in a fairly

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.020 
so I'd say the Russians are in a fairly
good<00:05:20.710> position<00:05:21.099> right<00:05:21.250> now<00:05:21.280> this<00:05:21.550> wall<00:05:21.760> is<00:05:21.880> not

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
good position right now this wall is not

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.939 
good position right now this wall is not
going<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.240> be<00:05:22.300> penetrated<00:05:22.870> but<00:05:23.020> on<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.650> at<00:05:23.919> a

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
going to be penetrated but on it at a

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.100 
going to be penetrated but on it at a
distance<00:05:24.220> here<00:05:24.520> they're<00:05:24.699> getting<00:05:24.970> shot<00:05:25.180> out

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
distance here they're getting shot out

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.159 
distance here they're getting shot out
by<00:05:26.139> the<00:05:26.349> polls<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:26.979> they're<00:05:27.970> not<00:05:28.150> able<00:05:28.840> to

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
by the polls and they're not able to

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.370 
by the polls and they're not able to
really<00:05:29.410> respond<00:05:30.160> so<00:05:30.639> they're<00:05:30.930> bad<00:05:31.930> position

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
really respond so they're bad position

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:45.580 
really respond so they're bad position
here<00:05:32.669> forced<00:05:33.669> to<00:05:33.760> pull<00:05:33.970> back<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.180> bit

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.570 

kind<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.680> cool<00:05:46.830> idea<00:05:46.860> that<00:05:47.220> would<00:05:47.310> you<00:05:47.370> just

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
kind of a cool idea that would you just

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.040 
kind of a cool idea that would you just
do<00:05:47.669> like<00:05:47.819> a<00:05:47.879> king<00:05:48.120> of<00:05:48.240> hill<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.599> center<00:05:48.930> of<00:05:48.990> the

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
do like a king of hill and center of the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.409 
do like a king of hill and center of the
town<00:05:52.190> so<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.400> Russians<00:05:53.699> on<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:54.000> left<00:05:54.180> side<00:05:54.300> of

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
town so the Russians on the left side of

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.909 
town so the Russians on the left side of
the<00:05:54.479> road<00:05:54.599> from<00:05:54.990> this<00:05:55.289> point<00:05:55.560> of<00:05:55.680> view<00:05:55.710> or

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
the road from this point of view or

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.700 
the road from this point of view or
being<00:05:56.129> pushed<00:05:56.400> out<00:05:56.580> entirely<00:05:57.569> still<00:05:58.530> have<00:05:58.680> a

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
being pushed out entirely still have a

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.309 
being pushed out entirely still have a
couple<00:05:58.979> back<00:05:59.159> here<00:05:59.729> and<00:05:59.909> up<00:06:00.659> here

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
couple back here and up here

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.070 
couple back here and up here
but<00:06:02.220> in<00:06:02.340> general<00:06:02.610> it's<00:06:03.000> looking<00:06:03.389> pretty<00:06:03.690> grim

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
but in general it's looking pretty grim

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.260 
but in general it's looking pretty grim
I<00:06:04.349> say<00:06:05.280> that<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.520> polls<00:06:05.759> have<00:06:05.909> lost<00:06:06.090> about

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
I say that the polls have lost about

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.749 
I say that the polls have lost about
half<00:06:06.539> their<00:06:06.780> combat<00:06:07.169> force<00:06:07.440> by<00:06:07.800> now<00:06:07.949> let's<00:06:08.669> say

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
half their combat force by now let's say

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.279 
half their combat force by now let's say
there's<00:06:08.940> around<00:06:09.120> 50<00:06:09.569> dead<00:06:09.720> ones<00:06:09.930> right<00:06:10.110> here

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
there's around 50 dead ones right here

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.070 
there's around 50 dead ones right here
probably<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.550> little<00:06:11.699> less<00:06:11.909> I<00:06:12.120> go<00:06:12.690> as<00:06:12.810> far<00:06:12.960> and

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
probably a little less I go as far and

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.219 
probably a little less I go as far and
say<00:06:13.139> it's<00:06:13.229> around<00:06:14.270> 3035<00:06:15.270> we<00:06:15.840> could<00:06:16.050> count

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
say it's around 3035 we could count

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.050 
say it's around 3035 we could count
we're<00:06:16.530> not<00:06:16.680> gonna<00:06:16.800> count<00:06:17.039> the<00:06:17.580> Russians<00:06:17.909> had

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
we're not gonna count the Russians had

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.580 
we're not gonna count the Russians had
definitely<00:06:18.389> lost<00:06:18.780> at<00:06:18.930> least<00:06:19.110> twice<00:06:19.349> of<00:06:19.560> that

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
definitely lost at least twice of that

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.260 
definitely lost at least twice of that
amount<00:06:19.889> right<00:06:20.099> now<00:06:20.130> from<00:06:20.460> from<00:06:20.759> just<00:06:20.849> judging
