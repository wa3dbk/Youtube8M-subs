00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.910
 hi friends of gt5 i am strata i bring 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.769
 a boyfriend for the channel and we go with the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.210
 fifth video of today the truth is 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.279
 that we are that we throw the house by 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.960
 window with this new update and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.449
 that's how euphoric my character is 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.310
 I also find the truth is that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.130
 I had never uploaded five videos in a 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 day but good the truth is that good I 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.300
 I think there are many things to teach 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.550
 this new dlc and one of them is this 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.860
 that is a new way that they have taken 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.210
 for the races that this safe mode 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.760
 that many of you are going to like 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.399
 and it is a mode that is called without collision 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.719
 ok and good as its name suggests 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.670
 obviously, the collections are 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.110
 already totally prohibited in this mode 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.329
 as long as you use this mode 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.640
 as I say you see here without putting 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.070
 contact is good, as you see 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.379
 Well, using this mode, it's not 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.050
 let's be able to get our friends out of 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.430
 the track by hitting them or shoving 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.199
 the behind we will not be able to 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.670
 to do it is worth as you see here I am with 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.680
 same forever that I will leave your channel in the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.030
 description and good then the difference 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.100
 is that from now on the players 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.750
 they will appear then as you see there they are 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.000
 as transparent as if it were a 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.759
 hologram and well the truth is that it's 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.080
 very well focused from the point of 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.960
 view of people who like to play 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.610
 racing and winning the cleanly vouchers 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.580
 people who read one likes to play 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.810
 race and win the best running 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.090
 Well, I think it's probably going to 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.860
 like this new 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.649
 implementation that they have put into this 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.479
 tlc that the truth is that it is very good and 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.429
 Well, someday you want to play and 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.320
 push your friends and get them out of 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.330
 the other track because you can get 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.280
 the standard mode and you're going to go without 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.320
 problems but good as I tell you the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.330
 truth is that it's pretty good since 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.280
 good to many of you there will be 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.229
 I am sure that many or all 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.960
 once you are about to win 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.789
 a race catches you from the slipstream and how 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.400
 I say they take you off the track of the 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.020
 true 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.330
 a lot of anger that they do that to you especially 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.580
 when you're about to win that day 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.490
 a lot of anger but good thanks to 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.770
 this good idea that has had to face 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.479
 On the other hand, the truth is that I think 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.430
 very well that they have initiatives of this 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.890
 type to correct the dirty game and 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.260
 other then the truth that I see it quite 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.600
 well and good but I hope that also 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.480
 you liked it and it serves you 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.800
 help this good is neither a trick nor 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.780
 nothing is simply a small 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.400
 information that I give you and well then nothing 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.380
 friends, I hope you liked the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.390
