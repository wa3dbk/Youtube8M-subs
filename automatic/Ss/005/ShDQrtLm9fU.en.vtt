difficulty of it in the solving

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.639 
difficulty of it in the solving
challenge<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:46.050> way<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> works

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
challenge the way it works

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.690 
challenge the way it works
is<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.520> two<00:00:48.090> axes<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.690> rotation<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:49.700> non

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
is that two axes of rotation are non

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.729 
is that two axes of rotation are non
geared<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.480> free<00:00:54.140> but<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> third<00:00:55.530> one

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
geared they are free but the third one

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.479 
geared they are free but the third one
is<00:00:56.210> geared<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.590> turn<00:01:01.739> these<00:01:01.920> sides<00:01:02.219> by

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
is geared so you can turn these sides by

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.289 
is geared so you can turn these sides by
90-degree<00:01:03.180> angles<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.030> only<00:01:06.119> turn

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
90-degree angles but you can only turn

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.200 
90-degree angles but you can only turn
this<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:07.080> 180<00:01:07.799> degrees<00:01:11.030> puzzle<00:01:12.030> turns

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
this side by 180 degrees puzzle turns

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.649 
this side by 180 degrees puzzle turns
very<00:01:12.390> well<00:01:13.369> it's<00:01:14.369> extremely<00:01:14.640> smooth<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:17.659> it's

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
very well it's extremely smooth and it's

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
very well it's extremely smooth and it's
very<00:01:18.840> nice<00:01:24.380> if<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> notice<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> sticker

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
very nice if you notice the sticker

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.969 
very nice if you notice the sticker
colors<00:01:26.580> aren't<00:01:26.850> exactly<00:01:27.390> correct<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.829> that's

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
colors aren't exactly correct and that's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.609 
colors aren't exactly correct and that's
because<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> had<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> cut<00:01:30.360> from<00:01:30.540> orakau<00:01:31.140> sticker

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
because I had to cut from orakau sticker

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
because I had to cut from orakau sticker
sheet<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.070> order<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> sticker<00:01:33.570> colors

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sheet in order to get the sticker colors

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
sheet in order to get the sticker colors
but<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.680> still<00:01:34.890> tell<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> green

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
but you can still tell this is the green

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.920 
but you can still tell this is the green
side<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> blue<00:01:36.659> side<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
side and this is the blue side and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.100 
side and this is the blue side and
that's<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> matters

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
that's all that matters

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.770 
that's all that matters
now<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.439> puzzle<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.390> extremely<00:01:42.390> difficult

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
now this puzzle is extremely difficult

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.969 
now this puzzle is extremely difficult
to<00:01:43.110> solve<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.759> solved<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.270> once<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.979> will

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
to solve I have solved it once I will

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.609 
to solve I have solved it once I will
probably<00:01:47.189> never<00:01:47.430> scramble<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> again<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
probably never scramble it again it is

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.630 
probably never scramble it again it is
so<00:01:49.950> challenging<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.770> when<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> first<00:01:53.220> had<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
so challenging and when I first had the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.280 
so challenging and when I first had the
puzzle<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.149> when<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> was<00:01:54.540> first<00:01:54.780> trying<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.679 
puzzle and when I was first trying to
solve<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.649> after<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> mixed<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.670> found<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
solve it after I mixed it up I found it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.840 
solve it after I mixed it up I found it
to<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.840> extremely<00:01:58.729> excruciatingly<00:01:59.729> ly

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
to be extremely excruciatingly ly

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.170 
to be extremely excruciatingly ly
difficult<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.159> challenging<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.000> would

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
difficult it was so challenging I would

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.530 
difficult it was so challenging I would
always<00:02:03.420> mess<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.729> basically<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:06.030> very

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
always mess up and basically I was very

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.600 
always mess up and basically I was very
much<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> brink<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.530> looking<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.250> tips

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
much on the brink of looking up tips

becomes<00:02:37.200> much<00:02:37.830> easier<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.430> solve<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:39.120> still

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
becomes much easier to solve it's still

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.910 
becomes much easier to solve it's still
extremely<00:02:39.750> difficult<00:02:40.140> they<00:02:40.560> don't<00:02:40.680> get<00:02:40.800> me

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
extremely difficult they don't get me

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.140 
extremely difficult they don't get me
wrong<00:02:41.070> but<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.520> becomes<00:02:41.940> much<00:02:42.360> easier<00:02:45.770> in

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
wrong but it just becomes much easier in

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.520 
wrong but it just becomes much easier in

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.970 

but<00:03:15.330> yes<00:03:15.540> like<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.900> said<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.290> very<00:03:16.349> difficult

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
but yes like I said it's very difficult

to solve my method is about eleven or
ten<00:03:19.890> steps<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.330> ridiculous<00:03:22.190> if<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
ten steps and it's just ridiculous if I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.130 
ten steps and it's just ridiculous if I

puzzle it won't be for the far-off
future<00:03:27.299> because<00:03:27.870> my<00:03:28.379> method<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.769> still<00:03:29.010> rather

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
future because my method is still rather

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.699 
future because my method is still rather
inefficient<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.209> rather<00:03:31.110> difficult<00:03:31.470> to
