00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.440
 magi hi all guys what's up 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.760
 doing 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.760
 what the fuck is he doing but 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.869
 he was dancing I ca n't see any boys 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.660
 then it is difficult to create a video game 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.509
 bad these days also because 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.130
 only from the tutorial they give you for 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.989
 unity 3d 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.300
 who gets out of a more decent game than b 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 creeps but this parkour city game 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 really told the bottom of the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.390
 disgust certainly been an idiot who dances to 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.089
 here's a thing a guys premise you 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.519
 in this gameplay not in this video 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.309
 you will not see the at least you will not hear 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.499
 sound of this game because why not 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.190
 no they did not 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:07.620
 understood they did not make the sound then 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.930
 will start very well then you gay 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.710
 let's start immediately or what we have to do 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.710
 what do we have to do 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.910
 I'll get you immediately local even if not 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.490
 I passed the level 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.500
 obviously they were a shit I could 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.870
 already go to the next level 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.930
 very well we only have to 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.970
 click with the mouse button 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.220
 the key and the little man here does it all 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.220
 that is, you press a key and at least 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.840
 how sacred he clung 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.200
 great and also the textures in the meantime 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.720
 that there are no processors 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 look at the setting we should be 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:06.560
 a metropolitan city seems to say a 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:11.009
 design which is a shame for anyway 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.390
 for any person who has two hours e 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.040
 two eyes 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.040
 but let's go to the second city because 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.670
 shut up the crap 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.989
 Madonna 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.989
 what was a mistake there was an error 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.970
 this man jumps like my grandmother 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:36.870
 that is, all this does not make sense 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:40.410
 because I should always have been skipping 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.870
 so bad that it doesn't make sense either 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.280
 there you could do used quietly 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.560
 but no he must make jumps 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.700
 unbelievable no between two madonna palaces 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.440
 that third success 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:01.019
 look at what bank we give to visit another 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.780
 what the fuck this level totally 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.920
 disgust 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.590
 we finished the game practically 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.680
 guys that is not dead when he tunes 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.040
 who looks watch looks at him 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.470
 they watch the boys close this 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:26.609
 video about this milano that it was 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.130
 created by looking who talks to do 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.010
 this video game killed one 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.290
 person is costumino will have to be ashamed 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:40.280
 for the rest of his life to be 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.280
 this day from magi cola is all curly
