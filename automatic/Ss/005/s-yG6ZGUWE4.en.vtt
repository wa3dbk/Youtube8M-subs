00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.929 

here's<00:00:04.990> another<00:00:05.170> form<00:00:05.680> of<00:00:05.939> evaluating

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
here's another form of evaluating

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.509 
here's another form of evaluating
algebraic<00:00:07.479> expressions<00:00:08.290> now<00:00:08.530> here<00:00:09.250> we're<00:00:09.400> not

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:09.519 
algebraic expressions now here we're not

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.670 
algebraic expressions now here we're not
given<00:00:09.970> when<00:00:10.210> x<00:00:10.480> equals<00:00:10.750> something<00:00:11.230> or<00:00:11.500> when<00:00:11.650> a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
given when x equals something or when a

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.520 
given when x equals something or when a
variable<00:00:12.070> equals<00:00:12.670> something<00:00:12.910> but<00:00:13.810> we<00:00:14.290> have

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
variable equals something but we have

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.240 
variable equals something but we have
two<00:00:15.720> expressions<00:00:16.720> that<00:00:17.170> look<00:00:17.289> the<00:00:17.769> same<00:00:18.010> but

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
two expressions that look the same but

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.630 
two expressions that look the same but
that<00:00:18.430> are<00:00:18.550> completely<00:00:19.390> different<00:00:20.430> let's<00:00:21.430> look

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
that are completely different let's look

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.689 
that are completely different let's look
at<00:00:21.760> this<00:00:21.880> one<00:00:22.090> we<00:00:22.750> have<00:00:22.990> a<00:00:23.380> parentheses<00:00:24.340> around

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
at this one we have a parentheses around

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.519 
at this one we have a parentheses around
the<00:00:25.119> negative<00:00:25.300> three<00:00:25.869> and<00:00:25.900> we<00:00:26.170> have<00:00:26.350> that

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
the negative three and we have that

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.769 
the negative three and we have that
squared<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.779> here<00:00:29.199> we<00:00:29.440> have<00:00:29.680> negative<00:00:30.779> three

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
squared and here we have negative three

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.139 
squared and here we have negative three
but<00:00:32.439> it's<00:00:32.770> not<00:00:33.010> in<00:00:33.190> parentheses<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:34.030> that's

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
but it's not in parentheses and that's

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.939 
but it's not in parentheses and that's
also<00:00:34.359> squared<00:00:34.870> so<00:00:35.289> what's<00:00:35.499> the<00:00:35.620> difference

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
also squared so what's the difference

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.000 
also squared so what's the difference
here<00:00:36.100> well<00:00:36.850> here<00:00:37.420> this<00:00:37.809> is<00:00:38.109> the<00:00:38.289> same<00:00:38.559> thing<00:00:38.859> as

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
here well here this is the same thing as

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.770 
here well here this is the same thing as
saying<00:00:39.159> negative<00:00:39.609> three<00:00:40.920> times<00:00:41.920> negative

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
saying negative three times negative

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.629 
saying negative three times negative
three<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.940> we<00:00:46.149> know<00:00:46.449> that<00:00:47.190> negative<00:00:48.190> 3<00:00:48.429> times

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:48.639 
three so we know that negative 3 times

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:50.759 
three so we know that negative 3 times
negative<00:00:48.729> 3<00:00:49.239> gives<00:00:49.269> us<00:00:49.569> a<00:00:49.629> positive<00:00:49.749> 9<00:00:50.409> and

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
negative 3 gives us a positive 9 and

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.279 
negative 3 gives us a positive 9 and
that's<00:00:51.670> correct<00:00:51.819> that<00:00:52.359> gives<00:00:52.539> us<00:00:52.690> our<00:00:52.780> answer

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
that's correct that gives us our answer

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.669 
that's correct that gives us our answer
great<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:54.699> happens<00:00:55.149> here<00:00:55.449> well<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.229> lot<00:00:56.469> of<00:00:56.559> my

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
great what happens here well a lot of my

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.949 
great what happens here well a lot of my
students<00:00:57.159> say<00:00:57.399> that<00:00:57.699> that's<00:00:57.969> also<00:00:58.359> a<00:00:58.389> positive

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:58.959 
students say that that's also a positive

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.930 
students say that that's also a positive
9<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.199> that's<00:00:59.620> where<00:01:00.010> they're<00:01:00.219> wrong<00:01:00.249> and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
9 and that's where they're wrong and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.449 
9 and that's where they're wrong and
this<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.209> what<00:01:01.359> we<00:01:01.479> have<00:01:01.629> to<00:01:01.719> pay<00:01:01.839> attention<00:01:01.869> to

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:02.459 
this is what we have to pay attention to

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:05.280 
this is what we have to pay attention to
when<00:01:03.459> it's<00:01:03.699> not<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.360> parentheses<00:01:04.629> when<00:01:05.260> the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
when it's not in parentheses when the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.770 
when it's not in parentheses when the
negative<00:01:05.619> is<00:01:05.979> not<00:01:06.159> in<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.700> parenthesis<00:01:07.300> and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
negative is not in the parenthesis and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.220 
negative is not in the parenthesis and
it's<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.590> an<00:01:08.800> even<00:01:09.490> exponent<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.570> even<00:01:11.020> power

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
it's to an even exponent and even power

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.310 
it's to an even exponent and even power
like<00:01:11.650> it<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.860> here<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.630> want<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.930> make<00:01:14.020> sure<00:01:14.050> we

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
like it is here you want to make sure we

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.530 
like it is here you want to make sure we
do<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.590> like<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:15.040> it's<00:01:15.340> really<00:01:15.540> represented

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
do it like this it's really represented

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.620 
do it like this it's really represented
as<00:01:16.830> 3<00:01:17.830> times<00:01:18.820> 3<00:01:19.510> which<00:01:19.840> equals<00:01:20.140> 9<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:22.210> then<00:01:22.510> we

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
as 3 times 3 which equals 9 but then we

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.390 
as 3 times 3 which equals 9 but then we
have<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.020> negative<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.800> we<00:01:23.890> have<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.190> bring

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
have that negative that we have to bring

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.640 
have that negative that we have to bring
down<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.570> will<00:01:25.720> be<00:01:25.840> represented<00:01:26.470> as

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
down so it will be represented as

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.240 
down so it will be represented as
negative<00:01:27.520> 9<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.510> whenever<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.530> see<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:30.010> you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
negative 9 so whenever you see that you

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.100 
negative 9 so whenever you see that you
want<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.670> know<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.840> will<00:01:31.960> be

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
want to know that that will be

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.350 
want to know that that will be
represented<00:01:32.680> as<00:01:32.800> negative<00:01:33.310> 9<00:01:33.640> let<00:01:34.150> me<00:01:34.240> give

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
represented as negative 9 let me give

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.230 
represented as negative 9 let me give
you<00:01:34.450> another<00:01:34.480> example<00:01:35.110> here<00:01:35.730> what<00:01:36.730> if<00:01:36.850> we<00:01:37.000> did

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
you another example here what if we did

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.260 
you another example here what if we did
negative<00:01:38.050> 4<00:01:39.270> squared<00:01:41.430> well<00:01:42.430> we<00:01:42.640> know<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:42.850> 4

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
negative 4 squared well we know that 4

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.110 
negative 4 squared well we know that 4
times<00:01:43.540> 4<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:43.870> 16<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.860> we<00:01:45.310> always<00:01:45.550> bring<00:01:46.060> that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
times 4 is 16 and we always bring that

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.570 
times 4 is 16 and we always bring that
negative<00:01:46.480> around<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.620> we<00:01:47.950> equal

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
negative around so that we equal

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.040 
negative around so that we equal
negative<00:01:50.130> 16<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.510> that's<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.720> difference

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
negative 16 and that's the difference

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.110 
negative 16 and that's the difference
because<00:01:53.260> it's<00:01:53.620> not<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.280> parentheses<00:01:54.880> so

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
because it's not in the parentheses so

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.940 
because it's not in the parentheses so
you<00:01:55.180> don't<00:01:55.570> worry<00:01:56.110> about<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:56.560> negative

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
you don't worry about that negative

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.680 
you don't worry about that negative
until<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.340> end<00:01:57.520> when<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.300> bring<00:01:58.480> it<00:01:58.570> around

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
until the end when you bring it around

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.670 
until the end when you bring it around
and<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.950> only<00:02:00.220> works<00:02:00.729> when<00:02:01.510> it's<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.900> an<00:02:02.050> even

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
and that only works when it's to an even

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.010 
and that only works when it's to an even
exponent
