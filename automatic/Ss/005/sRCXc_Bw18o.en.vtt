I<00:00:56.280> already<00:00:57.269> proceeded<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> apply<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
I already proceeded to apply some of the

I already proceeded to apply some of the
details<00:00:58.920> there<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.519> see<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.850> the

details there as you can see on the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
details there as you can see on the
surface<00:01:00.120> although<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> moving<00:01:01.289> along

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
surface although this is moving along

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 
surface although this is moving along
just<00:01:02.250> fine<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.929> let<00:01:04.110> me<00:01:04.140> go<00:01:04.290> over<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.440> few

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
just fine and now let me go over a few

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190 
just fine and now let me go over a few
details<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.160> within<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.550> cells<00:01:05.960> now<00:01:06.960> I've

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
details here within the cells now I've

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.260 
details here within the cells now I've
built<00:01:07.440> this<00:01:07.560> model<00:01:07.820> several<00:01:08.820> times<00:01:09.030> before

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
built this model several times before

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.900 
built this model several times before
and<00:01:10.070> each<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.250> previous<00:01:11.550> times<00:01:11.760> I

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
and each of the previous times I

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.660 
and each of the previous times I
basically<00:01:12.300> left<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.810> section<00:01:13.410> clear<00:01:13.680> but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
basically left this section clear but

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
basically left this section clear but
one<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> things<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.390> did<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.870> one<00:01:16.050> 350

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
one of the things I did for the one 350

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.570 
one of the things I did for the one 350
scale<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> use<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:20.060> dull<00:01:21.060> coat<00:01:21.300> to<00:01:22.310> spray<00:01:23.310> on

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
scale was I use a dull coat to spray on

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.440 
scale was I use a dull coat to spray on
to<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:24.120> clear<00:01:24.600> boussard<00:01:25.200> pieces<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
to these clear boussard pieces and it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.010 
to these clear boussard pieces and it
creates<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> nice<00:01:28.610> sort<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> haze<00:01:30.180> effect<00:01:30.750> here

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
creates a nice sort of haze effect here

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
creates a nice sort of haze effect here
and<00:01:31.370> I<00:01:32.370> really<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.600> way<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.900> turned

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and I really like the way this turned

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.630 
and I really like the way this turned
out<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.680> basically<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:37.280> front<00:01:38.280> end<00:01:38.430> piece

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
out so basically this front end piece

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 
out so basically this front end piece
here<00:01:38.910> comes<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.450> two<00:01:39.720> pieces<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.920> two<00:01:41.100> parts

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
here comes with two pieces or two parts

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.800 
here comes with two pieces or two parts
if<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.730> have<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> put<00:01:42.120> together<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.630> these

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
if you have to put together or these

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.400 
if you have to put together or these
insert<00:01:43.500> onto<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.370> nacelle<00:01:44.730> here<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:46.200> first

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
insert onto the nacelle here the first

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.290 
insert onto the nacelle here the first
of<00:01:46.560> course<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.830> this<00:01:47.100> clear<00:01:47.400> covering<00:01:47.820> but

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
of course is this clear covering but

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.020 
of course is this clear covering but

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.730 
course is why there was holes are there
I<00:02:03.700> tell<00:02:04.180> all<00:02:04.420> those<00:02:04.540> needles<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.230> come<00:02:05.470> through

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
I tell all those needles to come through

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.040 
I tell all those needles to come through
but<00:02:06.730> this<00:02:07.150> is<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> piece<00:02:07.480> I'm<00:02:07.660> talking<00:02:07.900> about

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
but this is the piece I'm talking about

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.600 
but this is the piece I'm talking about
here<00:02:08.290> this<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.710> inner<00:02:08.860> piece<00:02:09.130> or<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.399> has

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
here this is the inner piece or that has

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.950 
here this is the inner piece or that has
these<00:02:09.759> striations<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.509> are<00:02:10.600> supposed<00:02:10.869> to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
these striations that are supposed to

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.480 
these striations that are supposed to
duplicate<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.590> fan<00:02:11.830> piece<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.340> see

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
duplicate the fan piece that you see

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.740 
duplicate the fan piece that you see
rotating<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.350> studio<00:02:14.650> model<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:16.030> what<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
rotating in the studio model so what I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.020 
rotating in the studio model so what I
did<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.350> painted<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.190> piece<00:02:18.430> with

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
did here is I painted that piece with

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.990 
did here is I painted that piece with
two<00:02:19.240> Mia's<00:02:19.510> clear<00:02:20.200> red<00:02:20.440> paint<00:02:20.710> gave<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.850> nice

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
two Mia's clear red paint gave it a nice

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.900 
two Mia's clear red paint gave it a nice
red<00:02:22.270> color<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:23.320> sorted<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.860> into<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.580> nacelle

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
red color and sorted it into the nacelle

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.540 
red color and sorted it into the nacelle
and<00:02:25.150> then<00:02:25.990> rather<00:02:26.650> than<00:02:26.800> making<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.280> clear

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
and then rather than making that clear

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.660 
and then rather than making that clear
again<00:02:27.730> i<00:02:27.970> coated<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.390> with<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:29.220> dull<00:02:30.220> coat<00:02:30.430> and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
again i coated that with a dull coat and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.180 
again i coated that with a dull coat and
it<00:02:31.150> added<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:32.020> nice<00:02:32.380> effect<00:02:32.620> here<00:02:32.920> creating

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
it added a nice effect here creating

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.190 
it added a nice effect here creating
this<00:02:33.310> frosted<00:02:33.880> look<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.870> gives<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.080> that

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
this frosted look so it gives it that

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720 
this frosted look so it gives it that
kind<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.650> layered<00:02:35.920> sort<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.370> effect<00:02:36.610> I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
kind of this layered sort of effect I

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.400 
kind of this layered sort of effect I
guess<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.090> might<00:02:37.240> want<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.480> call<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:38.350> I

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
guess you might want to call it but I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.080 
guess you might want to call it but I
really<00:02:38.890> really<00:02:39.040> like<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.490> way<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.700> turned<00:02:39.850> out

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
really really like the way it turned out

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.850 
really really like the way it turned out
so<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.140> something<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.470> might<00:02:41.560> want<00:02:41.800> to

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
so this is something you might want to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.230 
so this is something you might want to
try<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.370> decide<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.790> put<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.060> model

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
try and can you decide to put this model

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.720 
try and can you decide to put this model
together<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.709> whole<00:02:44.860> piece<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.220> clear<00:02:45.490> so

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
together and the whole piece is clear so

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.850 
together and the whole piece is clear so
you<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.300> mask<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.750> off<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.650> course

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
you have to mask that off and of course

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.180 
you have to mask that off and of course
paint<00:02:48.160> these<00:02:48.580> end<00:02:48.820> pieces<00:02:48.970> here<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.980> same

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
paint these end pieces here the same

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.380 
paint these end pieces here the same
color<00:02:51.430> as<00:02:51.580> your<00:02:51.610> painting<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.030> rest<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.330> the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
color as your painting the rest of the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.560 
color as your painting the rest of the
hall<00:02:53.310> okay<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.580> then<00:02:54.700> this<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.060> course<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
hall okay and then this of course is the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.979 
hall okay and then this of course is the
secondary<00:02:56.020> hole<00:02:56.320> in<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:58.060> previous<00:02:58.690> video<00:02:58.810> I

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
secondary hole in the previous video I

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.840 
secondary hole in the previous video I
talked<00:02:59.320> about<00:02:59.530> using<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.920> dissolve<00:03:00.610> putty

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
talked about using that dissolve putty

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.479 
talked about using that dissolve putty
on<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.510> scene<00:03:01.780> here<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.380> as<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.100> can<00:03:03.190> see<00:03:03.400> it

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
on the scene here and as you can see it

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.220 
on the scene here and as you can see it
did<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> pretty<00:03:03.730> nice<00:03:04.180> job<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:04.720> nice<00:03:04.989> and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
did a pretty nice job it's nice and

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.310 
did a pretty nice job it's nice and
smooth<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.040> hides<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.400> pretty<00:03:06.640> well<00:03:06.790> and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
smooth so it hides it pretty well and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.560 
smooth so it hides it pretty well and
then<00:03:08.320> there<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.220> there's<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.269> course<00:03:10.450> the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
then there is the there's of course the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.180 
then there is the there's of course the
bottom<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:10.989> ship<00:03:11.200> here<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.980> scene

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
bottom of the ship here and this scene

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.370 
bottom of the ship here and this scene
isn't<00:03:12.370> too<00:03:12.850> prominent<00:03:13.239> but<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.630> again<00:03:14.200> did<00:03:14.350> a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
isn't too prominent but it again did a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.400 
isn't too prominent but it again did a
very<00:03:14.560> good<00:03:14.769> job<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:15.130> hiding<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.550> as<00:03:15.670> well<00:03:16.410> okay

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
very good job of hiding it as well okay

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.630 
very good job of hiding it as well okay
and<00:03:17.620> again<00:03:17.680> as<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.040> can<00:03:18.160> see<00:03:18.280> I'm<00:03:18.370> applying

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
and again as you can see I'm applying

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.759 
and again as you can see I'm applying
that<00:03:18.790> decals<00:03:19.150> already<00:03:19.600> here

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
that decals already here

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.470 
that decals already here
finally<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.519> color<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.000> I'm<00:03:22.120> using<00:03:22.150> for

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
finally the color that I'm using for

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.590 
finally the color that I'm using for
this<00:03:22.750> model<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.320> testers<00:03:24.010> light<00:03:24.370> gray<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:25.540> is

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
this model is testers light gray that is

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600 
this model is testers light gray that is
the<00:03:25.810> same<00:03:26.019> color<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.410> painted<00:03:26.709> my<00:03:26.860> one<00:03:27.070> 350

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
the same color I painted my one 350

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.060 
the same color I painted my one 350
scale<00:03:27.880> model<00:03:28.570> with<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.470> think<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:29.920> really

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
scale model with and I think it really

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.840 
scale model with and I think it really
does<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.370> nice<00:03:30.640> job<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:31.540> duplicate<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.850> grayish

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
does a nice job to duplicate a grayish

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.759 
does a nice job to duplicate a grayish
tone<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.360> tend<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.570> see<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:34.870> screen<00:03:35.080> that

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
tone that you tend to see on screen that

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.170 
tone that you tend to see on screen that
of<00:03:35.860> course<00:03:36.010> deviates<00:03:36.489> from<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.790> blue-collar

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
of course deviates from the blue-collar

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.720 
of course deviates from the blue-collar
from<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:38.190> least<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.370> original

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
from the least that the original

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.590 
from the least that the original
miniature<00:03:39.880> was<00:03:40.750> painted<00:03:41.230> in<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:43.209> think<00:03:43.480> this

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
miniature was painted in so I think this

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.330 
miniature was painted in so I think this
does<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.840> pretty<00:03:44.290> nice<00:03:44.500> job<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.830> duplicate<00:03:45.190> what

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
does a pretty nice job to duplicate what

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.699 
does a pretty nice job to duplicate what
you<00:03:45.430> see<00:03:45.610> on<00:03:45.730> screen<00:03:46.049> what<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:47.080> see<00:03:47.320> here<00:03:47.530> of

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
you see on screen what you see here of

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.890 
you see on screen what you see here of
course<00:03:47.980> is<00:03:48.160> where<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.370> sensor<00:03:48.850> dish<00:03:49.090> goes

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
course is where the sensor dish goes

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.289 
course is where the sensor dish goes
into<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.470> painted<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:50.920> copper<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.150> that's

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
into and I painted this copper so that's

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.150 
into and I painted this copper so that's
basically<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:52.930> testers<00:03:53.560> copper<00:03:53.830> paint

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
basically just testers copper paint

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.100 
basically just testers copper paint
