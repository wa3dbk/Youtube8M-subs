this to mean to get for instance food

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
this to mean to get for instance food
for<00:01:23.610> vary<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:24.030> more<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> station<00:01:25.110> when

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
for vary will more on the station when

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.270 
for vary will more on the station when
he<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.820> actually<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.030> are<00:01:27.240> working<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
he is there actually we are working and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.780 
he is there actually we are working and
typically<00:01:29.280> about<00:01:29.549> 18<00:01:30.360> months<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.380> advance<00:01:31.790> so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
typically about 18 months in advance so

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.100 
typically about 18 months in advance so
we<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> standard<00:01:34.320> menu<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> much<00:01:36.479> most<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
we have a standard menu so much most of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.280 
we have a standard menu so much most of
the<00:01:37.200> core<00:01:37.409> menu<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> same<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the core menu is the same and so you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.460 
the core menu is the same and so you
know<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.680> pre<00:01:41.549> position<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.259> then

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
know we just pre position that but then

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
know we just pre position that but then
each<00:01:43.829> crew<00:01:44.159> member<00:01:44.460> gets<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.880> certain<00:01:45.210> amount

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
each crew member gets a certain amount

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.230 
each crew member gets a certain amount
of<00:01:45.799> preference<00:01:46.799> food<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.549> call<00:01:47.729> them<00:01:47.850> bonus

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
of preference food we call them bonus

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.960 
of preference food we call them bonus
containers<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
containers and so they you know that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.240 
containers and so they you know that
container<00:01:51.509> has<00:01:51.810> their<00:01:52.110> name<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.530> with

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
container has their name on it with

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.219 
container has their name on it with
their<00:01:53.549> selections<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.020> that's

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
their selections in it and so that's

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
their selections in it and so that's
what<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.070> sure<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
what we have to be sure is there at the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
what we have to be sure is there at the
right<00:01:57.450> time<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> utilize<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.549> are

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.580 
you able to use all of the different
delivery<00:02:02.280> ships<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.630> delivery<00:02:04.200> trucks<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
delivery ships the delivery trucks that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.830 
delivery ships the delivery trucks that
are<00:02:04.710> going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> station<00:02:05.280> yes<00:02:05.759> over<00:02:06.600> time

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
are going to the station yes over time

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.260 
are going to the station yes over time
we<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.320> used<00:02:07.619> them<00:02:07.829> all<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.640> used<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.000> use<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
we have used them all we used to use the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.180 
we have used them all we used to use the
progress<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.840> lot<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
progress a lot but now that we have the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.410 
progress a lot but now that we have the
commercial<00:02:11.580> carriers<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.629> board

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
commercial carriers on board

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.230 
commercial carriers on board
SpaceX<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.530> orbital<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.430> we're<00:02:15.610> not<00:02:15.820> using

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
SpaceX and orbital so we're not using

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.830 
SpaceX and orbital so we're not using
progress<00:02:17.050> as<00:02:17.230> much<00:02:17.470> for<00:02:17.800> food<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.660> have

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
progress as much for food but we have

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.070 
progress as much for food but we have
used<00:02:20.080> progress<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:21.010> use<00:02:21.340> HTV<00:02:22.270> which<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
used progress we use HTV which is the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.430 
used progress we use HTV which is the
JAXA<00:02:23.560> cargo<00:02:23.950> vehicle<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:25.030> used<00:02:25.300> ATV<00:02:26.020> when<00:02:26.350> it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
JAXA cargo vehicle we used ATV when it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.700 
JAXA cargo vehicle we used ATV when it
was<00:02:26.590> flying<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.480> yeah<00:02:28.750> we<00:02:28.990> utilize<00:02:29.440> all

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
was flying and so yeah we utilize all

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.100 
was flying and so yeah we utilize all
these<00:02:30.130> different<00:02:30.490> cargo<00:02:30.850> vehicles<00:02:31.300> if<00:02:31.930> you're

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
these different cargo vehicles if you're

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.960 
these different cargo vehicles if you're
working<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.710> far<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.160> advance<00:02:33.310> you've<00:02:33.760> got

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
working that far in advance you've got

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.810 
working that far in advance you've got
to<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.180> sending<00:02:34.660> things<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.320> can<00:02:36.070> stay<00:02:36.580> good

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
to be sending things that can stay good

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.120 
to be sending things that can stay good
for<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.270> long<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.720> need<00:02:38.650> some<00:02:38.860> kind<00:02:39.070> of

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
for that long that need some kind of

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.000 
for that long that need some kind of
special<00:02:39.420> preservation<00:02:40.420> yes<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.770> the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
special preservation yes so the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.560 
special preservation yes so the
challenge<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.460> we<00:02:42.670> have<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.210> there<00:02:43.390> are

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
challenge that we have is that there are

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.480 
challenge that we have is that there are
no<00:02:43.780> dedicated<00:02:44.020> freezers<00:02:44.800> or<00:02:44.950> refrigerators

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
no dedicated freezers or refrigerators

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.390 
no dedicated freezers or refrigerators
for<00:02:45.970> food<00:02:46.210> on<00:02:46.420> orbit<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.350> all<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.770> our<00:02:47.860> food<00:02:48.130> has

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
for food on orbit so all of our food has

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.490 
for food on orbit so all of our food has
to<00:02:48.460> be<00:02:48.760> shelf<00:02:49.120> stable<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.840> last<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> very

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
to be shelf stable and last for a very

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.250 
to be shelf stable and last for a very
long<00:02:50.740> time<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:52.000> we're<00:02:52.240> using<00:02:52.480> freeze-dried

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
long time so we're using freeze-dried

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.710 
long time so we're using freeze-dried
products<00:02:53.740> we're<00:02:54.010> using<00:02:54.310> thermal<00:02:55.240> stabilized

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
products we're using thermal stabilized

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.020 
products we're using thermal stabilized
products<00:02:56.140> which<00:02:56.380> are<00:02:56.590> like<00:02:56.980> canned<00:02:57.459> products

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
products which are like canned products

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.390 
products which are like canned products
except<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:58.930> put<00:02:59.110> ours<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.440> pouches<00:02:59.680> instead<00:03:00.310> of

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
except we put ours in pouches instead of

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.490 
except we put ours in pouches instead of
cans<00:03:00.760> because<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.630> pouches<00:03:01.840> are<00:03:02.140> lighter<00:03:02.380> in

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
cans because the pouches are lighter in

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.280 
cans because the pouches are lighter in
weight<00:03:02.680> which<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.850> advantageous<00:03:04.420> when<00:03:05.110> you're

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
weight which is advantageous when you're

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.080 
weight which is advantageous when you're
launching<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.190> orbit<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.810> yeah<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.500> use

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
launching it to orbit so yeah we use

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.250 
launching it to orbit so yeah we use
really<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.420> when<00:03:10.660> we<00:03:10.810> do<00:03:10.990> use<00:03:11.230> some

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
really and when we do use some

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.330 
really and when we do use some
irradiated<00:03:12.010> meat<00:03:12.400> products<00:03:12.940> as<00:03:13.150> well<00:03:13.390> so

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
irradiated meat products as well so

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.640 
irradiated meat products as well so
we're<00:03:15.340> using<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.940> variety<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.660> products<00:03:17.620> that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
we're using a variety of products that

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.550 
we're using a variety of products that
create<00:03:17.980> shelf<00:03:18.580> stable<00:03:18.820> items<00:03:19.510> you've<00:03:20.170> got<00:03:20.380> a

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
create shelf stable items you've got a

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.830 
create shelf stable items you've got a
few<00:03:21.010> samples<00:03:21.489> here<00:03:21.670> are<00:03:21.970> some<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.330> these<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
few samples here are some of these the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.949 
few samples here are some of these the
things<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.950> are<00:03:24.100> thermo<00:03:24.940> stabilized<00:03:25.600> and

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
things that are thermo stabilized and

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.650 
things that are thermo stabilized and
yes<00:03:26.410> actually<00:03:27.160> thermos<00:03:27.700> table<00:03:28.000> eyes<00:03:28.090> products

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
yes actually thermos table eyes products

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.750 
yes actually thermos table eyes products
so<00:03:28.900> for<00:03:29.140> example<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.830> turkey<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.459> they<00:03:30.580> have

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
so for example the turkey that they have

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.150 
so for example the turkey that they have
available<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.570> them<00:03:32.050> for<00:03:32.320> tomorrow<00:03:32.500> if<00:03:33.010> they

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
available to them for tomorrow if they

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.360 
available to them for tomorrow if they
choose<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.730> use<00:03:34.300> it<00:03:34.480> for<00:03:34.660> Thanksgiving<00:03:35.370> this

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
choose to use it for Thanksgiving this

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.759 
choose to use it for Thanksgiving this
is<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:37.060> thermos<00:03:37.510> well<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:37.989> has<00:03:38.170> been<00:03:38.200> actually

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
is a thermos well this has been actually

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.680 
is a thermos well this has been actually
made<00:03:39.550> shelf<00:03:39.910> stable<00:03:40.180> by<00:03:40.959> irradiation<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:43.269> this

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
made shelf stable by irradiation so this

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.479 
made shelf stable by irradiation so this
is<00:03:43.900> product<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.590> ready<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:44.980> eat<00:03:45.010> they<00:03:45.280> just

the<00:03:47.739> package<00:03:48.070> with<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.250> fork<00:03:48.580> or<00:03:48.730> spoon<00:03:48.940> we<00:03:49.840> also

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
the package with a fork or spoon we also

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.290 
the package with a fork or spoon we also
have<00:03:50.560> for<00:03:50.890> instance<00:03:51.310> we<00:03:51.459> have<00:03:51.610> candied<00:03:52.030> yams

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.290 
have for instance we have candied yams
this<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.890> canned<00:03:54.190> product<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.120> is

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
this is like a canned product so this is

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.190 
this is like a canned product so this is
thermo<00:03:55.720> stabilized<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:58.209> but<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.720> has<00:03:59.019> been

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
thermo stabilized and it but it has been

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.020 
thermo stabilized and it but it has been
done<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.769> pouch<00:03:59.950> to<00:03:59.980> make<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.580> lighter<00:04:00.790> in

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
done in a pouch to make it lighter in
