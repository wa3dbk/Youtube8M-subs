 but for now in the southeast there were shelling and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.890
 Peter Poroshenko made them a row of scandalous 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.960
 statements in berlin 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.069
 right after meeting with angel merkel in 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.830
 during which the Ukrainian president 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.889
 had to control himself he gave 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.080
 will emotions interview cdf channel that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.000
 pseudo truce and other 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.930
 Poroshenko's revelations, listen to our 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.760
 Columnist Aegina Horn President 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.619
 Poroshenko in confusion 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 He used to that in his beloved Europe 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.330
 sympathize with him often regret and here in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.520
 interview to german television suddenly 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.190
 interrupted by words and ask uncomfortable 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.110
 questions mister president i have to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.940
 notice that you add fuel to the fire 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 when you say you're going 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.969
 to win Donetsk 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.309
 this statement is very disturbed 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.250
 german government ami claus i even 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 This is for you for 31 claus, I thank you for 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 I advise you not to comment on this comment 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.770
 Russian newspapers are considered this 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.039
 the only source where you can 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.199
 find such nonsense i'm the president of the world 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.110
 Ukraine firmly adheres to Minsk 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.030
 agreements for Tyumen care we shield 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.700
 apparently the president of the world like him 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.430
 calls forgot what he said only three days 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 before that before the movie premiere airport 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 I understand the same amount, we have no link 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.250
 no doubt we will free 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.009
 the airport we will free Donetsk because 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.350
 this is our land and we will restore the airport 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.430
 with him there in glass the remains of reinforcement 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.979
 concrete and write glory cyborgs com 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.220
 there is Peter Poroshenko shows again 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.570
 what is it for external use 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.820
 democratic peace-loving of for 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.860
 internal speaking literally what 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.350
 they are waiting for him or what to say 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.200
 to calm the people and topple all of them 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.020
 woes naturally on russia before meals on 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.230
 positions the only possible peaceful 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.910
 conflict resolution 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.160
 this is the restoration of territorial 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.380
 state unity by diplomatic 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.420
 by withdrawing Russian troops from 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.270
 the territory of Ukraine is now on the territory 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.090
 the country is about 11 thousand 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.740
 Russian military personnel and information 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.440
 again what is called from the ceiling 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.480
 German viewers will not check not 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.400
 I see the need to repeat what 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.200
 similar allegations without 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.730
 any specifics without any 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.250
 evidence to say the least not 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.170
 contributes to nothing positively in 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.420
 the time when groups are formed 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.760
 the implementation of the Minsk agreements when 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.320
 literally bit by bit the world is going 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.450
 Poroshenko tells that they 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.240
 enjoy truce for deliveries 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.000
 weapons and will fight to the last 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.980
 blood drops today Ukraine cry 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.470
 Ukraine pays very high today 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.410
 price for this pseudo truce since 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.780
 as we signed the minsk agreement 83 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.730
 our soldiers gave their lives 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.920
 to stop the aggressor 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.680
 causes Poroshenko's latest statements 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.370
 and the pseudo truce is impermissible 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.370
 statements that really are 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.240
 performance mouth military rhetoric 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.569
 which is not aimed at solving precisely 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.990
 by peaceful means of this matter also his 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.970
 statement on the need to release 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.180
 the territory of Ukraine to the last drop 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.330
 blood does not indicate whose blood drop but 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.239
 this is also not a movement side 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.190
 World President of Ukraine constantly 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.900
 forks how to change the constitution 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.910
 without changing it 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.340
 how to convince European partners and 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.590
 patrons in peaceful intentions not 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.340
 weakening military rhetoric and here still 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.840
 such questions 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.519
 some in the west doubt you 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.860
 can you trust when you say that you 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.810
 Ukraineâ€™s good side is now 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.310
 one of the most corrupt 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.930
 states on the planet in working on 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.120
 there is essentially no constitution 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.910
 results your own statement 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.989
 mister president is often too much 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.350
 nationalist whether sharp 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.350
 by this
