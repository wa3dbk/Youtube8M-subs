00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.920
 the dandy coccyx in you know from here nothing 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.680
 more making a short video this by 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.389
 example for all those users of 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.239
 windows that have been passed to the mac and that 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.519
 I miss you ares this one 

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.519
 to show a super useful technique is a 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.039
 bit complicated but if you get it to 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:28.149
 practice frequently then then you 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.849
 You're used to it, it's super easy , you have no 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.420
 your mac must have the following two 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.950
 programs not three presidents programs 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.920
 good first installed the firefox 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.550
 and firefox plugin that seek 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.620
 flame fox it down long or fox and something like that 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.910
 this fox and put in fox and with an X 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.970
 nothing else 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.040
 and that allows you to download the videos and 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.040
 music directly for example youtube 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.700
 here I have an efe lb file as 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.350
 you can see that is a file is a video 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.940
 but I'm just interested in audio 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.760
 that in this case be like limewire 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.119
 now it is no longer useful because it is in 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.740
 a court order can not work 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.229
 there is no program that downloads music 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.910
 for mac then this technique then to me 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.850
 It serves me what I do is download video 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.340
 there you can do as 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.009
 you said but downloading the video 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.050
 it was light then the following program 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.590
 they need to be able to do this 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.590
 is called 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.270
 this string clip then what are we going 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:37.289
 do nothing else is grab the file 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.570
 open it with that application as you can 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.340
 see how you see him interpret many 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.530
 videos this program does not interpret 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.119
 videos from youtube some if I do not understand 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.340
 because I think it's because of the quality of hd 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.369
 but I'm not sure because as you can 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.369
 watch 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.210
 [Music] 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.620
 we have what audio is then 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.260
 nothing else we just go here to 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.280
 fine or file and we will export it 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.600
 Audio 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.090
 here as you can see in our option 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.650
 and nothing else simply if they want it 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.280
 disc quality which is extremely 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.020
 heavy around here in mp4 that is 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 equivalent to double does that is the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.070
 format x itunes we all select 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.590
 we left the stereo option so that 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.800
 give the two speakers 256 kilobytes per 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.300
 second is super good like this beat 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.460
 break 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.620
 come on ok 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.110
 we adjust the name we want from the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.330
 song and nothing else we give this save and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.820
 what will make the program is a 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.340
 video and the only thing to do is pull the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.950
 audio and record it with voice as if it were 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.920
 a file for example mp3 in this case 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.070
 that mp4 is very useful as it can happen to 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.569
 its to your free itunes library or what 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.760
 they want 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.810
 this is a very useful guy this is from 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.810
 nicol√°s and already you know
