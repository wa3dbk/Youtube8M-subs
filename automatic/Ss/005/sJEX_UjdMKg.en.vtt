00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
here that is going on involves quite a

here that is going on involves quite a
lot<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.990> TR<00:01:29.060> basically<00:01:30.060> all<00:01:30.299> factions<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.079> can

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
lot of TR basically all factions you can

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.399 
lot of TR basically all factions you can
see<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.759> sure<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:33.509> NC<00:01:33.840> yep

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
see just a pretty sure is that an NC yep

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.420 
see just a pretty sure is that an NC yep
poor<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.920> NT<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:36.090> did<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:37.020> um<00:01:37.430> this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
poor little NT that did but um this

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
poor little NT that did but um this
battle<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.970> consistent<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.049> three<00:01:40.500> factions

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
battle is consistent of three factions

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
battle is consistent of three factions
and<00:01:42.259> I'm<00:01:43.259> getting<00:01:43.710> quite<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.549> steady<00:01:45.329> FPS<00:01:46.229> for

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and I'm getting quite a steady FPS for

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.730 
and I'm getting quite a steady FPS for
this<00:01:46.740> enabled<00:01:47.399> at<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> moment<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.590> only

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
this enabled at the moment the only

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
this enabled at the moment the only
thing<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.540> disabling<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.549> FPS<00:01:53.840> smoothing

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
thing about disabling the FPS smoothing

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.399 
thing about disabling the FPS smoothing
is<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.799> yes<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.700> may<00:01:56.880> get<00:01:57.090> higher<00:01:57.360> FPS<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
is that yes you may get higher FPS the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.690 
is that yes you may get higher FPS the
normal<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.469> obviously<00:02:01.469> at<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> moment<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> am

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
normal so obviously at the moment I am

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.889 
normal so obviously at the moment I am
getting<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> steady<00:02:03.540> 60<00:02:04.200> FPS<00:02:05.009> no<00:02:06.000> problems<00:02:06.509> no

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
getting a steady 60 FPS no problems no

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.130 
getting a steady 60 FPS no problems no

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
drops

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.469 
drops
and<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.890> doesn't<00:02:09.039> matter<00:02:09.310> wondering<00:02:09.880> if<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.300> go

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
and it doesn't matter wondering if I go

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.040 
and it doesn't matter wondering if I go
straight<00:02:10.539> into<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.170> combat<00:02:12.720> I'm<00:02:13.720> still

with<00:02:44.680> FPS<00:02:45.160> but<00:02:45.610> may<00:02:46.540> see<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.470> bit<00:02:47.920> more

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
with FPS but may see a bit more

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.240 
with FPS but may see a bit more
consistency<00:02:48.760> in<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.480> FPS<00:02:50.050> where<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.739> never

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
consistency in the FPS where it never

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.380 
consistency in the FPS where it never
really<00:02:51.610> drops<00:02:52.030> because<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:53.110> capped<00:02:53.560> at<00:02:53.830> 60

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
really drops because it's capped at 60

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.740 
really drops because it's capped at 60
it<00:02:55.390> has<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.750> minimum<00:02:56.670> setting<00:02:57.670> as<00:02:57.820> well<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.570> can

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
it has a minimum setting as well you can

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.009 
it has a minimum setting as well you can
actually<00:02:58.930> want<00:02:59.680> me<00:02:59.739> zoom<00:03:00.280> out<00:03:00.400> here<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.930> you

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
actually want me zoom out here so you

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.810

about this you do actually have an ini

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.990 
about this you do actually have an ini

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
you don't know where the installation

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.039 
you don't know where the installation
directory<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.920> please<00:03:21.190> google<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:22.660> might

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
directory is please google it I might

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.750 
directory is please google it I might
throw<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.500> down<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.980> description<00:03:24.160> as<00:03:24.730> well

throw it down in the description as well
so<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.299> can<00:03:25.329> just<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.840> look<00:03:26.019> down<00:03:26.230> there

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
so you can just have a look down there

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.810 
so you can just have a look down there
it's<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.700> default<00:03:28.090> location<00:03:28.470> but<00:03:29.470> remember<00:03:30.370> if

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
it's a default location but remember if

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.660 
it's a default location but remember if

an<00:04:26.129> identical<00:04:26.789> copy<00:04:26.819> before<00:04:27.569> you<00:04:27.990> start

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
an identical copy before you start

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.740 
an identical copy before you start
messing<00:04:28.470> around<00:04:28.740> with<00:04:29.039> a<00:04:29.069> file<00:04:29.400> however<00:04:29.970> what

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
messing around with a file however what

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.899 
messing around with a file however what
I<00:04:30.780> suggest<00:04:31.229> is<00:04:31.379> maybe<00:04:31.440> if<00:04:32.009> you<00:04:32.400> want<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.699> try

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
I suggest is maybe if you want to try

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.570 
I suggest is maybe if you want to try
and<00:04:33.030> get<00:04:33.150> higher<00:04:33.509> than<00:04:33.930> 60<00:04:34.409> FPS<00:04:34.830> see<00:04:35.159> if<00:04:35.430> you

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
and get higher than 60 FPS see if you

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.730 
and get higher than 60 FPS see if you
have<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.759> hundred<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.270> twenty<00:04:36.720> Hertz<00:04:36.930> monster

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
have a hundred and twenty Hertz monster

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.589 
have a hundred and twenty Hertz monster
that's<00:04:38.220> really<00:04:38.669> only<00:04:38.849> way<00:04:39.180> you're<00:04:39.360> going<00:04:39.509> to

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
that's really only way you're going to

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.129 
that's really only way you're going to
benefit<00:04:40.409> from<00:04:40.710> having<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:41.789> high<00:04:41.909> on<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.210> 60<00:04:42.659> FPS

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
benefit from having a high on a 60 FPS

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.059 
benefit from having a high on a 60 FPS
but<00:04:43.889> if<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.789> have<00:04:45.229> 120<00:04:46.229> Hertz<00:04:46.409> mono<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.919> might

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
but if you have 120 Hertz mono you might

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.820 
but if you have 120 Hertz mono you might
want<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.370> put<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.759> 120<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.020> then<00:04:49.470> put<00:04:49.710> the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
want to put that to 120 and then put the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.189 
want to put that to 120 and then put the
minimum<00:04:50.220> frame<00:04:50.520> rate<00:04:50.849> at<00:04:51.180> about<00:04:52.139> 50<00:04:52.889> or<00:04:53.190> 60

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
minimum frame rate at about 50 or 60

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.749 
minimum frame rate at about 50 or 60
give<00:04:55.199> that<00:04:55.440> try<00:04:55.800> with<00:04:56.099> your<00:04:56.219> hundred<00:04:56.490> twenty

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
give that try with your hundred twenty

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.129 
give that try with your hundred twenty

quite<00:04:58.349> a<00:04:58.440> powerful<00:04:58.680> machine<00:04:59.219> to<00:04:59.460> hit<00:04:59.610> that<00:04:59.759> max

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
quite a powerful machine to hit that max

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.730 
quite a powerful machine to hit that max
frame<00:05:00.389> rate<00:05:02.000> but<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.629> really<00:05:04.169> depends<00:05:04.590> on<00:05:04.680> your

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
frame rate but it really depends on your

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.779 
frame rate but it really depends on your
hardware<00:05:05.599> so<00:05:06.599> give<00:05:07.409> it<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.590> try<00:05:07.830> see<00:05:08.580> how<00:05:08.729> you

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
hardware so give it a try see how you

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.050 
hardware so give it a try see how you
get<00:05:09.000> on<00:05:09.060> with<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.479> and<00:05:09.810> keep<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.590> in<00:05:10.710> mind

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
get on with that and keep it in mind

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.680 
get on with that and keep it in mind
planetside<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.360> bit<00:05:12.690> more<00:05:12.990> CPU<00:05:13.800> best<00:05:14.330> so<00:05:15.330> it

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
planetside is a bit more CPU best so it

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.559 
planetside is a bit more CPU best so it
