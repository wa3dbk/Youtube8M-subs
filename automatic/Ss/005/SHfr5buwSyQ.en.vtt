usually<00:00:24.539> other<00:00:24.900> opponents<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.650> guy<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
usually other opponents like that guy is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
usually other opponents like that guy is
actually<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> reveal<00:00:26.970> their<00:00:27.180> position

actually going to reveal their position

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.720 
actually going to reveal their position

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
so that's why you sometimes rely on

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.209 
so that's why you sometimes rely on
others<00:00:32.809> drop<00:00:33.809> down<00:00:34.050> finishing<00:00:34.890> off<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> two

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
you have nowhere to escape you want to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.880

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
memorize the textures of a map so you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.770 
memorize the textures of a map so you
can<00:01:03.600> drop<00:01:03.780> down<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.199> small<00:01:04.470> ledges

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.240

right there I switched my shotgun a male
aid<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.459> melee<00:01:50.819> cancels<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> cocking<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:51.959> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
aid the melee cancels the cocking on the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.289 
aid the melee cancels the cocking on the
shotgun<00:01:52.289> which<00:01:52.649> makes<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.009> loud<00:01:53.189> noise<00:01:53.299> so

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
shotgun which makes a loud noise so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.809 
shotgun which makes a loud noise so
that's<00:01:54.780> why<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:55.829> did<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.130> some<00:01:56.549> players

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
that's why I even did that some players

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:57.979 
that's why I even did that some players
you<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.420> turtle<00:01:57.810> beach<00:01:57.959> headset

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:57.989 
you have you know turtle beach headset

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:59.600 
you have you know turtle beach headset
so<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> lot<00:01:58.739> of<00:01:58.799> speakers<00:01:59.099> can<00:01:59.280> kill<00:01:59.459> out<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so a lot of speakers can kill out a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.279 
so a lot of speakers can kill out a
shotgun<00:01:59.849> cock<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.599> they<00:02:00.720> will<00:02:00.840> actually<00:02:00.929> back

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
shotgun cock and they will actually back

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.460 
shotgun cock and they will actually back
away<00:02:02.450> those<00:02:03.450> shots<00:02:03.750> right<00:02:03.869> there<00:02:03.989> were<00:02:04.319> kind

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
don't know their location so that's why

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.690 
don't know their location so that's why
you<00:03:27.260> know<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:27.590> always<00:03:27.860> good<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.400> pay

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
it was charging from blue because he

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.930 
it was charging from blue because he
would<00:04:54.540> be<00:04:54.720> my<00:04:54.960> only<00:04:55.220> danger<00:04:56.220> cuz<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.820> other

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
would be my only danger cuz the other

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.180 
would be my only danger cuz the other
guys<00:04:57.120> were<00:04:57.300> bottom<00:04:57.630> on<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.260> map<00:05:00.830> now<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.860> didn't

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
guys were bottom on the map now I didn't

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.530

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.360 
blow up the fusion cores in the blue
hallway<00:05:03.990> because<00:05:04.230> I<00:05:04.500> might<00:05:04.710> use<00:05:04.890> those<00:05:05.070> as<00:05:05.340> a

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
hallway because I might use those as a

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:14.960 
hallway because I might use those as a
way<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.640> suppress<00:05:06.210> them<00:05:07.190> or<00:05:08.190> also<00:05:08.850> just<00:05:13.970> again

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
way to suppress them or also just again

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.340 
way to suppress them or also just again
as<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.240> see<00:05:15.420> the<00:05:15.570> guy<00:05:15.720> was<00:05:15.900> frantically

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
sometimes you know he can just clean

shot the barrels and he could have

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:40.980

which<00:06:13.630> is<00:06:13.660> why<00:06:13.900> I<00:06:13.930> choose<00:06:14.230> not<00:06:14.440> to<00:06:14.500> rush

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
which is why I choose not to rush

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.260 
which is why I choose not to rush
because<00:06:15.130> he<00:06:15.250> can<00:06:15.400> easily<00:06:15.550> drop<00:06:16.030> a<00:06:16.060> grenade

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
because he can easily drop a grenade

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.330 
because he can easily drop a grenade
there<00:06:16.750> and<00:06:16.960> if<00:06:17.080> someone<00:06:17.530> spawns<00:06:17.770> blue<00:06:18.070> right

when I go I had no chance of surviving

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.780 
when I go I had no chance of surviving
that's<00:06:20.440> why<00:06:20.620> I<00:06:20.650> drop<00:06:20.950> on<00:06:21.130> that<00:06:21.250> ledge<00:06:21.430> first

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
for the kill is a stupid idea because
