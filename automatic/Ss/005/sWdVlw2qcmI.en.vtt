your lantern to be about eight feet in
the<00:01:18.960> air<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.240> taking

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the air and so we are actually taking

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.690 
the air and so we are actually taking
into<00:01:21.990> account<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.830> height<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> our<00:01:23.370> actual

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
into account the height of our actual

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.640 
into account the height of our actual

drainage<00:02:02.970> below<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> concrete<00:02:04.370> now<00:02:05.370> we're

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
drainage below the concrete now we're

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.490 
drainage below the concrete now we're
using<00:02:05.640> fast-setting<00:02:06.300> concrete<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
using fast-setting concrete so want to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.160 
using fast-setting concrete so want to
make<00:02:07.620> sure<00:02:07.650> we<00:02:08.009> get<00:02:08.190> our<00:02:08.489> post<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> hole

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
make sure we get our post in the hole

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.880 
make sure we get our post in the hole
and<00:02:10.500> set<00:02:11.400> pretty<00:02:12.000> much<00:02:12.209> where<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and set pretty much where we want it and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.089 
and set pretty much where we want it and
it<00:02:14.010> nice<00:02:14.159> and<00:02:14.190> straight<00:02:14.640> before<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:16.830> start

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
it nice and straight before you start

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.619 
it nice and straight before you start
pouring<00:02:17.400> our<00:02:17.489> concrete<00:02:17.849> there<00:02:18.209> we<00:02:18.299> go

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
pouring our concrete there we go

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.360 
pouring our concrete there we go
feels<00:02:19.080> like<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.260> sleeting<00:02:19.530> towards<00:02:19.920> me<00:02:20.159> but

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
feels like a sleeting towards me but

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.780 
feels like a sleeting towards me but
okay<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.239> then<00:02:21.390> slider<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.140> side<00:02:22.790> now

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
okay and then slider on this side now

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.490 
okay and then slider on this side now
this<00:02:24.000> fast-setting<00:02:24.420> concrete<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.290> mix

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
this fast-setting concrete you can mix

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
this fast-setting concrete you can mix
it<00:02:25.620> up<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.920> buggy<00:02:26.130> we're<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.209> doing

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
it up in a buggy we're going to be doing

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.490 
it up in a buggy we're going to be doing
those<00:02:27.569> we're<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.020> just<00:02:28.230> dump<00:02:28.380> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
those we're going to just dump a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.610 
those we're going to just dump a
directly<00:02:28.860> into<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.160> hole

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
directly into the hole

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.170 
directly into the hole
and<00:02:29.739> then<00:02:29.860> we'll<00:02:30.010> add<00:02:30.160> some<00:02:30.400> water<00:02:30.550> makes<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
and then we'll add some water makes the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.210 
and then we'll add some water makes the
process<00:02:31.629> what<00:02:31.870> we're<00:02:32.050> doing<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.530> little<00:02:33.099> bit

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
process what we're doing a little bit

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.400 
process what we're doing a little bit
easier<00:02:33.580> what<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.510> want<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.720> do<00:02:34.840> is<00:02:35.050> put<00:02:35.319> in

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
easier what you want to do is put in

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.830 
easier what you want to do is put in
probably<00:02:35.680> about<00:02:35.980> half<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.489> a<00:02:36.580> bag<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.180> then

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
probably about half of a bag and then

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.570 
probably about half of a bag and then
we'll<00:02:38.170> soak<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.620> with<00:02:38.650> water<00:02:38.950> let<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.370> soak

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
we'll soak it with water let that soak

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.790 
we'll soak it with water let that soak
in<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.030> then<00:02:40.090> add<00:02:40.390> more<00:02:40.750> dry<00:02:41.110> mix<00:02:41.379> and<00:02:41.620> then<00:02:41.769> a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
in and then add more dry mix and then a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.199 
in and then add more dry mix and then a
little<00:02:42.010> more<00:02:42.160> water<00:02:42.310> just<00:02:42.640> kind<00:02:42.879> of<00:02:42.940> keep

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
little more water just kind of keep

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.809 
little more water just kind of keep
working<00:02:43.599> our<00:02:43.750> way<00:02:43.780> as<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.830> adjust<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.400> pole<00:02:45.580> as

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
working our way as we adjust the pole as

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.210 
working our way as we adjust the pole as
we<00:02:45.970> go<00:02:46.090> along

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
we go along

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.850 
we go along
the<00:02:48.220> idea<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:48.879> fill<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.420> hole<00:02:49.629> almost<00:02:50.019> to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
the idea is to fill the hole almost to

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.410 
the idea is to fill the hole almost to
the<00:02:50.980> top<00:02:51.220> with<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.459> little<00:02:51.549> bit<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.910> room<00:02:52.090> left

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
the top with a little bit of room left

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.630 
the top with a little bit of room left
for<00:02:52.660> grass<00:02:53.379> or<00:02:53.739> mulch<00:02:53.980> or<00:02:54.220> something<00:02:54.519> like

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
for grass or mulch or something like

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.490 
for grass or mulch or something like
that<00:02:54.849> then<00:02:55.569> we'll<00:02:55.690> be<00:02:55.720> able<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.080> moisten<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
that then we'll be able to moisten the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.289 
that then we'll be able to moisten the
top<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:56.980> let<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.190> set<00:02:57.370> up<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.849> shouldn't

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
top and let it set up and it shouldn't

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.229 
top and let it set up and it shouldn't
take<00:02:58.330> too<00:02:58.480> long

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
take too long

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.460 
take too long
okay<00:03:01.239> we<00:03:01.360> got<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.599> light<00:03:01.750> post<00:03:01.989> nice<00:03:02.230> and

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
okay we got the light post nice and
