00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
in Venezuela but we thought that we

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.940 
in Venezuela but we thought that we
needed<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.570> company<00:01:36.229> where<00:01:36.470> we<00:01:36.590> could<00:01:36.770> dance

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
and become professionals so when we

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
at the bull show and I think we were

it went well and we got chosen finalists
in<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.080> competition<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:53.060> thought<00:01:53.240> maybe

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
in the competition so we thought maybe

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.450 
in the competition so we thought maybe
we<00:01:53.930> were<00:01:54.020> not<00:01:54.230> so<00:01:54.470> bad<00:01:54.500> maybe<00:01:54.980> we<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:55.430> a

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
we were not so bad maybe we have a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.000
