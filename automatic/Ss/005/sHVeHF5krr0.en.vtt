00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
he must have been swimming on the right

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:08.580 
he must have been swimming on the right
on<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.260> right<00:04:57.360> up<00:04:58.360> in<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.660> rock<00:05:07.380> yeah<00:05:08.380> there

so we came off the bank and uh found
some<00:05:28.870> trout<00:05:29.199> I<00:05:29.909> guess<00:05:30.909> a<00:05:30.939> couple<00:05:31.330> hundred

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449

some trout and then uh that shut down so

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.939 
some trout and then uh that shut down so
we<00:05:36.250> came<00:05:36.400> in<00:05:36.639> a<00:05:36.669> little<00:05:36.879> bit<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.770> caught<00:05:38.770> this
