00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.020

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.710

 we had a window like this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.219
 In no case is it necessary to update 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.120
 go sightings settings multiplayer 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:04.080

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.360

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.820
 server but it was all like a sled but we 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.300
 put a tick and everything will be with us 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:42.980
 Now we will work normally 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.980
 insert now it comes 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.860

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.620

 object here here select objects 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.050
 some objects will be repeated 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.240
 since these objects have no name 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.750
 there are no objects here we see 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.110
 repeated for the sheet 3 booms are repeated 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.540
 because these objects are not recorded then 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.760
 I mean they are not at all what the first object 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.650

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:52.540

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:52.540
