00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.750
 the archer took off with the political arm of the works that is great 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.979
 script 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.999
 modeling brazilia 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.769
 distant 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.329
 I'm a distant designer 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.519
 so in the two-month project I explained 10 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.390
 the rain project 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.390
 shostak of seti is in her that I think script 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.640
 ig for now 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.689
 A.D 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.229
 the system is only doing one function 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.880
 here I sign 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.720
 the creation of 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.170
 party walls choosing with the others that kilo of pork sausage 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.530
 right 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 So I'll have the demonstration done. 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.920
 the optimism 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.030
 plans is not 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.140
 I think it helps to create the cross plan 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.060
 his size 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.800
 14 years 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 in this case if the biometric system is left configured 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.410
 of each unit 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.240
 Ã‰rika on the other there is a website 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.210
 if the plan 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.540
 Nearby 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 what tite get the client here 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.870
 So, as I said, I said 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.190
 creates pear tree said that it would be messing with cipullo marquinho to create a line of 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.190
 products of the season 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.500
 medical equipment for example 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.340
 but I can also create 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.250
 half a meter 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.250
 walls we are going to create similar to aids 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.320
 mst 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 for the record 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.710
 Well then, just choose the dead curtis 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.720
 each set 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.670
 since for the moment only has four sets configured in the opportunity 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.990
 more 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 politicians made the first 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.430
 the hearing the canopy began after it creates joy for the people 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.620
 and opened the board 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.710
 and then have another option is what to say of the line that this line 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.109
 brand 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.109
 then simply push a button or 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.039
 wall and create 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.499
 she has already created and grouped 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.180
 nothing prevents that which reduces the goal passes to testify right 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.349
 you can see 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.349
 the line was deleted 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.799
 or create participate 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.049
 shocked 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.159
 simple, right? 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.159
 I'm the only one who has motivation. 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.729
 I think that we 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.799
 It's important that every character in my profession 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.079
 stations corrÃªa 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.079
 the holy priest 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.449
 the Swiss novartis the fourth group q 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.499
 for them to fire him 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.149
 during visits 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.149
 that way in the pack with the father 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:17.869
 oksana 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.869
 not 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.789
 counts the type of materials but this is a ticket with the silver 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.669
 an initial demonstration 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.669
 the system 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:34.499
 thank you in the evening
