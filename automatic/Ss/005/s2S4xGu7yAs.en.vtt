00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:06.809
 The red effect is that I want to talk about 8 people about that performance 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.289
 I think 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.169
 That's elbaz, and you play that keyboard 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.169
 It is reminiscent of the transition to the British pope 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.869
 Cembalo was in the composition of that machine 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.749
 It is Run, but it is also in the age of that cembalo 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.559
 It is said that Ed was hard to follow the strength 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:26.349
 I am 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.979
 The shop is located in the Mashan region and hit the neck of the shop. 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:35.750
 That it is easy to get a mouth by the influence if it is shaped like tapping 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.530
 The piano in between was released and now it was now 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.720
 It's a clamshell that you can hit the piano as well 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.150
 Development has been promoted and merger name is also abbreviated 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.090
 You can walk batting 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 Yes it came to be done in the form but 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.850
 If you think about distribution historical things 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.019
 It's an honor to be able to put it out 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:00:59.690
 I mean 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.440
 by smb 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.629
 What is required of Ekko's piano 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.140
 I thought it might be like this 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.619
 It is eco different that I tried rice finish 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710
 But it is the same model 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.920
 It is a point that it is not true 45 that it is right here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.420
 a. Sunlight comes out one after another 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 draft 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.710
 Haiku was 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.710
 Fast sales 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.550
 It is different 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.920
 You are the person who is doing the eco adjustment, of the book 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.570
 High here 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.410
 Oh 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.410
 On the other hand, uniqueness was strong 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.070
 Attended a round on this circuit 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.350
 I would like to ask you a moment 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.020
 Yup 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 There is that 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 The company says 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.740
 It is good to have a long time to finish 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.489
 surely 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.489
 On the other hand 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.449
 distribution 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:22.359
 successfully 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.359
 Yono same plan 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.079
 That minute 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.819
 Floral 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.479
 I don't think it's hal how passing is happening 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.899
 Do not go 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:45.289
 Meanwhile we occur at or 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.149
 It's over 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.519
 hbo until June 8 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.799
 It has expired 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.499
 Kasuga is letting you 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:55.669
 Eva 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.829
 It is hard to understand if I try to get it last year 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.800
 I do not know whether I have been with Hokkaido but 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.490
 I already went 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.670
 ja area 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.009
 There was t- 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.519
