00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
something like that they start to give a

something like that they start to give a
video<00:02:07.979> little<00:02:08.250> bright<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.759> higher<00:02:08.940> volumes

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

video little bright at higher volumes
but<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.899> an<00:02:10.020> amplifier<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.920> drives<00:02:11.190> them<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
but with an amplifier that drives them a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.550 
but with an amplifier that drives them a
little<00:02:11.670> more<00:02:11.760> effectively<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.900> don't<00:02:13.410> think

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
little more effectively I don't think

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.040 
little more effectively I don't think
that<00:02:13.680> should<00:02:13.770> be<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.920> problem<00:02:14.129> at<00:02:14.340> all<00:02:15.050> overall

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
that should be a problem at all overall

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.320 
that should be a problem at all overall
these<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.590> pretty<00:02:16.860> good<00:02:17.209> headphones<00:02:18.209> to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
these would be pretty good headphones to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.820 
these would be pretty good headphones to
drive<00:02:18.540> straight<00:02:18.810> from<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> portable<00:02:19.530> source

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
drive straight from a portable source

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
better with an amp bass response was

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.190 
better with an amp bass response was
pretty<00:02:37.800> fun<00:02:38.300> some<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.330> us<00:02:39.540> around<00:02:39.660> here<00:02:39.900> could

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
pretty fun some of us around here could

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.620 
pretty fun some of us around here could
have<00:02:40.290> used<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:41.220> hair<00:02:41.670> more<00:02:41.700> bass<00:02:42.180> but

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
have used just a hair more bass but

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.110 
have used just a hair more bass but
that's<00:02:43.530> getting<00:02:43.710> pretty<00:02:44.100> picky

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that's getting pretty picky

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.630 
that's getting pretty picky
I<00:02:45.150> thought<00:02:45.780> these<00:02:45.960> really<00:02:46.380> had<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> very<00:02:47.340> fun

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
I thought these really had a very fun

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.200 
I thought these really had a very fun
and<00:02:47.880> involving<00:02:48.360> bass<00:02:48.570> response<00:02:49.610> not<00:02:50.610> overdone

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
and involving bass response not overdone

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.930 
and involving bass response not overdone
at<00:02:51.450> all<00:02:51.600> I'll<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.320> kind<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.650> write<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
at all I'll just kind of write in the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.480 
at all I'll just kind of write in the
mix<00:02:54.150> with<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> mid<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.810> treble<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.490> great

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
mix with the mid and treble so great

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.820 
mix with the mid and treble so great
sounding<00:02:56.850> prod<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:58.590> M<00:02:59.160> for<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.820> too<00:03:00.530> gives<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
sounding prod the M for you too gives a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.440 
sounding prod the M for you too gives a
couple<00:03:02.130> different<00:03:02.490> features<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.270> very

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
couple different features it's very

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.920 
couple different features it's very
similar<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:04.110> sounds<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.830> m4<00:03:04.980> u1<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.660> over

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
similar in sounds to the m4 u1 but over

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.340 
similar in sounds to the m4 u1 but over
here<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:08.220> right<00:03:08.430> side<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.630> little

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
here on the right side we have a little

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.710 
here on the right side we have a little
switch<00:03:10.740> can<00:03:11.670> leave<00:03:11.820> them<00:03:12.000> off<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:12.450> just<00:03:12.480> use

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
switch can leave them off and just use

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.100 
switch can leave them off and just use
them<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:12.990> passive<00:03:13.440> mode<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.900> mode

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
them in passive mode and in that mode

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.720 
them in passive mode and in that mode
they<00:03:16.290> pretty<00:03:16.470> much<00:03:16.620> sound<00:03:16.890> identical<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.520> them

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
they pretty much sound identical to them

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.810 
they pretty much sound identical to them
for<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.120> one<00:03:18.410> or<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.650> can<00:03:19.890> go<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.640> first

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
for you one or you can go to the first

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.730 
for you one or you can go to the first
position<00:03:20.970> which<00:03:21.420> will<00:03:21.600> engage<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:22.260> little

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
position which will engage a little

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.560 
position which will engage a little
audio<00:03:23.010> amplifier<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:24.180> inside<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
audio amplifier and inside the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.330 
audio amplifier and inside the
headphones<00:03:24.960> seems<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.890> give<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.160> little

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
headphones seems to give you a little

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.580 
headphones seems to give you a little
more<00:03:26.430> volume<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.209> seem<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.170> make<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> bass

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
more volume and seem to make the bass

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.500 
more volume and seem to make the bass
impact<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.520> little<00:03:29.760> bit<00:03:29.850> stronger<00:03:30.180> and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
impact just a little bit stronger and

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.540 
impact just a little bit stronger and
then<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.530> third<00:03:31.709> setting<00:03:32.130> would<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
then the third setting would be the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.120 
then the third setting would be the
acoustic<00:03:33.030> noise-canceling<00:03:33.800> so<00:03:34.800> if<00:03:34.920> you're<00:03:35.040> on

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
acoustic noise-canceling so if you're on

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.100 
acoustic noise-canceling so if you're on
an<00:03:35.220> airplane<00:03:35.370> that's<00:03:36.270> probably<00:03:36.660> going<00:03:36.930> to

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
an airplane that's probably going to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.990 
an airplane that's probably going to
help<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.709> have<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.890> little<00:03:38.040> quieter<00:03:38.490> listening

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
help you have a little quieter listening

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.949 
help you have a little quieter listening
environment<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:41.100> does<00:03:41.430> seem<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.330> impact<00:03:42.720> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
environment it does seem to impact the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.630 
environment it does seem to impact the
audio<00:03:43.230> performance<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.770> little<00:03:44.040> bit<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
audio performance a little bit the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.190 
audio performance a little bit the
mid-range<00:03:45.000> will<00:03:45.240> get<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.390> little<00:03:45.630> honky<00:03:46.020> with

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
mid-range will get a little honky with

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.590 
mid-range will get a little honky with
the<00:03:46.350> noise<00:03:46.530> canceling<00:03:47.070> turned<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:47.520> so<00:03:47.970> if

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
the noise canceling turned on so if

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.300 
the noise canceling turned on so if
you're<00:03:48.720> not<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:48.900> an<00:03:49.110> airplane<00:03:49.440> or<00:03:49.740> traveling

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
that I would probably recommend just

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.220 
that I would probably recommend just
