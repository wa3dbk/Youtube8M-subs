 Well, today I'll show you how to change your iPhone 5 battery 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.980
 In fact, it is very easy, there are only 4 screws you have to decipher at first 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.650
 Be sure to turn off your iPhone. Then there are the two bulgans under the main button 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.820
 They are special screws, so you will need special screwdrivers 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.659
 The same screwdrivers that you can use on your iPhone 4 and 4S will do the trick 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:28.289
 When you have finished removing the screws, use the cup pipette (the bigger the better) 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.710
 And place it on the screen. Then use a non-invasive plastic tool to remove the gauze 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:41.030
 From its base. Personally, I think it's a little easier when you use a razor blade 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.580
 But using a razor blade will leave some small scratches on your device 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.540
 Just raise the screen 90 degrees. Because you can see the cable tape 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.620
 Which can be torn if you move it back further 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 The battery cables are in place on the motherboard. Remove 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.000
 Screw the small screws and remove the metal bow, then 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.710
 Then you can remove the small black cable. Looks like a little lego cut. Then remove it 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.650
 (Use only by authorized personnel) and take the battery out of place and bring in your new battery 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:33.260
 Put it in place on the motherboard, like cutting the lego completely. And proved it 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.729
 Take the small metal bow and fasten it with bolts as we did before remember 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.110
 You can find replacement batteries on Amazon.com usually available at a cheap price 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.560
 I'll put a link in the description below the video so you can easily find it 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.810
 Replace the display and ensure that the screws are properly seated 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.229
 Behold, you replaced the battery successfully! 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.020

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.340
