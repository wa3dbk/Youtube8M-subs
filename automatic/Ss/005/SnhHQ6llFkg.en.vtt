 he that nests and now his soul on it 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.110
 ascended he served the alarm in the fallen 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.960
 afghan and where the sounds of bullets are like noise from 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.980
 hurricane and where the mines are in tatters all 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.310
 ripped to pieces 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.670
 I wanted to go home boy for a round of melancholy 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.850
 once a stormy night trod a detachment of mountains and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 Fields suddenly the guy pierced eyes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.240
 his tears rolled he groaned loudly 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.660
 said goodbye dear and then suddenly fell 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.750
 still had the strength and hold a big fist and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.110
 whisper softly like this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.739
 so everything blew together fire and dirt 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.070
 and the smoke goes out of life he goes young 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.059
 where did all the unread enemies come from 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.160
 then thrown at our point because 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:57.180

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.690
 which claimed hundreds of lives with it will come 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 old mother will hug the grave and will 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.390
 cry loudly losing strength already and both rubs 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.150
 nameplate of those honorary names 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.400

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.490
