00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.780 
slowly adjust it that can be kind of a
pain<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> neck<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
pain in the neck if you are out and you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.789 
pain in the neck if you are out and you
are<00:01:50.909> shooting<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:52.049> ones<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.710> you

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
are shooting with your ones and you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340 
are shooting with your ones and you
don't<00:01:52.950> have<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> tripod<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.659> somewhat

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
don't have a tripod it can be somewhat

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
don't have a tripod it can be somewhat
hard<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.189> get<00:01:56.430> used<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.000> once<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.390> get

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
hard to get used to it but once you get

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.630 
hard to get used to it but once you get
used<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.439> amazing<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.219> it'll<00:01:59.490> give

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
used to it it is amazing and it'll give

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.999 
used to it it is amazing and it'll give
you<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.030> best<00:02:00.329> possible<00:02:01.229> image<00:02:01.500> alright<00:02:01.920> so

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you the best possible image alright so

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.260 
you the best possible image alright so
now<00:02:02.159> I'm<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> talk<00:02:02.759> about<00:02:02.790> auto

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
now I'm going to talk about auto

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.179 
now I'm going to talk about auto
focusing<00:02:03.960> now<00:02:04.469> there<00:02:04.649> are<00:02:04.740> actually<00:02:05.040> two

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
focusing now there are actually two

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.889 
focusing now there are actually two
different<00:02:05.219> ways<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> auto<00:02:06.299> focus<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> don't

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
different ways to auto focus I don't

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.240 
different ways to auto focus I don't
want<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> people<00:02:07.200> don't<00:02:07.439> understand<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.950> one

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
want to people don't understand that one

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
want to people don't understand that one
is<00:02:08.429> much<00:02:08.670> faster<00:02:09.090> than<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> other<00:02:09.590> when<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
is much faster than the other when you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.160 
is much faster than the other when you
are<00:02:10.770> working<00:02:10.890> down<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
are working down the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.440 
are working down the
when<00:02:12.410> you're<00:02:12.530> looking<00:02:12.830> through<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.520> actual

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
when you're looking through the actual

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.170 
when you're looking through the actual
viewfinder<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.770> achieve<00:02:16.100> focus<00:02:16.520> much<00:02:16.760> faster

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
viewfinder you achieve focus much faster

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.240 
viewfinder you achieve focus much faster
I'm<00:02:17.270> going<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.600> do<00:02:17.780> an<00:02:17.930> example<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.830> I'm<00:02:19.100> going

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
I'm going to do an example and I'm going

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.490 
I'm going to do an example and I'm going
to<00:02:19.340> say<00:02:19.580> when<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.120> did<00:02:20.360> focus<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.260> don't

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
to say when it did focus because I don't

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.100 
to say when it did focus because I don't
have<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.490> beep<00:02:23.120> turned<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.870> guys

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
have the the beep turned on so you guys

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.320 
have the the beep turned on so you guys
can't<00:02:24.500> really<00:02:24.800> know<00:02:24.920> but<00:02:25.550> I'm<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.819> going<00:02:26.000> to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
can't really know but I'm just going to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.740 
can't really know but I'm just going to
actually<00:02:27.080> zoom<00:02:27.380> out<00:02:28.040> all<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.580> way<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.940> put<00:02:28.970> my

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
actually zoom out all the way and put my

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.380 
actually zoom out all the way and put my
focus<00:02:30.020> on<00:02:30.170> infinity<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.550> make<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.910> basically

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
focus on infinity to make it basically

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.780 
focus on infinity to make it basically
the<00:02:32.510> same<00:02:32.720> on<00:02:33.080> both<00:02:33.500> different<00:02:34.100> test<00:02:34.310> examples

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the same on both different test examples

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.199 
the same on both different test examples
and<00:02:35.530> we've<00:02:36.530> already<00:02:36.770> achieved<00:02:37.010> focus<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.060> was

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
and we've already achieved focus it was

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.770 
and we've already achieved focus it was
that<00:02:38.420> fast

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
that fast

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.140 
that fast
I<00:02:38.810> wouldn't<00:02:39.170> put<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.010> camera<00:02:40.580> up<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:41.000> my<00:02:41.120> eye

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
I wouldn't put the camera up to my eye

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.800 
I wouldn't put the camera up to my eye
and<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:42.350> achieved<00:02:42.800> focus<00:02:43.340> now<00:02:44.030> I'm<00:02:44.330> going<00:02:44.630> to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
and it achieved focus now I'm going to

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.699 
and it achieved focus now I'm going to
switch<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.440> into<00:02:45.620> Y<00:02:46.250> view<00:02:46.700> or<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.600> see<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.230> wide

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
switch it into Y view or you see a wide

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.920 
switch it into Y view or you see a wide
representation<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.730> what<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.209> are<00:02:50.330> taking<00:02:50.630> a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
representation of what you are taking a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.620 
representation of what you are taking a
picture<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.380> on<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.190> LCD<00:02:52.670> screen<00:02:52.850> I'm<00:02:53.570> going

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
picture of on the LCD screen I'm going

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.380 
picture of on the LCD screen I'm going
to<00:02:53.810> focus<00:02:54.230> back<00:02:54.620> out<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.280> infinity<00:02:55.670> again<00:02:56.000> to

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
to focus back out to infinity again to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.259 
to focus back out to infinity again to
make<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.570> fair<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.260> now<00:02:58.070> I'm<00:02:58.310> going<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.880> zoom

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
make it fair and now I'm going to zoom

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.320 
make it fair and now I'm going to zoom
out<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.630> a<00:03:00.230> hundred<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.190> five<00:03:01.550> millimeters

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
out to a hundred and five millimeters

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.990 
out to a hundred and five millimeters
like<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.930> did<00:03:03.140> before<00:03:03.290> now<00:03:03.980> I'm<00:03:04.070> going<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.519> focus

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
like I did before now I'm going to focus

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.860 
like I did before now I'm going to focus
and<00:03:05.209> see<00:03:05.330> how<00:03:05.390> long<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.660> takes<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:11.239> there<00:03:11.690> we

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
and see how long it takes and there we

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.930 
and see how long it takes and there we
go<00:03:12.050> so<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.590> took<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.920> much<00:03:13.130> longer<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.760> be

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
go so it took that much longer to be

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.479 
go so it took that much longer to be
able<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.209> achieve<00:03:14.570> focus<00:03:15.410> when<00:03:15.890> using<00:03:16.130> live

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
able to achieve focus when using live

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.460 
able to achieve focus when using live
view<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:17.180> Y<00:03:17.329> view<00:03:17.510> takes<00:03:17.750> much<00:03:17.930> longer<00:03:18.140> when

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
view so Y view takes much longer when

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.620 
view so Y view takes much longer when
you're<00:03:18.590> trying<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.950> get<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:19.880> focus<00:03:20.420> point

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
you're trying to get a focus point

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.720 
you're trying to get a focus point
that's<00:03:21.049> something<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.620> keep<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.070> mind<00:03:22.310> because

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
that's something to keep in mind because

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.460 
that's something to keep in mind because
that<00:03:22.910> can<00:03:23.060> be<00:03:23.090> crucial<00:03:23.780> if<00:03:24.079> there<00:03:24.320> is<00:03:24.440> a

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
that can be crucial if there is a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.860 
that can be crucial if there is a
fast-moving<00:03:25.310> object<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.480> want<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.720> take

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
fast-moving object and you want to take

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.270 
fast-moving object and you want to take
a<00:03:26.900> picture<00:03:27.140> definitely<00:03:27.769> make<00:03:27.920> sure<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.190> be

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
a picture definitely make sure to be

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.190 
a picture definitely make sure to be
taking<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.670> picture<00:03:28.700> through<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.810> viewfinder

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
taking a picture through the viewfinder

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.850 
taking a picture through the viewfinder
now<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.010> reason<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:32.209> is<00:03:32.390> because<00:03:32.930> Canon

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
now the reason that is is because Canon

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.009 
now the reason that is is because Canon
has<00:03:34.040> been<00:03:34.250> using<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:35.150> viewfinder<00:03:35.480> in<00:03:35.900> the

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
has been using the viewfinder in the

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
a little bit off I didn't research it

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.430 
a little bit off I didn't research it
but<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.239> is<00:03:44.420> just<00:03:44.570> knowledge<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.230> know

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.360 
but this is just knowledge that I know
and<00:03:46.040> why<00:03:46.790> view<00:03:47.390> has<00:03:47.600> only<00:03:47.750> been<00:03:47.930> around<00:03:48.140> for

and why view has only been around for

and why view has only been around for
seven<00:03:49.370> or<00:03:49.549> five<00:03:49.579> years<00:03:50.450> so<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.290> something

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
seven or five years so that is something

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.039 
seven or five years so that is something
to<00:03:51.590> keep<00:03:52.160> in<00:03:52.400> mind<00:03:52.459> all<00:03:53.120> right<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.540> wrap
