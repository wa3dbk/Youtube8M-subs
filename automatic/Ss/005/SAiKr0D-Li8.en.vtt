 yes 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.020
 and more 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.510
 they see gamers and December 5 and 7 in 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.710
 feria de madrid buy your tickets in 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.710
 point gamer is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 very good guys welcome to the channel 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.400
 of youtube of the lvbp we continue with these 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.640
 call outs in advanced work fer today we 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.370
 touch retreat a map put here in the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.860
 jungle something like a luxury hotel with 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.330
 spa and everything and the truth I must say one 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.550
 of the maps that aesthetically more 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.589
 like and at the level of structure also the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.000
 truth is that this one is very good this is 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.400
 one of my favorite maps not to mention 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.080
 the one that as always you already know 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.970
 I always say this is a version 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.590
 preliminary call outs not much 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.180
 less will they be the definitive ones 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.130
 but it will help us a bit to go 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.259
 naming the areas and we can 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.759
 Orient a little better on these maps 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.500
 which are obviously new for all 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.050
 so nothing will we start to give us 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 a tour of this in retreat you know 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.850
 a rainy map all day raining 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.530
 but good is enjoyed equally by now 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.390
 I say that aesthetic white building very 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.030
 nice everything we start if you think 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.039
 here as you can imagine this is the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.539
 pool is one of the outdoor areas 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.940
 in the back of the pool and 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.470
 this would be the roof of the pool 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.240
 place where I am right now 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.080
 if we move here to the right we 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.870
 We will find 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.210
 ubs that hit me against the wall friends 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.490
 the wall this structure here we're going 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.500
 to name the wall and as you see we have 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.720
 on one side views towards the pool and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.120
 on the side on the other side views to 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.430
 this zen garden with a turtle in the middle 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.510
 that we are going to call directly 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.300
 turtle because it is the element 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.010
 obviously more representative of this 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.890
 this very nice map the light bulbs 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.750
 there are also there, we continue with the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.180
 part of the outside then we'll go in later 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.460
 inside if you think these are some 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.020
 stairs stairs behind but I say 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.550
 then later from inside the building what 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.560
 we will see everything much better we continue by the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.410
 part of outside and this we see here is 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.150
 the way as you see all this will be the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.370
 area of ​​the road if we see someone else 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.230
 above, we can tell you what is 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.380
 closer to the turtle here that is 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.880
 closer to the ladder of the road to the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.590
 staircase on the road and here it is 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.510
 in the covered area of ​​the road this area 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.850
 that is stuck here a little bit 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.620
 below outside of this structure that is 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.110
 the white to this is called the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.540
 white the white top would be this area 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.710
 from here and just below because the white 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.750
 down we continue on the outside if you think 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.440
 we are exactly in this 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.410
 structure 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.240
 that is called the target and we continue and we 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.250
 we found the bar area this is the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.070
 outside bar area the bar terrace 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.740
 the tables of the bar and so on and this is the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.020
 bar counter so simple there is a 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.790
 zone more than this is from outside an area 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.560
 a little more exterior to which we are going to 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.840
 to name the river as you see is all 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.810
 wet the soil so they are usually 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.850
 denominate this area the river area we 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.710
 we put in here to see the hammocks 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.210
 this is the hammock room the 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.970
 staircase of the hammocks we can go out 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.030
 out to a structure that has to 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.670
 has it mounted around as you see this 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.330
 would be the area the platform of the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.140
 hammocks is hammocks up simply 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.390
 we continue on the outside 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.580
 we will continue to name those areas 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.590
 closest to the building and this is the 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.030
 area of ​​the caves we have already finished is 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.160
 we have finished seeing the return to 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.020
 unique that yes this rock here that is 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.910
 a rock that is often used a lot as 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.010
 Coverage is often referred to as rock 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.380
 of pool because here as you see already 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.960
 we go back to the pool so this would be 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.580
 the pool rock we could give a 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.490
 turn out we're going to get in 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.290
 inside the building and we enter the 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.870
 and this is called the lobby with 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.140
 the sculpture of the central part these 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.700
 are the sofas it is important to look at 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.710
 that the sofas have as is the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.450
 green sign that big television 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.910
 green so when we have someone 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.990
 here we know it's on sofas and if it's 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.880
 here we know that he is in 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.010
 computers is worth this we're going to 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.600
 name computers 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.730
 we're in the lobby so we're going to 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.090
 go out here for out because this 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.080
 staircase here is usually called 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.120
 precisely lobby stairs 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.400
 precisely because we are good 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.470
 towards the lobby through a 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.470
 through this door and we have gone through 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.420
 as you see this right here is the link you 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.130
 they usually call core core several 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.050
 things as a central area we 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.180
 we are going to name the link and this 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.860
 you see here are the arcs of the nexus 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.230
 that later also each one 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.230
 will identify in the best way the 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.950
 that you see more timely is this plant 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.260
 part of outside 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.120
 this platform here will be the platform 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.070
 of the lobby because it is the one that is most 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.860
 near these two entries that 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.270
 precisely they give us access to the lobby 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.830
 we cross the nexus if you think that 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.800
 part of there would be him 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.630
 of the nexus and this here are the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.700
 hotel stairs why why by 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.800
 this door we will enter the hotel 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.660
 this is the structure of the hotel the 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.670
 hotel building that is a monolith in 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.470
 the central part these are the stairs 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.750
 we are going to double them doubles 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.480
 hotel to differentiate them from the 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.610
 exterior hotel stairs this is 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.250
 the hotel platform where there is a 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.630
 hard point as you well know and little else 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.370
 in the area of ​​the hotel ah well if there 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.400
 some stairs behind that are the 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.320
 stairs behind the hotel where 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.300
 we can enter to this platform 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.700
 is here you see here we can access 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.620
 also to the turtle area we are 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.560
 in the hotel and I think we have left 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.020
 I really have a small draft left 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.630
 just already in the part of the 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.030
 pool and this is here from here 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.000
 it is called spa we enter from the 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.160
 pool and here we can enter the 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.760
 space we went through the spa as we arrived 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.610
 again to the nexus and around here we will return 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.390
 the lobby as you can see has no 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.890
 superior structure 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.840
 and I also need a small 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.860
 platform here to which we are going to 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.750
 name the hotel platform 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.670
 this is a platform as you see 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.140
 It also gives me to the entrance of the hotel and 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.360
 around here we see that we have the 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.510
 white from before we had already seen 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.920
 in advance to forgiveness and this one here 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.830
 that is the last bit since I have left 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.720
 this is the shortcut this is called the 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.270
 shortcut as you see we come from the area 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.770
 of the road and the white etcetera is a 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.080
 scald very tiny that gives us access 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.420
 directly towards the good turtle with 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.700
 the turtle said goodbye seeing the 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.380
 retreat channels as you already know that 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.510
 incorporate new maps and we will continue 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.520
 with the series as they are added 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.170
 maps what is said to the rules of this 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.890
 advanced uav thanks for good guys 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.890
 until the next 8
