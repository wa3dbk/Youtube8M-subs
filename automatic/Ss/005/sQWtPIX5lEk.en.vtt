swimming around or something I'm trying

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:35.800 
swimming around or something I'm trying
to<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.420> i<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.630> find<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.550

it's a pretty fucking empty though I
mean<00:00:39.560> I<00:00:39.620> guess<00:00:39.710> it's<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.160> first<00:00:40.400> iteration<00:00:40.940> of

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
mean I guess it's the first iteration of

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.520 
mean I guess it's the first iteration of
that

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.530 

to<00:02:57.420> be<00:02:57.570> like<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.780> mini<00:02:58.050> boss<00:02:58.290> or<00:02:58.530> something<00:02:59.540> it's

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
probably I'm guessing this could have

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.370 
probably I'm guessing this could have
been<00:03:02.160> something<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.610> what<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:02.850> won't<00:03:03.030> were

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
been something of what they won't were

been something of what they won't were
expecting<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.560> be<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:09.530> will<00:03:10.530> not<00:03:10.740> do<00:03:11.070> that

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.260 

conduit<00:03:29.480> highlining<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:33.490> 93<00:03:34.490> thick<00:03:34.790> wooden

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
conduit highlining the 93 thick wooden

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.940 
conduit highlining the 93 thick wooden
pin

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.970 

there's<00:03:42.550> moms<00:03:42.849> and<00:03:43.300> their<00:03:43.510> lives<00:03:43.840> must<00:03:44.709> kill

there's moms and their lives must kill
them<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.819> fight<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.660> over<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:49.980> think<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.040> killed

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
them this fight is over I think I killed

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:09.910 
them this fight is over I think I killed
like<00:03:51.550> four<00:03:51.790> guys<00:03:56.310> sounds<00:03:57.310> like<00:03:57.400> standard

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.120 

it<00:04:10.920> cannot<00:04:11.310> be<00:04:11.430> done<00:04:11.819> being<00:04:12.390> level<00:04:12.709> yeah<00:04:13.709> I

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
it cannot be done being level yeah I

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.680 
it cannot be done being level yeah I
thought<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.180> was<00:04:15.270> thick<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.540> one

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
thought that it was thick the one

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.970 
thought that it was thick the one
screenshot<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:16.260> saw<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:16.739> or<00:04:16.829> whatever

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
screenshot that I saw of it or whatever

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.060 
screenshot that I saw of it or whatever
and<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.370> was<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.820> looked<00:04:18.030> pretty<00:04:18.180> small<00:04:18.540> so<00:04:19.070> I'm

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and it was it looked pretty small so I'm

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.400 
and it was it looked pretty small so I'm
guessing<00:04:20.280> there's<00:04:20.579> ice<00:04:21.420> melt<00:04:21.870> smaller<00:04:22.140> and

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
guessing there's ice melt smaller and

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:37.480 
guessing there's ice melt smaller and
larger<00:04:22.530> versions

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:48.770 

what<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.670> ask<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.210> impossible

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.990 

still<00:04:49.780> not<00:04:50.230> even<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.710> whole<00:04:50.980> other<00:04:51.670> side

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
still not even like a whole other side

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.150 
still not even like a whole other side
of<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.210> over<00:04:52.390> there

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.020 

ok

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
ok

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.180 
ok
I'm<00:04:58.540> coming<00:05:00.660> slowly<00:05:01.660> but<00:05:01.780> surely<00:05:02.230> as<00:05:02.980> you're

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
I'm coming slowly but surely as you're

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.780 
I'm coming slowly but surely as you're
already<00:05:03.310> telling<00:05:03.520> everything<00:05:08.640> yeah<00:05:09.640> this

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
already telling everything yeah this

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.330 
already telling everything yeah this
place<00:05:09.910> is<00:05:10.000> pretty<00:05:10.900> huge<00:05:11.140> nice<00:05:11.890> if<00:05:12.100> there<00:05:12.190> was

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
place is pretty huge nice if there was

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.050 
place is pretty huge nice if there was
mom's<00:05:13.000> here<00:05:13.270> bud

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.879 

I<00:05:19.880> think<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:20.940> other<00:05:21.060> guy<00:05:21.210> who<00:05:21.270> ended<00:05:21.570> up

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
I think the other guy who ended up

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.960 
I think the other guy who ended up
