is each college does it differently and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
university should be run like businesses

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.190 
university should be run like businesses
or<00:02:32.489> not<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.630> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.989> be<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.170> a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
know about and so there's nothing to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.270 
know about and so there's nothing to
worry<00:02:39.060> about<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:40.160> finally<00:02:41.160> I'd<00:02:41.250> like
