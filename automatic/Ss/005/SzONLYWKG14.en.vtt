00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello welcome to hardware advice in 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.519
 this video the update is 1400 euro 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.330
 gaming computers january 2014 as 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.820
 processor of the intel core i7 4770 came with 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.020
 4 times 3 5 gigahertz he has a turbo 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.289
 partly from 3.9 ghz 84 watt tdp one

 integrated graphics unit the intel hd 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.550
 4600 he took a boat that means

 a free multiplier so free 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 overclock and hyperthread the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 means anyone can has two threads as 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.600
 a theoretical eight-chamber this 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.340
 brings a bit more power 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.290
 Endspiele the eight cores support 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.250
 such as crysis 3 or 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.350
 battlefield 4 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.480
 of course rich processor for everyone 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.920
 current games loose and should 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.989
 for gamer the next three to five

 weak what can you overclock in it 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.250
 as cpu cooler and thermal woodland 02 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.140
 macho it's a pretty big cpu 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.879
 cooler for a very reasonable price and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.160
 with that is quiet operate or 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.510
 Overclock possible then as mainboard 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.860
 the msz 87 g 45 gaming with the intel sz 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.850
 87 chipset 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.680
 it has usb3 sata3 four ddr3 ram banks 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:18.840
 pci express 3.0 17.11 chip and on europe 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.170
 just once ps 2 2 x usb 2 4 x usb 3 a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.110
 lan socket vga dvi and hdmi for the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.020
 Integrated graphics unit 6 35 mm 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.820
 Latch and east left a coaxial 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.829
 output for the sound chip as 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.909
 Memory eight gigabytes are crucial 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.759
 ballistix board ddr3 1600 m count 90 kit 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.060
 ddr3 1600 and count nine is pretty 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.159
 briskly 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.890

 ssd the 120 gb samsung 840 evo it is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.340
 a very fast ssd and 120 gb 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.610
 sufficient for the operating system all 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.070
 programs and 102 games as fest fest 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.750
 the seagate desktop hdd it is a 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.670
 above-average fast hdd and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.590
 a terabyte pay for most

 geforce gtx 87 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.670
 it is one of the strongest currently 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.530
 graphics cards on the market the gtx 87 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.379
 he is so strong on the standard clock 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.090
 like the 290 ticks on the book block you 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.680
 he is additionally convinced again 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.719
 and with it you can all

 4 black flag for free 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.780
 as a power supply the 480 watt be quite 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.400
 straight power e9 it's very energy 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.409
 save thanks to 80 plus gold

 samsung and as housing the corsair 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.010
 Karachi ripped 200 it's a something 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.870
 worse housing with any amount 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.760
 space inside but true of course 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.319
 decide for yourself which yes take
