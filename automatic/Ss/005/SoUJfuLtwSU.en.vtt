hey YouTube this is gonna be a quick
update<00:00:07.580> of<00:00:08.180> the<00:00:08.389> Genesis<00:00:09.459> g500<00:00:10.459> road<00:00:10.700> bicycle

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
update of the Genesis g500 road bicycle

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.810 
update of the Genesis g500 road bicycle
finally<00:00:12.320> got<00:00:12.469> to<00:00:12.559> take<00:00:12.740> this<00:00:12.889> out<00:00:13.100> on<00:00:13.129> the<00:00:13.580> road

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
finally got to take this out on the road

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.439 
finally got to take this out on the road
and<00:00:14.180> put<00:00:14.360> about<00:00:14.420> 11<00:00:14.900> 12<00:00:15.680> miles<00:00:16.039> on<00:00:16.490> it<00:00:16.520> and<00:00:16.910> just

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
and put about 11 12 miles on it and just

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.220 
and put about 11 12 miles on it and just
kind<00:00:17.660> of<00:00:18.849> ran<00:00:19.849> it<00:00:20.000> through<00:00:20.269> its<00:00:20.390> paces<00:00:20.480> just<00:00:21.140> to

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
kind of ran it through its paces just to

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.890 
kind of ran it through its paces just to
see<00:00:21.410> how<00:00:21.619> it<00:00:21.800> would<00:00:21.919> hold<00:00:22.130> up<00:00:22.339> and<00:00:22.900> starting

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
see how it would hold up and starting

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.599 
see how it would hold up and starting
off<00:00:24.050> with<00:00:24.320> actually<00:00:24.710> it's<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.220> very<00:00:25.460> nice

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
off with actually it's a very nice

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.909 
off with actually it's a very nice
little<00:00:25.999> bike<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:27.140> first<00:00:27.169> thing<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:27.829> did<00:00:27.910> was<00:00:28.910> I

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
little bike the first thing I did was I

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.270 
little bike the first thing I did was I
adjusted<00:00:30.919> all<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:32.410> gears<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.800> shifters<00:00:34.250> and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
adjusted all the gears and shifters and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.180 
adjusted all the gears and shifters and
derailleurs<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.210> everything<00:00:35.600> looking<00:00:36.500> back

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
derailleurs and everything looking back

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.530 
derailleurs and everything looking back
here<00:00:37.790> you've<00:00:38.300> got<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.540> couple<00:00:38.840> little<00:00:39.080> screws

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
here you've got a couple little screws

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.590 
here you've got a couple little screws
see<00:00:41.540> if<00:00:41.630> I<00:00:41.690> can<00:00:41.810> get<00:00:41.930> this<00:00:42.050> camera<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.530> focus

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
see if I can get this camera to focus

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.710 
see if I can get this camera to focus
there<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:44.690> go<00:00:45.400> these<00:00:46.400> two<00:00:46.460> right<00:00:47.060> here<00:00:47.450> are<00:00:47.510> the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
there we go these two right here are the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.920 
there we go these two right here are the
important<00:00:48.170> ones<00:00:48.380> and<00:00:48.680> that<00:00:49.460> just<00:00:49.940> adjusts

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
important ones and that just adjusts

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.490 
important ones and that just adjusts
this<00:00:51.590> sprocket<00:00:52.010> backwards<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.120> forwards<00:00:53.540> so

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
this sprocket backwards and forwards so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.150 
this sprocket backwards and forwards so
it's<00:00:54.650> the<00:00:54.770> fine<00:00:55.010> tuning<00:00:55.430> on<00:00:55.520> how<00:00:55.700> this<00:00:55.880> shifts

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
it's the fine tuning on how this shifts

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.200 
it's the fine tuning on how this shifts
the<00:00:58.160> next<00:00:58.460> thing<00:00:58.700> is<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:01.430> course<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:01.970> guy

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
the next thing is of course this guy

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.310 
the next thing is of course this guy
here<00:01:02.710> well<00:01:03.710> just<00:01:04.610> some<00:01:04.909> small<00:01:05.540> things<00:01:05.840> as<00:01:06.080> well

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
here well just some small things as well

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.450 
here well just some small things as well
but<00:01:07.270> that's<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.840> back<00:01:09.140> derailleur<00:01:09.740> front

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
but that's the back derailleur front

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.929 
but that's the back derailleur front
derailleur<00:01:11.049> you've<00:01:12.049> got<00:01:12.320> two<00:01:13.280> right<00:01:13.549> here

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
derailleur you've got two right here

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.380 
derailleur you've got two right here
what's<00:01:14.179> your<00:01:14.270> your<00:01:14.509> two<00:01:14.749> stops<00:01:15.729> on<00:01:16.729> how<00:01:16.909> far<00:01:17.240> it

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
what's your your two stops on how far it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.059 
what's your your two stops on how far it
goes<00:01:17.509> this<00:01:17.749> way<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:17.990> how<00:01:18.259> far<00:01:18.619> it<00:01:18.710> goes<00:01:18.859> this

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
goes this way and how far it goes this

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.219 
goes this way and how far it goes this
way<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.490> one<00:01:19.609> thing<00:01:19.789> I<00:01:19.880> had<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.090> do<00:01:20.359> was

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
way and one thing I had to do was

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.529 
way and one thing I had to do was
actually<00:01:21.409> loosen<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.520> bolt<00:01:22.759> right<00:01:22.969> here<00:01:23.390> and

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
actually loosen the bolt right here and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.539 
actually loosen the bolt right here and
lift<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.590> up<00:01:24.770> because<00:01:25.100> there<00:01:25.219> wasn't<00:01:25.399> enough

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
lift this up because there wasn't enough

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.639 
lift this up because there wasn't enough
tension<00:01:26.149> on<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:27.729> cable<00:01:28.729> there<00:01:29.259> most<00:01:30.259> bikes

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
tension on the cable there most bikes

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.489 
tension on the cable there most bikes
will<00:01:31.159> come<00:01:31.460> with<00:01:31.939> a<00:01:31.969> little<00:01:32.450> adjustment<00:01:33.170> nut

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
will come with a little adjustment nut

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.440 
will come with a little adjustment nut
back<00:01:33.920> here<00:01:34.219> that<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.399> can<00:01:34.609> just<00:01:34.639> twist<00:01:35.119> and

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
back here that you can just twist and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.969 
back here that you can just twist and
put<00:01:35.630> more<00:01:35.749> attention<00:01:35.869> or<00:01:36.259> less<00:01:36.469> tension<00:01:36.770> on

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
put more attention or less tension on

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.709 
put more attention or less tension on
this<00:01:37.100> cable<00:01:37.340> well<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.329> front<00:01:38.509> derailleur

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
this cable well the front derailleur

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.679 
this cable well the front derailleur
doesn't<00:01:39.289> have<00:01:39.469> that<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:40.850> all<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.119> had<00:01:41.359> to<00:01:41.389> do<00:01:41.539> is

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
doesn't have that so all I had to do is

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.090 
doesn't have that so all I had to do is
just<00:01:41.869> raise<00:01:42.109> this<00:01:42.319> up<00:01:42.499> a<00:01:42.590> little<00:01:42.799> bit<00:01:42.920> which

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
just raise this up a little bit which

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.709 
just raise this up a little bit which
wasn't<00:01:43.399> a<00:01:43.579> big<00:01:43.759> deal<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:44.210> puts<00:01:44.479> more<00:01:44.659> tension

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
wasn't a big deal that puts more tension

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.440 
wasn't a big deal that puts more tension
on<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.200> here<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.679> then<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.369> was<00:01:46.609> able<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.909> adjust

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
on it here and then I was able to adjust

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.499 
on it here and then I was able to adjust
the<00:01:47.630> stops<00:01:47.929> forward<00:01:48.319> and<00:01:48.469> backwards<00:01:49.509> shifts

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
the stops forward and backwards shifts

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.179 
the stops forward and backwards shifts
very<00:01:50.810> very<00:01:51.049> well<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.530> actually<00:01:51.679> shifts

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
very very well and actually shifts

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.609 
very very well and actually shifts
pretty<00:01:52.429> quickly<00:01:53.109> the<00:01:54.109> front<00:01:54.439> derailleur

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
pretty quickly the front derailleur

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.539 
pretty quickly the front derailleur
which<00:01:54.950> one<00:01:55.369> thing<00:01:55.549> I<00:01:55.639> didn't<00:01:55.909> mention<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:56.990> I

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
which one thing I didn't mention in I

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.219 
which one thing I didn't mention in I
think<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.819> first<00:01:59.060> video<00:01:59.450> may<00:01:59.659> have<00:01:59.899> or<00:02:00.049> not

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
think the first video may have or not

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.300 
think the first video may have or not
but<00:02:00.920> you've<00:02:01.130> got<00:02:01.340> three<00:02:01.909> sets<00:02:02.389> of<00:02:03.039> chain<00:02:04.039> rings

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
but you've got three sets of chain rings

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.059 
but you've got three sets of chain rings
here<00:02:04.609> so<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.819> have<00:02:04.850> a<00:02:04.969> lot<00:02:05.299> of<00:02:05.709> options<00:02:06.709> for

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
here so you have a lot of options for

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.800 
here so you have a lot of options for
switching<00:02:07.700> gears<00:02:07.969> most<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.390> time<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.569> actually

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
switching gears most the time I actually

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.840 
switching gears most the time I actually
stayed<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> middle<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.830> found<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.220> worked

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
stayed in the middle I found it worked

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.020 
stayed in the middle I found it worked
pretty<00:02:11.120> well<00:02:12.370> moving<00:02:13.370> up

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
pretty well moving up

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.130 
pretty well moving up
to<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> top<00:02:16.390> you've<00:02:17.050> got<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:18.840> brakes<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
to the top you've got your brakes and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.380 
to the top you've got your brakes and
your<00:02:20.230> shifters<00:02:20.590> up<00:02:20.740> here<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:22.120> course<00:02:22.300> I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
your shifters up here and of course I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.870 
your shifters up here and of course I
had<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.540> adjust<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.980> pitch<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
had to adjust the pitch of the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.340 
had to adjust the pitch of the
handlebars<00:02:25.390> because<00:02:25.690> they<00:02:25.810> were<00:02:25.870> tipped<00:02:26.140> way

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
handlebars because they were tipped way

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.410 
handlebars because they were tipped way
too<00:02:26.410> far<00:02:26.770> down<00:02:26.950> at<00:02:27.310> least<00:02:27.460> for<00:02:27.730> me<00:02:27.880> at<00:02:28.300> that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
too far down at least for me at that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.200 
too far down at least for me at that
particular<00:02:28.570> time<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> terrible<00:02:31.000> wrap

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
particular time this is a terrible wrap

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.000 
particular time this is a terrible wrap
job<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.870> don't<00:02:32.230> know<00:02:32.320> if<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.620> people<00:02:32.740> at<00:02:32.890> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
job I don't know if the people at the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.740 
job I don't know if the people at the
store<00:02:33.220> put<00:02:33.520> this<00:02:33.610> together<00:02:33.820> or<00:02:34.150> what<00:02:34.390> but<00:02:34.600> it's

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
store put this together or what but it's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.410 
store put this together or what but it's
done<00:02:35.140> very<00:02:35.590> poorly<00:02:35.890> there's<00:02:36.700> quite<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> few

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
done very poorly there's quite a few

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.260 
done very poorly there's quite a few
cuts<00:02:37.870> if<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.320> look<00:02:38.470> underneath<00:02:38.770> here<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.880> this

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
cuts if you look underneath here in this

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.510 
cuts if you look underneath here in this
so<00:02:40.600> I'm<00:02:41.140> gonna<00:02:41.350> completely<00:02:41.740> rewrap<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.250> and

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
so I'm gonna completely rewrap it and

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.920 
so I'm gonna completely rewrap it and
it's<00:02:42.610> gonna<00:02:42.700> give<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.030> lot<00:02:43.210> nicer<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
it's gonna give it a lot nicer and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's gonna give it a lot nicer and
cleaner<00:02:44.050> look<00:02:44.680> than<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.950> does<00:02:45.130> now<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:47.230> other

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
cleaner look than it does now the other

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.070 
cleaner look than it does now the other
thing<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.800> had<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.130> adjust<00:02:48.630> was<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
thing that I had to adjust was the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.950 
thing that I had to adjust was the
brakes<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.100> brakes<00:02:51.400> are<00:02:51.700> pretty<00:02:52.630> cheap

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
brakes and the brakes are pretty cheap

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.090 
brakes and the brakes are pretty cheap
they<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:53.980> work<00:02:54.340> they<00:02:54.640> do<00:02:54.700> stop<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:56.650> don't

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
they do work they do stop you just don't

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.860 
they do work they do stop you just don't
plan<00:02:57.340> on<00:02:57.370> stopping<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> dime<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.410> your

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
plan on stopping on a dime this is your

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.570 
plan on stopping on a dime this is your
lever<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.170> open<00:03:02.530> your<00:03:02.680> brakes<00:03:02.980> up<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.460> can

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
lever to open your brakes up so you can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.850 
lever to open your brakes up so you can
pull<00:03:03.760> your<00:03:03.880> front<00:03:04.150> wheel<00:03:04.270> off<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:04.870> what<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.590> did

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
pull your front wheel off but what I did

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.050 
pull your front wheel off but what I did
is<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:07.380> set<00:03:08.380> screw<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:09.370> can<00:03:09.490> twist<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.000> and

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
is this set screw you can twist this and

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.780 
is this set screw you can twist this and
this<00:03:10.330> will<00:03:10.480> put<00:03:10.630> more<00:03:10.780> whoops<00:03:11.410> more<00:03:12.370> tension

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
this will put more whoops more tension

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.960 
this will put more whoops more tension
on<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.000> bike<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.620> that'll<00:03:14.620> set<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.430> width<00:03:15.730> of

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
on the bike and that'll set the width of

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.880 
on the bike and that'll set the width of
how<00:03:16.120> far<00:03:16.420> your<00:03:16.630> brakes<00:03:16.900> are<00:03:17.200> away<00:03:17.530> from<00:03:17.590> your

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
how far your brakes are away from your

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:27.360 
how far your brakes are away from your
wheel<00:03:18.660> when<00:03:19.660> you're<00:03:19.840> adjusting<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.950> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
wheel when you're adjusting it and the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.650 
wheel when you're adjusting it and the
pads<00:03:27.580> are<00:03:27.760> fairly<00:03:27.940> cheap<00:03:28.090> -<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.600> I'll

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
pads are fairly cheap - and I'll

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.850 
pads are fairly cheap - and I'll
probably<00:03:28.900> end<00:03:29.080> up<00:03:29.170> switching<00:03:29.410> those<00:03:29.650> that

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
probably end up switching those that

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.380 
probably end up switching those that
once<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.190> wear<00:03:30.370> them<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.610> little<00:03:30.790> bit<00:03:31.000> more<00:03:31.240> and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
once I wear them a little bit more and

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.720 
once I wear them a little bit more and
probably<00:03:31.510> wear<00:03:31.810> them<00:03:31.930> out<00:03:32.020> pretty<00:03:32.230> quick<00:03:32.730> but

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
probably wear them out pretty quick but

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.490 
probably wear them out pretty quick but
overall<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.270> was<00:03:34.540> actually<00:03:34.720> pretty<00:03:35.020> impressed

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
overall I was actually pretty impressed

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.710 
overall I was actually pretty impressed
on<00:03:36.010> how<00:03:36.190> well<00:03:36.490> it<00:03:36.520> shifted<00:03:37.200> how<00:03:38.200> smoothly<00:03:38.620> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
on how well it shifted how smoothly and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.600 
on how well it shifted how smoothly and
large<00:03:40.720> variety<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:42.540> gears<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.900> has

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
large variety of gears that it has

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.970 
large variety of gears that it has
especially<00:03:45.610> for<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.630> bike<00:03:47.050> that<00:03:47.080> ran<00:03:47.530> right<00:03:47.560> at

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
especially for a bike that ran right at

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.410 
especially for a bike that ran right at
$400<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:50.440> was<00:03:50.590> 399<00:03:51.430> plus<00:03:51.730> tax<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.270> actually

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
$400 this was 399 plus tax I actually

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.910 
$400 this was 399 plus tax I actually
came<00:03:52.690> up<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.930> write<00:03:53.230> out<00:03:53.350> four<00:03:53.590> hundred<00:03:53.860> and

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
came up to write out four hundred and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.720 
came up to write out four hundred and
thirteen<00:03:54.340> dollars<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.739> if<00:03:56.860> in<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.190> market<00:03:57.520> for

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
thirteen dollars so if in the market for

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.550 
thirteen dollars so if in the market for
a<00:03:57.790> beginner<00:03:58.209> road<00:03:58.510> bike<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.170> a<00:03:59.200> great

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
a beginner road bike this is a great

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.140 
a beginner road bike this is a great
beginner<00:03:59.860> world<00:04:00.130> bike<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.580> rose<00:04:00.760> right<00:04:01.000> at

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
beginner world bike it rose right at

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.750 
beginner world bike it rose right at
twenty<00:04:01.390> four<00:04:01.570> pounds<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:03.340> if<00:04:03.459> you<00:04:03.550> through<00:04:03.730> a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
twenty four pounds and if you through a

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.030 
twenty four pounds and if you through a
couple<00:04:03.910> lighter<00:04:04.209> things<00:04:04.540> on<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.900> I'm<00:04:05.830> sure

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
couple lighter things on it I'm sure

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.860 
couple lighter things on it I'm sure
these<00:04:06.160> tires<00:04:06.459> are<00:04:06.730> pretty<00:04:06.850> cheap<00:04:07.180> too<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:07.810> if

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
these tires are pretty cheap too so if

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.740 
these tires are pretty cheap too so if
you<00:04:07.930> threw<00:04:08.200> some<00:04:08.410> more<00:04:09.070> expensive<00:04:09.370> tires<00:04:09.820> on

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
you threw some more expensive tires on

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.660 
you threw some more expensive tires on
it<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.709> can<00:04:11.860> get<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.100> weight<00:04:12.250> down<00:04:12.430> can

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
it you can get the weight down can

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.070 
it you can get the weight down can
substantially<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:16.060> know<00:04:16.150> through<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.510> lighter

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
substantially you know through a lighter
