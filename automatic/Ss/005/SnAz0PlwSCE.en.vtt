00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.310
 today Nestor is going to put the batteries to a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.680
 promising athlete of 30 ning pianist 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.690
 pater a young 21 year old team 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.760
 asics that will give a lot to talk about 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 hello if you want to improve your performance 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.410
 in the mountain race you should not only 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.900
 dedicate yourself to running today we will work 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.360
 three fundamental aspects to improve 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.910
 said performance first of all the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.880
 second technique stability 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 and finally how to work exercises 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.719
 physical condition to improve the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.640
 performance with the jeunesse we already have 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.310
 here we are going to start in the first block 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.649
 we will focus on the top train and 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.380
 this way we will improve our 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.329
 stability of the center of the body each 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.820
 one of the exercises you can do it 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.700
 about four repetitions 30 seconds of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.380
 work and about 15 rest we are going to 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.719
 work with the big double strutz 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.210
 through gums that are anchored in 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.370
 different parts of your body what 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.750
 let's do is challenge your balance 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 and your stability 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.619
 in this way we will improve then your 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.910
 physical condition 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.950
 it seems to me that we start 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.630
 we anchor the gums in the biceps and 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.550
 we perform the movement of arms of the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.960
 career taking the hand from the 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.000
 pocket to the ear to increase 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.520
 the difficulty of the exercise we anchor the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.800
 rubbers on the wrists and we are in 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.390
 Standing position 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.640
 finally we will do a ski ping 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.680
 trying to transfer the two 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.200
 exercises performed to the movement of 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.200
 the race in this second block 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.390
 we work on the lower train two 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.800
 aspects the stride width and 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.570
 also how are the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.120
 joints to the different 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.400
 irregularities of the land with 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.590
 rubber bands anchored in the ankles we do 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.360
 the stride looking for the maximum 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.520
 possible amplitude as in the block 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.460
 1 30 seconds of work and 15 of 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.740
 rest we turn around looking at the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.450
 anchor point and we seek to work the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.340
 extensor musculature back to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.770
 also as widely as possible 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.740
 with the bands anchored in the quadriceps 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.540
 we will do some skip stopping every three 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.239
 times and with a small displacement 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.220
 lateral we have reached the last block 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.090
 in which we will transfer all these 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.410
 to the improvement of your physical condition 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.840
 we anchor the four tires at the level of the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.550
 hip and we will make some slopes where 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.220
 the coach will increase the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.050
 resistance over the athlete with 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.060
 rubber bands anchored at the ankles and 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.430
 dolls we will make some scripts 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.470
 first in static and the signal in 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.420
 dynamic with displacement to be able 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.700
 transfer this to the race to the signal 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.830
 we stop doing the ski ping we drop 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.380
 the elastics and the athlete will run for the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.690
 terrain naturally so far the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.310
 selection in today's form I hope that 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.690
 work with these exercises to 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.690
 improve our career times
