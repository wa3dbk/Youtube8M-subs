terraforming<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:50.460> it's<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.850> little<00:05:51.120> bit

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
terraforming so it's a little bit

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.290 
terraforming so it's a little bit
luckier<00:05:51.720> than<00:05:51.780> usual<00:05:52.350> but<00:05:53.250> it's<00:05:53.460> yeah<00:05:53.940> usually

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
luckier than usual but it's yeah usually

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
I'm really good on this server this is

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.620 
I'm really good on this server this is
hardly<00:05:56.310> any<00:05:56.460> lack<00:05:56.669> at<00:05:56.850> all<00:05:59.030> so<00:06:00.030> let's<00:06:00.240> just<00:06:00.419> fix

hardly any lack at all so let's just fix
that<00:06:00.750> up

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
that up

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.070 
that up
oh<00:06:01.640> there<00:06:02.640> you<00:06:02.700> go<00:06:02.820> no<00:06:03.090> I'm<00:06:03.240> gonna<00:06:03.510> pee<00:06:03.810> again

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
oh there you go no I'm gonna pee again

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.880 
oh there you go no I'm gonna pee again
that's<00:06:04.350> really<00:06:04.560> weird

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
that's really weird

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
that's really weird
okay<00:06:05.520> oh<00:06:05.640> that's<00:06:05.970> just<00:06:06.120> GM<00:06:06.510> myself<00:06:06.900> again<00:06:07.169> and

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
okay oh that's just GM myself again and

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.450 
okay oh that's just GM myself again and
start<00:06:08.910> polling<00:06:09.630> fire<00:06:10.260> hazard<00:06:10.590> again<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:13.460> I

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
start polling fire hazard again but I

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.219 
start polling fire hazard again but I
guess<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.150> key<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.479> this<00:06:15.570> game<00:06:15.660> is<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:16.020> keep

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
guess the key to this game is to keep

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.409 
guess the key to this game is to keep
moving<00:06:16.470> keep<00:06:16.950> moving<00:06:17.010> to<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.520> side<00:06:17.849> and

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
moving keep moving to the side and

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.180 
moving keep moving to the side and
you're<00:06:19.380> gonna<00:06:19.500> want<00:06:19.680> that<00:06:19.770> you<00:06:19.860> don't<00:06:20.010> want<00:06:20.130> to

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
you're gonna want that you don't want to

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.530 
you're gonna want that you don't want to
just<00:06:20.310> do<00:06:20.490> what<00:06:20.640> I'm<00:06:20.760> doing<00:06:21.030> at<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.180> moment

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
just do what I'm doing at the moment

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.850 
just do what I'm doing at the moment
just<00:06:21.750> running<00:06:22.080> across<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:22.320> butters<00:06:22.710> it's

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
just running across the butters it's

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.470 
just running across the butters it's
completely<00:06:23.250> pointless<00:06:23.430> you're<00:06:24.150> gonna<00:06:24.240> want

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
completely pointless you're gonna want

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.780 
completely pointless you're gonna want
the<00:06:24.540> sort<00:06:24.750> of<00:06:24.780> aim<00:06:24.960> about<00:06:25.320> where<00:06:25.590> he<00:06:25.800> is<00:06:25.830> so<00:06:26.730> I'm

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
the sort of aim about where he is so I'm

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.220 
the sort of aim about where he is so I'm
gonna<00:06:26.970> keep<00:06:27.120> moving<00:06:27.450> because<00:06:27.510> if<00:06:27.690> you<00:06:27.810> stop

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
gonna keep moving because if you stop

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.020 
gonna keep moving because if you stop
moving<00:06:28.380> you'll<00:06:29.190> get<00:06:29.310> stuck<00:06:29.520> in<00:06:29.670> the<00:06:29.760> blocks

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
moving you'll get stuck in the blocks

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.230 
moving you'll get stuck in the blocks
and<00:06:31.220> that<00:06:32.220> would<00:06:32.340> be<00:06:32.400> really<00:06:32.520> pointless<00:06:32.880> even

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
and that would be really pointless even

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.000 
and that would be really pointless even
if<00:06:33.450> like<00:06:33.630> you're<00:06:33.840> just<00:06:34.080> your<00:06:34.290> side<00:06:34.530> stuck<00:06:34.860> in

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
if like you're just your side stuck in

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.710 
if like you're just your side stuck in
the<00:06:35.100> block<00:06:35.340> you're<00:06:35.580> still<00:06:35.820> you'll<00:06:36.360> still<00:06:36.570> get

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
the block you're still you'll still get

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.780 
the block you're still you'll still get
take<00:06:36.930> damage<00:06:37.140> the<00:06:38.040> whole<00:06:38.160> point<00:06:38.430> you<00:06:38.760> just

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
take damage the whole point you just

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.640 
take damage the whole point you just
need<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.180> keep<00:06:39.330> me<00:06:39.480> revenge<00:06:39.720> as<00:06:39.810> I<00:06:39.870> said<00:06:40.110> trying

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
need to keep me revenge as I said trying

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.230 
need to keep me revenge as I said trying
to<00:06:40.770> be<00:06:40.830> tactical<00:06:41.310> is<00:06:41.370> where<00:06:41.550> you<00:06:41.640> move<00:06:41.820> you<00:06:42.060> see

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
to be tactical is where you move you see

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.730 
to be tactical is where you move you see
where<00:06:42.420> he's<00:06:42.600> moving<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:43.020> I<00:06:43.080> move<00:06:43.290> the<00:06:43.410> opposite

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
where he's moving to I move the opposite

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.210 
where he's moving to I move the opposite
direction<00:06:43.890> so<00:06:45.440> not<00:06:46.440> like<00:06:46.590> I'm<00:06:46.770> doing<00:06:46.890> tomorrow

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
direction so not like I'm doing tomorrow

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.200 
direction so not like I'm doing tomorrow
so<00:06:47.370> like<00:06:47.520> that<00:06:47.700> there<00:06:47.880> you<00:06:47.910> go

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
so like that there you go

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.960 
so like that there you go
and<00:06:48.750> then<00:06:48.990> obviously<00:06:49.290> your<00:06:49.890> your<00:06:50.670> actual

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
and then obviously your your actual

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.390 
and then obviously your your actual
hitting<00:06:51.240> distance<00:06:51.660> is<00:06:51.960> it's<00:06:52.860> gonna<00:06:53.010> affect

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
hitting distance is it's gonna affect

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.440 
hitting distance is it's gonna affect
you<00:06:53.550> a<00:06:53.580> little<00:06:53.970> bit<00:06:55.610> try<00:06:56.610> stays<00:06:56.910> pressed<00:06:57.210> to

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
you a little bit try stays pressed to

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.530 
you a little bit try stays pressed to
the<00:06:57.480> fence<00:06:57.780> as<00:06:58.110> you<00:06:58.260> can<00:06:58.530> because<00:06:59.280> then<00:07:00.240> you'll

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
the fence as you can because then you'll

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.280 
the fence as you can because then you'll
think<00:07:01.280> correct<00:07:02.280> me<00:07:02.340> know<00:07:02.970> how<00:07:03.810> is<00:07:04.080> that<00:07:04.110> even

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
think correct me know how is that even

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.420 
think correct me know how is that even
possible

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
possible

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:13.580 
possible
fires<00:07:06.390> a<00:07:06.630> noob<00:07:06.870> he's<00:07:07.350> a<00:07:07.380> knob<00:07:11.840> so<00:07:12.840> yeah<00:07:13.020> I<00:07:13.380> hope

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
fires a noob he's a knob so yeah I hope

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.330
