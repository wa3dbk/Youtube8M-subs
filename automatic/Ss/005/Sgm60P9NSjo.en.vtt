we push the Explorer and it drops low

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.710 
we push the Explorer and it drops low
down<00:00:53.900> it's<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:55.280> wheels<00:00:55.550> move<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.480> gears

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
down it's the wheels move the gears

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.480 
down it's the wheels move the gears
which<00:00:57.170> are<00:00:57.350> attached<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.710> change<00:00:57.980> brought<00:00:58.220> hit

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
which are attached to change brought hit

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.090 
which are attached to change brought hit
and<00:00:59.030> there's<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.390> belt<00:00:59.600> on<00:00:59.810> this<00:01:00.020> side<00:01:00.260> which

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
and there's a belt on this side which

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.119 
and there's a belt on this side which
moves<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.640> pull<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.030> down<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:03.410> drops<00:01:03.860> load

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
moves to pull you down and drops load

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.160 
moves to pull you down and drops load
that<00:01:04.820> also<00:01:04.940> goes<00:01:05.239> backwards<00:01:05.690> but<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:05.930> not<00:01:06.050> as

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
that also goes backwards but it's not as

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.430 
that also goes backwards but it's not as
efficient

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440

art we got our second class lever then

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.900 
art we got our second class lever then
we<00:01:23.120> got<00:01:23.270> chain<00:01:23.900> sprocket<00:01:24.140> it's<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.740> gears<00:01:25.010> the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
we got chain sprocket it's the gears the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:38.790 
we got chain sprocket it's the gears the
medically<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.870> then

Geert rain chance rockets third class
lever<00:01:42.980> and<00:01:43.490> point<00:01:43.910> less<00:01:44.090> than<00:01:44.120> we

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.340 

let's<00:02:11.850> ice<00:02:12.030> machine<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.780> second-class

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
let's ice machine is the second-class

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.940 
let's ice machine is the second-class
lever<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:14.040> turns<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.470> rock<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.860> in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
lever which turns the rock here in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.780 
lever which turns the rock here in
sprocket<00:02:18.410> turns<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> pulley<00:02:19.800> which<00:02:20.459> causes

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
sprocket turns to pulley which causes

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.940 
sprocket turns to pulley which causes
this<00:02:20.880> point<00:02:21.090> lift<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.840> lever<00:02:22.620> which

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
this point lift up the lever which

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:35.580 
this point lift up the lever which
causes<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> car<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.760> roll<00:02:23.850> down

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.950 

so<00:02:36.590> maybe<00:02:37.220> that's<00:02:37.370> input<00:02:37.760> here<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.480> runs<00:02:38.720> a

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
so maybe that's input here and it runs a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.740 
so maybe that's input here and it runs a
small<00:02:39.590> gear<00:02:39.950> train<00:02:40.250> which<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:41.120> connected<00:02:41.720> to

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
small gear train which is connected to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.130 
small gear train which is connected to
our<00:02:41.930> chance<00:02:42.350> rocket<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.820> after<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:44.750> happens

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
our chance rocket so after that happens

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.420 
our chance rocket so after that happens
the<00:02:45.200> chain<00:02:45.560> sprocket<00:02:45.710> goes<00:02:46.100> down<00:02:46.280> it's

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
the chain sprocket goes down it's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.350 
the chain sprocket goes down it's
connected<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.850> two<00:02:47.410> belts<00:02:48.410> which<00:02:49.010> go<00:02:49.160> down

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
connected to two belts which go down

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.400 
connected to two belts which go down
because<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.540> wasn't<00:02:50.690> long<00:02:50.900> enough<00:02:51.110> with<00:02:51.230> one

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
because it wasn't long enough with one

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.860 
because it wasn't long enough with one
set<00:02:51.830> belts<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.820> we<00:02:52.850> de<00:02:53.000> groun<00:02:53.090> here<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.690> then

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
set belts so we de groun here and then

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.540 
set belts so we de groun here and then
to<00:02:54.020> get<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.590> keep<00:02:54.860> another<00:02:55.070> belt<00:02:55.280> going<00:02:55.430> we

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
to get it to keep another belt going we

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.000 
to get it to keep another belt going we
need<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.700> put<00:02:55.820> another<00:02:56.030> chain<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.650> sprocket

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
need to put another chain and sprocket

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.620 
need to put another chain and sprocket
there<00:02:58.220> which<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:58.730> connected<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.300> second

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
there which is connected to the second

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.199 
there which is connected to the second
belt<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.020> then<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.550> goes<00:03:01.730> across<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.120> the

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
belt and then so this goes across to the

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.030 
belt and then so this goes across to the
second<00:03:02.510> belt<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:03.200> then<00:03:03.620> when<00:03:03.740> it's<00:03:03.860> going

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
second belt and then when it's going

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.310 
second belt and then when it's going
across<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.850> gets<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.180> end<00:03:05.330> then<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.930> red

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
across it gets the end then the red

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.870 
across it gets the end then the red
thing<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.650> put<00:03:06.770> on<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.920> bottom<00:03:07.220> gets<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.790> the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
thing and put on the bottom gets to the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.810 
thing and put on the bottom gets to the
plane<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.360> get<00:03:08.510> onto<00:03:08.630> the
