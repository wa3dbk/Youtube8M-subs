00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 I was looking for an ophthalmologist today 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.010
 at the monopoly seller for 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.900
 only it was really necessary 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.900
 to force them to crush nesteq 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.300
 very important with shaving steaks 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.890
 hashed fresh that this is a chain 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:31.220
 cooking by force that's ravages of steaks 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:37.630
 to have a cooking homogeneity 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:41.060

 if it had to go through a name 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.490
 I will see the optician stagnant 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.590
 even at short words and apparently the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.690
 girl gave me an ophthalmic touch 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.770
 on grenoble that could take 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.060
 significantly less than a year 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.190
 so I'll call them tomorrow I'll 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.509

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.180

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.450
 better than one again so here I am you 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.010

 would like us to eat burgers months 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.380

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:46.040

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:15.319
 tour say thank you so to the tac world 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.890
 rolls a big very big end very 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.069
 those living 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.319
 it's the assault I advise you 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.300
 already that she has progressed to avoid the 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.459
 mark ray lahood that they have a fucking 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.319
 less than 12 and something I do 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.720
 on the other hand I think I have too much 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:38.190
 there is too much bread in fact so I cut a 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:42.980
 little the cut a little bit to go to see with 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.980
 earlier points and I cut 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.610
 here 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.080
 cut the bread 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.820
 so there is a little less than because good 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.530
 I'm getting a little pleasure agree 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.610
 to please the ports of agreement 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.320
 but if I can limit a little bit I 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.800
 prefers to feel the goat 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.800
 warehouse 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.710
 here 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:16.650
 there we are not bad dac 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.650
 we get to know each other bielsa 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:29.050
 there the surplus one saves this formula of 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.219
 Of course, but I prefer 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.349
 donges 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:37.870
 so this is my really big pig fashion 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:39.580
 today 1 to know is the word of 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.050
 robert of the week what i want 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.800
 put there the canvas you can see 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.009
 Something 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.780
 we see so much nothing I do that it's 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.800
 better 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:57.569
 yeah that's high rank is so 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.020
 I take myself bad and in addition top goat 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.930
 really the group 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.129
 it's too much sauce so here maybe 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.469
 not a lot of that of the coupe in two 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.469
 the editor 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.970
 tomorrow it will be double sports ration 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:24.760
 here are my three little pieces of flesh 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:28.030
 below in fact with then cheddar 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.030
 you and say 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.280
 it's a little boring it's either people 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:41.240
 do not want her to be galleys with 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:42.320
 balls and that's the cheddar cause and of 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.170
 take him too much slab 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:51.590
 dac there I put myself steak the plays to 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.460
 dead because it's creepy hurts a 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.460
 not too serious 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.229
 you have 7 5% fat but 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.229
 I listen to the max anyway 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:18.540
 ac drops then for next 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.950
 cheddar and afterwards normally from 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.630
 catch up but there I have no sauce and 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.710
 no ketchup 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.080
 hello but not but if you at home 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:35.040
 have title up I 'm going to show you a 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:36.510
 well cheddar here is a lake a 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.350
 man and ketchup on a little bit 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.980
 the up 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.210
 but do not wait, I still think 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.470
 if we had family because that's 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.190
 already quite fat as it concerns 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.740
 our meal for but it's cool 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.020
 so there logically we can eat them 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.700
 like that but I like to do a little 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.450
 stuff and more and I was able to fight and I 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.110
 I am hurrying 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.560
 it is to pass them to the toaster some 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.900
 seconds 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.340
 in fact for it to crush them a little and 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.020
 that the bread is a little hot a 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.820
 little bit crispy 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.150
 for sauce sauce for sauce 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.680
 try you'll see it's 300 it's true 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.710
 that's otherwise we're not going much 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.360
 again we tend not to 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.740
 great thing again I had to do 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.180
 a live just now I'm going to see 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.500
 that we do not know where I do not know 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.530
 make a live in the velvety evening in 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.970
 running on twitter so here are the friends 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.010
