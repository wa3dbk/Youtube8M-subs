00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hi guys so this is my fifth video of you

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.639 
hi guys so this is my fifth video of you
learn<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.440> ride<00:00:04.650> series<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.839> in<00:00:06.839> in<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.500> last

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
learn to ride series and in in the last

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.799 
learn to ride series and in in the last
video<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.069> talked<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.849> little<00:00:09.030> bit<00:00:09.240> about<00:00:09.510> how<00:00:09.780> to

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
video I talked a little bit about how to

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.660 
video I talked a little bit about how to
shift<00:00:10.410> gears<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> properly<00:00:11.219> match<00:00:11.460> your

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
shift gears to properly match your

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.539 
shift gears to properly match your
engine<00:00:11.969> speed<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.559> in<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.830> video<00:00:14.160> I'll<00:00:14.519> be

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
engine speed and in this video I'll be

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.650 
engine speed and in this video I'll be
talking<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:15.120> braking<00:00:15.809> techniques<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
talking about braking techniques and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.480 
talking about braking techniques and
emergency<00:00:18.660> braking<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:21.619> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.800> MSF<00:00:23.220> course

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
emergency braking so in the MSF course

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.759 
emergency braking so in the MSF course
we<00:00:23.670> learned<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.990> front<00:00:25.199> brake<00:00:25.410> only

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
we learned that the front brake only

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.939 
we learned that the front brake only
contributes<00:00:26.609> actually<00:00:27.150> about<00:00:28.019> 70<00:00:28.560> percent<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
contributes actually about 70 percent of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.460 
contributes actually about 70 percent of
your<00:00:29.039> total<00:00:29.250> stopping<00:00:29.820> power<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.480> whenever

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
your total stopping power so whenever

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.110 
your total stopping power so whenever
you<00:00:31.800> brake<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.520> want<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.759> make<00:00:32.880> sure<00:00:33.000> you're

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you brake you want to make sure you're

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.459 
you brake you want to make sure you're
applying<00:00:33.329> both<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> front<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> back

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
applying both the front and the back

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.920 
applying both the front and the back
brakes<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.399> may<00:00:35.579> not<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:35.969> important<00:00:36.510> for

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
brakes this may not be as important for

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
brakes this may not be as important for
a<00:00:36.989> routine<00:00:37.680> stop<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> stop<00:00:38.610> sign<00:00:38.640> but

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
a routine stop like at a stop sign but

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
a routine stop like at a stop sign but
you<00:00:39.450> want<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> habit<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you want to really get in the habit of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.450 
you want to really get in the habit of
using<00:00:41.040> both<00:00:41.489> brakes<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.300> when<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.559> face<00:00:44.280> an

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
using both brakes so when you do face an

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.790 
using both brakes so when you do face an
emergency<00:00:45.000> situation<00:00:45.210> you'll<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.469> come

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
emergency situation you'll have come

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.350 
emergency situation you'll have come
into<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> habit<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.399> using<00:00:47.550> both<00:00:47.760> brakes<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
into the habit of using both brakes and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.660 
into the habit of using both brakes and
you'll<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> full<00:00:48.809> braking<00:00:49.200> potential<00:00:51.320> so

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
you'll get the full braking potential so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
you'll get the full braking potential so
another<00:00:53.670> thing<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.879> don't<00:00:53.969> want<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.480> is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
another thing you don't want to do is

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.889 
another thing you don't want to do is
use<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.379> front<00:00:55.739> brake<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:57.210> inside

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
use your front brake when you're inside

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.420 
use your front brake when you're inside
of<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.140> turn<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.649> should<00:00:58.800> never<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.100> breaking

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of a turn you should never be breaking

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.000 
of a turn you should never be breaking
inside<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> turn<00:01:00.030> first<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:01.859> should

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
inside of a turn first of all you should

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.700 
inside of a turn first of all you should
be<00:01:02.100> pressing<00:01:02.579> rolling<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.809> should<00:01:04.619> be

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
be pressing rolling in you should be

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
be pressing rolling in you should be
pressing<00:01:05.430> sorry<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> should<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.970> pressing

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
pressing sorry you should be pressing

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.550 
pressing sorry you should be pressing
into<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> turn<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.840> rolling<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.409> your

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
into the turn and rolling on your

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
into the turn and rolling on your
throttle<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.220> mentioned<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.570> my

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
throttle as I mentioned in one of my

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.219 
throttle as I mentioned in one of my
last<00:01:09.840> videos<00:01:09.960> about<00:01:10.700> counter-steering<00:01:12.229> but

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
last videos about counter-steering but

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.990 
last videos about counter-steering but
yeah<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> should<00:01:13.979> never<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.580> front

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
yeah you should never use your front

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.270 
yeah you should never use your front
brakes<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.600> you're<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.009> turn<00:01:19.280> another

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
brakes when you're in a turn another

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
brakes when you're in a turn another
important<00:01:20.700> thing<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.570> should

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
important thing to know is you should

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.920 
important thing to know is you should
never<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.920> grab<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> handful<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.930> front

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
never you know grab a handful of front

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.719 
never you know grab a handful of front
brake<00:01:25.140> because<00:01:25.979> they'll<00:01:26.189> cause<00:01:26.400> your<00:01:26.610> wheel

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
brake because they'll cause your wheel

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.550 
brake because they'll cause your wheel
to<00:01:26.759> lock<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.270> unless<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to lock up unless you have one of the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
to lock up unless you have one of the
newer<00:01:28.740> bikes<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.250> ABS<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:29.970> even<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
newer bikes with ABS but even then I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.109 
newer bikes with ABS but even then I
wouldn't<00:01:30.689> recommend<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.829> grabbing<00:01:32.460> your

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
wouldn't recommend just grabbing your

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.370 
wouldn't recommend just grabbing your
front<00:01:33.390> brake<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.750> hard<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
front brake as hard as you can you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
front brake as hard as you can you
should<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.619> gently<00:01:34.979> applying<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.700> coming

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
should be gently applying it and coming

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.929 
should be gently applying it and coming
to<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> smooth<00:01:37.079> stop<00:01:37.549> same<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> back

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
to a smooth stop same with the back

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
to a smooth stop same with the back
brakes<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.750> shouldn't<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.200> slam<00:01:40.619> down<00:01:40.829> on

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
brakes you shouldn't just slam down on

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.350 
brakes you shouldn't just slam down on
it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.820 

so<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:46.030> going<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.270> demonstrate<00:01:46.830> emergency

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
so I'm going to demonstrate emergency

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.890 
so I'm going to demonstrate emergency
braking<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:51.390> an<00:01:52.390> emergency

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
braking what that is is an emergency

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.720 
braking what that is is an emergency
situation<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.830> actually<00:01:54.190> happened<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.490> me<00:01:54.610> a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
situation this actually happened to me a

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.450 
situation this actually happened to me a
couple<00:01:55.000> weeks<00:01:55.150> ago<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.780> was<00:01:56.470> going<00:01:56.650> about<00:01:56.830> 45<00:01:57.310> or

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
couple weeks ago I was going about 45 or

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.870 
couple weeks ago I was going about 45 or
50<00:01:57.880> miles<00:01:58.030> per<00:01:58.240> hour<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.960> car<00:01:59.200> pulled<00:01:59.470> out

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
50 miles per hour and a car pulled out

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.980 
50 miles per hour and a car pulled out
from<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:00.970> side<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.480> pulled<00:02:01.600> out<00:02:01.660> right<00:02:01.870> in

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
from the side and pulled out right in

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.050 
from the side and pulled out right in
front<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.290> me<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.620> I<00:02:03.100> applied<00:02:03.430> emergency

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
front of me and I applied emergency

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.760 
front of me and I applied emergency
braking<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.600> little<00:02:04.870> too<00:02:05.020> late<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:05.230> it<00:02:05.620> did

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
braking a little too late but it did

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.010 
braking a little too late but it did
slow<00:02:06.040> me<00:02:06.190> down<00:02:06.220> considerably<00:02:06.760> what<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:07.660> do<00:02:07.810> is

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
slow me down considerably what you do is

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.230 
slow me down considerably what you do is
you<00:02:08.560> want<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.770> downshift<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.610> this<00:02:10.090> will

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
you want to downshift and this will

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.090 
you want to downshift and this will
cause<00:02:10.390> your<00:02:10.600> bike<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.170> slow<00:02:11.350> down<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.770> purely

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
cause your bike to slow down just purely

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.800 
cause your bike to slow down just purely
because<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.460> engine<00:02:12.910> braking<00:02:13.150> your<00:02:13.480> bike<00:02:13.660> will

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
because of engine braking your bike will

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.510 
because of engine braking your bike will
be<00:02:14.250> trying<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.280> match<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.290> gear<00:02:17.740> the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
be trying to match the the gear the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.250 
be trying to match the the gear the
speed<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.030> gear<00:02:19.240> you're<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.840> it'll

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
speed of the gear you're in so it'll

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.810 
speed of the gear you're in so it'll
automatically<00:02:20.770> slow<00:02:21.070> down<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.430> way<00:02:21.580> that's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
automatically slow down that way that's

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.120 
automatically slow down that way that's
called<00:02:21.940> engine<00:02:22.330> braking<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.900> then<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.650> pull

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
called engine braking and then you pull

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.280 
called engine braking and then you pull
in<00:02:24.310> both<00:02:24.640> your<00:02:24.940> front<00:02:25.420> brake<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.930> your<00:02:26.110> rear

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
in both your front brake and your rear

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.140 
in both your front brake and your rear
brakes<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.250> there's<00:02:27.459> three<00:02:27.760> stopping

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
brakes so there's three stopping

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.320 
brakes so there's three stopping
mechanisms<00:02:28.720> two<00:02:29.670> emergency<00:02:30.670> braking<00:02:30.940> you're

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
mechanisms two emergency braking you're

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.660 
mechanisms two emergency braking you're
down<00:02:31.570> shifting<00:02:32.020> you're<00:02:32.890> pulling<00:02:33.250> your<00:02:33.459> front

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
down shifting you're pulling your front

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.280 
down shifting you're pulling your front
brake<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.060> you're<00:02:34.420> pressing<00:02:34.630> down<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:34.870> your

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
brake and you're pressing down on your

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.750 
brake and you're pressing down on your
rear<00:02:35.680> brake<00:02:38.400> yeah<00:02:39.400> if<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.910> watched<00:02:40.150> my<00:02:41.760> near

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
rear brake yeah if you watched my near

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.699 
rear brake yeah if you watched my near
accident<00:02:43.300> video<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.870> think<00:02:44.230> those<00:02:44.320> february

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
accident video I think those february

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.380 
accident video I think those february
23rd<00:02:45.160> i<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.580> up<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.820> youtube<00:02:46.180> as<00:02:46.360> well

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
23rd i have that up on youtube as well

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.050 
23rd i have that up on youtube as well
you<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.350> see<00:02:47.590> i<00:02:47.620> applied<00:02:48.160> emergency<00:02:48.790> braking

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
you can see i applied emergency braking

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.090 
you can see i applied emergency braking
but<00:02:49.450> not<00:02:49.630> in<00:02:49.780> time<00:02:49.959> my<00:02:50.200> bike<00:02:50.380> could<00:02:50.620> not<00:02:50.860> come

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
but not in time my bike could not come

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.680 
but not in time my bike could not come
to<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.280> complete<00:02:51.640> stop<00:02:51.820> in<00:02:52.000> time<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.480> after

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
to a complete stop in time and after

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.080 
to a complete stop in time and after
that<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.870> did<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.230> swerving<00:02:53.860> technique<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.940> get

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
that I did the swerving technique to get

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.790 
that I did the swerving technique to get
around<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.510> car<00:02:58.350> yeah<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.410> think<00:02:59.680> I'll

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
around the car yeah I think I'll

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.530 
around the car yeah I think I'll
probably<00:02:59.950> make<00:03:00.220> another<00:03:00.280> video<00:03:00.760> later<00:03:01.420> on

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
probably make another video later on

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.949 
probably make another video later on
just<00:03:02.050> demonstrating<00:03:02.980> different<00:03:03.959> maneuvers

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
just demonstrating different maneuvers

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.680 
just demonstrating different maneuvers
that<00:03:05.140> we<00:03:05.260> learn<00:03:05.440> at<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.680> MSF<00:03:06.130> course<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:07.660> I

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
that we learn at the MSF course that I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.759 
that we learn at the MSF course that I
found<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.170> be<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.739> know<00:03:08.830> life-saving<00:03:09.489> really

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
found to be you know life-saving really

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.199 
found to be you know life-saving really
but<00:03:11.769> here<00:03:11.920> I'll<00:03:12.010> show<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.250> guys<00:03:12.489> emergency

but here I'll show you guys emergency

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.840 
but here I'll show you guys emergency
braking<00:03:13.450> right<00:03:13.870> now<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.519> they'll<00:03:15.519> really<00:03:15.730> be

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
braking right now and they'll really be

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:27.100 
braking right now and they'll really be
the<00:03:16.060> end<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.269> this<00:03:16.420> video

okay<00:03:27.680> I'm<00:03:27.740> gonna<00:03:27.920> speed<00:03:28.190> up<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.400> bit

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
okay I'm gonna speed up a bit

okay I'm gonna speed up a bit
and<00:03:30.610> get<00:03:30.820> into<00:03:31.120> second<00:03:31.510> gear

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
and get into second gear

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.470 
and get into second gear
and<00:03:33.689> two<00:03:34.019> emergency<00:03:34.500> brake<00:03:34.739> I'm<00:03:35.099> in<00:03:35.310> a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
and two emergency brake I'm in a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.729 
both brakes right no see so there I
downshift<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.780> hit<00:03:48.900> both<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.379> front

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
downshift it and I hit both the front

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.910 
downshift it and I hit both the front
and<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:49.980> rear<00:03:50.189> brace<00:03:51.019> simultaneously<00:03:52.019> right

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920
