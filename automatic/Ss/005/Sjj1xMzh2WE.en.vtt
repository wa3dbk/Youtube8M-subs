I mean you know nothing's really changed
in<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.400> respect<00:05:10.790> there<00:05:11.030> so<00:05:11.630> that's<00:05:12.050> a<00:05:12.260> big

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
in that respect there so that's a big

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.130 
in that respect there so that's a big
plus<00:05:12.560> points<00:05:13.040> trough<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.430> bar<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:14.690> also<00:05:14.990> it

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
plus points trough the bar and also it

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.410 
plus points trough the bar and also it
covers<00:05:15.500> it<00:05:15.590> all<00:05:15.710> with<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.310> edges<00:05:16.640> we<00:05:17.030> can<00:05:17.180> try

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
covers it all with the edges we can try

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.420 
covers it all with the edges we can try
and<00:05:17.450> show<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:17.960> there<00:05:18.200> it<00:05:18.950> got<00:05:19.100> all<00:05:19.400> the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
and show you that there it got all the

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.330 
and show you that there it got all the
way<00:05:19.790> around<00:05:23.260> which<00:05:24.260> is<00:05:24.590> obviously<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.190> big

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
way around which is obviously the big

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.230 
way around which is obviously the big
plus<00:05:25.550> point<00:05:27.610> meets<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.760> first<00:05:28.970> and<00:05:29.150> over

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
plus point meets the first and over

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.630 
plus point meets the first and over
applied<00:05:29.630> in<00:05:29.780> terms<00:05:29.960> of<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.140> wet<00:05:30.350> of<00:05:31.010> playing<00:05:31.340> and

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
applied in terms of a wet of playing and

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.760 
applied in terms of a wet of playing and
you<00:05:31.790> can<00:05:31.940> see<00:05:32.060> that<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:33.110> does<00:05:33.350> have<00:05:33.380> a<00:05:33.560> little

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
you can see that it does have a little

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.250 
you can see that it does have a little
bit<00:05:33.920> of<00:05:34.010> luck<00:05:34.220> when<00:05:34.400> those<00:05:34.520> ripple<00:05:34.910> effects

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
bit of luck when those ripple effects

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260 
bit of luck when those ripple effects
but<00:05:36.370> nowhere<00:05:37.370> near<00:05:37.640> as<00:05:37.670> bad<00:05:37.880> as<00:05:38.030> what<00:05:38.150> I've

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
but nowhere near as bad as what I've

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.600 
but nowhere near as bad as what I've
seen<00:05:38.420> on<00:05:38.570> some<00:05:38.840> of<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.020> other<00:05:39.400> branded<00:05:40.400> ones

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
seen on some of the other branded ones

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.880 
seen on some of the other branded ones
out<00:05:40.790> there<00:05:41.410> when<00:05:42.410> you<00:05:42.470> think<00:05:42.650> of<00:05:42.710> like<00:05:42.860> a

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
out there when you think of like a

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.530 
out there when you think of like a
zigzag<00:05:43.810> yeah<00:05:44.810> you<00:05:45.020> know<00:05:45.170> I<00:05:45.200> mean<00:05:46.030> yeah<00:05:47.030> I<00:05:47.330> mean

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
zigzag yeah you know I mean yeah I mean

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.180 
zigzag yeah you know I mean yeah I mean
it's<00:05:47.720> gonna<00:05:47.960> be<00:05:48.170> when<00:05:48.320> I'm<00:05:48.440> pretty<00:05:48.710> easy<00:05:48.860> when

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
it's gonna be when I'm pretty easy when

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.530 
it's gonna be when I'm pretty easy when
I<00:05:49.250> know<00:05:49.310> what<00:05:49.490> is<00:05:49.580> in<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.850> fight<00:05:50.060> was<00:05:50.270> it<00:05:50.420> went

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
I know what is in the fight was it went

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.170 
I know what is in the fight was it went
on<00:05:50.630> for<00:05:50.930> second<00:05:51.770> time<00:05:51.950> pulled<00:05:52.850> it<00:05:52.970> off<00:05:53.030> and

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
on for second time pulled it off and

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.550 
on for second time pulled it off and
let's<00:05:53.210> put<00:05:53.450> it<00:05:53.510> back<00:05:53.630> on<00:05:53.660> again<00:05:53.900> my

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
let's put it back on again my

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.590 
let's put it back on again my
recommendation<00:05:54.860> is<00:05:55.490> do<00:05:56.060> it<00:05:56.150> we've<00:05:56.330> actually

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
recommendation is do it we've actually

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.160 
recommendation is do it we've actually
closer<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.710> you<00:05:58.040> not<00:05:58.790> with<00:05:59.600> a<00:05:59.630> camera<00:05:59.930> here

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
closer to you not with a camera here

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.160 
closer to you not with a camera here
then<00:06:00.980> because<00:06:01.550> basically<00:06:01.760> I'm<00:06:02.210> a<00:06:02.600> hands-on

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
then because basically I'm a hands-on

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.500 
then because basically I'm a hands-on
now<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:03.890> it's<00:06:04.550> not<00:06:04.730> easy<00:06:04.910> to<00:06:05.120> try<00:06:05.240> to<00:06:05.300> do<00:06:05.420> it

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
now and it's not easy to try to do it

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.090 
now and it's not easy to try to do it
like<00:06:05.630> that<00:06:05.690> so<00:06:06.260> you<00:06:06.320> want<00:06:06.530> to<00:06:06.590> have<00:06:06.680> its<00:06:06.890> close

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
like that so you want to have its close

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.420 
like that so you want to have its close
as<00:06:07.280> you<00:06:07.400> can<00:06:07.550> to<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.810> apply<00:06:09.260> it<00:06:09.290> once<00:06:10.250> it's

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
as you can to you and apply it once it's

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.550 
as you can to you and apply it once it's
like<00:06:10.550> that<00:06:10.760> is<00:06:10.910> very<00:06:11.120> very<00:06:11.180> easy<00:06:11.540> to<00:06:11.690> apply<00:06:11.930> so

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
like that is very very easy to apply so

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.140 
like that is very very easy to apply so
I'm<00:06:12.680> going<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:12.830> leave<00:06:12.950> it<00:06:13.100> on<00:06:13.160> and<00:06:13.430> leave<00:06:14.030> it<00:06:14.060> on

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
I'm going to leave it on and leave it on

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.210

one first time ever applying one it went
a<00:07:14.689> lot<00:07:14.719> easier<00:07:15.080> than<00:07:15.199> I<00:07:15.319> thought<00:07:15.349> I<00:07:15.499> was<00:07:15.740> gonna
