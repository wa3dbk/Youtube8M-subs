way<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.110> works<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.680> obviously<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.430> got<00:01:41.549> your

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
way it works is obviously you got your

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.950 
way it works is obviously you got your
middle<00:01:41.939> linebacker<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.930> your

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
middle linebacker and then you got your

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.719 
middle linebacker and then you got your
two<00:01:43.200> defensive<00:01:43.649> tackles<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.189> occupy<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
two defensive tackles they occupy the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.060 
two defensive tackles they occupy the
center<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.540> left<00:01:45.750> gun<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.140> guards<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
center and the left gun right guards so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
center and the left gun right guards so
that<00:01:47.250> leaves<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.759> big<00:01:48.119> hole<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> fourth

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
that leaves a big hole for a fourth

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.660 
that leaves a big hole for a fourth
defensive<00:01:49.590> player<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> come<00:01:50.040> straight

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
defensive player to come straight

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.480 
defensive player to come straight
through<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> sack<00:01:52.439> now<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.130> doesn't

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
through and get the sack now it doesn't

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.399 
through and get the sack now it doesn't
work<00:01:53.640> every<00:01:54.090> single<00:01:54.210> time<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.079> very

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
work every single time and if it's very

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.959 
work every single time and if it's very
easy<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> stop<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.759> put<00:01:56.880> your

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
easy to stop you can just put your

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.300 
easy to stop you can just put your
running<00:01:57.299> back<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.869> run<00:01:58.079> block<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> normally

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
running back in a run block and normally

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
running back in a run block and normally
that<00:01:59.340> will<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.850> care<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.570> unless

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that will take care of it and unless

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.350 
that will take care of it and unless
you're<00:02:01.590> using<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.009> safety<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.880> middle<00:02:03.180> will

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you're using the safety the middle will

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.330 
you're using the safety the middle will
be<00:02:03.479> wide<00:02:03.810> open<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> really<00:02:04.920> got<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.189> look

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
be wide open so you really got to look

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.090 
be wide open so you really got to look
for<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
for that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.859 
for that
so<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:06.400> easy<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.790> beat<00:02:07.119> but<00:02:07.450> if<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.600> guy's

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
so it's easy to beat but if the guy's

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.050 
so it's easy to beat but if the guy's
not<00:02:07.900> expecting<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.830> especially<00:02:09.580> if<00:02:09.880> they're

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
not expecting it especially if they're

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.780 
not expecting it especially if they're
in<00:02:10.179> single<00:02:10.630> backset<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.470> mean<00:02:12.190> it's<00:02:12.340> perfect

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
in single backset I mean it's perfect

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.130 
in single backset I mean it's perfect
because<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:13.180> know<00:02:13.300> they're<00:02:13.480> under<00:02:13.780> center

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
because you know they're under center

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.540 
because you know they're under center
we're<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:14.590> single<00:02:14.920> back<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.310> know<00:02:15.400> like

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
we're not single back but you know like

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.830 
we're not single back but you know like
in<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.760> bombing<00:02:16.030> sing<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.510> know<00:02:16.630> whoever

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
in a bombing sing you know whoever

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.840 
in a bombing sing you know whoever
whatever<00:02:17.230> they're<00:02:17.709> under<00:02:17.980> center<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.700> just

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
whatever they're under center so it just

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.250 
whatever they're under center so it just
takes<00:02:19.030> them<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.209> while<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.450> draw<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.900> back<00:02:20.050> and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
takes them a while to draw it back and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.290 
takes them a while to draw it back and
most<00:02:20.500> people<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.069> throw<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.610> ball<00:02:21.790> till

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
most people do not throw the ball till

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.030 
most people do not throw the ball till
they've<00:02:22.450> dropped<00:02:22.720> back<00:02:23.050> completely<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.010> that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
they've dropped back completely so that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.740 
they've dropped back completely so that
leaves<00:02:24.340> plenty<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.880> time<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.209> have<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> fast

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
leaves plenty of time to have a fast

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.270 
leaves plenty of time to have a fast
right<00:02:26.020> outside<00:02:26.170> linebacker<00:02:26.530> buster<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
right outside linebacker buster and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.460 
right outside linebacker buster and
before<00:02:27.700> he<00:02:27.819> can<00:02:28.000> even<00:02:28.060> see<00:02:28.420> who's<00:02:28.569> open<00:02:29.020> it's

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
before he can even see who's open it's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.559 
before he can even see who's open it's
just<00:02:29.650> boom<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.220> he<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.580> down<00:02:30.790> I've<00:02:31.239> gotten<00:02:31.510> a

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
just boom and he is down I've gotten a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
twice unless you playing like a really

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.930 
nervous and you'll see that they
immediately<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:42.130> try<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.370> throw<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.760> ball

that's nickel y9 sugar blitz and also

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.780 
that's nickel y9 sugar blitz and also
just<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.290> throw<00:02:56.470> them<00:02:56.680> off<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.800> little<00:02:57.100> bit<00:02:57.310> you

just to throw them off a little bit you

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.460 
just to throw them off a little bit you
can<00:02:57.970> switch<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.540> up<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.930> if<00:02:59.140> you're<00:02:59.290> using

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
can switch it up and if you're using

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.199 
can switch it up and if you're using
that<00:02:59.620> playbook<00:03:00.160> seattle<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:00.940> do<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
that playbook seattle you can do the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.210 
that playbook seattle you can do the
sugar<00:03:01.450> cover<00:03:01.720> 3<00:03:02.080> which<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.500> right<00:03:02.860> below<00:03:03.069> it

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
sugar cover 3 which is right below it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.120 
sugar cover 3 which is right below it
and<00:03:03.489> i<00:03:03.580> think<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.480> sugar<00:03:04.750> cover<00:03:05.019> 3<00:03:05.319> bluff<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.010> it
