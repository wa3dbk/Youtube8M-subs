00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 [Music] 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.509
 What's up with everyone talking to them? Mark Mex 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.049
 guys as soloist estruch or if 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:18.260
 secrets in ucd in 2025 and good guys 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.450
 the first trick or secret we are good is 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.370
 just an interest that I imagine that 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.960
 already several of you know and it's flying 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.270
 head to all the mannequins in all 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.010
 the map at a certain time and 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.380
 after we turn our heads to 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.080
 last one will appear on this TV 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.180
 little games that are of activision when 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.800
 I just started with this from the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.950
 videogames that is videogames 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.910
 that the cross that started activision to 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.940
 let's say make videogames book this not 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.710
 it's not any kind of joke not me 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.660
 I would know how to edit this to fool 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.760
 or that is 100% real yourselves 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.520
 you can try are like four games 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.810
 different from this one is the one that actually 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.730
 I did not understand what to do as you can 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.540
 see and I do not know what to do but good 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.550
 Boys 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.380
 let's move on to the next secret as they can 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.449
 see here there is a robot because let's say that 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.159
 it's like in the future but what's important 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.890
 is that game that is just 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.920
 that if we take out an explosive cart 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.259
 these can see that there is a track 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.200
 here next we can jump here and 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.270
 get to the other side of the map and this is 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.189
 extremely useful as in searching and destroying 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.630
 when they put the campers or in 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.880
 any other game mode that always 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.369
 are going to be able to camperos there and good 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.840
 now we move on to a very very good trick 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.429
 we increase a grenade that chimney and 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.909
 we can kill the people who are here 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.700
 in as you can see later in 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.829
 the death chamber we regret is going to 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.869
 lower the grenade down the chimney is and 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.439
 comes out and just to kill the camper 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.079
 milestone and pum and this is extremely useful 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.250
 trick and almost nobody knows it so the 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.039
 guys then we went with the next 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.280
 trick and it's basically getting on this 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.099
 small to the ladder and jump to this 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.170
 part of the fence and as you can see then 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.849
 we have much better visibility and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 never wait for the enemies that 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.379
 let's be here now another trick that is 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.209
 pretty funny is to get on the car and 

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:10.340
 jump out of this mannequin if we get in 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.079
 his head and good guys it seems that 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.970
 we are super exposed and the truth is 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.820
 that if we are a little exposed but 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.260
 It is very useful to justly kill the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.450
 champions who put on those windows that 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.610
 I was shooting 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.490
 but I do not recommend too much because as 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.040
 I said you are a little exposed and good 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.170
 guys now the next trick and it's 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.180
 just in this house like orange if 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.670
 is that I'm not more colorblind than normal 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.460
 but to a boy this is a trick a 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.410
 little camper but good I recommend you 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.450
 lights only if it is very very 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.820
 unnecessary and just to get on the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.440
 tele is we can kill the sounds 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.450
 come in and we can be covered 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.340
 the back side as you can see well 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.450
 what good guys, that's another trick 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.370
 a little camper like I said and good 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.990
 for the next trick I imagine that to 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.360
 everyone knows that we can go up 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.160
 here and we can kill the champions that 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.320
 be here inside the house the same 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.060
 on the other side we can go up here 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.100
 and this is extremely useful when someone 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.470
 it gets to change and it does not let us play 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.140
 taste so good that's a way in 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.330
 place to go around the bottom of the 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.920
 house inside the house and now 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.900
 guys finally we have here some 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.610
 plates is a secret that almost nobody knows 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.060
 but let's say it's in everyone's sight 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.040
 here 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.470
 a sign are scattered throughout the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.270
 map and this is like a decoder not 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.430
 I have no idea whatsoever the numbers are 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.020
 generating like this with the guys for this 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.430
 it's basically all the plates like them 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.860
 I said they are watered on the whole map 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.540
 as a description of each part 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.280
 of the map so I do not expect anything 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.989
 have you liked please leave your like 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.030
 great favorites comment and share 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.890
 the video so I say goodbye I'm brand 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.730
