and<00:01:37.970> what<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.049> really<00:01:39.350> does<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:40.130> case<00:01:40.369> you

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
and what this really does in case you

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.820 
and what this really does in case you
guys<00:01:40.670> don't<00:01:40.970> know<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.930> most<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:42.799> probably

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
guys don't know you most of you probably

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.520 
guys don't know you most of you probably
know<00:01:43.189> anyway<00:01:43.549> but<00:01:43.880> II<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.720> period<00:01:45.290> when<00:01:45.439> you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
know anyway but II and period when you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.539 
know anyway but II and period when you
throw<00:01:45.799> it<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.130> charges<00:01:47.119> such<00:01:47.450> as<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:47.869> know

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
throw it and charges such as you know

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.920 
throw it and charges such as you know
spreading<00:01:49.549> out<00:01:49.640> an<00:01:49.820> electrical<00:01:50.210> charge<00:01:50.240> it

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
spreading out an electrical charge it

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.469 
spreading out an electrical charge it
will<00:01:51.799> disable<00:01:52.479> whatever<00:01:54.490> your<00:01:55.490> enemy<00:01:56.000> has

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
will disable whatever your enemy has

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.469 
will disable whatever your enemy has
hacked<00:01:56.930> most<00:01:57.409> likely<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:58.189> will<00:01:58.820> most<00:01:59.180> likely

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
hacked most likely it will most likely

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.340 
hacked most likely it will most likely
disable<00:02:00.229> their<00:02:00.680> turrets<00:02:01.280> their<00:02:01.610> drones

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
disable their turrets their drones

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.180 
disable their turrets their drones
anything<00:02:03.350> computer<00:02:03.860> operated<00:02:04.490> or<00:02:04.670> anything

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
anything computer operated or anything

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.540 
anything computer operated or anything
it<00:02:05.220> has<00:02:05.430> any<00:02:05.700> sort<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.150> power<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.470> then<00:02:08.310> they

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
it has any sort of power so then they

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.780 
it has any sort of power so then they
would<00:02:08.700> only<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:09.119> left<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:10.320> machine<00:02:11.070> pistol

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
would only be left with a machine pistol

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.600 
would only be left with a machine pistol
and<00:02:12.170> most<00:02:13.170> likely<00:02:13.410> when<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.860> throw<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.190> EMP

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and most likely when you throw this EMP

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.000 
and most likely when you throw this EMP
grenade<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.600> going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:16.020> localized<00:02:16.830> all

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
grenade it's going to be localized all

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.930 
grenade it's going to be localized all
right<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.370> going<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.640> spread

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
right it's not going to spread

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.340 
right it's not going to spread
throughout<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> whole<00:02:18.510> entire<00:02:18.540> map<00:02:19.110> it's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
throughout the whole entire map it's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.400 
throughout the whole entire map it's
only<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.890> be<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.780> certain<00:02:21.780> radius<00:02:21.990> of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
only going to be on a certain radius of

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.170 
only going to be on a certain radius of
the<00:02:22.470> matter<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.340> probably<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> be

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the matter so it's probably going to be

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.500 
the matter so it's probably going to be
meant<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.660> be<00:02:24.870> only<00:02:25.250> thrown<00:02:26.250> at<00:02:26.610> maybe<00:02:26.940> an<00:02:27.150> M&amp;E

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
meant to be only thrown at maybe an M&amp;E

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.110 
meant to be only thrown at maybe an M&amp;E
or<00:02:27.660> two<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.320> only<00:02:29.040> at<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> certain<00:02:29.700> distance

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
or two and only at a certain distance

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.350 
or two and only at a certain distance
and<00:02:30.750> most<00:02:31.620> likely<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.160> won't<00:02:32.310> affect<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.880> all

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
and most likely it won't affect you all

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.440 
and most likely it won't affect you all
right<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.440> overall<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.700> new<00:02:35.910> wage<00:02:36.120> match

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
right so overall this new wage match

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.160 
right so overall this new wage match
looks<00:02:37.110> well<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.130> keep<00:02:38.550> saying<00:02:38.760> looks<00:02:39.180> sounds

opinion they introduced wage manages

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.070 
opinion they introduced wage manages
they<00:03:07.800> introduced<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.910> combat<00:03:09.660> training

they introduced the combat training

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.229 
they introduced the combat training
which<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.680> actually<00:03:11.070> returning<00:03:11.640> in<00:03:11.820> black<00:03:12.000> ops

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
which is actually returning in black ops

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.120 
which is actually returning in black ops
2<00:03:12.390> by<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.750> way<00:03:13.020> we<00:03:13.200> will<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.590> combat

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
I'll catch you guys later well it's i

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.630 
I'll catch you guys later well it's i
guess<00:03:40.230> like<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.980> kind<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.250> has<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.519> a

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
guess like it kind of has like a

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.199 
guess like it kind of has like a
transparency<00:03:42.620> through<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.920> actual<00:03:44.489> design

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
transparency through the actual design

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.630 
transparency through the actual design
at<00:03:45.660> least<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:45.989> my<00:03:46.080> opinion<00:03:46.230> i<00:03:46.590> think<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:46.980> so

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
at least in my opinion i think it is so

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.580 
at least in my opinion i think it is so
i<00:03:47.670> mean<00:03:48.060> they<00:03:48.180> really<00:03:48.450> did<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.750> cool<00:03:49.050> design<00:03:49.200> to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
i mean they really did a cool design to

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.970 
i mean they really did a cool design to
that<00:03:49.800> then<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.760> next<00:03:50.940> thing<00:03:51.120> being<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:52.019> that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
that then the next thing being is that

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.460 
that then the next thing being is that
they're<00:03:53.340> actually<00:03:53.519> adding<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.390> whole<00:03:54.690> new<00:03:55.050> way

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
they're actually adding a whole new way

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.030 
they're actually adding a whole new way
that<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.860> use<00:03:56.130> create<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> class
