00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.450
 nowadays the fact that the world every 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.089
 more globalized time and the general manager 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.130
 must face a series of challenges and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.650
 achieving excellent results 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.050
 business the central issue besides the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.630
 General manager should be very prepared 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.119
 to be able to take on any kind of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 organizational change any kind of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.109
 9 leadership that can be given the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.630
 within the organization and a third 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.640
 aspect I think it's could face 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.460
 any strategy change that is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.010
 den inside the table is a theme too 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 central that we see especially in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.270
 the case of general managers is what 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 referred to the sector in which it is and 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.170
 general manager if in that property you must 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 have the experience with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.820
 knowledge and everything that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.120
 allow this general manager to be able to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.140
 face in a very proactive way all 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.140
 the changes that may occur 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.800
 one of the central themes in a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.260
 general manager is his ability to power 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.080
 have a clear vision of the business of 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 can see challenges and opportunities the power 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 take decisions sometimes with very little 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 information and those are would I say one of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
 the skills or competences that you have 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.350
 than having a general manager of all 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 way its strategic focus its 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.880
 ability and vision and your ability to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.560
 be able to face any challenge u 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.630
 opportunity that can be presented 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.910
 within the organization I think that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.890
 nowadays a general manager must be 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.780
 seen not only is it a fact why 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 internal within the company but 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.880
 also within your power capacity 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.280
 interact directly and with 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.140
 different interest groups do not 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.479
 only with your customers or suppliers 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.660
 that are probably your customers are 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.780
 its its closest interlocutors but 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.000
 also with means with other entities 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.680
 own that are not necessarily in 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.060
 your most direct environment 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.070
 also with your own 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.350
 public sector institutions such 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.210
 way that before any change or 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.490
 any challenge that they have 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.350
 interact if it's a topic that every time 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.350
 it's more important between communications 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.050
 I believe that a general manager his 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.820
 ability to interrelate with and 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.209
 communication has to be very clear 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.520
 he has to have the ability to 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.860
 communicate to interact with all 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.500
 members within an organization the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.830
 theme today of organizational climate theme 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.690
 today how to get an organization 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.840
 and the members of these who are your 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.120
 collaborators can be very close 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.370
 to the general manager to the leader of that 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 organization I think they are aspects 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.810
 central where each general manager 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.970
 must watch over that possibility or for that 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.660
 ability to interact with all 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.660
 the members inside 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.819
 on the subject of emotional intelligence if 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.090
 is the ability above all to be able 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.459
 face problems being able to handle 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.190
 emotionally before any change 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.200
 or uncertainty the power to have or 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.370
 ensure a good life balance I believe 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.860
 that as a general manager that 's 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.540
 extremely important and the issue of power 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.540
 take more and more responsible 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.030
 and I think every manager who has 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.880
 as your main career anchor the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.870
 being able to be a general manager requires 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.319
 first be very very prepared 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.599
 regardless of what your 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.310
 function within the organization is 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.370
 important that this general manager 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.080
 continually preparing how much 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.489
 more responsibilities can assume 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.530
 within the organization will help 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.959
 within this objective that is set 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.819
 be very prepared before any 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.090
 opportunity that can be presented for 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.040
 to assume the forgiveness we force the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.830
 General manager responsibility is very 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.690
 visible is very exposed I think that in 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.030
 the measure that a manager achieves 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.170
 all the objectives will facilitate the 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.170
 be able to take on management
