00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.430 

and<00:02:26.370> then<00:02:27.330> we're<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.930> slice<00:02:28.140> this

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
and then we're just going to slice this

nice fairly thin um it doesn't have to
be<00:02:33.360> super<00:02:33.750> super<00:02:33.990> thin<00:02:34.650> because<00:02:35.640> these<00:02:35.880> are

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
be super super thin because these are

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.880 
be super super thin because these are
going<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.420> break<00:02:36.630> down<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> little<00:02:37.050> bit<00:02:37.410> as<00:02:37.590> they

going to break down a little bit as they

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:46.990 
going to break down a little bit as they
pickle
