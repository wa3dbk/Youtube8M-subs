obligation of an occupying power is to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.860

security during a period of occupation

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.100 
security during a period of occupation
and<00:00:42.230> I<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.730> incident<00:00:45.600> again

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and I think that this incident again

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.970 
and I think that this incident again
shows<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.730> Israeli<00:00:48.360> disposition<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
shows the Israeli disposition to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.569 
shows the Israeli disposition to
maximize<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.510> use<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.719> force<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
maximize the use of force and to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
maximize the use of force and to
disregard<00:00:54.090> its<00:00:55.340> fundamental<00:00:56.340> obligation<00:00:57.410> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
disregard its fundamental obligation to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.389 
disregard its fundamental obligation to
avoid<00:00:59.329> excessive<00:01:00.329> violence<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.829> addressing

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
avoid excessive violence in addressing

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.140 
avoid excessive violence in addressing

situation<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> West<00:02:32.580> Bank<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.060> what's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
situation in the West Bank and what's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.720 
situation in the West Bank and what's
going<00:02:33.390> on<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.170> very<00:02:34.350> few<00:02:34.620> people<00:02:34.950> have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
going on there but very few people have

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.920 
going on there but very few people have
this<00:02:35.970> issue<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.510> their<00:02:36.690> radars<00:02:38.420> yes<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.690> think

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
this issue on their radars yes I think

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.140 
this issue on their radars yes I think
with<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.690> renewal<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:44.150> interest

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
with that this is a renewal of interest

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.200 
with that this is a renewal of interest
and<00:02:45.420> concern<00:02:45.630> about<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.130> situation<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:48.060> the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
and concern about the situation on the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.590 
and concern about the situation on the
Golan<00:02:48.570> Heights<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:49.380> has<00:02:50.040> been<00:02:50.600> marginalized

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
Golan Heights that has been marginalized

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.220 
Golan Heights that has been marginalized
over<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.350> years<00:02:52.590> partly<00:02:53.370> because<00:02:54.230> Syria

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
over the years partly because Syria

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.270 
over the years partly because Syria
hasn't<00:02:55.860> pushed<00:02:56.820> very<00:02:57.000> hard<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:58.290> few<00:02:58.770> attempts

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
hasn't pushed very hard the few attempts

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.970 
hasn't pushed very hard the few attempts
at<00:03:00.080> negotiating<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.290> Israeli<00:03:01.830> withdrawal

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
have turned out to be unsuccessful but

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.330 
have turned out to be unsuccessful but
the<00:03:07.590> basic<00:03:08.360> message<00:03:09.360> here<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the basic message here is that the

and Richard said it was deeply troubled

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.080 
and Richard said it was deeply troubled
by<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> events<00:03:37.830> but<00:03:38.340> where<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.580> also<00:03:38.850> clearly

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
by the events but where it also clearly

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.390 
by the events but where it also clearly
put<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.570> onus<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.260> protesters<00:03:40.860> by<00:03:41.070> saying

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
put the onus on the protesters by saying

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.820 
put the onus on the protesters by saying
that<00:03:42.180> provocative<00:03:42.810> actions<00:03:43.410> like<00:03:43.590> this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
that provocative actions like this

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.500 
that provocative actions like this
should<00:03:44.070> be<00:03:44.220> avoided<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.850> goes<00:03:45.030> on<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.330> say<00:03:45.480> that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
should be avoided it goes on to say that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.540 
should be avoided it goes on to say that
Israel<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:46.200> any<00:03:46.470> sovereign<00:03:47.040> nation<00:03:47.370> has<00:03:47.520> a

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
Israel like any sovereign nation has a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.180 
Israel like any sovereign nation has a
right<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.090> defend<00:03:48.510> itself<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:49.410> Israel

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
right to defend itself is Israel

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.470 
right to defend itself is Israel
defending<00:03:50.610> itself<00:03:50.850> by<00:03:51.060> shooting<00:03:51.390> at

protesters across an occupied territory

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.380 
protesters across an occupied territory
I<00:03:54.500> think<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.650> very<00:03:55.860> misleading<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:57.120> talk

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
I think it's very misleading to talk

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.100 
I think it's very misleading to talk
about<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.230> terms<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.770> defense<00:04:00.110> Israel

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
about this in terms of defense Israel

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.110 
about this in terms of defense Israel
has<00:04:01.140> demonstrated<00:04:01.770> over<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.700> over<00:04:02.820> again

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
has demonstrated over and over again

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.430 
has demonstrated over and over again
that<00:04:03.600> if<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.230> wants<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:05.070> has<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.760> means<00:04:06.030> to

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
that if it wants to it has the means to

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.979 
that if it wants to it has the means to
non-violently<00:04:07.550> control<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:09.480> angry

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
non-violently control the angry

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.710 
non-violently control the angry
demonstrations<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:11.280> does<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.150> all<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.510> time

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
demonstrations it does this all the time

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.970 
demonstrations it does this all the time
with<00:04:13.670> settlers<00:04:14.670> who<00:04:15.410> exhibit<00:04:16.410> much<00:04:16.650> more

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
with settlers who exhibit much more

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.520 
with settlers who exhibit much more
violence<00:04:17.609> than<00:04:17.850> was<00:04:18.000> exhibited<00:04:18.630> by<00:04:19.049> these

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
violence than was exhibited by these

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.050 
violence than was exhibited by these
people<00:04:20.160> at<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:21.030> border

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
people at the border

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.510 
people at the border
so<00:04:22.210> this<00:04:22.480> was<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:23.280> calculated<00:04:24.280> effort<00:04:25.000> to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
so this was a calculated effort to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.540 
so this was a calculated effort to
enforce<00:04:27.520> their<00:04:28.030> claim<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:29.230> the<00:04:29.500> water<00:04:29.800> by

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
enforce their claim to the water by

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.710 
enforce their claim to the water by
relying<00:04:31.090> on<00:04:32.040> lethal<00:04:33.040> violence<00:04:33.720> against

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
relying on lethal violence against

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.340 
relying on lethal violence against
unarmed<00:04:35.260> demonstrators<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:37.030> sends<00:04:38.020> again

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
unarmed demonstrators and sends again

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.550 
unarmed demonstrators and sends again
the<00:04:38.530> message<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.940> world<00:04:40.180> that<00:04:40.990> Israel<00:04:41.470> is

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
the message to the world that Israel is

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.379 
the message to the world that Israel is
not<00:04:41.830> prepared<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.550> live<00:04:42.880> up<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.240> its
