00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.230
 hello everyone here a guide how 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.300
 beat dead dex and good first thing 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.760
 what we have to do is close that 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.309
 corner because melee kills us 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.950
 a blow and good now the 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.839
 guard in front and will not be able to leave and 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.419
 guard does not kill him takes away the little life 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:23.659
 and by the ossuary I'm giving the toad to 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.509
 that they do not take away practically anything and 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:29.539
 well I recommend having a flea Indian 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.270
 because every blow we give him reduces 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.820
 900 that is, it did not take away almost anything 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.370
 and then the shift made little 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.340
 charge anger because in 5 the guard 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.320
 which is the last one deactivates the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.470
 vulnerability and in 6 well I already 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.490
 we can give the anger 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.210
 and gun does not reduce anything so 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.880
 also if you come with soul then that but 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.530
 when you are with a spell the element 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.220
 which is the spell for example the with and 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.230
 mile since 100% fire resistance 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.830
 and it takes away 10% of everything else 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.820
 and then you can 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.780
 we are being with miles and assaults 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.670
 and things of air and fire so that the I 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.530
 bid with the anger that is of strength you 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.610
 removed a lot and also has 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:28.270
 carie sword that is neutral 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.950
 Then, well, you can see to see 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.590
 also if you see with a weapon that is not a 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.170
 of the last ones for example a parabola 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.820
 because to see page the payments now that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.679
 you will have times not so with the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.929
 first hit we will give you one hundred percent of 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.549
 resistance already so with the others not 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.030
 we will remove anything we will give you even more of 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.159
 resistance 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.500
 and well I do not know there's nothing more 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 explain 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.180
 I hope it serves you that you can pass it and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.750
 considers that the new multi man y os 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.590
 I leave with the video 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 until next time 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.310
 do not 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.659
 and 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.950
 Y 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.420
 ah 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 yes 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.780
 all right 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.200
 Y
