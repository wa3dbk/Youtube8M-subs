what I'm doing here I am trying to fix
my<00:00:08.940> window<00:00:09.469> brinda<00:00:10.469> works<00:00:10.650> on<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> Jag<00:00:11.099> when

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
my window brinda works on the Jag when

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.249 
my window brinda works on the Jag when
you<00:00:11.550> pull<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> handle<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.660> window<00:00:12.990> drops

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
you pull on the handle the window drops

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.150 
you pull on the handle the window drops
down<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> tiny<00:00:13.740> bit

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
down a tiny bit

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.490 
down a tiny bit
like<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.210> when<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.599> release<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.870> goes<00:00:16.289> back

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
like that when you release it goes back

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
like that when you release it goes back
up<00:00:16.710> well<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.140> if<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.949> door<00:00:20.640> opens<00:00:21.270> when

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
up well if the if the door opens when

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.570 
up well if the if the door opens when
you<00:00:21.840> pull<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> handle<00:00:22.560> then<00:00:23.340> there's<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
you pull on the handle then there's a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.300 
you pull on the handle then there's a
switch<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:25.050> latch<00:00:25.199> mechanism<00:00:25.470> over<00:00:25.949> here

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
switch in the latch mechanism over here

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
switch in the latch mechanism over here
and<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:27.090> switch<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> latch<00:00:27.660> mechanism

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
and that switch in the latch mechanism

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.839 
and that switch in the latch mechanism
is<00:00:28.650> supposed<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> tell<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> car<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
is supposed to tell the car that the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
is supposed to tell the car that the
door<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.119> open<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.960> window<00:00:31.289> stays<00:00:31.650> down

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
door is open and the window stays down

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.510 
door is open and the window stays down
about<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> half<00:00:32.790> an<00:00:32.910> inch<00:00:33.710> but<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:35.070> switch<00:00:35.370> is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
about a half an inch but my switch is

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970 
about a half an inch but my switch is
broken<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.149> took<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> last<00:00:37.050> before<00:00:37.290> try<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
broken I took out the last before try to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
broken I took out the last before try to
fix<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> switch<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> can't<00:00:39.809> find<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
fix the switch but I can't find a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.080 
fix the switch but I can't find a
replacement<00:00:40.290> switch<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.100> getting<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.489> got<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
replacement switch and getting I got the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
replacement switch and getting I got the
last<00:00:42.239> back<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.140> difficult

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
last back in but it's really difficult

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.959 
last back in but it's really difficult
so<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:45.469> overtime<00:00:46.469> which<00:00:46.680> happened<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.820> my

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so in overtime which happened is that my

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.580 
so in overtime which happened is that my
window<00:00:48.360> seemed<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.050> been<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.350> up

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
window seemed to have been going up

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
window seemed to have been going up
further<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.129> further<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.300> even<00:00:51.510> got

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
further and further and it got even got

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
further and further and it got even got
so<00:00:51.899> bad<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.379> rubbing<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.550> here

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so bad that it was rubbing right here

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.279 
so bad that it was rubbing right here
and<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.390> where<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.809> lift<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and you can see where it's like lift a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.290 
and you can see where it's like lift a
mark<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.070> molding<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> side<00:00:56.910> here

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
mark on my molding on the side here

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270 
mark on my molding on the side here
and<00:00:57.719> when<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:57.960> close<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> door<00:00:58.590> got<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and when I would close the door got the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.560 
and when I would close the door got the
point<00:00:59.460> where<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.640> door<00:00:59.820> wouldn't<00:01:00.030> close<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
point where the door wouldn't close the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.420 
point where the door wouldn't close the
latch<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.350> mean<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> glass<00:01:01.770> would<00:01:02.010> bang<00:01:02.250> up

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
latch I mean the glass would bang up

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
latch I mean the glass would bang up
against<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> molding<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.390> there<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
against the molding right there and I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
against the molding right there and I
had<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> roll<00:01:05.580> down<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> window<00:01:06.090> slightly<00:01:06.479> in

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
had to roll down the window slightly in

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.090 
had to roll down the window slightly in
order<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.320> close<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> door<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.830> did<00:01:10.890> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
order to close the door so what I did I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.289 
order to close the door so what I did I
knew<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:11.670> had<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.880> some<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
knew there had to be some kind of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
knew there had to be some kind of
adjustment<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> high<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> window<00:01:13.680> went<00:01:13.890> up

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
adjustment for a high the window went up

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.460 
adjustment for a high the window went up
and<00:01:14.270> well<00:01:15.270> before<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.689> able<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> close<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and well before I was able to close the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.679 
and well before I was able to close the
door<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.250> can't<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> adjustment

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
door now I can't because the adjustment

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.140 
door now I can't because the adjustment
got<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> adjustment<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.280> started<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
got out of adjustment so I started I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.460 
got out of adjustment so I started I
opened<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> door<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.320> another

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
opened up the door which is in another

I<00:01:26.159> opened<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> door<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.509> discovered

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
I opened up the door and I discovered

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.880 
I opened up the door and I discovered
that<00:01:27.960> right<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> middle<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that right here in the middle of the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.260 
that right here in the middle of the
door<00:01:29.150> there's<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> bolt<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.979> when<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> looked<00:01:33.180> at

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
door there's a bolt and when I looked at

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.870 
door there's a bolt and when I looked at
this<00:01:33.360> bolt<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.869> could<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.159> had<00:01:35.430> slid

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
this bolt I could see that it had slid

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.910 
this bolt I could see that it had slid
you<00:01:36.869> probably<00:01:37.140> can't<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.560> video<00:01:37.799> but

you probably can't see on this video but

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.140 
you probably can't see on this video but
I<00:01:37.979> could<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.250> where<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> bolt<00:01:38.670> had<00:01:38.820> slid

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
I could see where the bolt had slid

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
I could see where the bolt had slid
backwards<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> metal<00:01:40.619> was<00:01:40.829> chewed

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
backwards because the metal was chewed

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
backwards because the metal was chewed
up<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> did<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
up there so I did a little bit of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530 
up there so I did a little bit of
experimenting<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.000> loosened<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.090> bolt<00:01:45.360> I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
experimenting I loosened up the bolt I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.870 
experimenting I loosened up the bolt I
rolled<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> window<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:47.340> discovered

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
rolled the window down and I discovered

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.039 
rolled the window down and I discovered
that<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.090> could<00:01:48.119> slide<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> boat<00:01:48.689> back<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that I could slide the boat back and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
that I could slide the boat back and
forth<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.530> retightened<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
forth I retightened it up at the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.450 
forth I retightened it up at the
original<00:01:51.299> location<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:52.560> uses<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> Torx<00:01:53.189> thirty

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
original location it uses a Torx thirty

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
original location it uses a Torx thirty
bit<00:01:53.729> by<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> way<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.659> retighten<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.380> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
bit by the way I just retighten it up it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.450 
bit by the way I just retighten it up it
what<00:01:55.649> looked<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.219> its<00:01:56.340> original

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
what looked like it was its original

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.880 
what looked like it was its original
location<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.479> after<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.259> tightened<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.740> back

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
location and after I tightened it back

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.399 
location and after I tightened it back
up<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.369> rolled<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> window<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
up I rolled the window up and I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.690 
up I rolled the window up and I
discovered<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> door<00:02:02.159> would<00:02:02.310> close<00:02:02.340> just

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
discovered the door would close just

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.429 
discovered the door would close just
fine<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.600> I've<00:02:03.750> adjusted<00:02:03.869> that

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
fine and so now that I've adjusted that

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.429 
fine and so now that I've adjusted that
for<00:02:04.680> me<00:02:04.820> close<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.969> door<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
for me close this door here now that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.839 
for me close this door here now that
I've<00:02:07.560> adjusted

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
I've adjusted

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.920 
I've adjusted
when<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.479> close<00:02:09.749> the<00:02:09.899> door<00:02:10.109> it<00:02:11.009> closes<00:02:11.749> I'm<00:02:12.749> not

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
when I close the door it closes I'm not

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.390 
when I close the door it closes I'm not
exactly<00:02:13.200> sure<00:02:13.409> what's<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.829> have<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
exactly sure what's going to have the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.360 
exactly sure what's going to have the
hang<00:02:14.969> put<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.269> top<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:16.349> I'm<00:02:17.099> guessing

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
hang put the top up but I'm guessing

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.709 
hang put the top up but I'm guessing
that<00:02:17.579> you<00:02:17.879> know<00:02:17.969> the<00:02:18.060> top<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.359> going<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.569> fit

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
that you know the top is going to fit

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.209 
that you know the top is going to fit
pretty<00:02:18.930> closely<00:02:19.200> there<00:02:19.620> might<00:02:19.739> be<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.859> tiny<00:02:20.040> bit

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
pretty closely there might be a tiny bit

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.009 
pretty closely there might be a tiny bit
of<00:02:20.310> wind<00:02:20.459> noise<00:02:20.519> but<00:02:21.359> I<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.719> deal<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:21.989> a

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
of wind noise but I can deal with a

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.300 
of wind noise but I can deal with a
little<00:02:22.079> bit<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.319> wind<00:02:22.439> noise<00:02:22.499> because<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.950> used

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
little bit of wind noise because I used

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.539 
little bit of wind noise because I used
to<00:02:23.370> drive<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> top<00:02:23.939> down<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.799> I<00:02:25.799> don't

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
to drive to the top down and I don't

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.559 
to drive to the top down and I don't
think<00:02:26.639> it's<00:02:26.849> going<00:02:26.939> to<00:02:27.000> fit<00:02:27.060> exactly

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
think it's going to fit exactly

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.000 
think it's going to fit exactly
perfectly<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.349> this<00:02:28.469> prevents<00:02:28.859> me<00:02:28.980> from

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
perfectly but this prevents me from

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.369 
perfectly but this prevents me from
having<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.489> oil<00:02:30.420> down<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.719> window<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.019> half<00:02:31.260> an

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
having to oil down the window a half an

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.509 
having to oil down the window a half an
inch<00:02:31.469> every<00:02:31.680> time<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.980> get<00:02:32.069> out<00:02:32.189> of<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.310> car

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
inch every time I get out of the car

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.389 
inch every time I get out of the car
just<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.819> close<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.239> door
