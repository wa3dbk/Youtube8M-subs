they<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> decide<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:19.259> once<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.770> goes

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

above<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:21.270> second<00:01:21.780> purple<00:01:22.229> line<00:01:22.439> it's

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
above the second purple line it's

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.649 
above the second purple line it's
automatically<00:01:24.090> band<00:01:25.070> okay<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.610> bleeds<00:01:27.420> can

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
automatically band okay it bleeds can

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.530 
automatically band okay it bleeds can
just<00:01:27.869> went<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.470> over<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.119> why

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
just went right over it I can see why

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.649 
just went right over it I can see why
it's<00:01:31.170> an<00:01:31.829> uber<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:33.060> get<00:01:33.210> why<00:01:33.420> they'd

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it's an uber but I don't get why they'd

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.010 
it's an uber but I don't get why they'd
put<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> there<00:01:34.430> but<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.329> probably

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
put it there but it's it's probably

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.920 
put it there but it's it's probably
because<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.560> new<00:01:37.740> ability<00:01:38.340> was<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.479> speed

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
because the new ability was it speed

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
because the new ability was it speed
boost<00:01:40.229> after<00:01:40.680> every<00:01:41.310> turn<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.579> boost<00:01:41.970> its

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
boost after every turn and boost its

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.420 
boost after every turn and boost its
speed<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.750> only<00:01:43.320> some<00:01:43.590> will<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.220> them

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
speed but only some will some of them

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.420 
speed but only some will some of them
get<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.119> some<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> its<00:01:46.079> attacks<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.890> 5th
