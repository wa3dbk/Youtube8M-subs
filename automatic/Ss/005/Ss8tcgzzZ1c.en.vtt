used to be an operation not too long ago
huh<00:01:49.660> yeah<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.229> 90s<00:01:50.679> it<00:01:50.860> had<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.069> get

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
looks like it's here for our lifetime

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.210 
looks like it's here for our lifetime
and<00:01:55.000> maybe<00:01:55.149> beyond<00:01:55.479> yeah<00:01:56.259> it's<00:01:56.500> unfortunate

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
and maybe beyond yeah it's unfortunate

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
but that's one of the reasons why you
