00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.979
 [Music] 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.830

 Wild vandals guilty of crimes 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.400
 against humanity that they condemned 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.180
 immortal prison for life without right 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.180
 to freedom of speech 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.340
 a new issue to deal with I want to give the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.990
 officially welcome the member more 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.189

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.189
 unanimous consensus except 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.640
 thank you all and now the reason for the 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.350
 to convene this meeting in the light of the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.870
 abuse of trust has revealed during 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.640
 the case of wild vandals we have to 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.340
 decide if batman can continue in the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.400
 league 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.290
 those in favor wait before 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.790
 that we vote the accused must say 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.960
 words in your defense 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.059
 seconded well batman what I did not 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.489
 requires no defense to be 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.979
 necessary would do not 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.950
 please as an individual if even more like 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.390
 group the league is too powerful to 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.700
 not have insurance against any 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.350
 possible abuse of our power we use 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.570
 our power to protect the world 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.720
 we always do and if ever 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.399
 we use for another purpose if they can not 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.740
 see the danger that a league represents 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.110
 of justice out of control not 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.460
 I need a vote 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.460
 I do not belong here 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:45.519
 [Music] 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.549
 do you have a moment 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.840
 you want there are contingency plans 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.160
 to stop everyone in the league just in 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.990
 If any of us 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.990
 come back evil were designed to 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.930
 immobilize not to kill but wild 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.080
 He devised the plan to bury you I suppose not 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.170
 It was one of mine 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.300
 you finished after talking so much about 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.830
 power without supervision are you so arrogant 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.090
 that does not bother you even in creating a plan 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.970
 to stop yourself 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.490
 Of course I have a plan called League of 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.020
 the justice 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.020
 I just wanted to be sure 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.319
 what is that if the line went to the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.850
 wrong side I want someone to be 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.590
 who can I trust to keep 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.920
 except the planet 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:57.979
 and even from me 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:57.979
