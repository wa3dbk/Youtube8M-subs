00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 good to all my name is rami and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome to another video this time 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.440
 I bring a gameplay of the new mode 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.200
 called brics truck in English or advance 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.710
 in Spanish this mode came out nothing 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.680
 along with this dlc called the Felix or 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.359
 relics lost and good the first 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 just in case the skins are interested 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.300
 they are also from this dlc and good 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.029
 basically what this mode is about 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.099
 of two teams competing in a team 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 you have to carry a flag of a point 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.960
 another and the other team will have to 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.000
 avoid it and win that team that has 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 scored more flags in their respective 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 rounds and good to notice here as I know how 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.649
 is the boom air and set the amount of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.320
 points they generate for assistance to 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.600
 176 or either do not know what happened there but good 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.730
 yemen things and good here is the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 flag that kind of hologram or what 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410
 that is that is good that is the flag and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.079
 that is the point of good delivery the base 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.059
 and good in this case to us not to 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.770
 our team had to defend 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.080
 I was defending I do not know if I did 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.610
 right or wrong staying and so back together 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.750
 to the base I was defending 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.400
 basically 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.290
 that was also practically next 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.000
 from the base and that's why I stayed there but 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.910
 well I did not know if I did it wrong or good 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.770
 because it was my first games 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.780
 but well here I saved with the boom 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.600
 get to kill that one just before 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.450
 could deliver and so avoid that the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.300
 rival team score the flag and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.040
 get a good point once 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.750
 I was not boom anymore, I went to look 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.490
 other weapons like the hammer of the dawn 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.290
 but hey I was not so 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.640
 I only had the nasser and in this case 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.100
 because instead of defending, I was a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.100
 little offensive but he was also good 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.330
 defensive but he was more or less more 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 ahead of normal and therefore for this 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.880
 they managed to score the flag but 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.610
 well, you do not always have to stay behind 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.369
 it's also good sometimes to get out a little 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.830
 offensive so that the rival team 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.140
 well do not trust much but good 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.930
 here we were with the last man in 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.390
 rivals team life because because here 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.010
 You can finish a round or two ways 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.290
 well because the time is over 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.079
 about ten minutes or else why 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.319
 it is finished the regenerations there are some 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.390
 35 regeneration is only for the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.099
 attacking team because the team 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.030
 Defender can always generate the times 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.739
 you want 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.549
 well here it was in this case we 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.590
 I had to attack, I took the flag and good 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.709
 because if he was not sure where 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.590
 move as you see as the flag affects 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.200
 the way you move or you move 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.819
 a little slower than normal but 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.349
 well you can keep doing the same bones 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.629
 and cartwheels and that kind of thing 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.359
 only that you move a little more 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.340
 slow and good here I did a fail us 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.470
 they put a boomer there by the corridor 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.900
 but the good thing is that at least 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.989
 I got to take the flag a little far 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.620
 and well come in let's say push a little 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.450
 Well, we already got the flag 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.180
 I was practically on the side of the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.400
 base so what I decided then go to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.430
 attack is to catch the mate flag to that and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.680
 I got to take the flag to the base and 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.970
 so get a point for our 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.580
 team 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.200
 once we capture the flag or 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.410
 we carry the flag to the base 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.480
 we deliver because the flag comes out in the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.410
 same site that came out the first time and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.360
 it takes about 14 seconds or so 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.110
 little advice that I give you not 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.120
 forget about the weapons collected from the map 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.100
 because it is necessary that someone covers 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.330
 of the flag but if someone has to 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.880
 example the hammer of the dawn or the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.040
 boomers let's say the powerful weapons then 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.560
 you can discover much better at 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.410
 that carries the flag as you see here and 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.940
 well well facilitate the thing much 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.160
 finally just say that 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.900
 there is a rule of piety for example 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.120
 in this case our team and here by 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.430
 rival was tied to two well then 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.740
 if we can score a flag more 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.230
 As you can see, we ended up winning thanks 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.450
 to that rule of piety so good nothing 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.330
 people if you have any doubt about 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.010
 this way commented the and well also 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.810
 comment what you think about this new 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.360
 way so nothing people this has been 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.959
 everything grows everything to see me and see you in 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.959
 another video
