00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
[MUSIC PLAYING] Let's give you
a combination for using tuts.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.130
We're going to do half of
an ice box to wrist rolls.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.970
It starts like this.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.170
Here's my first angle.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.128
I have a straight line.

00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:18.080
My wrists are flat, like this.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.460
Don't go too in,
don't go too out.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920
Make sure it's straight.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.155
And I'm going to slide my
right wrist up, bring it down,

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:30.270
and I'm going to
slide it across.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.190
This is where I get my box.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.425
And then I'm going to
simply collapse the box.

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:40.305
And I'm going to
bring back the center,

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:44.150
and I'm going to
start my wrist rolls.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.331
Hands are pushed down.

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.986
I'm going take my
hand that's above,

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:52.270
I'm using my left
arm to be above,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.200
and I'm going to roll that down.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.450
Still trying to keep some
good [INAUDIBLE] form.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.489
Now I take my upper arm,
which is my right arm,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.536
and I'm going to swing that.

00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:08.995
Now it's even.

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:13.796
And one more level
down, like so.

00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:17.372
Now I take my lower arm,
which is my right arm,

00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:21.750
and I'm going to roll that up.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.710
And then I'm going
to do one last step.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.180
And that's going to be my
lower arm, left arm, coming up,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.000
center, and that was
[? going to be ?] wrist roll

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.490
pattern, we did
is-- all the way up.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.020
Let's try again
from the beginning.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.760
Hands right here, wrist comes
up, coming down, sliding over,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.430
collapse the box, coming in.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:57.930
The wrist goes down, rolling,
coming down one more,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.430
rolling up.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.904
Let's give it our own bass
and clap to move step by step.

00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:05.870
Ready?

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.270
Boom, clap.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.320
Boom, clap.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.789
Boom, clap.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.244
Boom, clap.

00:02:11.244 --> 00:02:12.232
Boom, clap.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:13.714
Boom, clap.

00:02:13.714 --> 00:02:15.196
Boom, clap.

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:16.184
Boom, clap.

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:17.666
Boom, clap.

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:19.190
Boom, clap.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.870
Boom, clap.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.598
And boom, clap.

00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:23.810
Good job.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.400
Take a couple minutes, practice
doing this, and go slow.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.390
And then each time go faster,
and faster, and faster,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.270
until you can hit it
smooth and clean like this.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.990
In the Dance and
Dubstep tutorial,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.600
we break down
everything you need

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.520
to know about
dancing and dubstep.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.980
From hitting those
modulated baselines,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.710
moving in slow motion,
vibrating, how to hit those

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.280
nasty drops, and so much more.
