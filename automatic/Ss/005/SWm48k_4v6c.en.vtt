00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.340
Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.840
I got so many requests to do something Sci-fi
from emails and online and on my

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.470
Facebook. So, today we are gonna be making
Stargate Cookies! Mmmm!

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:32.480
The things you will need, will be: 1 big mixing
bowl, sugar cookie mix, flour,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.020
a gingerbread man cookie cutter, 2 circle
cookie cutters, just make sure 1 is large

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.250
and 1 is a little bit smaller, a stick of
butter, and an egg.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.980
Let’s put it all together!

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.440
Now you’re gonna take your mixer, and you’re
gonna beat for 2 minutes

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.340
on medium speed.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.899
Once you finish mixing your batter, you’re
gonna get your hands dirty, and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.460
stick ‘em in the bowl, and start massaging
the dough.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.000
And you just keep doing it until it’s a
bit more moldable, then we’ll roll it out!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.090
Take a little bit of flour, a little pinch
of flour, a handful if you have really

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.070
small hands! Put it down, put down your ball.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.280
And I like to put a little flour on the top
of it too!

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.960
Now, take your rolling pin, I also like to
coat that in flour, so that doesn’t stick.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.400
And then you’re just gonna lightly roll
it out.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.299
Once you’ve got your dough all rolled out,
what you want to do is line

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.920
your cookie sheet with a piece of wax paper,
and we’re gonna now cut out the little

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.110
star gates.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.720
So use the bigger circle first, neep-neep-neep-neep!

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.780
Use a flipper, pick him up, and put him on
the wax paper.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.470
And then you’re gonna take your smaller
circle, line him up in the middle,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.080
nee-nee-nee-nee-nee! Then you’re gonna take
this little toothpick,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.650
pick out the middle. I found that this way
works better than trying to transport

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.050
the thin ring onto the cookie sheet, otherwise
it gets kind of warped.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.629
Looks like an oval, like a weird oval.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.680
Ta-da! Now we’re gonna cut out our little
gingerbread sugar cookie men!

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.740
Little Starfleet officers! Oh, so cute!

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.880
And then we’re just gonna cut him out, take
my little flipper,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.520
and put him on your tray.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.150
Before we put the cookies into the oven, we’re
gonna take the circle cookies,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.030
like so, and fill them with Jolly Ranchers.
This is a really cool technique, a lot

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.790
of people do this for holiday cookies, but
I’m gonna be using it to make these

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.000
look like the actual event horizon in the
middle.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.140
It’s gonna be all blue and shiny, it’s
gonna look really, really cool.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.700
OK, so, you dump ‘em out, and you’re gonna
pick out just the blue ones,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.420
that’s all you want. And then you’re gonna
unwrap ‘em, put him in the bag.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.680
I’ve already done a few ahead of time, so
I saved some time.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.990
Now take your hammer, crack ‘em.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.680
Ta-da!

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.150
Take a little handful of Jolly Rancher and
put him in the middle.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.420
A little tip, that I would suggest doing,
is fill them a little bit higher than you

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.549
think that you would have to. Da-da!

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.330
Once these are all done, we can put them in
the oven at 350 and you bake

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.170
for about 6 minutes. But keep a close eye
on ‘em because these cookies are

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.500
a little bit thinner and you don’t want
them to burn!

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.909
Once your cookies are done baking, take them
out of the oven and make sure

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.250
they’ve had plenty of time to cool! You
want to make sure that they’re completely

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.720
hard, no soft cookies, or else they’ll be
falling apart!

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.320
Look what they look like, they ended up so
cool! Ahhhh!

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.260
Look at our little Stargates! Eeee! Little
wormhole, hello!

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.670
Now it is time to decorate, I have pre-dyed
all these cookie icings, we have

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.450
white, gray, green, black and skin fleshy
tones.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.660
We’re gonna start with gray, and I’m gonna
frost him first, our little Stargate!

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.960
Now we’re gonna let this 1 dry, because
we’re gonna add some layers on top, and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.540
we’re gonna make our first little crew member, using
the green cookie icing.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.009
Once you’re done frosting your cookies,
do this to all of your other cookies and

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.350
wait 10 minutes for them to dry!

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.910
The cookies have dried and now we’re going
to add another level of decoration.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.780
You’re going to take your black cookie icing,
and we’re gonna draw little

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.840
combat vests. Weee, boop!

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.280
I’m gonna draw his little gun strap, here’s
their little combat boots!

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.610
This, this is how you draw boots… Oops,
also might want to look when you’re doing it.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.160
Once you got the black decoration, little
camo gear on, we’re gonna decorate

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.060
the skin color.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.440
While we wait for the skin color frosting
to set, we’re gonna take yellow fondant,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.900
and if you don’t have fondant you can use
Laffy Taffy, you can use Starburst,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.800
you just roll it out, just anything moldable,
that’s fine.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.960
And we’re gonna cut little triangles, and
put ‘em right on the top.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.889
You’re gonna have to cut out, pfft, pfft!

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.020
And you’re gonna cut out 9 of them, to be
the little chevrons!

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.509
I just evenly spaced ‘em out. And you’re
gonna take gray frosting, and we’re just

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.570
gonna add some extra details to our Stargate!

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.120
Da-dew! We’re all done with the little icings,
now you’re just gonna do this to

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.130
all of your cookies, and you can start decorating
your little officers.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.570
This ones all dry, so you can make their little faces and hair!

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.759
Ta-da! All of our little Stargate cookies
are all done, we have the actual

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.939
Stargates with the Jolly Rancher center, woo!
They’re so cute!

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.040
And, we have all of our commanding officers,
well I picked my 4 favorite from SG1.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:18.300
So, OK, we have Teal’c, Dr. Jackson, Major
Carter and Commander O’Neil.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.530
I couldn’t really get her hair right, but
that’s OK, I’m gonna eat her anyways!

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.340
Thanks you guys for suggesting a Sci-fi episode,
this is 1 of my favorite Sci-fi’s.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.350
I also love Battlestar Galactica, Firefly,
anything Josh Weeden really does,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.639
and, um, yes, maybe in a future episode!

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.380
But, if you have any other ideas for any other
Nerdy Nummies, please let me know,

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.330
leave me a comment down below and I will do
my best to make it happen!

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.390
OK, thanks you guys, bye-bye!
