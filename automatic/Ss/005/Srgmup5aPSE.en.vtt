00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi treasures then here i am today with 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.150
 a new video forgive if this part 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 is only recorded with the voice but 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.559
 unfortunately I lost the part I had 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.960
 recorded last night and I'm a bit of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 hurry so okay sorry you anyway 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.539
 both this is a video for life and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.010
 You are seeing this slide down I put myself 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.050
 all the titles because as usual not 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.119
 I remind them that you didn't speak 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.880
 English and they don't understand me anyway 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.740
 what we are talking about is tape 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 extension lite backstage shaun are 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.500
 basically of the extension with a 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.270
 double - sided adhesive tape so let's talk about it 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.370
 Scotch with the Scotch that we are one 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.870
 school but one for hair and that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.059
 absolutely not ruining my hair 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.539
 now you will see the app e 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.750
 you will see how to do it on the net we say this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.730
 and clara you can see frisa and you can 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.039
 in short, see how it is done on the ip network 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.780
 that is to say the keratin is put back we say that 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.379
 also Latin goes well well in fact 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.510
 put back the double-sided tape and for 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.699
 reusing them precisely are very useful 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 because precisely they can be reused e 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.990
 nothing will leave you to the video and do not have 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.330
 took this kiss then treasure one 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.040
 very important thing 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.390
 as you can see, I am not wearing make-up because of me 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.659
 I have washed my hair 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.979
 do it wash your hair because before 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.680
 start because it needs a lot or the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.670
 made that hair is clean but without 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.510
 no one leaps because if you put 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.350
 balms could 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.490
 we say hinder the duration then final 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.050
 of extensions because they should 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.580
 literally from slipping away 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.740
 now I'm combing and drying them 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.070
 well anyway yes okay I left it 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.600
 the vote but they are still dry and 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.970
 nothing now let's apply them with 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.920
 calmly because more than anything else a 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.080
 decide where to put them because I have them 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.210
 already a little while doing it instead 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.630
 at the beginning I would have directly divided the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.630
 head here divided divided the head here 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.320
 divided to it I would have done instead 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.990
 this time I have to do I have to do 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.600
 we say da cup not dakar but oh well there 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.220
 we are then understood treasures to start 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.530
 I'll show you that it's very possible 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.730
 apply the extension to myself and me 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.380
 I'm helped more than anything else for 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.850
 let you see it in fact you will see that 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.010
 these shots are not really 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.170
 perfect because in fact I was alone though 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.090
 it is very possible to apply it from 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.980
 sun it takes really little is enough for me 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.350
 however, two aspects to see you better 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.180
 both in front and behind then the first 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.489
 what i'm going to do is select the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.650
 where I want to put the tape e 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.390
 flash will have to be an account in which 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.489
 surely then they will go over there 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.170
 applicable and therefore tenacity is not 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.790
 will see I highly recommend it been in 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.170
 this does not leave very little hair 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.970
 don't put them too high because 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.060
 otherwise you will see it anyway 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.750
 it is very simple I remove the part that 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.640
 cover the adhesive and stick it over the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.090
 hair literally as you are 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.950
 giving do I go to raise the extension ho 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.000
 just applied leaving a little bit of 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.490
 hair clearly stuck to that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.200
 I will be practically trying to 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.140
 create a sandwich practically a 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.380
 sandwich because an extension here 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.480
 stuffing is my hair a few and then 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 the other extension I know now not 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.360
 You are a great hair but you are not 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.950
 worried this really was 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.480
 just to make you understand that you can 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.330
 go alone now we're going to see 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.160
 well how to apply them 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.490
 more specifically, in short, I do 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.660
 see the passage closely 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.130
 however, the last step to take 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.030
 what you are seeing me doing precisely 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.530
 now it's taking a plate and note 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.130
 put a little heat on top of it 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.810
 part where there is the part of we say here 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:54.600
 not art together with listening to you 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.530
 clearly and throw and now as you see 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.750
 from the nearest 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.630
 let's see how it's done then before 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.130
 we all attach the first lock 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.739
 let's say the first part of the stage 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.870
 extension at this time as you see 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.220
 my father is well pressed for 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.220
 make the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.830
 the extension just takes the hair 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.600
 let's say a little to leave those 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.190
 which have remained attached release 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.810
 attack those who come off that 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.660
 are more instead as you see leverage 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.450
 take away there is no need to 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.940
 put so many of the above 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.030
 the two fashions and I'm going there the 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.940
 collar on this other side 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.310
 of the extensions and also makes pressure here 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.230
 and now let's go to plate so that the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:46.690
 our xpansul heads won't move 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:48.750
 more from there and will not come off here 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.430
 treasures this is the passage for 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.400
 remove maybe the extension you had 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.720
 already applied or anyway after a while 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.750
 clearly the hair grows so yes 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.600
 could see they go go 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.970
 clearly removed with the appropriate let's say 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.860
 remover is like an oil but don't use it 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.810
 he of house clearly used these here 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.610
 that there are many to win 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.320
 trade on the web 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.500
 I'm just using this remover 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.200
 I'm going to put it over the strip 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.040
 where that state give it the best 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.310
 strip where there is precisely the tape lo 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.050
 scotch let's say do some work 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.750
 the oil that must come into good e 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.210
 gently start attacking the two 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.400
 parts of the former pension logically not 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.960
 you will feel no evil hair not you 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.850
 they will ruin it because it does everything 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.590
 the oil you just need to have a little bit 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.510
 of patience because I don't put very little 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.970
 at a time, as you can see, I'm putting myself there 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.590
 I'm just putting it a little 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.330
 really a little at a time so that 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.540
 you can still see the very well 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.440
 proceeding precisely continue to 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.010
 to work 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.840
 the oil and the tape and slowly here it is 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.280
 result will come off without any 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.010
 pain leaving no residue 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.419
 clearly if it will leave any residue 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.430
 but of this brand however it does not 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.870
 leave however okay if you find someone 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.840
 just brush with a little bit 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.060
 of oil and everything goes away now and there 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.380
 show how to reuse the 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.060
 our extensions 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.860
 then first of all you have to remove the 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.560
 old glue because once that 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.560
 you will have solved 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.300
 from your hair to the stages 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.650
 however the glue and the will have remained 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.600
 you have to disconnect with a little bit of 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.030
 patience as you are seeing here than with 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.440
 the nails slowly the detachment and the 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.389
 see right here in the part of the 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.430
 with that you understand that still why 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.040
 a little bit sticky even if he sees it 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:42.000
 detached forgive noises but it is lara 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:46.520
 slams here is how you see the removed e 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.780
 now here now you just have to 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.600
 reattach them another piece take a 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.280
 another piece of feet his new and with 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.450
 I am also extremely extreme of a bit 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.540
 wrong here now as you see the 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:03.720
 done hung up and you will only have to 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.169
 take away let's say this blue line for 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.240
 have under the time extension 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.990
 here is how you see if I lift is the part 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.880
 where it adheres to the hair is me 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.760
 recording this video the next day 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.300
 because in fact I slept and everything 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.410
 so by now hair is also a bit 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.720
 inflated for or at least to show 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.789
 however the effect is very very nice and 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.680
 the institutions I am ready for mine for 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.110
 get out so I leave 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.310
 avoiding that just big kiss and there 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.310
 see you at the next video
