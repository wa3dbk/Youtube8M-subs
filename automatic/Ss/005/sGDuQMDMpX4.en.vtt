00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.129
 it is here the grebbe and self-driving grub the tektronix 410 that is in use 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.259
 is plow makers at a contracting company 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.889
 This is the best four to end the self-propelled harvester 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.589
 we see here for the heightened 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.289
 novum ap ap sit down the French battle with a finished mitten 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.349
 and that actually carried the logo to the right-hand side, so it thought 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.359
 does not lie between your back and is therefore no longer carried along 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.619
 machine is 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.749
 what kind of st 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.749
 What is special is that we do not see diabolo in front, among other places 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.340
 at has the recordings 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.350
 this is because use is made of what gerrit calls the urgent largest 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 system 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.900
 that is the inclusion with 85 in the premier league not sit 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.740
 he offers to walk between the backs 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.640
 This one also features the brand electronic messaging scheme we are seeing 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.500
 also the thalys test and then we immediately put them on the front and we see that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.720
 act it also always gives the right roy depth 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.350
 with the hydraulic powered by a crocodile being two meters wide it is also 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.480
 provided with a marker sea cloth 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.450
 again see the row of trees product as much as possible the plant 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.450
 these are still provided as we can see from a real long head butt 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.500
 amen the supplier and that is extra to be able to unload on the bunker in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.850
 deep keepers over has many containers and that way were aware of it 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.390
 the beds 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.890
 of course you on the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.610
 The caterpillar drives on the front the caterpillars that are about three feet long 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.290
 and are 90 centimeters wide so again have a large surface to cover the whole 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.280
 weight at the rear and certainly also with one 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.430
 and of course send the two behind 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.990
 with the 865,000 32 tires 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.160
 which yes we are again between the runners 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.280
 well for the whole is a four other 90 hp mercedes benz engine present 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.890
 to say everything 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.120
 and the service maybe better we can see the fact that it is from the 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.860
 cabin 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.640
 with the so-called vs 700 the control for the ring road does not 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.199
 and then it is also good to take a taxi 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.949
 to the engines and thereby the operation
