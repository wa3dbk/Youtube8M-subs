00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
organics and I just got in my diverter

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.120 
organics and I just got in my diverter
that<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.950> will<00:00:08.099> be<00:00:08.250> using<00:00:08.519> for<00:00:09.059> my<00:00:10.130> rainwater

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
that I will be using for my rainwater

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.540 
that I will be using for my rainwater
harvesting<00:00:11.990> system<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.740> my<00:00:13.889> rain<00:00:14.130> barrels

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
harvesting system for my rain barrels

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.630 

I'm<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.060> go<00:00:18.390> ahead<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.690> fold<00:00:18.869> over<00:00:19.640> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
I'm going to go ahead and fold over the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.370 
I'm going to go ahead and fold over the
instructions<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.570> because<00:00:21.990> they<00:00:22.199> don't

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
instructions here because they don't

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.189 
instructions here because they don't
have<00:00:22.529> an<00:00:22.740> affiliate<00:00:23.189> program<00:00:23.510> at<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.869> time

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
have an affiliate program at this time

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.540 
have an affiliate program at this time
so<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.500> not<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.890> promoting<00:00:26.369> them

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
so I'm not going to be promoting them

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.900 
so I'm not going to be promoting them
but<00:00:27.449> anyhow<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.869> gives<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.380> step-by-step

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
but anyhow it gives you step-by-step

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.420 
but anyhow it gives you step-by-step
instructions<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.090> how<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:31.430> looks

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
instructions on how to do this looks

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.970 
instructions on how to do this looks
like<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.610> will<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.820> pretty<00:00:33.030> simple<00:00:33.920> here<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
like this will be pretty simple here is

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.250 
like this will be pretty simple here is
the<00:00:35.910> diverter<00:00:36.329> box<00:00:37.040> right<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the diverter box right here the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
the diverter box right here the
downspout<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.920> actually<00:00:41.280> go<00:00:41.399> into<00:00:41.550> here

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
downspout would actually go into here

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.639 
downspout would actually go into here
it's<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.750> two<00:00:42.960> hoses<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.559> will

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it's going to have two hoses that will

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.029 
it's going to have two hoses that will
come<00:00:43.829> off<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.370> will<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.670> into<00:00:45.890> two<00:00:46.890> different

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
come off one will go into two different

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.549 
come off one will go into two different
barrels<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.730> you'd<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.410> two<00:00:49.410> different

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
barrels if you'd like two different

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.010 
barrels if you'd like two different
systems<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.399> you'd<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.960> also<00:00:52.110> has<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
systems if you'd like it also has a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.240 
systems if you'd like it also has a
splash<00:00:55.020> guard<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:57.770> also<00:00:58.770> here's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
splash guard right here and also here's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.290 
splash guard right here and also here's
some<00:00:59.489> plugs<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.840> put<00:01:01.170> into<00:01:01.879> these<00:01:02.879> on

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
some plugs that you put into these on

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.050 
some plugs that you put into these on
the<00:01:03.390> very<00:01:03.600> bottom<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:05.430> wanted<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> cap

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the very bottom so if you wanted to cap

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.310 
the very bottom so if you wanted to cap
one<00:01:06.360> off<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.840> could<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:09.710> kind<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> basic

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
one off you could do that kind of basic

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.750 
one off you could do that kind of basic
looks<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.740> exactly<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> was<00:01:14.700> looking

looks it's exactly what I was looking

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
looks it's exactly what I was looking
for<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.330> already<00:01:15.479> has<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> screen<00:01:16.020> built<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.560> but

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
for it already has a screen built in but

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
for it already has a screen built in but
I<00:01:17.159> will<00:01:17.340> put<00:01:17.490> another<00:01:17.790> screen<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.900> just

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
I will put another screen in it just

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.499 
I will put another screen in it just
ensure<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.220> no<00:01:20.340> bugs<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.479> anything

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
going to place it about here that way I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679 
going to place it about here that way I
can<00:01:46.500> still<00:01:46.710> use<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.040> attachment<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:48.270> secure

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
can still use this attachment to secure

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.260 
can still use this attachment to secure
the<00:01:48.899> bottom<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.210> downspout<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
the bottom of the downspout and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.639 
the bottom of the downspout and
mark<00:01:54.200> market<00:01:54.859> and<00:01:55.009> pencil<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.590> way<00:01:59.409> if<00:02:00.409> I

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
mark market and pencil so that way if I

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.160 
mark market and pencil so that way if I
want<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.890> change<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.429> it's<00:02:02.360> not<00:02:02.539> ink

I'll go ahead and cut that alright guys
we've<00:02:07.759> got<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.969> diverter<00:02:08.269> box<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:09.700> top<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.819> the

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
we've got the diverter box on top of the

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.979 
we've got the diverter box on top of the
downspout<00:02:11.239> cut<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.790> secured<00:02:13.790> not<00:02:14.569> all<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.750> need

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
downspout cut and secured not all I need

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.630 
downspout cut and secured not all I need
to<00:02:15.110> do<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.590> secure<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.190> bottom<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.580> the
