oh<00:03:23.580> these<00:03:24.580> are<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> routes<00:03:25.300> in<00:03:25.630> which<00:03:25.960> all

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
oh these are the routes in which all

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.640 
oh these are the routes in which all
planets<00:03:26.740> move<00:03:27.010> around<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.580> Sun<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:28.290> Sun<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.500> in

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
planets move around the Sun so Sun is in

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.220 
planets move around the Sun so Sun is in
the<00:03:29.680> center<00:03:30.100> yes<00:03:30.970> you're<00:03:31.570> right

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
the center yes you're right

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.500 
the center yes you're right
let<00:03:32.470> me<00:03:32.620> tell<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:33.010> something<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.670> group<00:03:34.330> of

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
Roman people just covered about the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.690 
Roman people just covered about the
solar<00:03:37.240> system<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.230> they<00:03:38.440> named<00:03:38.680> everything<00:03:39.370> in

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
solar system so they named everything in

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.300 
solar system so they named everything in
Roman<00:03:40.209> like<00:03:40.900> these<00:03:41.380> circles<00:03:41.920> are<00:03:42.010> called

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
Roman like these circles are called

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.790 
Roman like these circles are called
orbits<00:03:42.790> which<00:03:43.180> means<00:03:43.510> moving<00:03:44.140> around<00:03:44.530> and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
orbits which means moving around and

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.410 
orbits which means moving around and
Roman<00:03:45.220> object<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:47.280> see<00:03:48.280> our<00:03:48.550> earth<00:03:49.120> is<00:03:49.300> a

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
Roman object of it see our earth is a

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.870 
Roman object of it see our earth is a
planet<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:50.080> it<00:03:50.440> moves<00:03:50.709> around<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.250> Sun<00:03:51.489> it

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
planet and it moves around the Sun it

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.360 
planet and it moves around the Sun it
takes<00:03:52.120> one<00:03:52.540> year<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.080> complete<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.530> circle<00:03:54.100> Oh

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
takes one year to complete a circle Oh

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.520 
takes one year to complete a circle Oh
one<00:03:55.209> year<00:03:55.570> that<00:03:55.959> means<00:03:56.580> 365<00:03:57.580> days<00:03:57.850> yes<00:03:58.630> now<00:03:59.200> let

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
one year that means 365 days yes now let

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.160 
one year that means 365 days yes now let
us<00:03:59.560> move<00:03:59.860> forward<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:01.000> know<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.450> trip<00:04:01.959> and

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
us move forward you know a trip and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.860 
us move forward you know a trip and
whole<00:04:02.350> system<00:04:02.920> would<00:04:03.190> take<00:04:03.430> many<00:04:03.820> years<00:04:04.060> but

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
whole system would take many years but

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.080 
whole system would take many years but
our<00:04:05.170> magic<00:04:05.770> plane<00:04:05.980> is<00:04:06.130> taking<00:04:06.310> us<00:04:06.640> faster<00:04:09.090> what

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
our magic plane is taking us faster what

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.560 
our magic plane is taking us faster what
is<00:04:10.270> this<00:04:10.540> oh<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:11.709> is<00:04:11.890> mercury<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.180> very

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
is this oh this is mercury it is very

saturn has rings around it do you know
these<00:06:07.229> rings<00:06:07.619> are<00:06:07.799> made<00:06:07.949> of<00:06:08.009> rock<00:06:08.429> and<00:06:08.459> ice

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:09.269 
these rings are made of rock and ice

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:12.469 
these rings are made of rock and ice
oh<00:06:09.529> but<00:06:10.529> these<00:06:10.769> look<00:06:11.099> like<00:06:11.339> rings<00:06:11.789> from<00:06:12.179> far

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
oh but these look like rings from far

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.149 
oh but these look like rings from far
away

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159

Agriculture<00:06:18.799> let's<00:06:19.799> see<00:06:20.039> other<00:06:20.219> planet<00:06:20.909> oh<00:06:21.149> it

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:21.929 
Agriculture let's see other planet oh it

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:25.279 
Agriculture let's see other planet oh it
is<00:06:22.139> light<00:06:22.499> blue<00:06:22.769> in<00:06:22.979> color<00:06:23.279> yes<00:06:24.119> you<00:06:24.779> know<00:06:24.929> it

also has rings around it but they are
not<00:06:28.079> visible<00:06:28.769> from<00:06:28.979> Earth<00:06:29.239> because<00:06:30.239> they're

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:30.809 
not visible from Earth because they're

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:33.769 
not visible from Earth because they're
from<00:06:31.049> upside<00:06:31.589> down<00:06:31.859> unlike<00:06:32.459> Saturn<00:06:32.969> which<00:06:33.569> are

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:33.779 
from upside down unlike Saturn which are

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:38.269 
from upside down unlike Saturn which are
surrounded<00:06:34.409> oh<00:06:35.749> it<00:06:36.749> is<00:06:36.989> so<00:06:37.289> blue<00:06:37.679> it<00:06:38.219> is

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279 
surrounded oh it is so blue it is

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:42.139 
surrounded oh it is so blue it is
natural<00:06:39.179> it<00:06:39.509> is<00:06:39.539> so<00:06:40.049> bull<00:06:40.379> that<00:06:41.069> is<00:06:41.129> why<00:06:41.549> Roman

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:42.149 
natural it is so bull that is why Roman

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.899 
natural it is so bull that is why Roman

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:44.909 
named it after the name of that goderdzi

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:49.519 
named it after the name of that goderdzi
so<00:06:45.629> there<00:06:46.259> are<00:06:47.059> eight<00:06:48.059> planets<00:06:48.329> and<00:06:48.809> Jupiter

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
so there are eight planets and Jupiter

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.129 
so there are eight planets and Jupiter
is<00:06:49.769> the<00:06:49.799> biggest<00:06:50.429> one<00:06:50.669> yes<00:06:51.389> you're<00:06:51.839> right

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
today yes we saw all solar system

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.870 
today yes we saw all solar system
let<00:07:00.220> me<00:07:00.340> show<00:07:00.490> you<00:07:00.550> something<00:07:01.090> now<00:07:02.490> see<00:07:03.490> if<00:07:03.820> you
