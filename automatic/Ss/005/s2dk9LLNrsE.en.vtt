00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
they're epiphytes which means they don't

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.500 
they're epiphytes which means they don't
require<00:00:36.660> soil<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> they're<00:00:38.730> easy<00:00:39.149> care

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
they still do require some care they

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.240 
they still do require some care they
actually<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.210> their<00:00:45.390> nutrients<00:00:46.250> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
actually get all their nutrients and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.190 
actually get all their nutrients and
moisture<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> air<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
moisture from the air that is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
moisture from the air that is
fascinating<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.219> me<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.940> need<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
fascinating to me so you do need to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.600 
fascinating to me so you do need to
water<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.899> mist<00:00:52.170> them<00:00:52.350> about<00:00:53.219> once<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
water them or mist them about once a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.160 
water them or mist them about once a
week<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.420> than<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.690> that's<00:00:55.020> about

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
week and other than that that's about

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200 
week and other than that that's about
the<00:00:55.410> only<00:00:55.620> care<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.160> okay<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.969> what's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the only care you need okay and what's

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.029 
the only care you need okay and what's
really<00:00:57.600> unique<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.079> how<00:00:58.109> creative<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.980> be

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
really unique is how creative you can be

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.770 
really unique is how creative you can be
with<00:00:59.370> them<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.789> don't<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.270> mean<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
with them and they don't I mean you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
with them and they don't I mean you
don't<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> green<00:01:01.530> thumb<00:01:01.770> -<00:01:02.160> well

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
don't have to have a green thumb - well

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.750 
don't have to have a green thumb - well
I'm<00:01:02.789> definitely<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.480> testimony<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.760> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
I'm definitely a testimony to that and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.840 
I'm definitely a testimony to that and
so<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.409> sitting<00:01:07.710> these<00:01:08.520> are

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
so this one is just sitting these are

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.940 
so this one is just sitting these are
some<00:01:09.600> containers<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.500> buy<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.680> want

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
some containers you can buy you want

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.130 
some containers you can buy you want
something<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.520> vented<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.080> do

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
something that's vented so they do

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.530 
something that's vented so they do
require<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.950> air<00:01:14.130> circulation<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
require good air circulation and so this

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.370 
require good air circulation and so this
literally<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.680> sits<00:01:16.920> right<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> does<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
literally just sits right so does that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
literally just sits right so does that
mean<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.890> display<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> outdoors<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:21.090> well

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
mean you can display it outdoors as well

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300 
mean you can display it outdoors as well
I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:22.020> temperatures<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.770> warmer<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
I think when temperatures get warmer you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.800 
I think when temperatures get warmer you
could<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.090> still<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.450> don't<00:01:24.659> like

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
could do that it's still they don't like

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
could do that it's still they don't like
a<00:01:24.840> freeze<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.500> again<00:01:26.100> we're<00:01:26.310> still<00:01:26.549> too<00:01:26.729> early

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a freeze so again we're still too early

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.819 
a freeze so again we're still too early
to<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> summer<00:01:28.350> yes<00:01:28.590> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to do that but in the summer yes you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.950 
to do that but in the summer yes you
could<00:01:28.979> easily<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.520> these<00:01:29.759> outdoors<00:01:30.240> okay<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
could easily use these outdoors okay and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
could easily use these outdoors okay and
they<00:01:31.110> come<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> variety<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:32.070> mean<00:01:32.400> their

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
they come in a variety I mean their

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
they come in a variety I mean their
unique<00:01:32.880> characteristics<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.259> all<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
unique characteristics are just all the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.730 
unique characteristics are just all the
different<00:01:34.710> shapes<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.549> styles<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.240> can

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
different shapes and styles that you can

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.020 
different shapes and styles that you can
play<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.189> you're<00:01:38.369> designing<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
play with when you're designing it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
play with when you're designing it
whether<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.780> coffee<00:01:40.079> table<00:01:40.380> piece

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
whether it just be a coffee table piece

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.670

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
maybe these colored beads would be

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.319 
maybe these colored beads would be
interesting<00:02:45.639> so<00:02:45.849> just<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.790> set<00:02:48.790> those<00:02:48.970> in

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
interesting so just just to set those in

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.300 
interesting so just just to set those in

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
there okay sure that sounds really loud

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.770 
there okay sure that sounds really loud
with<00:02:54.519> my<00:02:54.669> microphone<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.209> then<00:02:55.389> maybe<00:02:55.659> a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
with my microphone and then maybe a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.899 
with my microphone and then maybe a
shell<00:02:56.169> or<00:02:56.200> two<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.829> could<00:02:57.069> stick<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> shell

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909
