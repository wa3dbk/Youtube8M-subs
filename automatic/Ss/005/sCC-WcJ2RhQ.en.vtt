00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.740
 Already have my ladies and 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.620
 gentlemen welcome to the press conference too 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.910
 my right coach of the bvb jÃ¼rgen 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.560
 Klop around to my left our 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.030
 head coach norbert Meier and the word we 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.669
 First of all a hostess yes yes I am 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.869
 Of course, very satisfied 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.400
 he has more of the game you believe in you 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.789
 The initial phase is not pretty good 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.560
 had fallen 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.769
 too casual out although some very 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.569
 But it was concentrated in normal everyday life 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.570
 anyway a kind of skip 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.829
 In any case, emphasizes cool and then 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.469
 Let's do it right 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.850
 So it was ten minutes from now 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.820
 really good at the great football game 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.100
 made a world class goal shot 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.260
 a good ball circulation neat 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 defended and that is a two 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 But they do not have to leave situations 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.559
 want the really big second tent 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.429
 that is honest to us 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.089
 said the second succeeded pretty well 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.510
 made a goal 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:09.020
 Great chances had scarce Julian 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.020
 still marco reus the margin 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 So that was big stuff and then 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.920
 again we have the one 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 or other flank admitted too much 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 Had to have his own series too 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.520
 have to hold on to the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 left alone great reacted 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.219
 anyway and subsequent hits then is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.729
 Of course it's really exciting 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.990
 But I think that's over 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.250
 Of course , it will be our view now 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.689
 it did not go well either 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.979
 bad 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.200
 the team is heavily loaded and 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.180
 can also concentrate flutes 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.340
 the opponent has come up right 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.340
 the well done and if we have a at the end 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.509
 had conceded compensation would also 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.759
 Of course , all right 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.320
 so we are certainly not undeserved though 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.600
 through the last few minutes 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.720
 but some lucky winner thank you 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.460
 I wish the last three play this 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.150
 the very best would very much like 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.100
 next come back thank you 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.310
 thanks a lot thanks and praise there 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.520
 Ask trainer moment comes with good 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.190
 Young had so robert lewandowski already 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.300
 Grand series left today is still 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.890
 a little later than against 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.239
 has not worked out 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.280
 well that's auditioned but 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.510
 you have the last two gates of 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.380
 I had seen this series robbie 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.200
 have extended 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.790
 the team is almost there 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.620
 injuries still somehow across 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.870
 to lay 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.430
 and you do not have to overdo it 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.780
 yes said next 100 years holding ag 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.920
 So she can now too 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.870
 relaxation but also relaxes the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.900
 Both realize that today is not from the beginning 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.700
 should be to play actually 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.459
 it was not completely against 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:03:00.750
 the idea and therefore of the republic 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:03.570
 More questions for reference hurt 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.980
 or just actually it 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.510
 now and I hope it is not 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.420
 hurt or struck at least 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.420
 is a cosmopolitan who makes problems and 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.040
 lukasz piszczek adductors 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.250
 play hands in no case 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.250
 can and therefore completely meaningless 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.110
 License plates agree that there is one 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.750
 situation was a bit happy from 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:41.230
 me that I'm out with my situation 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.940
 but I did not see that again 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.440
 then as nothing to do 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:51.400
 but I mean it was the header 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.460
 to get out of the salt and the 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.720
 situation as mainz falls on the ball 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.730
 that is already different 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.460
 No question we have decided 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.750
 our huge possibilities if you 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.890
 If we had used it it would be to the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.480
 just this version a little less 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.100
 meaningfulness so you have to there 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.910
 say 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.050
 the situation is already everything 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.310
 So it was clear at decided 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.130
 dont bring the match out inside 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.600
 but at the meeting clearly you can hand 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.340
 I give it in the mirror of his 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.799
 long for complete bodies from max before 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.000
 So the impression was probably with 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.000
 I have not seen it by the hand 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:34.840
 more questions yes, unfortunately, there are on 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.680
 end of the day again without points there 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.770
 although you have to say that the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.900
 Team not only absolutely today 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.639
 has offered what to expect 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.669
 but she is also playful 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.350
 stinkig you have very very good scenes 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.430
 We had chances, too 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.440
 can work out 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.060
 dortmund has two beautiful gates 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.590
 made the first with a long shot 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.970
 and the second well played out 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.110
 no doubt but the team has 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.190
 Also towards the end of game still 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.630
 believed and we have the 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.820
 then have hit on 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.889
 further possibilities still had and 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.840
 Of course, I think, too 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.229
 a very large possibility deprived 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.520
 been 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.600
 I'm still in the mid-term with mr 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:18.950
 weiner talked about going down and 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.260
 also attested that the two are not 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.060
 given eleven meters or the situation 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.830
 also absolutely correct and correct 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.560
 this third situation was decided 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.490
 in the second half it was for me 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.390
 an eleven meter I already have 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.010
 looked at what is if certain things 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.200
 Just walk in one direction then 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.600
 do you get this situation then too 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.350
 not always 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.539
 nonetheless on TV 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.490
 Everything is decided, then you have 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.770
 now at least a story that 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.350
 and it is also true that we are 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.720
 it is not beautiful there are when 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.800
 I'm not lucky about it but on the 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.260
 the other side it is so that the 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.669
 Team safety is not the impression 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.169
 makes as if somewhere on 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.760
 if that does not work, the heads will not go up 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.910
 are but 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.500
 do everything she does everything and 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.780
 possibilities big dortmund we have 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.520
 Not what I maybe 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.130
 wanted to criticize is that we 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.480
 just need our effectiveness back 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.370
 in certain situations 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.020
 That scared us in the round 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.460
 helped by the board the 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.070
 percentage lead then we were very 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.110
 very effective today we just had to 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.170
 beginning and also played towards the end very 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.220
 very good possibilities 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.350
 and you can not do that then 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.040
 reward but as I said we still have 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.610
 three games 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.720
 That's a close situation, but we 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.230
 look forward to it next week 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:45.340
 continues dankeschÃ¶n there ask 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:48.460
 our coach that does not seem the case 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.160
 To be first and partie leads us 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.590
 to Frankfurt on Saturday 15.30 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.410
 and we are host against the first 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.820
 fc nuremberg in two weeks as well 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.880
 Thank you for coming 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.220
 a nice weekend and the bvb a lot 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.580

 thank you and goodbye
