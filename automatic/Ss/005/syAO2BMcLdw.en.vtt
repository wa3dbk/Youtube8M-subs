00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.960
 hi how about everyone in this video 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.640
 I'm going to teach how my waves use 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.650
 the water out of knitting so is that if you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.330
 I would like to see how I did keep seeing 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.280
 this video the first thing they are going to do 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 before applying carbon to your hair 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.940
 It is very important to apply a 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.199
 protector for the hair so that it does not 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.199
 abuse us so much 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.730
 Apply yourself very well at the tips and 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.259
 that have been applied very well 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.419
 hair protector to grab 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.830
 a brush and they are going to stick their hair 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.750
 to distribute the product very well 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.610
 then what they are going to do is separate the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 hair to me I always like to start 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 by curling the bottom part first 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 I go now I need like this I can not 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.469
 there is no perfect way of how to become 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.899
 these curls can do it like you 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.760
 like me always personally I 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.079
 like to start at the bottom of the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.809
 director that I will be using today 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.460
 is this berger called wave arts 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.879
 and it is that a water flare up to think that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.879
 is called 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.920
 I grab hair a little bit like that and I'm going to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.399
 leave there as for about 5 to 10 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.399
 seconds 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.670
 and that's how the stew is 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.850
 here where we end up in this part that 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.490
 is here as going up there is 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.050
 where are we going to put the web out to 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.050
 keep doing the two curls 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.820
 I try to pull her hair long 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.260
 down because that's going to make it 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.260
 undo the curl from above 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.550
 for the bottom part and that the little 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.550
 hair that remains and press it like that 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.900
 this clear water has a little button that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.870
 when you are pressed for up 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.060
 what it does is that it actually secured the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.600
 system you have to stop the water but 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 I assure you, you can wait from 5 to 10 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.400
 seconds when you want to curl and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.140
 is ready then you release it 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.939
 finally you can get 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.650
 Any product that is your favorite 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.140
 for the hair and I'm going to wear this 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.819
 oil that this is going to help you to give 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.890
 shine to the hair and also so that no 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.840
 it will be so stagnant at the top 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.380
 where we have medium small heads 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.300
 put this gel 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.780
 you can use juanes what 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.780
 you like 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.880
 another option so that the hair is not 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.220
 they try to fluff up or they did not like that 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.330
 waves will be stagnant can be 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.330
 get old 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.180
 this clear water apart from having the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.130
 botoncito where he is safe too 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.290
 has another little button where it is turned on 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.660
 and it goes off as you see right now it was cast 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.489
 safe and not moving at all well 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.220
 you can remove the insurance you have the 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.989
 little button where it turns on and off 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.209
 He also has another little button that 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.190
 It turns around and I can not control the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.930
 temperature how hot do you want that 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.930
 you are or accelerate 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.720
 see you until the next video
