00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.130
 to see is difficult because I think we did 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.130
 first good time 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.320
 and the rival did not reach you that much, but 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 good 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.140
 not all 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.609
 I think after the third goal 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.580
 a tumor and that's what the 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.489
 feeling that hits a lot when 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.110
 let's say go to halftime yesterday 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.620
 21 down I made a good match 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.199
 central the first time even 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.240
 at some point after the days 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.580
 but then equal 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.340
 but the rival took very good advantage of the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.580
 opportunity that he had and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.340
 I hope I wait and it came out of the backlash 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.550
 some defensive mistakes 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.739
 but also also me 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.969
 they bother me we're going to be like that it was not 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.510
 it was criminal that I have to see what 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.590
 arguably we are very very open in 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.900
 the corner block 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.640
 and then good not only goals but it is 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.850
 stop the third I have to see it well 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.850
 as well 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.930
 why 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.140
 brother I like to see one can not 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.850
 justify four that a part of the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.260
 party had the handling had the possession 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.690
 he had the poetry of 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.580
 defined 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.260
 and fundamentally for what it does without 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.060
 ball 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.460
 the black team what that did not do 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.370
 With the ball 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.560
 Let's see 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.460
 if the rival had four times of 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.570
 four goals because I had inattention 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.240
 because you were not so stingy like 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.150
 the handling of the game with the boys is 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.050
 so at some point they will learn but 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.050
 this kind of thing happens to you 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.880
 and he asks for more he knows he asks for more 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 Jona asks for more to wedges that are the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.620
 that at some point it has to be 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.620
 decisive 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.800
 and then the guys mind that was not very 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.290
 doubtful no but hey I'm I'm 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.649
 far away I have to see what you do not see no 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.649
 can you tell 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.120
 I used to say walter but good until one 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.590
 have to get used to we go to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.220
 team performance which is what most 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.220
 I'm interested 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.060
 after the third goal is like we 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.400
 it cost to lift again we had also 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.410
 had been the tie cars 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.440
 with the free kick that Paul also 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.910
 but just do not excuse us is not 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.030
 prepared for this kind of thing many 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.030
 plus
