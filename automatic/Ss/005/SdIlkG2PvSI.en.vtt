the g2 is a little bit smaller more

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.630 
the g2 is a little bit smaller more
compact<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.829> course<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> not

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
compact but of course this one is not

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.250 
compact but of course this one is not
waterproof<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.390> doesn't<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> micro<00:00:40.020> SD

waterproof and doesn't have a micro SD
card<00:00:40.500> reader<00:00:40.649> which<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.280> course<00:00:41.309> needs<00:00:41.760> space

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
card reader which of course needs space

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600 
card reader which of course needs space
in<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> Sony<00:00:43.050> smartphone<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.460> just

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
in the Sony smartphone and we can just

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.959 
in the Sony smartphone and we can just
turn<00:00:45.180> both<00:00:45.840> around<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> course

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
turn both around you can see of course

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.600

plastic actually back cover is maybe a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.689 
plastic actually back cover is maybe a
little<00:00:52.530> bit<00:00:52.710> more<00:00:52.890> high-end<00:00:53.129> looks<00:00:53.489> better

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
little bit more high-end looks better

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.670 
little bit more high-end looks better
and<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.629> 20.7<00:00:55.260> mayor<00:00:55.379> pistol

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
notifications Rishta sony doesn't have
if<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:07.830> put<00:01:08.159> both<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.820> top<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.119> each

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
if you just put both on top of each

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
if you just put both on top of each
other<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.600> clearly<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.680> size

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
other we can clearly see this size

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
other we can clearly see this size
difference<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> top<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.260> with

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
difference here on the top but in with

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
difference here on the top but in with
of<00:01:13.680> course<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.130> same<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.670> maybe<00:01:15.180> in

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
of course it's the same and maybe in

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.870 
of course it's the same and maybe in
thickness<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.110> Sony's<00:01:16.470> looks<00:01:16.799> also<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
thickness the Sony's looks also to be a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.280 
thickness the Sony's looks also to be a
little<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.210> thicker<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.810> actually<00:01:19.140> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
little bit thicker but it's actually I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.980 
little bit thicker but it's actually I
am<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.890> sure<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:21.180> LG<00:01:21.840> has

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
am not sure it's really it just LG has

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.499 
am not sure it's really it just LG has
this<00:01:22.200> round<00:01:22.740> edge<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> side<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.939> seems

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
this round edge on the side so it seems

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
this round edge on the side so it seems
to<00:01:24.689> be<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.310> matter<00:01:26.310> wise<00:01:26.520> let's<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.210> maybe

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
to be a matter wise let's we can maybe

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.060 
to be a matter wise let's we can maybe
just<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.990> quickly<00:01:28.170> compare<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> cameras

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
just really quickly compare the cameras

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.280 
just really quickly compare the cameras
since<00:01:29.729> 20<00:01:30.000> megapixels<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> course<00:01:31.020> quite

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
since 20 megapixels is of course quite

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.890 
since 20 megapixels is of course quite
amazing<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> LG<00:01:32.939> let's<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.329> open

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
amazing here on the LG let's just open

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 
amazing here on the LG let's just open

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
will hold them up and both right next to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
will hold them up and both right next to
each<00:01:38.250> other<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.939> guys<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.509> here

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
each other do you guys can see here

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.370 
each other do you guys can see here
under<00:01:41.270> stage<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.509> example<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
under stage for example that we have the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.080 
under stage for example that we have the
exact<00:01:43.649> same<00:01:43.680> picture<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> LG

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
exact same picture but I think the LG

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
exact same picture but I think the LG
has<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.630> more<00:01:45.689> bluish<00:01:46.170> white<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
has a little bit more bluish white and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.490 
has a little bit more bluish white and
to<00:01:47.070> Sony<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.180> reddish<00:01:48.570> white<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.110> but

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to Sony the more reddish white and but

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.280 
to Sony the more reddish white and but
otherwise<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:50.100> terms<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.990> wide-angle<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.049> think

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
otherwise in terms of wide-angle I think

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
otherwise in terms of wide-angle I think
the<00:01:52.350> sony<00:01:52.590> has<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> wee<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:53.970> much

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the sony has a wee bit more but not much

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.899 
the sony has a wee bit more but not much
actually<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.049> ma'am<00:01:55.350> maybe<00:01:55.649> about<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> same<00:01:56.610> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
actually a ma'am maybe about the same so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.639 
actually a ma'am maybe about the same so
yeah<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.439> short

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
yeah this was just really short

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950 
yeah this was just really short
comparison<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.369> sony<00:01:59.610> also<00:02:00.030> does<00:02:00.299> 4k<00:02:00.719> video

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
comparison the sony also does 4k video

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.889 
comparison the sony also does 4k video
which<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> LG<00:02:01.710> g2<00:02:02.159> doesn't<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.390> take<00:02:03.719> much

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
which the LG g2 doesn't do so take much

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.969 
which the LG g2 doesn't do so take much
