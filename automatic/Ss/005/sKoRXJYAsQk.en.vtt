00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
look like the PlayStation game God of

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.310 
look like the PlayStation game God of
War<00:02:58.190> look<00:02:59.190> like<00:02:59.340> Kratos<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.330> those<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.260> you

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
why he's a hero mentored by Superman his

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.840 
why he's a hero mentored by Superman his
power<00:05:14.720> is<00:05:14.960> quantum<00:05:17.320> his<00:05:18.320> weapon<00:05:18.980> ISM<00:05:19.220> hand

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.240 
yeah he's at least here - he is dear - I
think<00:05:32.050> but<00:05:33.050> I<00:05:33.290> stopped<00:05:33.710> playing<00:05:33.860> as<00:05:34.130> him

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
think but I stopped playing as him

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.550 
think but I stopped playing as him
because<00:05:34.580> back<00:05:35.090> before<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.870> update<00:05:36.080> came

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
because back before the update came

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.490 
because back before the update came
where<00:05:36.890> PvP<00:05:37.610> gear<00:05:37.850> wasn't<00:05:38.150> allowed<00:05:38.540> on<00:05:38.870> PvE

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
where PvP gear wasn't allowed on PvE

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.300 
where PvP gear wasn't allowed on PvE
stuff

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
stuff

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.610 
stuff
he<00:05:40.580> was<00:05:40.730> like<00:05:40.880> all<00:05:41.060> PvP<00:05:41.660> gear<00:05:41.930> so<00:05:42.380> I<00:05:42.410> pretty

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
he was like all PvP gear so I pretty

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.520 
he was like all PvP gear so I pretty
much<00:05:42.830> couldn't<00:05:43.220> do<00:05:43.520> PvE<00:05:43.970> instances<00:05:44.810> because<00:05:45.410> I

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
much couldn't do PvE instances because I

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.160 
much couldn't do PvE instances because I
had<00:05:45.710> no<00:05:45.860> PvE<00:05:46.220> gear<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:47.450> when<00:05:47.720> I<00:05:47.780> try<00:05:47.960> to<00:05:47.990> go

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
had no PvE gear and when I try to go

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.680 
had no PvE gear and when I try to go
into<00:05:48.350> PvE<00:05:48.680> instances<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.490> just<00:05:50.150> get<00:05:50.300> dis<00:05:50.450> draw

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
into PvE instances I just get dis draw

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.510 
into PvE instances I just get dis draw
and<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:50.960> was<00:05:51.080> really<00:05:51.320> not<00:05:51.620> fun<00:05:51.980> there's<00:05:52.250> way
