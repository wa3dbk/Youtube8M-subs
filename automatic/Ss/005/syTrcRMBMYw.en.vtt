00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 for me this season has already been 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.870
 spectacular from the beginning to be col 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.910
 peugeot team gave me a charge and one 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.280
 high responsibility however we have succeeded 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
 to bring the championship home with one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.410
 junior race in advance and three of the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.660
 Italian championship and so it was 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.699
 very very nice to be able to win 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.890
 manage to win four races on 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.710
 five disputed to arrive second in one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.260
 just for a small brake problem e 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.330
 then the last rally of san marino was 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.410
 it really doesn't have a tough epic race 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.239
 why 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.489
 the race I had never seen the tests 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.650
 they were difficult routes for our two 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.290
 but it was almost an ordeal for me 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.300
 I didn't have to handle the pressure 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.220
 not even win but we found ourselves 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 in the middle of the first race and then us there 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.949
 we have 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.570
 I also hoped to win the last one 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.510
 in fact it then led us to win 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.239
 also the last latest latest tests 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.850
 special and the race was really 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.010
 a strong emotion then get on stage 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.559
 celebrate with the whole team a 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.270
 championship with the race in advance 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.520
 still without the pressure 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.729
 last race is really something 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.560
 special that only starting I would be 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.789
 already dreamed of being here but I would be 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.300
 also dreamed of winning this way 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.530
 almost almost dominating even if then 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.170
 let's see all the special tests 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.450
 it was a really nice fight and maybe a 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.149
 Italian championship of the most beautiful of the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.420
 last years the machine my 208 and two 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.220
 we don't have the most reliable machine 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.619
 had virtually no problem 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.170
 the team definitely put his own 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.560
 because we are we are dedicated 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.470
 just driving and having fun 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.250
 because in my opinion if one does not have fun 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.380
 in the car when they drive 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.200
 he will never be able to do certain things 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.870
 affirmations you are certain times really is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.479
 really nice car a trim 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.030
 spectacular engine brake brakes a 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.240
 use that we always do not always have 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.490
 never as ever need to hear maybe 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.260
 the lack of some horses and up 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.380
 asphalt in fact we have also said the 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.990
 ours as absolute times we have 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.180
 made tenth absolute and then on the plate 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.760
 florio sixth and also bringing points 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.440
 for peugeot in the manufacturers field 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.440
 so it was really an honor for me
