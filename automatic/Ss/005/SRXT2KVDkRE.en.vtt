 Â«The difficult struggle 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.840
 but due to the placebo effect 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.170
 The placebo effect is just another word for the body's own 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.649
 Self-healing powers of any system that promotes them 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.710
 the site of the xetra system pull the information media

 its complexity can combine everything that happens in the body 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.479
 how the brain does not work as we learned it in school 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.720
 how learning does not happen there is not the memory of everyone 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.650
 weak not rammed 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.150
 this is not just there or otherwise 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.480
 all this is spread all over the brain and moving across the field 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.220
 towards it 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.320
 maybe ten years of that terrible headache that keeps him from time to time 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.490
 worse, so they did a CT and diagnosed a project team 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.110
 around 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.510

 to a specialist to my surprise was in a good value 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.960
 for not on 1 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.880

 the fundamental changes in medicine is the consumers 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.849
 forget this focus on the genes as a universal solution 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.839

 we have our own actions he thinks to explain healing spot sentences 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.809
 Matter is complex energy information is in Berlin had it 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.629
 gives an informational body through the nervous system and the tissues 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:37.269
 through 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.359
 becomes the actual controller of the entire organism and beautiful 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.279

 electromagnetic signals in Cologne 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.379
 because as I imagine this magnetic field as a carrier 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.529
 then it is equipped with information 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.949
 Nylon means getting out of the wheelchair again for us or seeing 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:04.849
