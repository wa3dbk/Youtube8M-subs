pretty nice

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.370 
pretty nice
here's<00:00:04.010> the<00:00:04.190> only<00:00:04.580> rust<00:00:04.850> I<00:00:05.210> could<00:00:05.810> find<00:00:06.050> on<00:00:06.290> the

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.380 
here's the only rust I could find on the

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.009 
here's the only rust I could find on the
whole<00:00:06.410> truck<00:00:06.980> is<00:00:07.279> on<00:00:07.970> the<00:00:08.120> passenger<00:00:08.810> side

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019 
whole truck is on the passenger side

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.549 
whole truck is on the passenger side
windshield<00:00:12.019> seam

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
windshield seam

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.709 
windshield seam
and<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.370> other<00:00:14.549> side<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.509> really

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
and the other side is really really

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.640 
and the other side is really really
clean<00:00:16.610> but<00:00:17.610> this<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.210> some<00:00:18.450> reason<00:00:18.650> it

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
clean but this one for some reason it

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.190 
clean but this one for some reason it
got<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:19.890> little<00:00:20.189> bit<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.369> rust<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.700> it<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.200> opened

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
got a little bit of rust on it I opened

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.749 
got a little bit of rust on it I opened
it<00:00:22.259> up<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.529> little<00:00:22.650> bit<00:00:22.919> and<00:00:23.099> I<00:00:23.160> ducked<00:00:23.460> some<00:00:23.669> of

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
it up a little bit and I ducked some of

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.790 
it up a little bit and I ducked some of
the<00:00:23.820> rust<00:00:24.029> out<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.140> needs<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.560> done

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the rust out but what needs to be done

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.960 
the rust out but what needs to be done
is<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:27.119> should<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.750> pulled<00:00:28.020> and<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:29.790> hole

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
is this should be pulled and the hole

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.700 
is this should be pulled and the hole
inside<00:00:30.390> there<00:00:30.689> should<00:00:30.899> be<00:00:30.960> cleaned<00:00:31.259> up<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
inside there should be cleaned up and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.950 
inside there should be cleaned up and
repainted<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.430> looks<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.149> very<00:00:33.570> very

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
repainted it looks to be very very

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.049 
repainted it looks to be very very
savable<00:00:34.850> without<00:00:35.850> any<00:00:36.120> major<00:00:36.300> reconstruction

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
savable without any major reconstruction

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.280 
savable without any major reconstruction
but<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> will<00:00:39.329> take<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.809> bit<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.110> elbow

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
but it will take a little bit of elbow

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.930 
but it will take a little bit of elbow
grease<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.399> cleaned<00:00:41.610> up

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
grease to get all that cleaned up

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.479 
grease to get all that cleaned up
everywhere<00:00:42.840> else<00:00:43.050> looks<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.980> really

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
everywhere else looks really really

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.139 
everywhere else looks really really
really<00:00:44.520> good<00:00:45.469> when<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.499> did<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> interior<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
really good when I did the interior the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.180 
really good when I did the interior the
four-wheel<00:00:48.570> drive<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.829> went

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
four-wheel drive and all that I went

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
four-wheel drive and all that I went
through<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.429> truck<00:00:50.699> pretty<00:00:50.910> well

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
through the truck pretty well

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.990

tanks<00:01:37.170> work<00:01:37.909> there's<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.000> slight<00:01:39.509> leak<00:01:40.099> out<00:01:41.099> of

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
tanks work there's a slight leak out of

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:47.330 
tanks work there's a slight leak out of
the<00:01:43.520> valve<00:01:44.719> the<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.959> the<00:01:46.170> valve<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.950> switch<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the valve the to the valve to switch the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.639 
the valve the to the valve to switch the
tanks<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> tanks<00:01:49.109> are<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.439> full

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
tanks when the tanks are really full

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.940 
tanks when the tanks are really full
it'll<00:01:50.130> leak<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.289> haven't<00:01:52.590> looked<00:01:52.799> into

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it'll leak and I haven't looked into

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.649 
it'll leak and I haven't looked into
that<00:01:53.069> yet<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.489> pretty<00:01:53.819> sure<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> know<00:01:54.239> what<00:01:54.569> it

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that yet I'm pretty sure I know what it

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.050 
that yet I'm pretty sure I know what it
is<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.259> gasket<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.579> opened<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
is I think the gasket when I opened it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.910 
is I think the gasket when I opened it
up<00:01:57.179> and<00:01:57.390> put<00:01:57.599> new<00:01:57.750> o-rings<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.379> it<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.739> that<00:01:58.890> it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
up and put new o-rings in it so that it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.669 
up and put new o-rings in it so that it
would<00:01:59.069> work<00:01:59.219> properly<00:01:59.579> I<00:02:00.140> had<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.319> make<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
would work properly I had to make the

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.350 
would work properly I had to make the
gasket<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.549> got<00:02:02.789> a<00:02:02.819> little<00:02:02.969> bit<00:02:03.209> sloppy

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
gasket and it got a little bit sloppy

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.529 
gasket and it got a little bit sloppy
it's<00:02:03.780> something<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.739> I<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.939> address<00:02:06.209> sir

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
it's something that I can address sir

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.969 
it's something that I can address sir
the<00:02:06.659> new<00:02:06.780> owner<00:02:06.989> can<00:02:07.229> address<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.709> pretty

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the new owner can address it's pretty

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.740 
the new owner can address it's pretty
minor<00:02:08.250> only<00:02:08.819> leaks<00:02:09.030> when<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.329> tanks<00:02:09.629> are

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
minor only leaks when the tanks are

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.300 
minor only leaks when the tanks are
really<00:02:10.079> full

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.540 

let's<00:02:15.300> be<00:02:17.750> but<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:18.900> about<00:02:19.230> it

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.690 

oh<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.840> know<00:02:22.930> what<00:02:23.140> else

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.760 

really<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.330> neat<00:02:26.600> rare<00:02:26.870> option<00:02:29.350> see<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.530> rear

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
really a neat rare option see that rear

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:43.790 
really a neat rare option see that rear
