00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello youtube people greet them ps 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.230
 novices 123 today I'm going to 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.700
 teach how to record an iso image of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.950
 any linux distribution to a dvd 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.670
 the first thing that we are going to occupy this is 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.119
 this little program 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.470
 is this called animation wood in 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.570
 the extraction of the video is going to leave 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.780
 All instructions and material 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.860
 that is going to occupy 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.810
 the seconds is going to be a virgin dvd 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 you can get it 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:41.100
 do in pharmacies stationery and so on 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.450
 in this case I'm going to burn the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.140
 Linux distribution 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:51.290
 opensuse in 3.1 I think it's the version 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.290
 more more stable of our distribution 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.940
 and we'll start first thing is to get 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 our total 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.469
 / virgin to the reader 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.469
 I put it 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.850
 as it recognizes 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.590
 in fact we can go to the start of type 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.590
 the machine had sodium 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.420
 like this dvd drive 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.440
 in fact it has nothing is clean 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.660
 this 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.450
 and the following since they were ready 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.520
 our virgin baby we open the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.520
 click program 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:48.250
 ok what is an example here six 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.409
 options we go to the first option 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.290
 it's disk image 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.470
 why 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.290
 we go here where it says origin 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.070
 select a file from the folder with 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.370
 a magnifying glass with two click 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.050
 and we look for our image here are 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:14.270
 tense in 3.9 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.990
 click here is already counter and without beard and 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:23.030
 of the image that 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:26.720
 here where it says destiny also check 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.060
 because good in 1 cpu brings a double 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.430
 burner they have where is there 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.550
 You can select which mature 1 burner 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.440
 2 in this case I burned only 1 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.910
 and it is the letter d 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.860
 down here I'm going to the opponent 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.620
 if the popcorn is not checked 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.010
 We put here to verify if you mark us 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.010
 some mistake 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.819
 and here the most important thing where it says 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.709
 writing speed 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:02.249
 we are going to put 4 many put 6 or 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.859
 they put them 10 many think to put it 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:08.700
 at 56 you know I'm going to record it well 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.350
 fast easy they are wrong because the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.710
 time to record 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.400
 it's very fast if we record them and record 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.410
 and all but damaged sectors of the disk and 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 makes it jump and that's why it makes 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.930
 rodeo I think that's why when they drip 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.640
 it can be windows when dripping the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.550
 disk marks a compact dll file high 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.090
 new format file I do not know what the same 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.820
 same goes with Linux distributions 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.460
 mark error or stay paralyzed or 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:48.090
 some different error that 's why it 's more 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:50.350
 recommendable 44 little 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.950
 as for me it is the best 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:58.910
 so that the disc goes well 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.610
 and already having all the steps done 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.120
 as spam we are going to give you here where is 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.840
 an image of a disk and the disk 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.840
 we click 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.580
 you just have to wait for the process 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.090
 as it is an image and show 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.160
 heavy this is going to take a while 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.480
 I like this one to use the video and 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.480
 I come back with you 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:34.690
 if 100% completion is already 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.260
 list our image of burned linux and 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.260
 recorded 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.780
 a good dvd friend this has been all for 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:47.050
 Today I hope you have served them 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.050
 I liked it 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.500
 I hope not 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:55.840
 that this video is useful 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.480
 I'm going to try these external banks 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.420
 hotels in abc I do for how to install it 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.140
 all first didactic what requirements 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.060
 they ask for all that to prove it, just like us 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.240
 we see the next video I send him a 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.240
 cordial
