00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 hi to all friends of pardes we are here 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.620
 today with the brand new home device 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 apple ipad retina this ipad by the name 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.560
 retina we have the 9.7 screen 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:29.849
 inches with a resolution of 2048 x 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:34.110
 1536 pixels the processor is a hicks axis 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.570
 dual core with a quad graphics processor 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 core precisely to support the graphics 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.910
 already very heavy concerning too 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.840
 other applications on the app 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.660
 store 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.520
 however the speed professor very much 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.910
 high 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.090
 we stayed a battery that lasts 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.180
 up to 10 hours is very good and one 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 128 gb memory really generous the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.330
 sim compartment is located on the left side of the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.369
 device and as you can see we have this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.970
 plastic plaque that fits us 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.189
 remember that it is a device with red 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.120
 both wi fi and mobile phone rolling that 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.610
 also supports the new one 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.570
 a 4g network we have a wifi that is 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.320
 doubled in speed compared to 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.630
 processors is a bluetooth 4.0 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.260
 we also have a new connector 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.660
 lightning generation also present on 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.880
 iphone 5 30-pin 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.340
 so this is the difference we say 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.950
 more than can jump to the eye at first 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.420
 view of the father with respect to his 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 predecessor 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.180
 let's see it inside then 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.480
 we unlock it ok 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.000
 I want to show how the display is 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.120
 really a great display though 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.190
 let's get closer to ours 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.160
 therefore also objective 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.780
 our eye sees that it is not 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.640
 we can say to recognize the pixels 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.520
 regarding the resolution 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:19.460
 we have a 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.440
 just as we can go now to 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:31.640
 try to photograph just a 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:34.850
 object here and take a picture either 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.280
 pressing on the display if not also 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.739
 we can crush and on the barbell 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.510
 of the volume so we can take pictures 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.330
 entirely in very rapid sequence 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.150
 good this we can record too 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.760
 1080p video 15 magnifies a bit 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.640
 the image and let us record the only one 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.410
 what is precisely that there is not much 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.959
 liked nor that you can register 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.420
 only 1080p video then full hd e 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.819
 you can't choose maybe 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.830
 lower video quality though 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.500
 this does not bring us that much 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.069
 that our memory is always 128gb 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.150
 and so space abounds now 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:23.450
 let's see the browser department 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:23.450
 loading a page of our website aspartyl 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:37.350
 at very fast loading times on 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:42.269
 ipad 3 sorry ipad retina ok let's see 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.220
 how the page loads us 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.410
 let's say pretty fast anyway 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.400
 it is a very fast device for da 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.620
 many points of view 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.380
 we see that we can have one 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.720
 interesting fluidity is present indeed 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.150
 anyway on all apple tv studios 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.920
 let's say that this company still remains 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.380
 industry leader in regards to 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.110
 the fluidity in the safari browser we can 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.630
 see how the elements on the text yes 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.240
 they can recognize to read a lot 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:19.340
 very well with this new device 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:22.850
 let's try uploading an article let's go 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:27.550
 we are under a 5 g wifi network anyway 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.970
 we say loading very fast 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:35.930
 promise a video of a review 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.550
 let's see how you can do it 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.320
 to see 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.040
 hi teachers that I will go for now 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.910
 to do the videorecensione of iphone 5 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.400
 ok so you can see that ipad with 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:57.200
 this 9.7 inch display really 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:05:01.610
 really good ok now i would say of 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.160
 go to see the mail apparatus that 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.390
 however it remains fairly unchanged 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.220
 now we have not put any 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.190
 on the account however the mail apparatus 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.750
 remains unchanged compared to 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:20.300
 predecessors therefore always always the same 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.790
 Well let's see the maps that map 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.520
 are for example I have to see new york 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.240
 city are the home owner maps 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.470
 precisely apple have been improved 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.630
 just respect to the past since not 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.980
 there were bugs that they gave 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.550
 quite annoying however how 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.140
 we can how we can see and much 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.990
 very interesting this kind of 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.000
 viewing 15 for me here we are for 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.210
 example new york city ​​allows us to 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.690
 seeing very very well is very pretty 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.710
 this is the kind of visualization 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.690
 present Syrians on this device 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.880
 going to press the button let's go 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:07.210
 see various visual options therefore very much 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.190
 advanced also from this point of view 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:14.320
 I would say that this is all 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.320
 to shoot you
