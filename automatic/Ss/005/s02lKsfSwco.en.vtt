00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 today we will have a small review 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.670
 shadows called cream shadows 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.269
 transformer I took for myself all the shades 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.700
 shadows because i have green color 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.310
 eye and suits me and warm colors and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.010
 cool colors of shadows and now let's 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.710
 Now we will consider them in a good way 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.320
 I will arrange them now 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.439
 they are presented in the catalog first go 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.750
 4 shades and warm well, that is, you can 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.700
 Of course, itâ€™s absolutely neutral 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.239
 light is a little bit with pearl 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.309
 shimmer and 4 shades of cold shadows here 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.070
 it will look so smoky gray 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.950
 deep plum deep indigo 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.829
 starry night and it's warm brilliant 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.980
 olive coffee shine rose gold 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.690
 and pearl beige I did now 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.390
 Swatch of shadows 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.609
 right here in yourself on your hand and you can them 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.719
 Now take a good look at the pearl 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.210
 beige thread me look on the skin further 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.330
 there is a little copper shade of pink 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330
 gold 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.030
 If that's a little bit and then kill like this 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.150
 this will look like next 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.060
 hue is a coffee shine 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.180
 brown is beautiful so deep color 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.930
 gives further the next shade is 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.329
 shiny olive ones like them 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.119
 shimmer in the light a little green 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.720
 only in the picture he is more he see 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.119
 more pronounced so pronounced 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.000
 olive but what on hand turned out but 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.939
 although the principle seems to be the next shade 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.460
 this is our starry night that shade 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:57.810
 which is just depicted in figure y 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:01.350
 the models here are deep indigo beautiful 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.460
 so deep color dark night so 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:10.020
 let's say it looks like this 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:13.020
 next is the plum plum shade and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.930
 it looks like pencil pencil 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.990
 pencils on a simple pencil smoky 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:28.110
 gray here let's get close to you 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:31.530
 show all the shades of resistance by the way 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.620
 the shadows are pretty good i mean i'm not here to 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.130
 regret third hands i will try now 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.800
 rubbing the whole shadow you look inflicted 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.650
 probably about five minutes ago 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.570
 photographed yet and now 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.600
 see how it will be smeared 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.170
 this shade 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.910
 so I see with effort true that is 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.520
 smeared very very slightly 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:04.560
 that is, they see with effort when you rub 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.710
 smeared and so the shade does not go away 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.980
 nowhere that is by persistence it turns out 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.680
 fixed and good enough 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.890
 durability will therefore you can safely 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.740
 use them during the day I you
