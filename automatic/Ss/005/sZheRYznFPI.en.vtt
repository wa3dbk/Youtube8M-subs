 suppose with that name there that it is a 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.340
 Quebec but I did not check I

 here who is visiting with us I you 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.940
 friendfeed showed then look at his 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.170
 chains but by a tube one lasts to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.149
 non hockey people and I wanted to change 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.530
 in the black samassa over loading I 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.380
 I will not show you 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:01.659
 this place there for nothing I lean 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.659
 to show you your delusions an owl 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:10.160
 no because the blur so had visited the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.709
 home the owl who is there and she 13.1 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.230
 and my non-Roussel parents will find 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.850
 well from where we gave that we moved 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.380
 to recreate a little atmosphere the 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.970
 baths in the house household madness 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.829
 by the old owners and also 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.989
 because it was very appropriate because 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.700
 of my owl madness that is possible 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.079
 and in fact it did with what you 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.470
 see in video the same time the interviewee 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.209
 or not or if I go out that some 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.870
 of you ask me for my makeup 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.150
 what did I do I told myself 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.790
 must be a little devolved ga 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.610
 much more than I had used because 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.530
 I found it very very light 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.780
 rihanna vein that a leader who put 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.700
 a video online and to the delos ton 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.680
 club on the eyelid gives you the effect 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.210
 a bit hard also that to see the side 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.590
 negative of the outfit that usually 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.960
 mandate is what we really put 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.610
 thing that sticks to so I want to 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.110
 to refuse something that is their 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.210
 does this effect glossy the others that 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.460
 it's very very bright it's almost 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.470
 glitter so his fall by all 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.660
 the games but the face is too cons 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.660
 truce so it's lucky man ka shing 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.740
 right and looks like this is very 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.030
 very very nice the finish super nice 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.660
 and with that actually wet a hollow 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.050
 connection 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.760
 I used this one in the 363 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.650
 Lingua waste since on the holds 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.739
 of inferior I used the a400m too 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.030
 applied which we gorgeous colors 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.860
 then to film a video because 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.250
 multiple drives it not indulge yourself 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.750
 to move in any way 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.070
 heifers that I always go out when I 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.209
 make a video to have a small 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.489
 something on my lips without that 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.150
 be too intense so peasants for 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.310
 I'm not banishing everything 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.410
 shine minutes from clarins and there 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.060
 it's a poodle and I believe I 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.700
 thought number 5 the one written on 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.690
 oh yes it's web 05 so that's 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.070
 something that I like a lot because 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.959
 that it's not too intense like a 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.170
 increase it holds well it's 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.940
 a lot there as a gospel is so a 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.950
 video you that too long for just 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.950
 launched the victory not the inhabitant 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.660
 but the fact that maguy perrot organic 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.410
 for the brief period that the lÃ¨ze 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.700
 so on this I think that without reason 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.769
 except it's a good day for 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.890
 see in the next video greet them 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.890
 facts
