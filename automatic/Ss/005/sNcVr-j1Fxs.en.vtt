at when I noticed something crawling all
over<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.740> ground<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:19.550> don't<00:00:20.550> know<00:00:20.820> they're<00:00:21.180> so

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
over the ground I don't know they're so

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.859 
over the ground I don't know they're so
tiny<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.529> gonna<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.890> able<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> Sam

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.420 
tiny and I'm not gonna be able to Sam
there<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:28.050> millions<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:29.699> things<00:00:31.430> at

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
there are millions of these things at

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
there are millions of these things at
first<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.239> thought<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.600> had<00:00:33.719> something<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.079> do

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
first I thought it had something to do

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.630 
first I thought it had something to do
with<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> chickens<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.190> some<00:00:35.399> kind

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
with the chickens like it was some kind

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.740 
with the chickens like it was some kind
of<00:00:36.320> mite<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.590> something<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.160> don't<00:00:38.250> know

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
of mite or something I don't know

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.910 
of mite or something I don't know
because<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.050> little<00:00:40.290> spot<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.530> where

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
because this is a little spot here where

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.660 
because this is a little spot here where
the<00:00:41.010> chickens<00:00:41.309> always<00:00:41.489> come<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.120> dust<00:00:42.840> bathe

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
the chickens always come and dust bathe

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.500 
the chickens always come and dust bathe
hopefully<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.760> haven't<00:00:45.000> been<00:00:45.120> doing<00:00:45.180> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
hopefully they haven't been doing it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.590 
hopefully they haven't been doing it
with<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:45.809> these<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.200> bugs<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:47.600> because

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
with all these little bugs here because

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.459 
with all these little bugs here because
they're<00:00:48.750> everywhere

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
they're everywhere

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.740
