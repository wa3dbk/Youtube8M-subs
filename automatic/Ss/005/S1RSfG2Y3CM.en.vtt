legitimate<00:00:17.940> email<00:00:18.090> database<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
legitimate email database this is a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.870 
legitimate email database this is a
topic<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.650> event<00:00:19.920> had<00:00:20.189> requested<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.820> us

and<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:56.039> why<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.309> started<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.670> build

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and that's why they started to build

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
and that's why they started to build
such<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> legitimate<00:00:57.510> list<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.379> of
