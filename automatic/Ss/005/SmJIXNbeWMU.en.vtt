00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
I can feel it so I'm doing something

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.189 
I can feel it so I'm doing something
right<00:00:53.440> that's<00:00:53.859> why<00:00:54.010> I'm<00:00:54.070> say<00:00:54.399> maybe<00:00:54.730> b-minus

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
right that's why I'm say maybe b-minus

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.590 
right that's why I'm say maybe b-minus
but<00:00:56.199> anyway<00:00:56.530> I'm<00:00:56.890> doing<00:00:57.249> okay<00:00:57.550> i<00:00:57.789> have<00:00:58.300> noticed

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
but anyway I'm doing okay i have noticed

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.750 
but anyway I'm doing okay i have noticed
some<00:00:58.809> awesome<00:00:59.170> trends<00:00:59.530> though<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.730> i

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
some awesome trends though and so i

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.310 
some awesome trends though and so i
thought<00:01:01.089> i'd<00:01:01.210> share<00:01:01.390> that<00:01:01.570> with<00:01:01.659> you<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:02.079> am

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
definitely doing the worst in the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.780 
definitely doing the worst in the
beginning<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.409> weeks<00:01:05.620> you<00:01:06.040> can<00:01:06.190> see<00:01:06.460> that

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
beginning of the weeks you can see that

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.610 
beginning of the weeks you can see that
bidding<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.420> majority<00:01:07.930> of<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.200> time<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.560> I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
bidding the majority of the time that I

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.470

everything and just do my best to count

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.210 
everything and just do my best to count
and<00:02:46.700> track<00:02:47.140> while<00:02:48.140> i'm<00:02:48.320> out<00:02:48.470> there<00:02:48.740> i<00:02:48.950> bought<00:02:49.190> a

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
and track while i'm out there i bought a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.830 
and track while i'm out there i bought a
one-way<00:02:49.460> ticket<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.180> i<00:02:50.210> actually<00:02:50.300> don't<00:02:50.660> know

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
one-way ticket so i actually don't know

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.890 
one-way ticket so i actually don't know
when<00:02:51.170> i<00:02:51.290> will<00:02:51.320> be<00:02:51.470> back<00:02:52.300> because<00:02:53.300> the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
when i will be back because the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.840 
when i will be back because the
assumption<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.470> if<00:02:54.830> I'm<00:02:55.040> there<00:02:55.460> with<00:02:55.790> a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
assumption is that if I'm there with a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.880 
assumption is that if I'm there with a
ticket<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.270> go<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.840> then<00:02:56.930> say<00:02:57.260> grandma<00:02:57.680> dies

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
ticket to go and then say grandma dies

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.740 
ticket to go and then say grandma dies
the<00:02:58.280> day<00:02:58.430> I'm<00:02:58.580> leaving<00:02:58.970> we<00:02:59.480> would<00:02:59.600> have<00:02:59.630> to

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
the day I'm leaving we would have to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.060 
the day I'm leaving we would have to
cancel<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.260> ticket<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.680> could<00:03:00.830> stay<00:03:00.980> an

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
cancel that ticket so I could stay an

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.320 
cancel that ticket so I could stay an
extra<00:03:01.280> couple<00:03:01.520> days<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.910> go<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.180> funeral

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
extra couple days to go to the funeral

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.810 
extra couple days to go to the funeral
and<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.620> just<00:03:03.830> makes<00:03:04.010> more<00:03:04.130> sense<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.640> have<00:03:04.790> a

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
and so just makes more sense so I have a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.430 
and so just makes more sense so I have a
one-way<00:03:05.090> ticket<00:03:05.240> to<00:03:05.450> Chicago<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.140> will<00:03:06.320> be

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
one-way ticket to Chicago and I will be

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.440 
one-way ticket to Chicago and I will be
coming<00:03:06.650> back<00:03:06.950> some<00:03:07.430> point<00:03:07.700> near<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.120> end<00:03:08.330> of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
coming back some point near the end of

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.480 
coming back some point near the end of
this<00:03:08.600> week<00:03:08.840> possibly<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:10.220> end<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
this week possibly the end of the

this week possibly the end of the
weekend<00:03:10.850> okay<00:03:11.890> so<00:03:12.890> anyway<00:03:13.250> that's<00:03:13.490> all<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.000> did

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
weekend okay so anyway that's all I did

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.520
