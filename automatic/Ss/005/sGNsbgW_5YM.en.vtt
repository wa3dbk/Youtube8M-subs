soho<00:01:18.789> was<00:01:18.999> and<00:01:19.299> see<00:01:19.869> for<00:01:20.020> ourselves<00:01:20.079> what<00:01:20.619> was

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
soho was and see for ourselves what was

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.569 
soho was and see for ourselves what was
in<00:01:21.039> view<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:22.509> know<00:01:22.659> that<00:01:22.689> Soho<00:01:23.350> orbits<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.100> l1

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
in view we know that Soho orbits the l1

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.359 
in view we know that Soho orbits the l1
Lagrangian<00:01:24.999> point<00:01:25.600> about<00:01:26.109> here<00:01:26.439> so<00:01:27.130> we<00:01:27.249> can

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
Lagrangian point about here so we can

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.429 
Lagrangian point about here so we can
put<00:01:27.490> our<00:01:27.549> camera<00:01:28.030> along<00:01:28.359> that<00:01:28.600> same<00:01:28.899> line<00:01:28.960> of

put our camera along that same line of

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.039 
put our camera along that same line of
the<00:01:29.530> Sun<00:01:29.799> Soho<00:01:30.460> earth<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.119> get<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.509> same<00:01:31.719> view

here is an image from lasko taken on
December<00:01:35.200> 15<00:01:35.670> 2009<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:36.939> here<00:01:37.359> we<00:01:37.450> are<00:01:37.600> in

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
December 15 2009 and here we are in

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.760 
December 15 2009 and here we are in

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
Celestia December 15 2009 we see Venus

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.739 
Celestia December 15 2009 we see Venus
and<00:01:41.979> sure<00:01:42.459> enough<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.969> transit<00:01:43.359> calendar

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
and sure enough the transit calendar

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.199 
and sure enough the transit calendar
shows<00:01:43.959> Venus<00:01:44.380> for<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:44.709> date<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.909> even<00:01:46.179> shows

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
shows Venus for this date it even shows

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.690 
shows Venus for this date it even shows
direction<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.200> back<00:01:47.709> in<00:01:47.859> Celestia<00:01:48.369> we<00:01:48.549> can

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
direction and back in Celestia we can

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.429 
direction and back in Celestia we can
speed<00:01:48.969> up<00:01:48.999> time<00:01:49.389> and<00:01:49.689> see<00:01:49.899> if<00:01:49.990> Venus<00:01:50.319> is

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
speed up time and see if Venus is

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.739 
speed up time and see if Venus is
traveling<00:01:50.889> the<00:01:50.979> right<00:01:51.130> way<00:01:51.280> too<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.939> there<00:01:52.659> we

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
traveling the right way too and there we

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.379 
traveling the right way too and there we
have<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.929> from<00:01:53.889> this<00:01:54.009> view<00:01:54.280> we<00:01:54.819> can<00:01:54.999> even<00:01:55.090> see

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
have it from this view we can even see

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.269 
have it from this view we can even see
the<00:01:55.539> next<00:01:55.749> transit<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.289> mercury<00:01:56.319> then<00:01:57.219> Venus

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:57.279 
the next transit of mercury then Venus

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:59.699 
the next transit of mercury then Venus
and<00:01:57.850> if<00:01:58.149> our<00:01:58.299> view<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.539> further<00:01:58.899> out<00:01:59.109> Neptune

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
and if our view is further out Neptune

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.819 
and if our view is further out Neptune
Jupiter<00:01:59.740> 2<00:02:00.749> so<00:02:01.749> whenever<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.380> see<00:02:02.439> a<00:02:02.560> blue

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
Jupiter 2 so whenever you see a blue

take too much rainwater for one bucket

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.970 
take too much rainwater for one bucket

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.589 
and so it spreads the rain flows into
the<00:03:12.069> buckets<00:03:12.430> beside<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.359> do<00:03:13.420> the

the buckets beside it so do the
