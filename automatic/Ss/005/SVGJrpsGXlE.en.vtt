I was sort of coming to it with

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.500 
I was sort of coming to it with
confidence<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.140> she's<00:02:20.620> coming<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.980> it

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
confidence and she's coming to it

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.009 
confidence and she's coming to it

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
without necessarily the confidence she

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:34.740 
without necessarily the confidence she
should<00:02:26.380> have<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:32.110> word<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.769> pretty<00:02:33.750> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
should have the word is pretty and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.500 
should have the word is pretty and
you're<00:02:34.900> thinking<00:02:35.170> visual<00:02:35.829> but<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.940> feel<00:02:37.239> the

cry<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.670> connect<00:03:06.260> however<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:09.150> do<00:03:09.510> need<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
cry and connect however you do need to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.690 
cry and connect however you do need to
carefully<00:03:10.620> take<00:03:10.860> them<00:03:11.070> through<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.460> process

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
carefully take them through that process

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.480
