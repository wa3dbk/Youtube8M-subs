factory and basically keeps the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.140 
factory and basically keeps the
alignment<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.170> place<00:00:34.440> from<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.770> factory<00:00:35.280> but

you have to remove it most of time they

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.730 
you have to remove it most of time they
just<00:00:39.840> break<00:00:40.080> out<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:42.530> I've<00:00:43.530> had<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
just break out just like that I've had a

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.290 
just break out just like that I've had a
couple<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> people<00:00:44.190> ask<00:00:44.490> me<00:00:44.610> questions<00:00:44.880> about

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
couple of people ask me questions about

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.440 
couple of people ask me questions about
that<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.900> there<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.710> now<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.330> easily

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
that so there you go now you can easily

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.800 
that so there you go now you can easily

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
and caster alignment and it's the same

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.730 
and caster alignment and it's the same
way<00:00:56.430> over<00:00:56.610> here

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
way over here

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.840 
way over here
just<00:00:58.740> get<00:00:58.860> you<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.040> little<00:00:59.070> pocket<00:00:59.550> screwdriver

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
just get you a little pocket screwdriver

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
just get you a little pocket screwdriver
out<00:01:00.210> dig<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.560> there

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
out dig it right out of there

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.700 
out dig it right out of there
piece<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:02.940> cake

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.110 

some<00:01:10.310> of<00:01:10.460> them<00:01:10.580> are<00:01:10.730> a<00:01:10.760> little<00:01:10.850> more<00:01:11.000> tricky

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
some of them are a little more tricky

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:20.859 
some of them are a little more tricky
than<00:01:11.600> others

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.660 

then<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:21.560> get<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.829> idea<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.280> one<00:01:22.490> three

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
then you get the idea this one three

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.419 
then you get the idea this one three
Americans<00:01:23.500> say<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:24.679> one's<00:01:24.890> being<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.219> little

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
Americans say this one's being a little

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.039 
Americans say this one's being a little
bit<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.609> a<00:01:25.670> pain<00:01:28.090> there<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.179> goes<00:01:29.390> pops<00:01:29.780> right

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
bit of a pain there it goes pops right

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.770 
bit of a pain there it goes pops right
out

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
out

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.230 
out
that's<00:01:32.380> all<00:01:32.560> it<00:01:32.650> looks<00:01:32.830> like<00:01:33.040> just<00:01:33.880> pops<00:01:34.090> right

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
that's all it looks like just pops right

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:55.370 
that's all it looks like just pops right
out<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.570> there<00:01:35.580> over<00:01:36.580> on<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.820> other<00:01:36.850> side<00:01:37.000> here

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.289 

one<00:01:56.380> piece<00:01:56.680> say<00:01:56.979> usually<00:01:57.130> break<00:01:57.729> that's<00:01:58.119> the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
one piece say usually break that's the

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.289 
one piece say usually break that's the
other<00:01:58.420> thing<00:01:58.540> too<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.520> there's<00:02:00.759> no<00:02:00.939> need<00:02:01.119> to

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
other thing too but there's no need to

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.679 
other thing too but there's no need to
use<00:02:02.170> them<00:02:02.350> for<00:02:02.380> anything<00:02:02.710> else<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.670> I'm<00:02:04.570> gonna

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
use them for anything else so I'm gonna

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:33.560 
use them for anything else so I'm gonna
have<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:04.930> worry<00:02:05.140> about<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:07.800> one<00:02:08.800> more

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.510 

so<00:02:34.570> let's<00:02:34.840> do<00:02:35.050> it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
so let's do it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.330 
so let's do it
and<00:02:36.520> one<00:02:37.240> other<00:02:37.390> thing<00:02:37.690> too<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.890> notice<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
and one other thing too you notice I

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.490 
and one other thing too you notice I
have<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.760> truck<00:02:40.300> jacked<00:02:40.840> up<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
have the truck jacked up on the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.190 
have the truck jacked up on the
alignment<00:02:41.770> rack<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:43.150> makes<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.990> lot<00:02:44.170> easier

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
alignment rack that makes a lot easier

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.740 
alignment rack that makes a lot easier
to<00:02:44.950> do<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> camber<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:45.610> caster<00:02:45.640> because<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
to do the camber and caster because the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.170 
to do the camber and caster because the
whole<00:02:46.900> wheel<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.170> doing<00:02:47.710> this<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.640> if<00:02:49.030> you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
whole wheel is doing this and if you

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.030 
whole wheel is doing this and if you
haven't<00:02:49.390> unloaded<00:02:49.780> makes<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.680> heck<00:02:50.830> of<00:02:50.860> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
haven't unloaded makes it a heck of a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.860 
haven't unloaded makes it a heck of a
lot<00:02:51.160> easier<00:02:51.240> than<00:02:52.240> when<00:02:52.330> all<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.660> weight

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
lot easier than when all this weight

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.100 
lot easier than when all this weight
you're<00:02:53.110> sitting<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:55.150> over<00:02:55.990> the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
you're sitting on it so over the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.430 
you're sitting on it so over the
computer<00:02:56.440> here<00:02:57.240> here<00:02:58.240> as<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:58.480> see<00:02:58.870> doing

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
computer here here as you can see doing

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.350 
computer here here as you can see doing
my<00:02:59.680> adjustments<00:03:00.510> Trillian<00:03:01.510> see
