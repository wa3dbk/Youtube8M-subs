so<00:00:46.569> real<00:00:47.499> estate<00:00:48.780> gurus<00:00:49.979> know<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:52.059> real

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
so real estate gurus know the real

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.079 
so real estate gurus know the real
estate<00:00:52.389> doesn't<00:00:52.899> always<00:00:53.079> look<00:00:53.289> pretty<00:00:54.089> it's

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
estate doesn't always look pretty it's

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.500 
estate doesn't always look pretty it's
seeing<00:00:55.449> past<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:56.879> present<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.120> looking<00:00:58.299> into

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
seeing past the present and looking into

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.509 
seeing past the present and looking into
the<00:00:58.629> future<00:00:58.719> as<00:00:59.289> of<00:00:59.559> what<00:00:59.799> things<00:01:00.069> can<00:01:00.339> become

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
the future as of what things can become

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:08.069 
the future as of what things can become
so<00:01:01.739> anyway<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.860> property<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.810> land

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079
