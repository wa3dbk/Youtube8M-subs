00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 as I said in the just prior the 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.970
 titration engineer daniel peredo el 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.589
 match as you could come not a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.599
 crystal that had many people who did not 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.059
 play together and the first time 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.549
 ended 0 to 0 and I think the goal 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.619
 mosquera was the euro only the first 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.539
 time even though he had support from the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.699
 uv people like Nesta end 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.680
 pulling the skinny but a good ball 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.480
 quick low passes between the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.390
 central legs and very good reaction 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.949
 of obama and another one is not another plus and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.199
 later it will come to stand out three three 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.840
 followed and up to four this this 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.190
 it showed that university wanted 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.600
 had weapons to be able to serve in the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.390
 second time well this ramón play 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 this orientation rises and ross and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.469
 falling down, he pokes her in the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.329
 the head of the flag open seems to me I do not know 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.370
 if money management rose 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.770
 because from here in front of us where is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.719
 the cabin there was already the brand does not arrive 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.219
 a moment that releases it and then this 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.230
 long ball of christ was from 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.629
 gonzález I am a gonzález it seems to me that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.219
 he takes advantage, he wins the position and 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.260
 hit strong area to open the way I 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.120
 it seems that that was the agent's path 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.710
 university college forward a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.540
 little the lines had put Fernandez 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.740
 I think it was a little more 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.630
 of distraction for the centrals but 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.490
 it seems to me that the u after the first goal 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.430
 it was very superior there is not a point of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.580
 break after it is going to arrive is 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.190
 is a very good play by ruiz díaz with 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.040
 with gomez that the mother who goes to 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 throw in volley and the for and against 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.450
 against boat and it is an attack a replica 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.850
 of what crystal does now he did 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.160
 university now the play is good 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.560
 it's quick the counter is a good 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.200
 transition but that only reaches rainer 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.030
 to define us and here look at 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.729
 amount of people that remains of crystal 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.830
 there is a space and they are enlarging 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.540
 enlarging winning and one of the had 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.450
 to leave to bail is to say to the brand 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.160
 and guastavino neither short nor lazy ramón 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.500
 puts him down the ball gives a pot those 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.140
 terrible and at three minutes he had 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.659
 entered 3 to 0 that will arrive 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.509
 lapidary for glass 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.340
 if others like wine there I think 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.659
 who makes the best decision even though 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.159
 the people for the cost because he 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.259
 starts practically from the field of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.670
 university when it ends up stepping on the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.670
 crescent and already arriving
