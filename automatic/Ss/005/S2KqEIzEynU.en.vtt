00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.230
 difficulties in accessing higher education is the issue that 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.020
 Today, it is about the congress of the republic convened by the 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.629
 representatives of the political movement 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.710
 gloria estela díaz and manuel vírgüez ambush solutions that guarantee the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.050
 coverage of quality higher education students 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.400
 of the difficulties you have for 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.730
 define the military situation comes another kind of difficulties you can have at 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.119
 access to higher education do not obey the basic problems of 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.760
 be 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.999
 access to credit is an opportunity that is not 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.739
 Both public and private universities work on the species 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.180
 Government programs can also be spoken in the education system where 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.980
 Only those who have levers to win the universities can do it 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.040
 public 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.080
 all the opposite in the private sector those who have the economic resources 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.950
 on the subject the first military notebook 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.530
 for now the important thing 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.050
 because there are many young people 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.330
 although he did not define his military situation that I can not have the title 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.210
 university for this already to the management of anger has worked through law 12 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.470
 43 so they can access 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.470
 the biggest problem lies 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.350
 everything seems to be 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.720
 is that there is no state policy 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.290
 government policies have been developed 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.510
 he said 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.310
 the governor of the day, either nationally, added that the department 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.610
 municipal miguel 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.670
 but since the constitution 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 there is no policy after two days to generate 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.350
 a continuity 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.460
 on what basic issues 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.470
 some for example accessible line of credit for both 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.510
 students of limited resources 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.450
 is found 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.860
 coverage and urban quality but with respect to the reality of that of the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.770
 country also feel and even greater integration aladi in the region 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.320
 so far because although it is true the respective mayors governors 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.680
 within your development plans 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.490
 Some 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.940
 Include a policy for your department in your municipality 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.129
 there is no articulation that allows 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.149
 despite taking into account 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.379
 criteria such as the region's vocation percent and culture 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.349
 from the idiosyncrasy and this generates 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.989
 of that engineering discrepancy precisely that there is only one 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:32.979
 of young people like this the money laundering capitals undoubtedly impacting 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.429
 will be the economic development of the regions 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:40.019
 has not been filled in that the best way out would be to increase the capacity of 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.329
 credit for young people 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.590
 images of christ 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.499
 fassi-fihri will reach the poor 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.199
 strategic leno 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.599
 these credits 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.539
 rather without thinking them 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:56.189
 What since the budget of the nation and what is a policy of 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.509
 state of the constitution

 In addition, a stable two percentage with a basic
