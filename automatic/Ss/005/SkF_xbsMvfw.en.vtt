going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> point<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.130> i<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.550> think

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
going to point out that i really think

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.049

all<00:00:36.989> kinds<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.530> foundation<00:00:38.040> should<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.579> shown

in the packaging I know that would be

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.979 
in the packaging I know that would be

the same and I said that in my review
before<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.990> I'll<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.740> lightly<00:01:47.189> dust<00:01:47.520> this

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
before but I'll just lightly dust this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.200 
before but I'll just lightly dust this
over<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.350> cream<00:01:49.350> foundation<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:50.070> set<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.549> so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
over the cream foundation to set it so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.859 
over the cream foundation to set it so
it<00:01:51.240> stays<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.729> that's<00:01:53.729> basically<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.240> my

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it stays and that's basically like my

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
it stays and that's basically like my
foundation<00:01:55.740> routine<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.250> you're<00:01:56.399> wondering

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
foundation routine if you're wondering

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.859 
foundation routine if you're wondering
at<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.750> moment<00:01:58.130> but<00:01:59.130> um<00:01:59.430> they<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
at the moment but um they don't like the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.280 
at the moment but um they don't like the
packaging<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.740> think<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.549> too<00:02:02.969> big<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.719> it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
packaging I think it's too big and it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.859 
packaging I think it's too big and it
takes<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.799> lot<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> my<00:02:05.509> makeup<00:02:06.509> storage

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.500 
and concealers and such and I just think
it<00:02:12.920> shouldn't<00:02:13.280> come<00:02:13.430> with<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> cheap<00:02:14.120> sponge

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it shouldn't come with a cheap sponge

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.120 
it shouldn't come with a cheap sponge
and<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.900> should<00:02:15.080> just<00:02:15.200> be<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.410> circle<00:02:15.950> it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and it should just be the circle it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.540 
and it should just be the circle it
would<00:02:16.220> be<00:02:16.310> half<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.240> size<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:19.040> mean<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
would be half the size and I mean the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.040 
would be half the size and I mean the
mirror<00:02:19.820> yeah<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.330> they<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.600> move<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.900> down

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
mirror yeah but they can move it down

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.380 
mirror yeah but they can move it down
here<00:02:21.440> maybe<00:02:21.710> they<00:02:22.250> could<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.460> redesign<00:02:23.150> it

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
here maybe they could just redesign it

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.650 
here maybe they could just redesign it
maybe<00:02:23.750> oops<00:02:24.850> uh<00:02:25.850> but<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.810> don't<00:02:27.800> know<00:02:28.510> it's<00:02:29.510> not

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
maybe oops uh but I don't know it's not

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.870 
maybe oops uh but I don't know it's not
so<00:02:29.870> much<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:30.260> i<00:02:30.560> think<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.160> packaging<00:02:31.790> is

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
so much that I i think the packaging is

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.850 
so much that I i think the packaging is
cheap<00:02:32.120> i<00:02:32.270> mean<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.510> drugstore<00:02:33.050> what<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.770> you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
cheap i mean it's drugstore what can you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.080 
cheap i mean it's drugstore what can you
expect<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.670> um<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.300> just<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.440> don't<00:02:36.530> like<00:02:37.090> you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
expect but um I just I don't like you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.350 
expect but um I just I don't like you
know<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.390> useless<00:02:38.840> space<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:40.190> um<00:02:40.550> anyway<00:02:41.240> I<00:02:41.860> I

r<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.080> me<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.860> don't<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.310> shape<00:03:04.610> I

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
like that this one has this so you can

have it go like that as opposed to like

have it go like that as opposed to like
that<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:10.330> but<00:03:11.330> sponges<00:03:12.170> get<00:03:12.410> rid<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.590> them<00:03:12.800> at

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
that and but sponges get rid of them at

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.890 
that and but sponges get rid of them at
least<00:03:12.980> once<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.489> week<00:03:13.640> because<00:03:14.330> they<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.870> know

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
least once a week because they you know

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.690 
least once a week because they you know
they<00:03:15.019> have<00:03:15.320> tons<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.709> bacteria<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.519> them

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
they have tons of bacteria on them

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.150 
they have tons of bacteria on them
because<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:17.060> can't<00:03:17.269> really<00:03:17.330> clean<00:03:17.720> them<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.739> I

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
because you can't really clean them so I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.009 
because you can't really clean them so I
don't<00:03:19.430> recommend<00:03:19.700> using<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.269> one<00:03:20.540> over<00:03:20.900> and

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
don't recommend using this one over and

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.289 
don't recommend using this one over and
over<00:03:21.080> again<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.650> again<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.400> reason<00:03:22.760> why<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:22.910> don't

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
over again so again a reason why I don't

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.720 
over again so again a reason why I don't
think<00:03:23.540> it's<00:03:23.660> worth<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.049> put<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:24.410> here

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
think it's worth it to put in here

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.550 
think it's worth it to put in here
because<00:03:25.730> people<00:03:26.239> who<00:03:26.480> don't<00:03:27.049> really<00:03:27.410> know<00:03:27.530> how

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
because people who don't really know how

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.289 
because people who don't really know how
to<00:03:27.709> use<00:03:27.769> makeup<00:03:28.100> they<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.519> buy<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.670> foundation

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
to use makeup they just buy a foundation

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.690 
to use makeup they just buy a foundation
because<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.320> wanted<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.860> they'll<00:03:31.400> use<00:03:31.580> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
because I wanted to they'll use the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.400 
because I wanted to they'll use the
sponge<00:03:31.910> for<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.269> year<00:03:32.690> or<00:03:32.720> two<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.170> that's

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
sponge for a year or two and that's

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.640 
sponge for a year or two and that's
really<00:03:33.769> gross<00:03:34.070> but<00:03:35.030> um<00:03:35.269> yeah<00:03:36.140> here<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.620> is

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
really gross but um yeah here it is

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.229 
really gross but um yeah here it is
close<00:03:37.130> up<00:03:37.370> it's<00:03:38.739> very<00:03:39.739> creamy<00:03:40.250> very<00:03:40.459> easy<00:03:41.030> to

close up it's very creamy very easy to

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.390 
close up it's very creamy very easy to
apply<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.570> very<00:03:41.959> blendable<00:03:42.560> there's<00:03:43.310> a

apply and very blendable there's a
swatch<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.330> then<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.840> course<00:03:45.080> you<00:03:45.200> can<00:03:45.350> blend

swatch and then of course you can blend

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.600 
swatch and then of course you can blend
it<00:03:45.709> out<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:47.209> looks<00:03:47.390> scary<00:03:47.570> I<00:03:47.900> know<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:49.280> really

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
it out it looks scary I know it's really

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.390 
it out it looks scary I know it's really
close<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:50.030> my<00:03:50.150> skin<00:03:50.180> tone<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.709> got<00:03:52.250> this

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
close to my skin tone and I got this

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.180 
close to my skin tone and I got this
because<00:03:52.760> lately<00:03:53.720> I've<00:03:53.900> been<00:03:54.049> getting<00:03:54.380> beige

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
because lately I've been getting beige

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.340 
because lately I've been getting beige
tones<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.299> I<00:03:56.360> thought<00:03:56.600> something<00:03:56.900> with<00:03:57.110> beige

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
tones so I thought something with beige

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.780 
tones so I thought something with beige
and<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.769> would<00:03:58.010> work<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:59.320> this<00:04:00.320> is<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:01.340> has<00:04:01.610> SPF

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
and it would work and this is it has SPF

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.600 
and it would work and this is it has SPF
15<00:04:02.480> which<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:02.720> good<00:04:03.019> because<00:04:03.769> you<00:04:04.280> just<00:04:04.430> want

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
15 which is good because you just want

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.729 
15 which is good because you just want
to<00:04:04.670> protect<00:04:04.940> your<00:04:05.060> skin<00:04:05.209> from<00:04:05.390> any<00:04:06.200> sun<00:04:06.530> rays

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
to protect your skin from any sun rays

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.030 
to protect your skin from any sun rays
all<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.489> good<00:04:08.000> stuff<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.739> again<00:04:09.739> here's<00:04:09.980> a

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040
