work with and incidentally that's one of
the<00:04:49.719> objections<00:04:50.469> I<00:04:50.620> have<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.639> new<00:04:52.560> bill<00:04:53.560> on

the objections I have to the new bill on
on<00:04:53.949> derivatives<00:04:54.550> I<00:04:54.909> think<00:04:55.509> it's<00:04:55.629> a<00:04:55.689> good<00:04:55.810> thing

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
on derivatives I think it's a good thing

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
overall but I I think that unless you

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.439 
overall but I I think that unless you
change<00:04:59.469> the<00:04:59.770> incentives<00:05:00.279> for<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.490> CEO<00:05:01.029> and
