and<00:02:46.970> all<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.900> shapes<00:02:48.139> are<00:02:48.260> going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.440> be<00:02:48.530> a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
and all the shapes are going to be a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.509 
and all the shapes are going to be a
little<00:02:48.950> bit<00:02:49.099> different

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
little bit different

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.370 
little bit different
now<00:02:50.269> remember<00:02:50.660> when<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.840> talk<00:02:51.079> about<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
now remember when I talk about the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.930 
now remember when I talk about the
shapes<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.859> things<00:02:52.010> these<00:02:52.280> pentatonix<00:02:52.849> are

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
shapes and things these pentatonix are

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.759 
shapes and things these pentatonix are
movable<00:02:53.299> any<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.989> scale<00:02:54.200> patterns<00:02:54.590> and

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
movable any of the scale patterns and

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.500 
movable any of the scale patterns and
things<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:54.980> we<00:02:55.099> talked<00:02:55.250> about<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:55.730> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
things that we talked about in the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.440 
things that we talked about in the
lessons<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.560> things<00:02:57.769> they're<00:02:58.340> almost<00:02:58.489> yours

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
lessons and things they're almost yours

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.360 
lessons and things they're almost yours
G<00:02:59.660> Panasonic<00:03:00.700> G<00:03:01.700> sharp<00:03:01.940> gonna<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.299> a<00:03:03.280> finish<00:03:04.280> on

G Panasonic G sharp gonna do a finish on

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.289 
G Panasonic G sharp gonna do a finish on
it<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.680> that's<00:03:06.829> why<00:03:07.069> I<00:03:07.099> emphasize<00:03:07.910> learning

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
it so that's why I emphasize learning

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.629 
it so that's why I emphasize learning
the<00:03:08.599> pattern<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.169> then<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.829> notes<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
the pattern and then the notes of the

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.020 
the pattern and then the notes of the
notes<00:03:10.790> will<00:03:10.910> come<00:03:11.060> after<00:03:12.700> because<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.790> want<00:03:13.970> to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
notes will come after because I want to

notes will come after because I want to
get<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.720> play<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.260> that's<00:03:15.739> that's<00:03:16.010> what

get you to play and that's that's what
it's<00:03:16.340> really<00:03:16.459> all<00:03:16.549> about<00:03:16.669> this<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.150> where<00:03:17.299> you

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
it's really all about this is where you

have fun creating and having a good time
playing<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:20.000> instrument<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:21.109> now<00:03:21.349> the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
playing the instrument so now the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.770 
playing the instrument so now the
pentatonic

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
pentatonic

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.540 
pentatonic
I'm<00:03:24.290> going<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> show<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.890> second<00:03:25.250> pattern

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
I'm going to show you the second pattern

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.710 
I'm going to show you the second pattern
which<00:03:25.730> starts<00:03:26.680> at<00:03:27.680> six<00:03:27.980> front<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.390> we've<00:03:29.570> got

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
which starts at six front so we've got

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:41.340 
which starts at six front so we've got
six<00:03:30.820> eight<00:03:32.680> five<00:03:33.680> eight<00:03:35.620> five<00:03:36.620> eight<00:03:39.550> five

six eight five eight five eight five
seven<00:03:49.780> that's<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.960> second<00:03:51.230> pattern<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.530> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
seven that's the second pattern of the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.530 
seven that's the second pattern of the
pentatonic<00:03:51.920> if<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.580> guys<00:03:52.730> want<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.060> rest<00:03:53.270> I

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
once again I'm going to play the first

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.699 
once again I'm going to play the first
pattern<00:04:16.700> that's<00:04:16.880> been<00:04:16.940> atonic<00:04:17.560> into<00:04:18.560> the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
pattern that's been atonic into the

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:26.470 
pattern that's been atonic into the
second<00:04:19.040> pattern<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:25.550> these<00:04:25.880> are<00:04:26.000> all<00:04:26.210> the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
second pattern and these are all the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.090 
second pattern and these are all the
same<00:04:26.690> notes<00:04:26.960> they're<00:04:27.440> all<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.680> same<00:04:27.860> five

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
same notes they're all the same five

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.860 
same notes they're all the same five
notes<00:04:28.130> it's<00:04:28.610> just<00:04:28.820> juxtapose<00:04:29.330> depending<00:04:29.780> on

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
notes it's just juxtapose depending on

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.260 
notes it's just juxtapose depending on
where<00:04:30.020> you're<00:04:30.140> where<00:04:30.770> you're<00:04:30.860> playing<00:04:31.100> them

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
where you're where you're playing them

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.210 
where you're where you're playing them
and<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.510> really<00:04:32.810> gets<00:04:33.050> cool<00:04:33.680> when<00:04:33.950> you<00:04:34.010> start

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
and it really gets cool when you start

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:47.530 
and it really gets cool when you start
soloing<00:04:44.200> pentatonic<00:04:45.220> five<00:04:46.220> notes<00:04:46.550> those<00:04:47.390> are

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
soloing pentatonic five notes those are

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.790 
soloing pentatonic five notes those are
the<00:04:47.600> first<00:04:47.720> two<00:04:47.870> patterns<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.470> pentatonic

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
the first two patterns of the pentatonic

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.860 
the first two patterns of the pentatonic
F<00:04:49.550> one<00:04:49.940> with<00:04:50.090> those<00:04:50.210> like<00:04:50.450> I<00:04:50.479> said<00:04:50.720> any
