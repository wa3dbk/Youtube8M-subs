00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:46.279 
machine 268 dollar machine it felt it it

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.489 
machine 268 dollar machine it felt it it
really<00:06:46.610> does<00:06:46.879> fail<00:06:47.239> at<00:06:47.449> that<00:06:47.569> point<00:06:47.869> it<00:06:48.199> the

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:48.499 
really does fail at that point it the

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.029 
really does fail at that point it the
the<00:06:48.830> speed<00:06:49.309> kills<00:06:49.699> it<00:06:49.939> and<00:06:50.649> just<00:06:51.649> the<00:06:51.800> lack<00:06:52.009> of

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
the speed kills it and just the lack of

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.159 
the speed kills it and just the lack of
performance<00:06:52.330> really<00:06:53.330> isn't<00:06:53.569> that<00:06:53.599> good<00:06:53.839> you

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
performance really isn't that good you

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.359 
performance really isn't that good you
see<00:06:54.379> there's<00:06:54.619> a<00:06:54.679> little<00:06:54.709> lag<00:06:55.839> so<00:06:56.839> like<00:06:57.050> um<00:06:57.369> you

00:06:58.359 --> 00:06:58.369 
see there's a little lag so like um you

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.339 
see there's a little lag so like um you
could<00:06:58.579> get<00:06:58.819> a<00:06:58.849> betting<00:06:59.539> better<00:06:59.749> for<00:07:00.199> like

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
could get a betting better for like
