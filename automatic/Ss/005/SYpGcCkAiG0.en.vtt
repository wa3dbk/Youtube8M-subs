00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
know a new kind of a new little hobby

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.740 
know a new kind of a new little hobby
there<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:48.030> I'll<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.270> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.480> give<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
there so I'll just kind of give you a
little<00:00:48.809> breakdown<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.370> start<00:00:50.520> from

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
little breakdown of it I will start from

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.049 
little breakdown of it I will start from
the<00:00:50.820> front<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> redline

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the front here it is a redline

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.729 
the front here it is a redline
like<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.510> said<00:00:54.570> red<00:00:54.870> line<00:00:55.050> Pro<00:00:55.890> Line<00:00:56.129> Pro<00:00:56.399> X<00:00:56.550> so

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
like I said red line Pro Line Pro X so

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
like I said red line Pro Line Pro X so
very<00:00:58.739> very<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.340> aluminum<00:00:59.699> frame<00:00:59.969> very<00:01:00.239> nice

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
very very it's aluminum frame very nice

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.049 
very very it's aluminum frame very nice
very<00:01:00.870> light<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.640> only<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.910> like

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
very light I think it's only at like

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.880 
very light I think it's only at like
nineteen<00:01:03.629> pounds<00:01:03.930> something<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
nineteen pounds something like that so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.039 
nineteen pounds something like that so
it's<00:01:05.040> very<00:01:06.619> very<00:01:07.619> light<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> wheels

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it's very very light so with the wheels

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.260 
it's very very light so with the wheels
where<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.220> Tioga<00:01:12.090> power<00:01:12.900> band<00:01:14.150> 20<00:01:15.150> by

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
where we have the Tioga power band 20 by

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.020 
where we have the Tioga power band 20 by
1.85<00:01:17.119> very<00:01:18.119> smooth<00:01:18.450> tire<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:20.520> know<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
1.85 very smooth tire you know that the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.219 
1.85 very smooth tire you know that the
forks<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.140> pretty<00:01:22.340> basic<00:01:23.960> which<00:01:24.960> that's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
forks are pretty basic which that's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.660 
forks are pretty basic which that's
probably<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.710> upgraded<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.220> probably<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
probably to be upgraded to probably a

probably to be upgraded to probably a
carbon<00:01:27.000> fiber<00:01:27.680> probably<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> answer

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
carbon fiber probably like the answer

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.910 
carbon fiber probably like the answer
dagger<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.670> something<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.799> go<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:31.890> a
