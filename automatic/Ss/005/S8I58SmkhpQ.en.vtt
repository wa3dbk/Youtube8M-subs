fine<00:00:37.890> apart<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:40.280> one<00:00:41.280> thing<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:43.430> it's

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
fine apart from one thing is that it's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.790 
fine apart from one thing is that it's
too<00:00:45.059> hot<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:46.440> gets<00:00:46.680> too<00:00:47.010> hot<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
too hot it gets too hot with the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.130 
too hot it gets too hot with the
installation<00:00:49.969> these<00:00:50.969> five<00:00:51.390> bricks<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
installation these five bricks and the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.860 
installation these five bricks and the
thermal<00:00:52.620> ceramic<00:00:53.010> installation<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.570> actually

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
thermal ceramic installation it actually

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
thermal ceramic installation it actually
gets<00:00:55.079> too<00:00:55.379> hot<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.860> gets<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.480> around<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
gets too hot it gets up to around the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.729 
gets too hot it gets up to around the
thousand<00:00:58.050> degrees<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.590> any

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
thousand degrees so if you have any

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
thousand degrees so if you have any
metal<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.120> completely

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
metal in here it's just completely

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.670 
metal in here it's just completely
melting<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:07.500> is

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
melting it and as you can see this is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.300 
melting it and as you can see this is
what<00:01:07.860> happened<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.880> end<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:10.189> one<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
what happened to the the end of one of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.410 
what happened to the the end of one of
the<00:01:11.490> white<00:01:12.270> pipes<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> top<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.640> on<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the white pipes on the top there on the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
the white pipes on the top there on the
right<00:01:16.520> what's<00:01:17.520> happened<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.770> it's<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
pipe and frieza caps welded onto the end

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.270 
pipe and frieza caps welded onto the end
there<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.320> completely<00:01:28.860> destroyed

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
there and it's just completely destroyed

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200 
there and it's just completely destroyed
them<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.650> next<00:01:31.650> year<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> redesign<00:01:32.670> I'm

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
them so next year on the redesign I'm

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
them so next year on the redesign I'm
gonna<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> look<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> air<00:01:35.040> supply

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
gonna have to look at in the air supply

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.640 
gonna have to look at in the air supply
on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> outside<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> insulation<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
on the outside of the insulation and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.090 
on the outside of the insulation and
having<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> air<00:01:39.600> come<00:01:39.930> basically<00:01:40.770> through

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
having the air come basically through

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
having the air come basically through
through<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> side<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> brick<00:01:42.240> south<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
through the side of the brick south to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
through the side of the brick south to
drill<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:43.320> holes<00:01:43.380> through<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.159> PDA<00:01:45.060> through

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
drill some holes through a PDA through

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.700 
drill some holes through a PDA through
that<00:01:45.540> way<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.869> mean<00:01:46.020> they're<00:01:46.200> okay<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that way I mean they're okay on the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.249 
that way I mean they're okay on the
bottom<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.790> obviously<00:01:48.600> where

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
bottom that it's just obviously where

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
bottom that it's just obviously where
the<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.829> fire<00:01:50.070> has<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.610> second<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the the fire has the second of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.490 
the the fire has the second of
combustion<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> top<00:01:52.530> there<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.640> see

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
combustion at the top there you can see

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.280 
combustion at the top there you can see
the<00:01:55.500> flames

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
the flames

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.570 
the flames
shooting<00:01:58.160> outside<00:01:58.280> there<00:02:00.130> that's<00:02:01.130> obviously

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
shooting outside there that's obviously

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.250 
shooting outside there that's obviously
their<00:02:02.000> part<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:04.210> fire<00:02:05.210> box<00:02:05.450> right<00:02:06.110> at<00:02:06.200> the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
their part the the fire box right at the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.380 
their part the the fire box right at the
top<00:02:06.500> where<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.980> cific<00:02:07.430> combustion<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.149> going

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
top where the cific combustion is going

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.900 
top where the cific combustion is going
on<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:09.080> it's<00:02:09.320> just<00:02:09.410> far<00:02:10.130> too<00:02:10.160> hot<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:10.820> them

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
on and it's just far too hot for them

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.310 
on and it's just far too hot for them
and<00:02:11.120> even<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:12.850> windfall<00:02:13.870> steel<00:02:14.870> windfall

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
and even this windfall steel windfall

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.230 
and even this windfall steel windfall
that<00:02:15.350> put<00:02:15.740> in<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:16.580> think<00:02:17.450> its<00:02:18.490> size<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.730> what

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
that put in I think its size is what

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.680 
that put in I think its size is what
some<00:02:20.450> core<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.780> an<00:02:20.870> inch<00:02:21.020> but<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:22.690> you

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
some core of an inch but it's just you

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.910 
some core of an inch but it's just you
see<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:24.260> melting

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.920 

so<00:02:27.920> yeah<00:02:28.130> bit<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.520> redesigned<00:02:29.390> for<00:02:29.720> next

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
so yeah bit of a redesigned for next

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.500 
so yeah bit of a redesigned for next
winter<00:02:30.280> got<00:02:31.280> some<00:02:31.400> more<00:02:31.490> radiators<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.180> put<00:02:32.360> in

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
winter got some more radiators to put in

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.380 
winter got some more radiators to put in
I've<00:02:33.410> got<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.680> pump<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.040> change<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:35.270> the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
I've got the pump to change to the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.330 
I've got the pump to change to the
single<00:02:35.750> speed<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.890> air<00:02:40.040> is

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
single speed so the so the air is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.980 
single speed so the so the air is
spending<00:02:40.820> more<00:02:40.970> time<00:02:41.209> in<00:02:41.420> here

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
spending more time in here

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.470 
spending more time in here
the<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:43.310> water<00:02:43.490> is<00:02:43.670> spending<00:02:43.970> more<00:02:44.120> time<00:02:44.330> in

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the the water is spending more time in

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.430 
the the water is spending more time in
heat<00:02:44.630> exchanger<00:02:45.140> but<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.220> still<00:02:47.440> burning

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
heat exchanger but it's still burning

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.110 
heat exchanger but it's still burning
quite<00:02:48.739> efficiently<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.400> bit<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.790> puff<00:02:50.000> of

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
quite efficiently a bit of a puff of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.610 
quite efficiently a bit of a puff of
smoke<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:50.630> as<00:02:50.750> I've<00:02:50.870> shut<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> door<00:02:51.350> so

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
smoke there as I've shut the door so

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.440 
smoke there as I've shut the door so
it's<00:02:52.520> not<00:02:52.670> quite<00:02:52.820> as<00:02:53.090> temperature<00:02:53.600> effort<00:02:58.450> but

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
it's not quite as temperature effort but

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.030 
it's not quite as temperature effort but
yeah<00:03:00.020> not<00:03:00.380> got<00:03:00.590> around<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.830> doing<00:03:00.980> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
yeah not got around to doing the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
yeah not got around to doing the
pizzeria<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.700> get<00:03:01.910> around<00:03:02.090> for<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.300> in<00:03:02.390> spring

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
pizzeria I get around for that in spring

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.009 
pizzeria I get around for that in spring
I<00:03:02.780> think<00:03:03.250> need<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.280> also<00:03:04.580> work<00:03:05.030> out<00:03:05.300> a

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
I think need to also work out a

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.810 
I think need to also work out a
different<00:03:06.500> way<00:03:06.830> of<00:03:07.360> shooting<00:03:09.640> shooting<00:03:10.640> that

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
different way of shooting shooting that

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.850 
different way of shooting shooting that
air<00:03:11.030> through<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.110> back<00:03:12.290> here<00:03:12.530> rather<00:03:12.769> than

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
air through the back here rather than

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.190 
air through the back here rather than
going<00:03:13.010> straight<00:03:13.370> up<00:03:13.549> because<00:03:14.049> another<00:03:15.049> thing

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
going straight up because another thing

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.060 
going straight up because another thing
that<00:03:15.760> it's<00:03:16.760> been<00:03:17.060> too<00:03:17.299> hot<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
that it's been too hot for is the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.240 
that it's been too hot for is the
dampers<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:21.140> dump<00:03:21.350> plates<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:21.980> come

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
dampers that the dump plates that come

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.440 
dampers that the dump plates that come
supplied<00:03:22.730> with<00:03:23.030> these<00:03:23.180> these<00:03:23.690> kits<00:03:24.080> are<00:03:25.450> not

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
supplied with these these kits are not

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.090 
supplied with these these kits are not
designed<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.640> work<00:03:29.110> with<00:03:30.110> thousand<00:03:30.739> degree

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
designed to work with thousand degree

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.979 
designed to work with thousand degree
temperatures<00:03:31.700> either<00:03:31.880> so<00:03:32.299> I<00:03:32.570> think<00:03:34.840> I'm<00:03:35.840> going

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
temperatures either so I think I'm going

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.120 
temperatures either so I think I'm going
to<00:03:36.049> struggle<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.410> get<00:03:36.620> those<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:37.010> work

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
to struggle to get those to work

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.870 
to struggle to get those to work
properly<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:38.170> yeah<00:03:39.170> again<00:03:39.440> another<00:03:40.010> little

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
properly so yeah again another little

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.539 
properly so yeah again another little
bit<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.180> redesign<00:03:42.110> on<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.709> mark<00:03:42.950> ii<00:03:43.280> model

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
bit of a redesign on the mark ii model

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.080 
bit of a redesign on the mark ii model
which<00:03:43.910> will<00:03:44.239> be<00:03:44.420> coming<00:03:44.660> out<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:46.459> winter<00:03:46.820> of

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
which will be coming out the winter of

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.470 
which will be coming out the winter of
this<00:03:47.299> year<00:03:48.250> where<00:03:49.250> i<00:03:49.489> keep<00:03:49.850> you<00:03:49.940> posted<00:03:50.360> on

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
that one alright guys as i saying before

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.020 
that one alright guys as i saying before
this<00:03:55.400> whole<00:03:55.640> thing<00:03:55.880> was<00:03:56.870> an<00:03:56.989> experiment<00:03:57.680> and

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
this whole thing was an experiment and

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.660 
this whole thing was an experiment and
the<00:03:59.030> thing<00:03:59.209> about<00:03:59.390> experiments<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:00.670> learning

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
the thing about experiments is learning

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.640 
the thing about experiments is learning
things<00:04:02.090> and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
things and

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.860 
things and
have<00:04:02.829> some<00:04:03.069> learnt<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.459> lot<00:04:03.579> from<00:04:03.640> this<00:04:04.000> but<00:04:04.780> it

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
have some learnt a lot from this but it

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.960 
have some learnt a lot from this but it
is<00:04:04.989> great<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.739> eats<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.310> house<00:04:08.700> pretty<00:04:09.700> well

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
is great it eats the house pretty well

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.869 
is great it eats the house pretty well
so<00:04:10.329> far<00:04:10.439> it<00:04:11.439> worked<00:04:11.799> even<00:04:12.010> better<00:04:12.310> if<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.640> got

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
so far it worked even better if I got

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.970 
so far it worked even better if I got
around<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.299> swapping<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.049> pump<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.409> do<00:04:14.769> some

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
around to swapping the pump and do some

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.499 
around to swapping the pump and do some
more<00:04:15.129> insulation<00:04:15.489> on<00:04:15.700> pipes<00:04:16.030> but<00:04:17.280> that's<00:04:18.509> just

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
more insulation on pipes but that's just

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.189 
more insulation on pipes but that's just
life<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:21.270> busy<00:04:22.270> doing<00:04:22.509> it<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.750> things<00:04:22.990> now

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
life and busy doing it the things now

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.189 
life and busy doing it the things now
moved<00:04:23.500> on<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:23.740> think<00:04:23.889> I<00:04:24.100> really<00:04:24.400> do<00:04:24.520> suffer<00:04:24.789> from

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199
