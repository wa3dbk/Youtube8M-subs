Charlotte taking passing angles away a
third<00:04:30.300> thing<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.750> does<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.110> causes<00:04:31.290> my<00:04:31.650> weight

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
third thing it does it causes my weight

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.590

to<00:04:32.040> do<00:04:32.160> what<00:04:32.810> Cosmo<00:04:33.810> weight<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.350> go<00:04:34.470> work<00:04:35.600> back

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
to do what Cosmo weight to go work back

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.450 
to do what Cosmo weight to go work back
because<00:04:37.350> he's<00:04:37.680> coming<00:04:38.100> this<00:04:38.220> direction

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460
