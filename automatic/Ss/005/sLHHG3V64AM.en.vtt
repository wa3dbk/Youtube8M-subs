00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.089 
besides the fact is everybody a wookie
is<00:02:11.629> I<00:02:12.629> particularly<00:02:13.319> like<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.799> way<00:02:13.920> they've

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
is I particularly like the way they've

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.330 
is I particularly like the way they've
sculpted<00:02:14.549> this<00:02:14.670> bag<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.650> loose<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.250> you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
can see that they've really taken the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.030 
can see that they've really taken the
time<00:02:20.269> see<00:02:21.269> where<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.739> take<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.769> little<00:02:22.920> time

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
time see where I can take a little time

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.830 
time see where I can take a little time
to<00:02:23.459> focus<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.030> detail<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.690> actually

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
to focus on the detail so it actually

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.160 
to focus on the detail so it actually
comes<00:02:25.230> apart<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.739> got<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.099> uh<00:02:30.170> this

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
comes apart and it's got that uh this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.809 
comes apart and it's got that uh this
isn't<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.530> best<00:02:31.650> angle<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.129> as<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.430> mentioned

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
isn't the best angle so as I mentioned

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.670 
isn't the best angle so as I mentioned

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
here the attention it's nice even down

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.789 
here the attention it's nice even down
to<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.459> little<00:02:42.209> metal<00:02:42.360> clasps<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.470> bottom

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
to the little metal clasps on the bottom

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.589 
to the little metal clasps on the bottom
let<00:02:44.250> me<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.489> if<00:02:44.579> I<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.790> show<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.480> in

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
let me see if I can show that to you in

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.089 
let me see if I can show that to you in
better<00:02:45.780> detail<00:02:48.109> so<00:02:49.109> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.319> just<00:02:49.410> barely<00:02:49.709> see

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
better detail so you can just barely see

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.250 
better detail so you can just barely see
them<00:02:50.310> down<00:02:50.549> here<00:02:50.609> and<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:54.239> material<00:02:54.900> itself

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
them down here and the material itself

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.780 
them down here and the material itself
the<00:02:55.470> way<00:02:55.590> they've<00:02:55.799> treated<00:02:56.040> spinal<00:02:56.579> really

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the way they've treated spinal really

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.990 
the way they've treated spinal really
gives<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> feel<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.480> leather<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.049> kind<00:02:58.319> of

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
gives it the feel of leather and kind of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.130 
gives it the feel of leather and kind of
separates<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> from<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.329> sculpt<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.959> fur

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
separates it from the sculpt on the fur

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.069 
separates it from the sculpt on the fur
so<00:03:01.409> I'm<00:03:01.500> particularly<00:03:01.950> fond<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:03.079> also

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
so I'm particularly fond of that I also

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.770 
so I'm particularly fond of that I also
really<00:03:04.379> like<00:03:04.530> what<00:03:04.709> they've<00:03:04.859> done<00:03:05.629> with<00:03:06.629> his

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
really like what they've done with his

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.349 
really like what they've done with his
face<00:03:07.049> they've<00:03:07.920> set<00:03:08.190> his<00:03:08.400> eyes<00:03:08.609> back<00:03:09.000> and

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
face they've set his eyes back and

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.420 
face they've set his eyes back and
though<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.200> can't<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.890> best<00:03:11.040> look<00:03:11.190> here

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
though you can't the best look here

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.860 
though you can't the best look here
they're<00:03:11.640> actually<00:03:11.730> recessed<00:03:12.359> back<00:03:12.569> there<00:03:12.750> and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
they're actually recessed back there and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.129 
they're actually recessed back there and
have<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.650> very<00:03:13.920> hollow<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.870> humane<00:03:15.870> look

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
have this very hollow and humane look

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.670 
have this very hollow and humane look
inside<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.919> as<00:03:17.599> really<00:03:18.599> manages<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.470> capture

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
inside that as really manages to capture

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.610 
inside that as really manages to capture
the<00:03:19.950> spirit<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.489> character<00:03:20.880> very<00:03:20.910> much

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
the spirit of the character very much

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.089 
the spirit of the character very much
one<00:03:22.620> last<00:03:22.859> thing<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.340> very<00:03:23.549> much<00:03:23.669> is

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
one last thing I like very much is

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.729 
one last thing I like very much is
Chewbacca's<00:03:26.099> bow<00:03:26.340> caster<00:03:27.049> is<00:03:28.049> completely

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
Chewbacca's bow caster is completely

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.629 
Chewbacca's bow caster is completely
removable<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.169> I'm<00:03:32.010> gonna<00:03:32.190> take<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.459> look

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
sculpting it so he can either hold it or

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.220 
sculpting it so he can either hold it or
sling<00:03:41.879> it<00:03:42.030> over<00:03:42.269> his<00:03:42.389> shoulder<00:03:42.419> via<00:03:43.019> that

sling it over his shoulder via that

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.199 
sling it over his shoulder via that
strap<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:43.769> whichever<00:03:44.280> way<00:03:44.639> you<00:03:44.699> want<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.030> pose

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
strap so whichever way you want to pose

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.800 
strap so whichever way you want to pose
it<00:03:45.449> you've<00:03:45.599> got<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> lot<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.109> flexibility<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
it you've got a lot of flexibility the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.300 
it you've got a lot of flexibility the
attention<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.290> detail<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.769> really<00:03:50.010> one<00:03:50.129> of<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
attention to detail is really one of the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.920 
attention to detail is really one of the
things<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.730> sets<00:03:50.940> aside<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.239> code<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.660> akia

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
things that sets aside the code of akia

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.659 
things that sets aside the code of akia
sculpt<00:03:52.379> now<00:03:52.799> it's<00:03:52.949> one<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.190> things<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.489> like

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
sculpt now it's one of the things I like

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.819 
sculpt now it's one of the things I like
about<00:03:53.699> them<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.150> particular<00:03:56.720> as<00:03:57.829> mentioned

about them in particular as mentioned

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.229 
about them in particular as mentioned
now<00:03:58.949> is<00:03:59.160> probably<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.579> best<00:03:59.819> time<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.090> pick

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
now is probably the best time to pick

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.809 
now is probably the best time to pick
one<00:04:00.419> of<00:04:00.480> these<00:04:00.540> up<00:04:00.599> because<00:04:01.459> you<00:04:02.459> aren't<00:04:02.639> gonna

one of these up because you aren't gonna

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.369 
one of these up because you aren't gonna
find<00:04:03.090> them<00:04:03.269> at<00:04:03.359> this<00:04:03.540> price<00:04:03.780> anywhere<00:04:03.989> else

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
find them at this price anywhere else
