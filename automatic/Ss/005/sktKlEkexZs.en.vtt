crafting box and then I walk over and I

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.680 
crafting box and then I walk over and I
pick<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.549> up<00:03:22.639> you<00:03:23.030> guys<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.329> hear<00:03:23.419> the<00:03:23.540> noise

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
but it was there because i went ahead

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.189 
but it was there because i went ahead
and<00:03:24.620> turned<00:03:24.739> off<00:03:24.949> the<00:03:24.980> noise<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:25.819> I<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.780> was

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199

crafting<00:03:30.169> bench<00:03:30.430> everything<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.699> in<00:03:31.940> place

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
crafting bench everything is in place

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.039 
crafting bench everything is in place
and<00:03:33.129> now<00:03:34.129> I<00:03:34.669> start<00:03:35.030> going<00:03:35.329> back<00:03:35.480> down<00:03:35.720> as<00:03:35.930> you

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
and now I start going back down as you

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.009 
and now I start going back down as you
see<00:03:36.199> up<00:03:36.290> on<00:03:36.409> the<00:03:36.500> Iron<00:03:36.919> there<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:38.000> cave<00:03:38.239> ends

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
see up on the Iron there the cave ends

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.189 
see up on the Iron there the cave ends
so<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:40.129> start<00:03:40.400> making<00:03:40.489> staircase<00:03:40.970> now<00:03:41.780> he<00:03:41.840> has<00:03:42.169> a

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
so I start making staircase now he has a

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.270 
so I start making staircase now he has a
specific<00:03:42.470> role<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:42.919> we're<00:03:43.040> not<00:03:43.099> allowed<00:03:43.250> to

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
specific role that we're not allowed to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.439 
specific role that we're not allowed to
dig<00:03:43.489> straight<00:03:43.639> down<00:03:43.729> otherwise<00:03:44.090> I'd<00:03:44.299> probably

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
dig straight down otherwise I'd probably

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.949 
dig straight down otherwise I'd probably
just<00:03:44.900> would<00:03:45.079> have<00:03:45.139> risked<00:03:45.470> magma<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.959> Doug

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
just would have risked magma and Doug

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.319 
just would have risked magma and Doug
straight<00:03:48.440> down<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.549> go<00:03:50.000> ahead<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.209> start

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
straight down so I go ahead and start

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.759 
straight down so I go ahead and start
digging<00:03:50.510> straight<00:03:50.780> down<00:03:50.959> here<00:03:51.199> I<00:03:51.229> find<00:03:51.409> a<00:03:51.530> cave

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
digging straight down here I find a cave

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.369 
digging straight down here I find a cave
I<00:03:51.949> think<00:03:51.979> oh<00:03:52.250> I'm<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:52.760> lucky<00:03:53.000> aren't<00:03:53.479> I<00:03:53.599> how

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
I think oh I'm so lucky aren't I how

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.740 
I think oh I'm so lucky aren't I how
magical<00:03:55.220> wondrous<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.150> then<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:56.299> realized

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
magical wondrous and then I realized

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.610 
magical wondrous and then I realized
that<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.930> cave<00:03:57.079> doesn't<00:03:57.260> really<00:03:57.470> go<00:03:57.590> very

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
that the cave doesn't really go very

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.069 
that the cave doesn't really go very
deep<00:03:57.829> at<00:03:58.069> all<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.000> start<00:03:59.629> building<00:04:00.639> 1<00:04:01.639> 2<00:04:02.120> 3<00:04:02.449> q

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
deep at all so I start building 1 2 3 q

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.360 
deep at all so I start building 1 2 3 q
the<00:04:03.199> stairs<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.650> start<00:04:03.799> building<00:04:04.040> more<00:04:04.129> stairs

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
the stairs to start building more stairs

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.860 
the stairs to start building more stairs
again<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:06.099> yeah<00:04:07.099> that<00:04:08.030> ends<00:04:08.150> up<00:04:08.239> being<00:04:08.299> my<00:04:08.690> main

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
again so yeah that ends up being my main

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.170 
again so yeah that ends up being my main
form<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.530> transportation<00:04:09.590> on<00:04:10.340> my<00:04:10.430> way<00:04:10.579> down<00:04:10.849> is

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
form of transportation on my way down is

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.640 
form of transportation on my way down is
I'll<00:04:11.299> just<00:04:11.479> intermittently<00:04:11.989> find<00:04:12.290> puny

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
I'll just intermittently find puny

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.949 
I'll just intermittently find puny
little<00:04:12.680> small<00:04:13.129> caves<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.819> if<00:04:14.419> I<00:04:14.540> go<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.810> the

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
little small caves and if I go to the

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.129 
little small caves and if I go to the
bottom<00:04:15.079> of<00:04:15.319> them<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.709> then<00:04:16.190> I'll<00:04:16.549> go<00:04:16.729> down<00:04:16.940> and

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
bottom of them and then I'll go down and

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.140 
bottom of them and then I'll go down and
make<00:04:18.139> some<00:04:18.349> more<00:04:18.440> stairs<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.280> set<00:04:19.549> cetera<00:04:19.970> and

make some more stairs and set cetera and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.540 
make some more stairs and set cetera and
also<00:04:20.780> for<00:04:21.320> whatever<00:04:21.620> reason<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.099> decided<00:04:22.430> that

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
also for whatever reason I decided that

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.149 
also for whatever reason I decided that
I<00:04:22.789> don't<00:04:22.969> want<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.210> destroy<00:04:23.599> this<00:04:23.750> dirt<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.380> just

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
I don't want to destroy this dirt I just

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.500 
I don't want to destroy this dirt I just
kind<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.460> like

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
kind of like

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.190 
kind of like
yearly<00:04:27.370> folk<00:04:28.370> nearly<00:04:29.270> become<00:04:29.510> phobic<00:04:29.900> of<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.110> I

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
yearly folk nearly become phobic of it I

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.320 
yearly folk nearly become phobic of it I
almost<00:04:30.770> always<00:04:30.950> avoided<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:32.030> I'm<00:04:32.180> not

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
almost always avoided and I'm not

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.760 
almost always avoided and I'm not
entirely<00:04:32.570> sure<00:04:32.720> why<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.080> ended<00:04:33.230> up<00:04:33.440> doing<00:04:33.650> X

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
entirely sure why I ended up doing X

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.920 
entirely sure why I ended up doing X
looking<00:04:34.130> back<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:34.460> think<00:04:34.490> well<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.360> mean<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:35.840> was

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
looking back I think well I mean it was

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.950 
looking back I think well I mean it was
kool<00:04:36.920> or<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.640> would<00:04:37.760> probably<00:04:38.060> be<00:04:38.330> destroyed

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
kool or it would probably be destroyed

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.620 
kool or it would probably be destroyed
just<00:04:38.990> as<00:04:39.260> fast<00:04:39.500> as<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.890> stone<00:04:40.130> why<00:04:40.310> do<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.490> care

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
just as fast as the stone why do I care

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.750 
just as fast as the stone why do I care
but<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.660> end<00:04:41.900> up<00:04:41.960> doing<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.350> anyways<00:04:42.680> also<00:04:43.610> as

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
but I end up doing it anyways also as

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.920 
but I end up doing it anyways also as
you<00:04:43.850> can<00:04:43.940> see<00:04:44.060> i<00:04:44.090> had<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.360> kalama<00:04:44.540> light<00:04:44.780> on

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
you can see i had the kalama light on

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.840 
you can see i had the kalama light on
that<00:04:45.080> right<00:04:45.380> now<00:04:45.410> that's<00:04:45.770> why<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:45.950> taskbar<00:04:46.640> is

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
that right now that's why the taskbar is

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.570 
that right now that's why the taskbar is
kind<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:47.090> messed<00:04:47.240> up<00:04:47.420> but<00:04:48.350> that's<00:04:48.650> yeah<00:04:49.550> that's
