in the way that anybody would expect now
she<00:03:08.230> pushed<00:03:08.590> down<00:03:08.770> but<00:03:08.980> her<00:03:09.070> head<00:03:10.440> stays<00:03:11.440> up

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
she pushed down but her head stays up

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.180 
she pushed down but her head stays up
her<00:03:13.120> neck<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.660> big<00:03:13.900> in<00:03:14.020> this<00:03:14.200> stretch<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> little

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
her neck is big in this stretch a little

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.130 
her neck is big in this stretch a little
bit<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:18.270> I'm<00:03:19.270> not<00:03:19.420> really<00:03:19.690> worrying<00:03:19.989> about

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
bit and I'm not really worrying about

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.370 
bit and I'm not really worrying about
drawing<00:03:20.739> Ariel<00:03:21.600> correctly<00:03:22.600> I'm<00:03:22.690> just<00:03:22.930> this

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
drawing Ariel correctly I'm just this

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.780 
drawing Ariel correctly I'm just this
city

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.910 

when<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.819> animated<00:03:27.540> her<00:03:27.749> as<00:03:27.930> well<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.379> just<00:03:28.620> do

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
when I animated her as well and just do

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.899 
when I animated her as well and just do
it<00:03:29.040> very<00:03:29.219> loose<00:03:29.879> like<00:03:30.180> this

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:40.610 

so<00:03:35.909> somewhere<00:03:37.129> out<00:03:38.129> behind<00:03:38.670> her<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:40.290> tail

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
so somewhere out behind her that tail

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.030 
so somewhere out behind her that tail
has<00:03:41.010> gone<00:03:41.400> straight<00:03:41.939> back<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:43.290> know<00:03:43.409> maybe

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
has gone straight back you know maybe

00:03:44.040 --> 00:04:01.580 
has gone straight back you know maybe
the<00:03:44.250> fin<00:03:44.459> hasn't<00:03:44.909> but<00:03:45.329> she's<00:03:45.540> kicking<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:46.019> back

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.349 

okay<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:02.650> now<00:04:05.069> now<00:04:06.069> we're<00:04:06.280> torso<00:04:06.790> is<00:04:06.969> moving

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
okay so now now we're torso is moving

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.890 
okay so now now we're torso is moving
all<00:04:08.079> of<00:04:08.349> that<00:04:08.530> energy<00:04:08.769> has<00:04:09.250> come<00:04:09.340> down<00:04:09.780> from<00:04:10.780> up

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
all of that energy has come down from up

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.830 
all of that energy has come down from up
here<00:04:11.379> to<00:04:11.890> down<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.310> here<00:04:12.790> now<00:04:13.359> it's<00:04:13.599> pushing

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
here to down to here now it's pushing

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.740 
here to down to here now it's pushing
down<00:04:14.230> here<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:15.010> we're<00:04:15.640> getting<00:04:15.790> this<00:04:16.150> energy

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
down here and we're getting this energy

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.240 
down here and we're getting this energy
it's<00:04:16.900> all<00:04:17.139> pushing<00:04:17.470> into<00:04:18.280> there<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:20.009> it's<00:04:21.009> got

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
it's all pushing into there and it's got

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.210 
it's all pushing into there and it's got
to<00:04:21.459> keep<00:04:21.699> continue<00:04:22.270> moving<00:04:22.449> that<00:04:22.870> way<00:04:23.080> right

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.400 

which<00:04:27.220> is<00:04:27.370> really<00:04:27.759> wonderful<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.300> now<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.720> I

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
which is really wonderful and now I I

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.980 
which is really wonderful and now I I
can<00:04:30.220> feel<00:04:30.580> there's<00:04:30.880> something<00:04:31.330> happening

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
can feel there's something happening

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.219 
can feel there's something happening
that<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.830> really<00:04:33.460> account<00:04:33.789> like<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.960> hold

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
that I I really account like the hold

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.980 
that I I really account like the hold
back<00:04:35.380> on<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.650> head<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.830> little<00:04:36.160> bit<00:04:36.310> more<00:04:36.960> but<00:04:37.960> I

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
back on the head a little bit more but I

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.680 
back on the head a little bit more but I
I<00:04:38.740> like<00:04:39.190> that<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.520> head<00:04:39.789> is<00:04:40.030> going<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.389> start

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
I like that the head is going to start

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.310 
I like that the head is going to start
to<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:42.070> roll<00:04:42.370> like<00:04:45.870> we're<00:04:46.870> not<00:04:46.990> going<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.229> look

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
to to roll like we're not going to look

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.339 
to to roll like we're not going to look
at<00:04:47.560> just<00:04:47.880> profile<00:04:48.880> now<00:04:49.120> either<00:04:49.419> sees<00:04:49.990> teeth

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
at just profile now either sees teeth

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.730 
at just profile now either sees teeth
beginning<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:51.190> feels<00:04:51.520> like<00:04:51.699> naturally<00:04:52.740> it

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
beginning it feels like naturally it

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.299 
beginning it feels like naturally it
wants<00:04:54.039> to<00:04:54.160> kind<00:04:54.400> of<00:04:54.430> go<00:04:54.580> opposite<00:04:55.180> of

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:56.309 
wants to kind of go opposite of

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:00.739 
wants to kind of go opposite of
the<00:04:56.609> direction<00:04:57.149> of<00:04:57.269> that<00:04:58.099> of<00:04:59.099> her<00:04:59.339> torso<00:05:00.149> being

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:00.749 
the direction of that of her torso being

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:12.740 
the direction of that of her torso being
pushed<00:05:01.079> down

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.710 

and<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.470> longer<00:05:13.920> I<00:05:14.160> set<00:05:14.760> this<00:05:15.000> up<00:05:15.270> like<00:05:15.450> that

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
and the longer I set this up like that

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.030 
and the longer I set this up like that
you<00:05:16.620> know<00:05:16.800> that<00:05:17.070> it's<00:05:17.340> got<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.000> at<00:05:18.120> some<00:05:18.300> point

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
you know that it's got to at some point

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.340 
you know that it's got to at some point
reverse<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:21.330> that's<00:05:21.480> another<00:05:21.750> thing<00:05:21.870> another

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
reverse and that's another thing another

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.950 
reverse and that's another thing another
card<00:05:22.740> in<00:05:22.920> my<00:05:23.070> hand<00:05:23.100> that<00:05:23.610> I'm<00:05:23.820> I'm<00:05:24.540> thinking

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
card in my hand that I'm I'm thinking

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.760 
card in my hand that I'm I'm thinking
okay<00:05:25.230> when<00:05:25.500> do<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:25.740> deliver<00:05:26.100> on<00:05:26.370> that

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.160 

[Music]

[Music]

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.600 
[Music]
and<00:05:32.170> if<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:32.710> do<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:33.040> fast<00:05:35.130> it<00:05:36.130> gives<00:05:36.460> an

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
and if you do it fast it gives an

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.770 
and if you do it fast it gives an
enormous<00:05:37.120> amount<00:05:37.510> of<00:05:37.660> power<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.940> I<00:05:40.600> have<00:05:40.690> a

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
enormous amount of power and I have a

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.080 
enormous amount of power and I have a
feeling<00:05:41.230> that<00:05:41.350> I'm<00:05:41.500> going<00:05:41.680> to<00:05:41.710> have<00:05:41.920> to<00:05:42.130> pay

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
feeling that I'm going to have to pay

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.240 
feeling that I'm going to have to pay
that<00:05:43.120> off<00:05:43.510> pretty<00:05:43.840> quick<00:05:44.170> to<00:05:44.650> give<00:05:44.830> her<00:05:44.980> some

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
that off pretty quick to give her some

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:54.860 
that off pretty quick to give her some
real<00:05:46.030> energy<00:05:46.530> so<00:05:47.530> I'm<00:05:47.770> gonna

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.070 

I'm<00:05:55.380> going<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.620> start<00:05:55.860> to<00:05:56.010> reverse<00:05:56.310> that

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.980 

somewhere<00:05:59.889> out<00:06:00.039> here<00:06:00.069> that<00:06:00.970> tail<00:06:01.300> is<00:06:01.330> thick

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.600 

and<00:06:04.990> she's<00:06:05.289> getting<00:06:05.470> a<00:06:05.650> lot<00:06:05.830> of<00:06:05.889> energy<00:06:06.160> to

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
and she's getting a lot of energy to

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.210 
and she's getting a lot of energy to
this<00:06:06.849> gun<00:06:08.129> all<00:06:09.129> of<00:06:09.370> that<00:06:09.550> holding<00:06:10.000> back
