compared<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.520> 4s<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:34.229> what

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
compared to the 4s and that's what

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.980 
compared to the 4s and that's what
matters<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:35.340> feels<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.180> lighter<00:01:36.750> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
matters it feels like it is lighter I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
matters it feels like it is lighter I
mean<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:37.950> talking<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.430> actual

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
mean if we're talking about actual

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520 
mean if we're talking about actual
specifications<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.960> lighter<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.409> not

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
specifications it is lighter it's not

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.109 
specifications it is lighter it's not
just<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> feeling<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.340> Apple<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
just a feeling that Apple is like you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
just a feeling that Apple is like you
know<00:01:42.240> imposed<00:01:43.079> upon<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.560> oh<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.799> feels

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
know imposed upon your oh it feels

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.340 
know imposed upon your oh it feels
lighter<00:01:44.369> therefore<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.000> no<00:01:45.210> absolutely<00:01:46.170> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
lighter therefore it is no absolutely is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.530 
lighter therefore it is no absolutely is
the<00:01:47.100> third<00:01:47.460> thing<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.820> wanted<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> mention<00:01:48.180> is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the third thing I wanted to mention is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
the third thing I wanted to mention is
speed<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.799> faster<00:01:50.570> noticeably<00:01:51.570> faster<00:01:51.810> in

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
speed it's faster noticeably faster in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.950 
speed it's faster noticeably faster in
every<00:01:53.100> operation<00:01:53.700> whether<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.930> know

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to it you know this speed on a five and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.450 
to it you know this speed on a five and
you<00:02:03.719> go<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> 4s<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:05.130> when<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you go back to the 4s that's when the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.859 
you go back to the 4s that's when the
speed<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.820> noticeable<00:02:06.329> I'm<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> go

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
speed is noticeable I'm going to go

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.710 
speed is noticeable I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.110> pull<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.069> camera<00:02:08.940> application

is<00:02:13.940> basically<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.090> camera<00:02:15.510> app<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:16.140> will<00:02:16.410> take

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
is basically a camera app that will take

is basically a camera app that will take
a<00:02:16.680> series<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.040> six<00:02:17.310> shots<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.820> only<00:02:18.210> keep<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
clearest one so let's go ahead and let

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640 
clearest one so let's go ahead and let

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
time fives done the 4s is done it's

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.980 
time fives done the 4s is done it's
faster<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.350> that's<00:02:34.800> important<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:36.090> know<00:02:36.150> for

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
faster and that's important you know for

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.650 
faster and that's important you know for

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
position the camera which is a big deal

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.560 
position the camera which is a big deal
because<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.190> centered<00:02:59.670> versus<00:03:00.030> offset

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
on the 4s compared to the five better

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.770 
on the 4s compared to the five better
quality<00:03:04.320> images<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.520> like<00:03:05.880> sharp<00:03:06.180> images<00:03:06.630> I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
quality images in I like sharp images I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.960 
quality images in I like sharp images I
like<00:03:07.170> images<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.100> represent<00:03:08.489> color

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
like images that represent color

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.300 
like images that represent color
accurately<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.110> five<00:03:10.410> does<00:03:10.920> not

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
accurately and the five does not

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.520 
accurately and the five does not
disappoint<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.120> only<00:03:12.330> thing<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.600> would<00:03:12.750> say<00:03:12.989> is

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
disappoint the only thing I would say is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.530
