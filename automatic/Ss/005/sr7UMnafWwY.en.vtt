00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.660

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.070
 from Malaga to see if you 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 please one of questions 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.970
 hello good night I have a question 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.580
 for 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.050
 for the coach I'm in front of 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.780
 do for de olé magazine of poland 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.480
 that you think about the whole thing with 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.850
 the player by the cup webs that you think 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.540
 that the transfer will take time to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.620
 the match against Barcelona 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.620
 yes i think so 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.860
 hello bernardo that such bernal damián for 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.430
 channel your radio an assessment of 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.230
 match and also if seen the seen is going to 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.600
 emphasize the need to signing 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.880
 players a forward a midfielder 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.479
 what you ask before the market closes 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.479
 Thank you 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.340
 Party action is quite simple 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.109
 I do not think that 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.109
 we leave with the feeling of 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.050
 there may be a point at least 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.090
 the team has done a great job 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.630
 in many phases we have controlled very 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.149
 good to valence 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.260
 the proof is that there are almost no chances 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.310
 goal clear 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.030
 the bold is a shame not an error but that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.030
 we commit ourselves 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.830
 and there it is very even, I am very 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.320
 happy with my team because I've seen 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.900
 has made a further step forward 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.090
 what we want to do from what I eat 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.910
 we think about doing things there are 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.060
 improve many things too but 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.489
 in general the truth is that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.709
 pity for result but for the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.709
 party we are happy 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.110
 the questions please 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.209
 thank you if you allow it 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.350
 if a bernardo question thought that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.710
 there were more questions 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.140
 you said you wanted a beginning of 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.670
 season with difficult matches or 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.830
 complicated because that can also 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.360
 demanding much more to the team worries 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.100
 that these results do not come in these 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.630
 first days because we have the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.480
 barcelona next week in the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.710
 Rose garden then visit Seville 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.720
 demanding calendar to start after 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.710
 of this defeat he worries that this is the case 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.540
 Thank you 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.580
 I do not worry because in principle we have 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.590
 calculated 0 points in the first three 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.390
 matches then we have it very easy 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.050
 as we already have it calculated from that 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.180
 way 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.610
 we go to the next match the barcelona 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.600
 lovely game at home let's play 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.810
 is everything and see if it also touches us 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.820
 a home referee would be nice to see if 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.190
 we get something out there but in principle what 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.140
 we have everything very clear in the first 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.150
 three days and today it has been seen that 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.980
 we are right we have played with the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.940
 valencia here you to you 'perfectly and 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.660
 I simply seems unfair 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.890
 result and there it is but it's football and not 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.890
 we can change to nothing 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.230
 we like the good night too 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.580
 look for elche tv dot tv with 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.040
 Regarding what you just said do not 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.050
 It seems to be a bit defeatist or it's very 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.600
 realistic with what the team has in 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.610
 say that you will lose all points 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.400
 of the next three days to lose 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.200
 because they will not win we have calculated the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.850
 possibility that you can stay 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.570
 I consider points it seems good 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.570
 Me 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.290
 so thank you very much good luck 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.290
 very well
