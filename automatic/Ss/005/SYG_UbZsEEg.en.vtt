00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.460
 numbers display the rules 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.460
 throughout life 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.210
 hello welcome back to the kitchen 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.760
 the ark today we propose you eggs with 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.090
 Toasts serve both with a breakfast 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.470
 very energetic like a quick dinner 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.470
 prepare and very tasty 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.470
 the first step is to put the water to boil 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.760
 and we left the toast ready and 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.590
 we'll warm it up when the egg is 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.530
 ready 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.840
 Y 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 i 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.980
 good when the water starts to boil 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.110
 we introduce the egg with care to 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.520
 do not burn and we leave it from 1 to 2 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 minutes as we like 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.820
 well past the cooking time 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.010
 we take the egg carefully and what 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.940
 we let it fry a little 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.880
 Y 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.870
 i 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.700
 here 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.770
 i 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.270
 Y 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.049
 well now what you have to do is 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.700
 Take advantage of the heat of the toast to 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.700
 dilute the butter well 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.020
 i 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 all right 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.710
 good and now comes a little 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.340
 more complicated operation that is to take out the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.480
 egg 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.670
 we are careful 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.340
 and if we do not have a pair of scissors that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.660
 they sell for those who love 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.820
 the eggs and eat them a lot 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.610
 often we have to cut with 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.940
 Care the shell and try to avoid 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.940
 that we fall pieces in the toast 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:18.140
 navas carefully we take the egg over 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.170
 the toast we take great care to 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.450
 that the shell does not fall off 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.459
 well we have the prepared egg 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.520
 Now we just need to take it out 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.700
 little bit and for adults who like it 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.660
 you can add a point of pepper 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.880
 black and you will see how it is a dish that 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.260
 love now let's stir the egg 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.260
 and of course to comment
