 I tell you because it was more than for the 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.540
 idea but at least it would be like an aspect 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.600
 of marijuana 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.760

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.590
 something that I am a carajito that the 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.840
 development would be conforming the authorship 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.840
 action stories 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 yes 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.410
 in this case 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.330
 and I tell my brothers when I have 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.340

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.940
 go to kiss I have already in the bullseye 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.070
 of the lyric that creates it because it's 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.350
 occupying the mtd well you have the idea 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.540

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.670
 I am a baby the black burj of high that 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.680

 mechada that you fill the arepa in my 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.400
 heart but when I do I have a 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.260
 definition because to be honest I am 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.330
 the improvisations all the planet 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.490
 being beta the lyrics that do not respect 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.860
 because they are exercises that if they take 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.540
 the topic that's why I'm a poet for where 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.670
 I want it arrived I do not need 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.650

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.810
 I tell you a pod I do not have a 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.500
 Paraguayan are helmets they go through with this 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.740
 to the beach and that's why 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.630
 I always dream I grow up it 's because of 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.760
 my dreams because this I put pawn 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.890
 I will take my happy and in my house there is no 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.590
 computer should go to write but 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.540
 so I am happy throwing I offer myself 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.910
 magazine that is my site with pulp 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.790
 anise lyric when I put a 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.650
 want it lyrical my mind that I have to 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.660
 understand it a hook fail in caigÃ¼ire 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.790
 it's because I'm a calling artist 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.190
 mind to my very tip of the motoraxista 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.350
 why when the lyrical vague if I'm from 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.720
 neighborhood doing on the track i have 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.730
 vocabulary they tell me that with this they do not 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.100
 because fast flag that if I'm moore 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.230
 of ugly and I look like a skull because I 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.810
 Flag rhythm I am like the first 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.240
 they want to throw themselves with me 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.610
 so much to agree also with 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.500
 Carla doing on the track I never 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.110
 I fall to speak to square 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.940
 they are going to conquer it, he did not pronounce the 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.160
 king or I never go back 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.139
 I hit me to destroy the black of the skin 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.300
 that I am like a rumba caleta and 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.730
 third level the lyric when I do 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.410
 then she faster says call the 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.389
 art of improvising 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.400
 this is improvisation that I get from 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.110
 heart I am like diomedes diaz 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.389
 after the burn they direct 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.490
 quote that comes to me from the brain 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.250
 they want to throw themselves with paper that in lyric 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.830
 I'm glad and it's going to be an event 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.290
 of talent black derives from poetry and 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.419
 feelings I already passed is stage of 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.400
 to square caraquistas horita when 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.620
 I do look for it, send me so beautiful not only 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.389
 because I have already passed this stage 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.340
 that's why when I do it in my mind 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.710
 there stands out when they see me out there 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.330
 greet me I'm not an artist just 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.490
 I am a mystic childbirth with people in the 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.580
 track why with an old woman who was 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.319
 yesterday my nation 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.020
 I told him I am a citizen and also I 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.320
 I am your nation, I said, Mrs. 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.020
 blessing 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.090
 the mountain gives me heart suspension 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.370
 as with critical flow when you create it 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.070
 they want to win with one because it is eyes and 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.170
 rape because to be honest the lyric 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.330
 in the view who removes who knows what 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.670
 they are incarnated as a lyrical 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.710
 come because people improve if you 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.540
 I do not shut up changes like four hours 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.970
 because my mind the now I'm not a 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.400
 hollow head I have more contents of a 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.400
 disco in villaseca why with the lyric 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.200
 of good no money listen to what indexes 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.830
 they believe that in two fields and I rape 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.570
 for rooney they are monkfish or for sugar with 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.240
 that live seduce your mind when 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.340
 synthesis stop of stuffed animals that's why 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.160
 when I do lyric when you work 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.900
 I'm in the mp or here in the life and 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.150
 ask for the show that the black that 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.520
 rhyme that such an end why when I do 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.360
 I am not famous, I am like thor 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.639
 this is fast and furious 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.009
 I am the law I am like the araguaney 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.020
 they want to throw themselves with one because I am 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.969
 it's in six clinics when I do it 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.129
 lyrical all this heat they are 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.710
 homosexuals like the nightclub sin 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:40.900
 that's why when I give and I am evolved 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.939
 if I tell you the betas in your face and not 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.069
 sacred in the lyric when he is wearing 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:47.770
 in my way of rapping is the line that 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.780
 I have for my mind on that street a lot 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.669
 People who want to compare do not know 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.189
 they compare by calling because they can not 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:57.009
 train this yes is to have talent not 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:59.080
 to laugh is to rape to be able to a table 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.810
 is to instruct so that you realize 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.009
 that if emotion rest and change I know if 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.009
 I deserve the applause
