00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.289 
let's just go into storage and I just
noticed<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.189> dragon<00:01:20.430> doesn't<00:01:20.880> seem

noticed that this dragon doesn't seem

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.620 
noticed that this dragon doesn't seem
like<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.780> has<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> baby<00:01:22.350> form<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:24.030> guessing

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
like it has a baby form so I'm guessing

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.359 
like it has a baby form so I'm guessing
it's<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> moon<00:01:25.740> dragon<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.220> moon

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
it's just like the moon dragon the moon

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's just like the moon dragon the moon
dragon<00:01:26.610> only<00:01:27.090> had<00:01:27.299> an<00:01:27.450> adult<00:01:27.750> form<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
dragon only had an adult form which is

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.499 
dragon only had an adult form which is
the<00:01:28.590> strangest<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.579> ever<00:01:29.610> saw

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the strangest thing I ever saw

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.620 
the strangest thing I ever saw
in<00:01:30.869> my<00:01:31.079> entire<00:01:31.259> life<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:32.090> here<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.600> is

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
in my entire life now here it is that is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.050 
in my entire life now here it is that is
the<00:01:34.020> dragon<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.820> there<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.270> egg<00:01:38.060> alright

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the dragon and there is the egg alright

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.840 
the dragon and there is the egg alright
so<00:01:39.240> there<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.960> egg<00:01:40.170> 16<00:01:40.950> hours<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> egg

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so there is the egg 16 hours for the egg

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.149 
so there is the egg 16 hours for the egg
to<00:01:42.180> hatch<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.960> guess<00:01:43.560> there<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.979> no

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to hatch and I guess there is no

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.460 
to hatch and I guess there is no
breeding<00:01:44.640> time<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.420> there's<00:01:45.570> 16<00:01:45.960> hours<00:01:46.290> for

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
breeding time but there's 16 hours for

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.050 
breeding time but there's 16 hours for
hatching<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.729> we're<00:01:47.909> gonna

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
hatching all right so we're gonna

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.240 
hatching all right so we're gonna
fast-forward<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.130> an

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
fast-forward that as you can see an

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.300

don't ask me alright so just gonna feed

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.880 
don't ask me alright so just gonna feed
it<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.569> if<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.780> moves<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.170> doesn't<00:02:37.290> move<00:02:37.590> I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
it to see if it moves it doesn't move I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.430 
it to see if it moves it doesn't move I
I<00:02:38.250> guess<00:02:38.670> there's<00:02:38.910> something<00:02:39.180> wrong<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
I guess there's something wrong with the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.880 
I guess there's something wrong with the
code<00:02:40.769> or<00:02:41.069> something<00:02:41.489> but<00:02:42.290> let's<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.620> wait

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
code or something but let's just wait

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.809 
code or something but let's just wait
until<00:02:44.250> she<00:02:45.180> does<00:02:45.390> her<00:02:45.630> stuff<00:02:46.019> again<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.819> then

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
until she does her stuff again and then

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.360 
until she does her stuff again and then
we'll<00:02:48.239> see<00:02:48.360> what<00:02:48.480> happens<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:52.100> that's<00:02:53.100> really

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
we'll see what happens so that's really

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.020 
we'll see what happens so that's really
strange<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:54.090> never<00:02:54.540> seen<00:02:55.130> someone<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.549> this<00:02:56.819> I
