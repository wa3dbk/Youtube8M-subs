00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
have really made a lot of difference and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.000

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
made this phone a little more enticing

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.360 
made this phone a little more enticing
because<00:03:20.730> it's<00:03:20.940> got<00:03:21.090> an<00:03:21.239> 8mp<00:03:21.540> camera<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.370> then

because it's got an 8mp camera and then

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.840 
because it's got an 8mp camera and then
you<00:03:23.459> don't<00:03:23.610> have<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:24.380> key<00:03:25.380> out<00:03:25.680> here<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.520> kind<00:03:26.730> of

you don't have a key out here so kind of

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.720 
you don't have a key out here so kind of
really<00:03:27.120> misses<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.050> whole<00:03:28.170> point<00:03:28.250> but<00:03:29.250> fine

USB cable as the wire connecting your

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.640 
USB cable as the wire connecting your
wall<00:04:52.070> charger<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.789> phone<00:04:53.350> it's<00:04:54.350> pretty

actually<00:05:02.409> loads<00:05:02.620> up<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:03.639> that's<00:05:03.879> how<00:05:04.150> we<00:05:04.180> are

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
actually loads up so that's how we are

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.240 
actually loads up so that's how we are
watch<00:05:04.599> our<00:05:04.780> rules<00:05:05.050> three<00:05:05.470> standard<00:05:05.919> stopped

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
watch our rules three standard stopped

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.520 
watch our rules three standard stopped
to<00:05:06.490> watch<00:05:06.669> out<00:05:06.939> a<00:05:06.970> two-pin<00:05:10.110> let's<00:05:11.110> see<00:05:11.289> that

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
to watch out a two-pin let's see that

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.619 
to watch out a two-pin let's see that
here's<00:05:11.949> the<00:05:13.409> microUSB<00:05:14.409> to<00:05:14.680> USB<00:05:14.770> cable<00:05:15.729> this<00:05:16.449> is

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
here's the microUSB to USB cable this is

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:18.209 
here's the microUSB to USB cable this is
basically<00:05:17.169> the<00:05:17.349> data<00:05:17.560> cable<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:18.069> you're

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
basically the data cable that you're

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.890 
basically the data cable that you're
going<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.520> using<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:19.000> transfer<00:05:19.330> data<00:05:19.569> to

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
going to be using to transfer data to

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.529 
going to be using to transfer data to
and<00:05:20.110> fro<00:05:20.259> from<00:05:20.469> it<00:05:20.590> bc<00:05:20.969> and<00:05:21.969> obviously<00:05:22.389> this

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
and fro from it bc and obviously this

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.869 
and fro from it bc and obviously this
also<00:05:22.719> doubles<00:05:23.080> up<00:05:23.169> as<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.439> wire<00:05:23.620> for<00:05:23.979> your

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
also doubles up as the wire for your

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.230 
also doubles up as the wire for your
wall<00:05:25.870> charger<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.669> wall<00:05:27.819> charger

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
wall charger so the wall charger

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.899 
wall charger so the wall charger
obviously<00:05:28.780> connects<00:05:29.500> from<00:05:29.620> here<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.129> you

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
obviously connects from here and you

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:32.010 
obviously connects from here and you
know<00:05:31.000> you'll<00:05:31.150> be<00:05:31.180> able<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.479> connect<00:05:31.750> from<00:05:31.840> down

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
know you'll be able to connect from down

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.559 
know you'll be able to connect from down
there<00:05:32.259> to<00:05:32.530> your<00:05:33.189> phone<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.460> actually<00:05:34.210> charge

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
there to your phone and actually charge

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.020 
there to your phone and actually charge
your<00:05:34.690> phone<00:05:34.949> so<00:05:35.949> that's<00:05:36.580> pretty<00:05:36.789> much<00:05:36.879> it

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
your phone so that's pretty much it

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.820 
your phone so that's pretty much it
there's<00:05:37.719> obviously<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.169> piece<00:05:38.650> of<00:05:38.680> paper

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
there's obviously the piece of paper

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.760 
there's obviously the piece of paper
which<00:05:39.219> is<00:05:39.250> basically<00:05:39.789> standard<00:05:40.770> information

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
which is basically standard information

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:52.850 
which is basically standard information
that<00:05:42.370> you'd<00:05:42.909> expect

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.030 

so<00:05:53.430> there<00:05:53.610> we<00:05:53.729> go

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
so there we go

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.960 
so there we go
it's<00:05:55.610> just<00:05:55.790> a<00:05:55.940> little<00:05:56.060> activation<00:05:56.750> for<00:05:57.050> an<00:05:57.230> SMS

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
it's just a little activation for an SMS

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.820 
it's just a little activation for an SMS
and<00:05:58.970> that's<00:05:59.150> about<00:05:59.270> it<00:05:59.390> so<00:05:59.810> that's<00:06:00.170> basically

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
and that's about it so that's basically

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.210
