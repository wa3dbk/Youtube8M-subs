00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
yep I'm going to use logic in a video

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.400 
yep I'm going to use logic in a video
the<00:00:02.850> world<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.179> ending<00:00:03.360> as<00:00:03.570> we<00:00:03.689> speak<00:00:03.959> so<00:00:04.290> what

of<00:00:06.810> Binding<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.200> Isaac<00:00:07.319> rebirth<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.099> then

started<00:00:09.450> coming<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.809> with<00:00:09.870> conclusions<00:00:10.710> by

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
started coming up with conclusions by

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.669 
started coming up with conclusions by
using<00:00:11.670> too<00:00:11.880> much<00:00:12.059> logic<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.230> came<00:00:13.500> up<00:00:13.530> with

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
using too much logic and I came up with

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.530 
using too much logic and I came up with
a<00:00:13.830> list<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.670> will<00:00:15.000> share<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a list that I will share with the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.240 
a list that I will share with the
internet<00:00:15.929> while<00:00:16.139> screaming<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> retard

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.360 

according<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> game's<00:00:37.440> creator<00:00:37.920> Edmund

according to the game's creator Edmund
McMillen<00:00:38.489> he<00:00:39.390> has<00:00:39.600> said<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.410> Reaper

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
McMillen he has said that in Reaper

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.619 
McMillen he has said that in Reaper
there's<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.730> chest<00:00:42.120> equivalent

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
there's going to be a chest equivalent

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.619 
there's going to be a chest equivalent
for<00:00:42.809> sure<00:00:43.309> no<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> can't<00:00:44.730> say<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> would<00:00:45.450> be

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
for sure no I can't say what it would be

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.500 
for sure no I can't say what it would be
but<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.649> guess<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> bosses<00:00:47.610> so

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but I can guess with the bosses so

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.220 
but I can guess with the bosses so
ensure<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.350> fight<00:00:49.649> Satan<00:00:50.190> man<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
ensure you fight Satan man right and the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.340 
ensure you fight Satan man right and the
Cathedral<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.010> fight<00:00:53.489> Isaac<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:55.199> if

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
Cathedral you fight Isaac and then if

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.279 
Cathedral you fight Isaac and then if
you<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.280> polaroid<00:00:56.820> thing<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you go get the polaroid thing you go to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.180 
you go get the polaroid thing you go to
the<00:00:58.500> chest<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.190> fight<00:01:00.000> blue<00:01:00.300> baby<00:01:01.010> notice<00:01:02.010> how

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the chest and fight blue baby notice how

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.820 
the chest and fight blue baby notice how
a<00:01:02.219> blue<00:01:02.489> baby<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.270> almost<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.989> same<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.260> Isaac

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
a blue baby is almost the same as Isaac

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
a blue baby is almost the same as Isaac
I<00:01:05.070> mean<00:01:05.549> yes<00:01:05.760> he's<00:01:05.939> slightly<00:01:06.119> harder<00:01:06.510> than

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I mean yes he's slightly harder than

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.929 
I mean yes he's slightly harder than
Isaac<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.140> he's<00:01:07.710> still<00:01:08.040> basically<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> same

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
Isaac but he's still basically the same

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.100 
Isaac but he's still basically the same
to<00:01:09.869> character<00:01:10.260> wise<00:01:10.439> they're<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
to character wise they're kind of the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.460 
to character wise they're kind of the
opposites<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.880> still<00:01:14.880> somehow<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.479> same<00:01:15.990> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
opposites but still somehow the same so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.649 
opposites but still somehow the same so
taking<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.830> information<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.090> conclude

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
taking that information we can conclude

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.800 
taking that information we can conclude
that<00:01:18.689> after<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> beat<00:01:19.680> Satan<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.700> must<00:01:21.030> fight

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that after you beat Satan you must fight

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.350 
that after you beat Satan you must fight
something<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.530> looks<00:01:22.830> similar<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
something that looks similar but at the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.100 
something that looks similar but at the
same<00:01:24.570> time<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.350> opposite<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.159> him

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
same time is the opposite of him

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
same time is the opposite of him
anything<00:01:28.110> comes<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.619> mind<00:01:28.740> well<00:01:29.610> let's<00:01:30.180> look

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
anything comes to mind well let's look

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.530 
anything comes to mind well let's look
at<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> devil<00:01:30.990> room<00:01:31.610> okay<00:01:32.610> stop<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.420> what

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
at the devil room okay stop that so what

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.190 
at the devil room okay stop that so what
is<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> alternative<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> angel

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
is the alternative that then the angel

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
is the alternative that then the angel
room<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.950> logically<00:01:40.250> okay<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.430> smart<00:01:41.729> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
room so logically okay you're smart you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.100 
room so logically okay you're smart you
can<00:01:42.000> figure<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.329> out<00:01:42.420> by<00:01:42.570> yourself

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
can figure it out by yourself

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.310 
can figure it out by yourself
also<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> chest<00:01:43.860> equivalent<00:01:44.520> might<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:46.079> be

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
also the chest equivalent might just be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.010 
also the chest equivalent might just be
purgatory<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.280> know<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.299> place<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.780> was

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
purgatory you know the place that was

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.569 
purgatory you know the place that was
made<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.860> clean<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.670> sins

made to get clean with your sins

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.380 
made to get clean with your sins
and<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.359> reason<00:01:52.780> Isaac's<00:01:53.170> mom<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.649> trying<00:01:53.890> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and the reason Isaac's mom is trying to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.660 
and the reason Isaac's mom is trying to
you<00:01:55.390> know<00:01:56.130> wait<00:01:57.130> does<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:57.310> mean<00:01:57.640> I

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
you know wait does this mean I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.190 
you know wait does this mean I

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
giving alternative twists to something

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.580 
giving alternative twists to something
my<00:02:06.850> guess<00:02:07.149> is<00:02:07.329> that<00:02:07.450> rebirth<00:02:07.929> will<00:02:08.229> do<00:02:08.440> the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
my guess is that rebirth will do the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.240 
my guess is that rebirth will do the
same

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
same

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.210 
same
there<00:02:09.970> will<00:02:10.090> be<00:02:10.119> new<00:02:10.420> pickups<00:02:11.260> at<00:02:11.650> least<00:02:11.980> one

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
there will be new pickups at least one

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.910 
there will be new pickups at least one
for<00:02:12.459> every<00:02:12.790> calling<00:02:13.239> key<00:02:13.480> bond<00:02:13.900> card<00:02:14.410> all<00:02:14.739> that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
for every calling key bond card all that

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
for every calling key bond card all that
good<00:02:15.099> stuff<00:02:15.129> so<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.299> for<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.660> key

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
good stuff so this is just for the key

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.740 
good stuff so this is just for the key
pickup<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.400> here's<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.730> key<00:02:20.069> prediction<00:02:21.750> that

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
pickup so here's a key prediction that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.220 
pickup so here's a key prediction that
sounds<00:02:23.260> really<00:02:23.590> stupid<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.670> double<00:02:25.299> key<00:02:25.690> pickup

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
sounds really stupid a double key pickup

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.380 
sounds really stupid a double key pickup
kind<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.590> like<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.010> oneplus<00:02:27.640> one<00:02:27.880> free<00:02:28.150> bomb

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
kind of like the oneplus one free bomb

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.620 
kind of like the oneplus one free bomb
thing<00:02:29.260> or<00:02:29.860> maybe<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.190> keychain<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.150> gives

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
thing or maybe a keychain that gives

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.319 
thing or maybe a keychain that gives
multiple<00:02:32.170> keys<00:02:32.880> speaking<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.000> all<00:02:34.120> trade

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
multiple keys speaking of all trade

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.809 
multiple keys speaking of all trade
things<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:35.079> did<00:02:35.349> some<00:02:35.620> rapid<00:02:36.250> guessing<00:02:36.640> for

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
things I did some rapid guessing for

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.550 
things I did some rapid guessing for
beggars<00:02:37.000> here<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.140> picture<00:02:38.440> then<00:02:40.560> yeah

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
beggars here have the picture then yeah

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.410 
beggars here have the picture then yeah
that's<00:02:41.739> enough<00:02:41.950> fucking<00:02:42.310> next<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:43.030> there<00:02:43.299> is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
that's enough fucking next that there is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.479 
that's enough fucking next that there is
a<00:02:43.450> teaser<00:02:43.780> picture<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.500> boss<00:02:44.680> called<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
a teaser picture of a boss called the

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.650 
a teaser picture of a boss called the
haunt<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.239> let<00:02:46.450> me<00:02:46.630> just<00:02:46.840> see<00:02:47.230> here<00:02:47.620> obviously

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
haunt so let me just see here obviously

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.020 
haunt so let me just see here obviously
there's<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.720> Isaac<00:02:50.290> comparison<00:02:51.040> he's

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
there's the Isaac comparison he's

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.059 
there's the Isaac comparison he's
probably<00:02:52.299> some<00:02:52.690> kind<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.140> ghost<00:02:53.500> that

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
probably some kind of ghost that

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.920 
probably some kind of ghost that
surrounded<00:02:54.700> by<00:02:54.849> baby<00:02:55.239> looking<00:02:55.660> things

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
surrounded by baby looking things

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.740 
surrounded by baby looking things
perhaps<00:02:56.829> they<00:02:57.220> are<00:02:57.310> there<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.700> protect<00:02:57.880> him<00:02:58.359> -

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
perhaps they are there to protect him -

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.559 
perhaps they are there to protect him -
halo<00:02:59.049> flies<00:02:59.410> if<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.829> will<00:03:00.010> also<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.030> suggested

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
halo flies if you will also I suggested

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.770 
halo flies if you will also I suggested
by<00:03:01.690> how<00:03:01.870> big<00:03:02.139> he<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.590> he<00:03:03.280> kind<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.299> looks<00:03:04.630> like

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
by how big he is he kind of looks like

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.009 
by how big he is he kind of looks like
the<00:03:05.230> Duke<00:03:05.549> or<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.209> might<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.660> Dukes

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
the Duke or so this might be the Dukes

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.830 
the Duke or so this might be the Dukes
ghost<00:03:08.410> or<00:03:09.250> perhaps<00:03:09.639> he's<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:10.150> an<00:03:10.480> entirely

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
ghost or perhaps he's just an entirely

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.140 
ghost or perhaps he's just an entirely
new<00:03:11.109> monster<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.769> do<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.310> look<00:03:12.519> like<00:03:12.730> divine

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
new monster I do I look like divine

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.949 
new monster I do I look like divine
calendar<00:03:13.690> or<00:03:13.989> Nostradamus<00:03:15.120> yes<00:03:16.120> not<00:03:16.359> next

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
calendar or Nostradamus yes not next

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.590 
calendar or Nostradamus yes not next
recently<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.950> new<00:03:18.100> enemy<00:03:18.459> was<00:03:18.609> teased<00:03:18.910> he<00:03:19.480> is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
recently a new enemy was teased he is

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.949 
recently a new enemy was teased he is
called<00:03:20.010> fatty<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.400> he<00:03:21.670> has<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.819> very<00:03:22.180> gluttony

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
called fatty and he has a very gluttony

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.140 
called fatty and he has a very gluttony
thing<00:03:23.230> going<00:03:23.680> on<00:03:23.799> with<00:03:24.040> him<00:03:24.160> perhaps<00:03:24.760> he's<00:03:25.120> a

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
thing going on with him perhaps he's a

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.330 
thing going on with him perhaps he's a
weak<00:03:25.389> version<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.989> him<00:03:26.230> well<00:03:26.799> that's<00:03:26.980> unlikely

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
weak version of him well that's unlikely

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.580 
weak version of him well that's unlikely
since<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.420> already<00:03:28.599> a<00:03:28.870> weak<00:03:29.139> version<00:03:29.349> of

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
since this is already a weak version of

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.069 
since this is already a weak version of
gluttony<00:03:29.799> but<00:03:30.639> by<00:03:30.790> his<00:03:31.000> bleeding<00:03:31.329> eyes<00:03:31.660> that

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
gluttony but by his bleeding eyes that

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.710 
gluttony but by his bleeding eyes that
can<00:03:32.200> only<00:03:32.349> assume<00:03:32.769> he's<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.130> fat<00:03:33.549> gapper<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.540> my

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
can only assume he's a fat gapper so my

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.539 
can only assume he's a fat gapper so my
guess<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:34.959> by<00:03:35.380> looking<00:03:35.769> at<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:35.980> effects<00:03:36.400> of

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
guess is by looking at the effects of

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.670 
guess is by looking at the effects of
the<00:03:36.940> bucket<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.329> lard<00:03:37.540> he's<00:03:38.139> probably<00:03:38.470> a

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
the bucket of lard he's probably a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.129 
the bucket of lard he's probably a
gapper<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.250> slower<00:03:39.579> but<00:03:39.940> has<00:03:40.180> more<00:03:40.480> HP<00:03:40.599> or<00:03:41.079> I

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
gapper that slower but has more HP or I

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.569 
gapper that slower but has more HP or I
may<00:03:41.680> be<00:03:41.709> way<00:03:42.010> off<00:03:42.040> as<00:03:42.609> stated<00:03:43.329> multiple<00:03:43.720> times

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
may be way off as stated multiple times

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:51.259 
may be way off as stated multiple times
next<00:03:44.999> so<00:03:45.480> um<00:03:46.819> dingo<00:03:48.200> that's<00:03:49.200> up<00:03:49.469> a<00:03:49.790> boss<00:03:50.790> might

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
next so um dingo that's up a boss might

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.300 
next so um dingo that's up a boss might
as<00:03:51.420> well<00:03:51.659> I<00:03:51.870> mean<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.079> mean<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.590> hate<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.040> poop

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
as well I mean I mean we hate the poop

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.250 
as well I mean I mean we hate the poop
as<00:03:53.519> an<00:03:53.700> item<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.389> might<00:03:54.629> as<00:03:54.719> well<00:03:54.840> make<00:03:55.019> him

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
as an item so might as well make him

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.800 
as an item so might as well make him
into<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> monster<00:03:56.069> so<00:03:56.099> we<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:57.239> target<00:03:57.689> our

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
into a monster so we can to target our

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.989 
into a monster so we can to target our
paid<00:03:58.170> at<00:03:58.379> something<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:58.950> can't<00:03:59.310> conclude<00:03:59.700> much

00:03:59.989 --> 00:03:59.999 
paid at something I can't conclude much

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.270 
paid at something I can't conclude much
from<00:04:00.329> looking<00:04:00.719> at<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.049> really<00:04:01.469> my<00:04:01.769> guess<00:04:02.040> is

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
from looking at this really my guess is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.490 
from looking at this really my guess is
it<00:04:02.489> he<00:04:03.120> shits<00:04:03.420> everywhere<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.989> defend<00:04:04.319> himself

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
it he shits everywhere to defend himself

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.580 
it he shits everywhere to defend himself
and<00:04:05.040> just<00:04:05.370> kind<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.939> behaves<00:04:06.689> like<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.959> monster

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
and just kind of behaves like a monster
