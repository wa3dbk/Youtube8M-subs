00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Hello! 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 We believe that all children should be educated 

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.000
 Because education can change lives. 

00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:18.100
 Education can help get rid of poverty 

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:20.100
 Let the children's future be full of hope. 

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.100
 This is our starting point. 

00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:24.100
 Although we are just soft stuffed toys, we work very hard 

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.100
 I hope to help more children go to school. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 However, it may not be enough for us alone. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.200
 Just take the IKEA store and take away any of our stuffed toys. 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.200
 The IKEA Foundation will donate 40 yuan (equivalent to 1 euro) 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.200
 For UNICEF and Save the Children 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.200
 Let us work together to help children's education. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 We are very grateful for your participation and help in the activities of filling toys.
