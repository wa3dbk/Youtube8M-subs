now this gets annoying this is the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.840 
now this gets annoying this is the
little<00:02:14.570> introduction<00:02:15.050> story<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.700> there's<00:02:16.700> no

little introduction story and there's no

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.520 
little introduction story and there's no
way<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.000> skipping<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.780> each<00:02:17.900> time<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.320> do

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
way of skipping this so each time you do

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.430 
way of skipping this so each time you do
find<00:02:18.890> yourself<00:02:18.980> tapping<00:02:19.700> away<00:02:20.170> try<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.290> just

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
find yourself tapping away try and just

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
anywhere you can turn around quite

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.199

quickly by using that button there and

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.660 
quickly by using that button there and
you<00:03:38.209> cannot<00:03:38.480> turn<00:03:38.870> just<00:03:39.140> simply<00:03:39.410> by<00:03:39.670> tilting

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
you cannot turn just simply by tilting

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.190 
you cannot turn just simply by tilting
it<00:03:40.910> has<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.239> be<00:03:41.330> kind<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.600> tilt<00:03:41.840> in<00:03:42.020> that

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
it has to be kind of tilt in that

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.960 
it has to be kind of tilt in that
direction<00:03:42.500> or<00:03:42.709> tilt<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.040> that<00:03:43.160> direction<00:03:43.459> it's

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
direction or tilt in that direction it's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.080 
direction or tilt in that direction it's
a<00:03:44.060> bit<00:03:44.209> tricky<00:03:45.020> and<00:03:46.450> controlling<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.570> is<00:03:49.090> okay

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
a bit tricky and controlling it is okay

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.150 
a bit tricky and controlling it is okay
frankly<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.540> pain<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.870> ass<00:03:51.020> but<00:03:51.400> yeah<00:03:52.690> um

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
frankly a pain in the ass but yeah um

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.470 
frankly a pain in the ass but yeah um
anyway<00:03:55.160> they<00:03:55.310> promised<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> game<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.360> have

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
to pick up different things you go along

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.250 
to pick up different things you go along
it'll<00:03:59.180> totally<00:03:59.360> what<00:03:59.750> you're<00:03:59.870> picking<00:04:00.050> up

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
it'll totally what you're picking up

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260 
it'll totally what you're picking up
from<00:04:00.590> that<00:04:00.800> but<00:04:01.070> about<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.640> bottom<00:04:02.060> left-hand

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
from that but about the bottom left-hand

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.590 
from that but about the bottom left-hand
corner<00:04:02.450> there

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
corner there

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.730 
corner there
tercel<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.840> all<00:04:06.960> things<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.380> pick<00:04:07.560> up

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
tercel and and all things you pick up

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.470 
tercel and and all things you pick up
the<00:04:07.890> larger<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.310> get<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.940> more<00:04:09.060> thing<00:04:09.270> seemed

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
the larger you get the more thing seemed

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.670 
the larger you get the more thing seemed
to<00:04:09.570> pick<00:04:09.690> up<00:04:10.400> but<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.840> incredibly<00:04:13.440> tricky

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
to pick up but it is incredibly tricky

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.330 
to pick up but it is incredibly tricky
because<00:04:13.980> it's<00:04:14.550> so<00:04:14.760> hard<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.750> control<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.440> am<00:04:16.530> as

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
because it's so hard to control I am as

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.650 
because it's so hard to control I am as
i<00:04:17.459> said<00:04:17.670> i've<00:04:17.850> been<00:04:18.000> playing<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.360> for<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.630> a

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
i said i've been playing it for that a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.500 
i said i've been playing it for that a
week<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.170> as<00:04:20.040> of<00:04:20.130> yet<00:04:20.340> or<00:04:20.550> not<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:21.330> know<00:04:21.450> to

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
week and as of yet or not you know to

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.320 
week and as of yet or not you know to
actually<00:04:21.890> get<00:04:22.890> past<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.310> first<00:04:23.550> level<00:04:23.790> even

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
actually get past the first level even

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.620 
actually get past the first level even
so<00:04:30.170> turn<00:04:31.170> turn<00:04:31.820> also<00:04:32.820> if<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:32.940> knock<00:04:33.360> into

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
so turn turn also if you knock into

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.600 
so turn turn also if you knock into
things<00:04:33.870> it'll<00:04:34.650> knock<00:04:34.830> things<00:04:35.040> off<00:04:35.280> your

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
things it'll knock things off your

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.950 
things it'll knock things off your
customary<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:37.020> i<00:04:37.140> will<00:04:37.290> go<00:04:37.410> down

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
customary so just i will go down

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.620 
customary so just i will go down
ultimately<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.110> need<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.350> get<00:04:40.470> through<00:04:41.630> those

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
ultimately you need to get through those

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.150 
ultimately you need to get through those
are<00:04:42.840> swing<00:04:43.140> back<00:04:43.350> there<00:04:43.560> basically<00:04:43.980> you<00:04:44.100> start

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
have not had any luck with this I think

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.220 
have not had any luck with this I think
if<00:06:31.620> you're<00:06:32.220> thinking<00:06:32.640> of<00:06:32.880> getting<00:06:33.030> this<00:06:33.300> wait

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
if you're thinking of getting this wait

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.460 
if you're thinking of getting this wait
I<00:06:35.450> think<00:06:36.450> they<00:06:36.660> need<00:06:36.810> to<00:06:36.900> update<00:06:37.020> it<00:06:37.290> a<00:06:37.350> bit

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
I think they need to update it a bit

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.780 
I think they need to update it a bit
more<00:06:37.650> it<00:06:38.490> feels<00:06:38.700> very<00:06:38.880> rushed<00:06:39.360> and<00:06:40.550> not<00:06:41.550> worth

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
more it feels very rushed and not worth

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.190 
more it feels very rushed and not worth
the<00:06:42.180> price<00:06:42.690> that<00:06:42.750> they<00:06:43.050> put<00:06:43.260> on<00:06:43.380> it<00:06:43.500> just<00:06:43.860> yet

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
the price that they put on it just yet

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.840 
the price that they put on it just yet
