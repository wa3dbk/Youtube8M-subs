00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.009
 wait a while 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.370
 I assume that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 it's not fair to just have a few years 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 I think of it 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.560
 that approach 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.560
 the Netherlands must 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 unfortunately not in you anymore I don't want it new 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.560
 I hear you again in the elevator you want 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.730
 when the leie 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.040
 our struggle is approaching 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 you 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 years 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 the one case 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 got earlier this year 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.860
 well i don't know 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.250
 to let know 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.860
 I know the spring of 2011 will yield a while 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.870
 lost the offices in less than 15 minutes 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:11.620
 To be happy
