follicles<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:22.080> is<00:05:22.590> also<00:05:22.770> significant<00:05:23.580> you

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
follicles that is also significant you

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.970 
follicles that is also significant you
want<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:23.970> make<00:05:24.120> sure<00:05:24.390> that<00:05:24.930> you<00:05:25.080> have<00:05:25.290> a<00:05:25.470> great

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
want to make sure that you have a great

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.360 
want to make sure that you have a great
diet<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.850> want<00:05:27.120> protein<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.440> you<00:05:28.560> want<00:05:28.890> fat

diet you want protein and you want fat
in<00:05:29.550> your<00:05:29.580> diet<00:05:29.700> because<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.720> protein<00:05:31.290> is<00:05:31.770> the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
in your diet because the protein is the

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.000 
in your diet because the protein is the
building<00:05:32.100> block<00:05:32.610> for<00:05:33.120> hair<00:05:33.870> it's<00:05:34.410> because

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
building block for hair it's because

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.510 
building block for hair it's because
hair<00:05:35.250> itself<00:05:35.760> is<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.810> protein<00:05:37.410> its<00:05:37.740> collagen

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
hair itself is a protein its collagen

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.909 
hair itself is a protein its collagen
and<00:05:38.760> I<00:05:39.450> can<00:05:39.780> also<00:05:40.020> tell<00:05:40.410> you<00:05:40.470> from<00:05:40.710> my

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
and I can also tell you from my

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.219 
and I can also tell you from my
experience<00:05:41.300> because<00:05:42.300> we<00:05:42.419> do<00:05:42.540> mineral<00:05:42.930> tissue

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
experience because we do mineral tissue

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.480 
experience because we do mineral tissue
analysis<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:44.280> our<00:05:44.490> practice<00:05:45.120> that<00:05:45.810> I<00:05:45.840> find

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
analysis and our practice that I find

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.950 
analysis and our practice that I find
different<00:05:47.490> levels<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.150> toxicity<00:05:48.720> in

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
different levels of toxicity in

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.530 
different levels of toxicity in
individual's<00:05:49.620> hair<00:05:50.250> it's<00:05:50.760> a<00:05:50.940> it's<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.270> good

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
individual's hair it's a it's a good

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.360 
individual's hair it's a it's a good
tool<00:05:51.930> for<00:05:51.960> us<00:05:52.350> to<00:05:52.500> find<00:05:52.740> out<00:05:52.830> what's<00:05:53.010> going<00:05:53.250> on

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
tool for us to find out what's going on

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.909 
tool for us to find out what's going on
inside<00:05:53.520> of<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.970> body<00:05:54.150> so<00:05:54.900> I<00:05:54.930> know<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.290> hair<00:05:55.620> is

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
inside of the body so I know the hair is

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.980 
inside of the body so I know the hair is
a<00:05:55.950> reservoir<00:05:56.729> of<00:05:56.940> minerals<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.360> if<00:05:57.510> I<00:05:57.660> find

a reservoir of minerals and if I find

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.659 
a reservoir of minerals and if I find

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
when we do mineral tissue analysis

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.300 
when we do mineral tissue analysis
oftentimes<00:06:05.940> we'll<00:06:06.720> find<00:06:07.310> compromised

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
oftentimes we'll find compromised

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.280 
oftentimes we'll find compromised
