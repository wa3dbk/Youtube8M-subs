00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
box even a device is black it's kind of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.270 
box even a device is black it's kind of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
strange micro USB cable on it also might

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.170 
strange micro USB cable on it also might
but<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.119> we<00:01:48.270> also<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.700> micro<00:01:50.700> sim<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
but what we also have is a micro sim to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.450 
but what we also have is a micro sim to
standard<00:01:51.630> sim<00:01:51.930> adapter<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> quite<00:01:53.280> nice

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
standard sim adapter which is quite nice

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
standard sim adapter which is quite nice
it<00:01:53.670> says<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.970> cross<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.270> top<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.840> even<00:01:54.960> have

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
it says a cross on top and you even have

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
it says a cross on top and you even have
a<00:01:55.229> little<00:01:55.439> thing<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.310> double<00:01:56.700> tape

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
double-sided tape in the middle so we

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.530 
double-sided tape in the middle so we
can<00:01:58.680> even<00:01:58.920> use<00:01:58.979> nano<00:01:59.310> SIM<00:01:59.610> actually<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.390> this

inside<00:02:34.520> usually<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.060> course<00:02:35.239> inside<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
inside usually is of course inside the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.479 
inside usually is of course inside the
box<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:35.989> took<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.290> out<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:37.069> has<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.310> think

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
box but I took it out and it has I think

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.360 
box but I took it out and it has I think
2000<00:02:38.330> milliamps<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:39.319> totally<00:02:40.190> fine

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
2000 milliamps so that's totally fine

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.540 
2000 milliamps so that's totally fine
for<00:02:41.110> 55<00:02:42.110> inch<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:42.860> want<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.130> use<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.250> for<00:02:43.400> a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
for 55 inch if you want to use it for a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.530

whole<00:02:43.760> day<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.120> we<00:02:44.239> will<00:02:44.330> check<00:02:44.510> that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
whole day but we will check that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.420 
whole day but we will check that
actually<00:02:44.930> out<00:02:45.050> in<00:02:45.260> our<00:02:45.620> review<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.160> tell<00:02:46.310> you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
how we fairly have a mac phony on the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.840 
how we fairly have a mac phony on the
front<00:02:48.380> their<00:02:48.830> standard<00:02:49.220> android<00:02:49.519> buttons

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
front their standard android buttons

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.479 
front their standard android buttons
here<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.150> bottom<00:02:50.320> which<00:02:51.320> are<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:52.220> course

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
here on the bottom which are of course

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.580 
here on the bottom which are of course
touch<00:02:52.760> on<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.720> top<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.170> map<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.470> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
touch on the top the to map is the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.630 
touch on the top the to map is the
camera<00:02:54.920> three-and-a-half<00:02:55.400> millimeter

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640

headphone<00:02:56.030> port<00:02:56.480> Mike<00:02:56.930> USB<00:02:57.440> right<00:02:57.620> next<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.950> it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
headphone port Mike USB right next to it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.340 
headphone port Mike USB right next to it
so<00:02:58.100> that's<00:02:58.310> also<00:02:58.489> no<00:02:58.700> top<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.180> like<00:02:59.600> that<00:02:59.840> to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
so that's also no top I like that to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.780 
so that's also no top I like that to
have<00:03:00.500> them<00:03:00.650> on<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.830> top<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.250> back<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.670> my

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
here and you can see here and that maybe

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.300 
here and you can see here and that maybe
even<00:04:03.109> in<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.320> future<00:04:03.650> there<00:04:03.799> will<00:04:03.829> be<00:04:04.220> an

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
even in the future there will be an

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.710 
even in the future there will be an
extra<00:04:04.489> antenna<00:04:04.910> here<00:04:05.030> on<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.239> bottom<00:04:05.359> or

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
extra antenna here on the bottom or

extra antenna here on the bottom or
anything<00:04:06.440> like<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.680> is<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.730> looks<00:04:07.760> quite

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
anything like that is it looks quite

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.580 
anything like that is it looks quite
interesting<00:04:08.570> so<00:04:08.690> we'll<00:04:08.810> just<00:04:08.989> put<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.470> back

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
interesting so we'll just put it back

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.500 
interesting so we'll just put it back
together<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.130> let's<00:04:10.310> see<00:04:10.489> them<00:04:10.880> how<00:04:11.269> it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
together and let's see them how it

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.349 
together and let's see them how it
compares<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.260> samsung<00:04:12.620> galaxy<00:04:13.090> s4<00:04:14.090> and

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
compares to the samsung galaxy s4 and

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.599 
compares to the samsung galaxy s4 and
apple<00:04:14.720> iphone<00:04:15.049> 5<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.530> 2<00:04:15.739> sony<00:04:15.980> device<00:04:16.370> but

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
apple iphone 5 and 2 sony device but

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.199 
apple iphone 5 and 2 sony device but
first<00:04:16.880> let's<00:04:17.600> just<00:04:17.690> start<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.229> camera<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:20.090> the

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
first let's just start the camera so the

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.000 
first let's just start the camera so the
camera<00:04:20.510> should<00:04:20.690> be<00:04:20.750> in<00:04:21.019> back<00:04:21.260> camera<00:04:21.560> mode<00:04:21.739> oh

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
camera should be in back camera mode oh

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.620 
camera should be in back camera mode oh
no<00:04:22.310> attacks<00:04:22.700> in<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.880> front<00:04:23.120> camera<00:04:23.240> mode<00:04:23.510> so

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
no attacks in the front camera mode so

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.470 
no attacks in the front camera mode so
you<00:04:23.659> can<00:04:23.810> see<00:04:23.990> that

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
you can see that

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.020 
you can see that
to<00:04:24.780> my<00:04:24.900> pistol<00:04:25.260> on<00:04:25.380> camera<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:25.890> not<00:04:25.920> that<00:04:26.550> fast

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
to my pistol on camera is not that fast

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.760 
to my pistol on camera is not that fast
actually<00:04:27.390> but<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:28.080> course<00:04:28.260> fast<00:04:28.530> enough

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
actually but it's of course fast enough

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.580 
actually but it's of course fast enough
for<00:04:28.950> shooting<00:04:29.520> any<00:04:29.700> thing<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.480> want<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:31.110> think

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
for shooting any thing you want I think

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.010 
for shooting any thing you want I think
but<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.070> quality<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.490> quite<00:04:32.810> good<00:04:33.810> because

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
but the quality is quite good because

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.960 
but the quality is quite good because
it's<00:04:34.380> really<00:04:34.620> sharp<00:04:34.890> again<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.610> same<00:04:35.790> thing

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
it's really sharp again the same thing

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.370 
it's really sharp again the same thing
here<00:04:36.090> with<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> back<00:04:36.450> camera<00:04:36.660> but<00:04:36.930> thats<00:04:37.170> a

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
here with the back camera but thats a

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.830 
here with the back camera but thats a
lot<00:04:37.740> smoother<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.940> can<00:04:39.120> really<00:04:39.390> shoot

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
lot smoother and you can really shoot

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.870 
lot smoother and you can really shoot
your<00:04:40.080> nice<00:04:40.230> videos<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.860> pictures<00:04:41.040> of<00:04:41.640> course

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
it's not too bright but bright enough I

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.040 
it's not too bright but bright enough I
would<00:05:14.460> say<00:05:14.700> right<00:05:14.880> now<00:05:15.060> if<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.720> sound<00:05:15.930> would

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
would say right now if the sound would

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.810 
would say right now if the sound would
be<00:05:16.290> shining<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.800> wouldn't<00:05:17.070> be<00:05:17.190> perfect<00:05:17.670> i

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
be shining it wouldn't be perfect i

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.880 
be shining it wouldn't be perfect i
think<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:18.960> working<00:05:19.200> quite<00:05:19.500> smoothly

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
think but it is working quite smoothly

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.830 
think but it is working quite smoothly
right<00:05:20.190> now<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.640> it<00:05:21.150> just<00:05:21.180> looks<00:05:21.630> actually

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
right now and it just looks actually

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.890 
right now and it just looks actually
fine<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:22.530> it's<00:05:22.920> also<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.460> fitting<00:05:24.210> my<00:05:24.480> hand<00:05:24.750> i

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
fine and it's also and fitting my hand i

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.090 
fine and it's also and fitting my hand i
stay<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.200> does<00:05:25.290> it<00:05:25.320> fit<00:05:25.590> better<00:05:25.620> than<00:05:26.070> a

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
stay but does it fit better than a

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.920 
stay but does it fit better than a
samsung<00:05:26.520> galaxy<00:05:26.550> s4<00:05:27.300> so<00:05:27.450> let's<00:05:27.600> just<00:05:27.780> check

here<00:06:36.790> also<00:06:36.970> the<00:06:37.660> Sony<00:06:37.960> is<00:06:38.230> a<00:06:38.290> little<00:06:38.680> bit

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
here also the Sony is a little bit

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.680 
here also the Sony is a little bit
thicker<00:06:38.980> I<00:06:39.130> would<00:06:39.400> say<00:06:39.550> but<00:06:39.610> maybe<00:06:39.880> even<00:06:40.180> the

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
thicker I would say but maybe even the

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.690 
thicker I would say but maybe even the
same<00:06:40.960> I'm<00:06:41.200> not<00:06:41.350> sure<00:06:41.560> archos<00:06:42.070> has<00:06:42.220> this<00:06:42.460> nice

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
same I'm not sure archos has this nice

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.510 
same I'm not sure archos has this nice
little<00:06:42.880> wedge<00:06:43.270> feeling<00:06:44.260> around<00:06:44.830> it<00:06:45.040> so<00:06:45.220> let's

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
little wedge feeling around it so let's

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.150 
little wedge feeling around it so let's
make<00:06:46.270> it<00:06:46.300> makes<00:06:46.660> it<00:06:46.810> look<00:06:46.990> and<00:06:47.230> feel<00:06:47.740> better<00:06:47.890> in

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
make it makes it look and feel better in

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.530 
make it makes it look and feel better in
your<00:06:48.190> hand<00:06:48.550> so<00:06:48.730> for<00:06:48.940> example<00:06:49.000> here<00:06:49.300> in<00:06:49.450> the

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
your hand so for example here in the

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.910 
your hand so for example here in the
bottom<00:06:49.660> corner<00:06:49.840> it<00:06:50.200> actually<00:06:50.530> feels<00:06:50.680> quite

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:50.920 
bottom corner it actually feels quite

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.430 
bottom corner it actually feels quite
nice<00:06:51.160> and<00:06:51.520> I<00:06:51.730> think<00:06:51.790> for<00:06:52.390> 200<00:06:52.780> bucks<00:06:52.990> is<00:06:53.140> a

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
nice and I think for 200 bucks is a

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.530 
nice and I think for 200 bucks is a
quite<00:06:53.920> good<00:06:54.160> starting<00:06:54.700> up<00:06:54.820> phone<00:06:55.090> it's<00:06:55.480> a

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
quite good starting up phone it's a

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.150 
quite good starting up phone it's a
little<00:06:55.630> bit<00:06:55.750> like<00:06:55.990> a<00:06:56.020> nexus<00:06:56.500> you<00:06:56.620> could<00:06:56.770> say<00:06:56.950> I

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
little bit like a nexus you could say I

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.650 
little bit like a nexus you could say I
would<00:06:57.550> say<00:06:57.730> actually<00:06:57.910> but<00:06:58.300> I<00:06:58.330> don't<00:06:58.540> have<00:06:58.630> a

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
would say actually but I don't have a

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.240 
would say actually but I don't have a
nexus<00:06:58.930> of<00:06:59.110> all<00:06:59.350> right<00:06:59.500> here<00:06:59.680> right<00:06:59.860> now<00:06:59.890> and

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
nexus of all right here right now and

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.340 
nexus of all right here right now and
but<00:07:01.090> if<00:07:01.330> you<00:07:01.420> don't<00:07:01.600> want<00:07:01.810> the<00:07:01.840> next<00:07:02.080> source<00:07:02.230> is

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
but if you don't want the next source is

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.510 
but if you don't want the next source is
actually<00:07:02.710> quite<00:07:02.800> nice<00:07:03.070> but<00:07:03.310> i<00:07:03.370> would

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
actually quite nice but i would

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.400 
actually quite nice but i would
recommend<00:07:03.910> the<00:07:04.000> case<00:07:04.180> since<00:07:04.450> this<00:07:04.900> glossy

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
recommend the case since this glossy

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.040 
recommend the case since this glossy
black<00:07:05.770> eye<00:07:06.070> back<00:07:06.520> cover<00:07:06.850> is<00:07:06.970> not<00:07:07.570> perfect<00:07:07.990> i

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
black eye back cover is not perfect i

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.570 
black eye back cover is not perfect i
think<00:07:08.290> to<00:07:08.380> just<00:07:08.530> put<00:07:08.770> around<00:07:08.950> anywhere<00:07:09.370> and

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
think to just put around anywhere and

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.640 
think to just put around anywhere and
the<00:07:10.000> camera<00:07:10.270> needs<00:07:10.450> some<00:07:11.110> protection<00:07:11.530> maybe

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
the camera needs some protection maybe

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.320 
the camera needs some protection maybe
also<00:07:11.890> since<00:07:12.190> it's<00:07:12.370> sticking<00:07:12.610> out<00:07:13.030> a<00:07:13.090> little

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
also since it's sticking out a little

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.940 
also since it's sticking out a little
bit<00:07:13.600> as<00:07:13.780> you<00:07:13.900> can<00:07:14.050> see<00:07:14.230> so<00:07:14.440> i<00:07:14.470> think<00:07:14.590> much<00:07:14.770> much

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
bit as you can see so i think much much

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.950 
bit as you can see so i think much much
