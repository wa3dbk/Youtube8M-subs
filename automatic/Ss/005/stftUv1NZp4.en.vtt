00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.240
 I want a very special thing 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.769
 in addition, the explanation why z 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.450
 meal across the complex conjugated 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 so charged simultaneously amount Z is HOCH 2 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 again briefly you have 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.990
 a complex number consisting of real 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:28.019
 time so much unit to the right + b 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.429
 imaginary part of mali so many units 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.750
 up 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.550
 but here z and each the complex 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.550
 corrected number to z has always the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
 Same real time only then accordingly 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 not always the earth part plus after 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.730
 above but - down exactly the same 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.940
 So you can already use it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.980
 Tips make each complex conjugate 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
 number is always mirrored at the moment 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 Reception should now be the proportion 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.329
 I would be negative in each case 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.850
 this same picture just on the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.239
 quotes left side so 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.610
 I would just go - as realtime 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 then + p to the top once z 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.250
 and then the same unit down 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.939
 would cross is now but only here for 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.400
 at a view if I am now 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:26.220
 would multiply both in detail h 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:34.170
 + bxtxh - wx times mali amalia 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:37.710
 quadrat.at would be - abi plus bettina would be 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.960
 plus abi i can because of that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 multiplication yes according to the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.509
 change order plus x - is - bx 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.579
 bsb square him ali is iquadrat and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.840
 here should be clarified 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.560
 iquadrat is - 1 so - um - e-plus the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.850
 both stay up 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.140
 square + b square comes out if it is 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 however , make equality signs 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.720
 if i use the complex number with the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.849
 complex conjugate number multiply 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.910
 and you should know that mix 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.860
 arrive again 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.550
 that can be clearly seen as a vector 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.190
 down here is the real time here 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.810
 the imaginary part z the length of the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.870
 distance from the complex number to 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.900
 origin is nothing else than after 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.420
 pythagoras that is also clarified 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.530
 square + b square simultaneously square 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.200
 I can say that the complex number x 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.930
 the complex conjugate number is currently 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.060
 is equal to two too high now 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.480
 Can you talk about it a bit if you can 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.100
 the multiplication has spoken itself 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.770
 I wonder what if I am to 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:03.640
 For example, I just take it real 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.480
 part one plus ii complex conjugated 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.780
 number would be 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:12.190
 1 - the imaginary part would be 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.860
 I do not have one now 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.350
 but it should be clear what 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.150
 You would know now if I did 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.130
 the two multiply because yes 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.470
 Immediately it comes that should come out 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.250
 amount z high two how much is the amount 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.100
 from Z 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:37.720
 He would be root of 1 square +1 square 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:40.720
 is equal root from two root 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.320
 Two would be the amount of the complex 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.570
 number with or rather with yourself 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.330
 itself multiplied or high 2 would be 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.700
 so z amount up two equal to two us 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.060
 So if you know the multiplication 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.050
 These two pay the complex numbers 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.920
 with 1 + 1 xx of the complex conjugate 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.150
 number to z he gives two there are questions 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.650
 because a lot of this I have that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.590
 is only a real number if you 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.870
 you think again about a complex number 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:17.650
 is real part + b x share more and more 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.180
 we have two as a real number then 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.470
 Remains +0 mali so we have as 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.110
 imaginary part 0 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.800
 could now make clear 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.840
 that would be z1 plus now 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:38.740
 once this would be 1 - 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.880
 once multiplication comes though 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.250
 that would be 12 corresponding to that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.780
 Here are where you then again in 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.210
 the deep can think about it 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.550
 what happens when multiplying 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.610
 happens with the angles what happens 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.320
 with the length corresponding to that one can 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.630
 so a bit to derive here 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.280
 as I said about this story 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.460
 that can be an important vocabulary 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.460
 his
