00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello friends with you without fan 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.379
 Today I changed a little bit not location 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.620
 I want you to constantly strain one and 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.150
 same background and so try 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 original and today to visit us 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.470
 someone who came for a highscreen alpha tablet 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.550
 tab 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.550
 Well, we drove 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.860
 general highscreen company 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.140
 position it like a tablet but 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.100
 such devices are also called 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.360
 me tablet 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.200
 because they have a ringer function 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.900
 Reception with MS 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.350
 Well, in short everything that you can do 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.510
 ordinary phone cost is 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:53.520
 about 8 thousand rubles, he began 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:56.590
 sold from 2014 at the end of January 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.110
 here is such a box by the way very 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.050
 decently so the box weighs the most important 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.130
 so what would I like to surprise you 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.700
 It seems like an ordinary 8 inch tablet is not from 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.350
 China, I order China 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.350
 I like highscreen at all 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.360
 the fact that they like to do unusual tala 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.210
 out with some chip but you are all 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.380
 well remember highscreen boost 2 there 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.430
 highscreen alpha r 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.610
 that is, they have two batteries in which 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.420
 capacity there is about 6000 milliamps 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.390
 hours well shorter high capacity therefore 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.700
 pleasantly surprised by this phone 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.140
 tabletphone let's call it that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.420
 3600 milliampere hours they are not here 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.760
 wanted to surprise the battery 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.280
 This tablet wants to surprise us with what 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.299
 he is not like everyone else 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.670
 permission now I will explain to you in what 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.659
 is this the essence look 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:05.049
 8 inch screen and tablet but resolution 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:13.200
 it is not like ordinary tablets 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:13.200
 I can't open the rain 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.380
 and so the resolution is not as we used to 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.810
 conventional tablets there 1024 768 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.239
 highscreen company managed to do 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.300
 this tablet resolution is exactly the same 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:41.530
 like the phone either full hd and either go 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:44.480
 on this tablet hd 1280 resolution on 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.690
 720 as they explain 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.120
 The purpose of this resolution is mainly 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.830
 8-inch tablet and not comfortable to hold in 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.410
 hand that is, they are about one hundred and forty five 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.370
 one hundred and fifty five centimeters that is 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.930
 its width and it turns out there is no 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.709
 width is obtained in length is not in width 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.120
 Yes everything is correct 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.140
 about a hundred and forty five centimeters before and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.150
 accordingly, they are not very convenient 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.590
 keep well as it is a tablet with it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.019
 you also need to talk 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.209
 so too freak will be so 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.440
 say yes it looks and therefore 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.390
 highscreen decided to make it easier they 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.180
 aspect ratios made 16 by 9 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.530
 that is, not four to three but 16 to 9 with 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.299
 this saving eight-inch display so 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.540
 let's turn it on because something i'm 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:48.250
 I started talking hope so it turns on 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.250
 or here you turn on here went the smell 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.780
 so well it 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.519
 characteristics let me go while 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.659
 launch i will introduce you to his 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.220
 characteristics 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:02.830
 as for the characteristics here 81 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.170
 In. I already told you the tft matrix 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.870
 here it seems to me they lost it 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.290
 seriously let it cost thousands 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.620
 one and a half thousand rubles more expensive but at the same time 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.109
 would stand 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.750
 fps because I donâ€™t know all the same 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:23.770
 tft matrix day past headphones 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.330
 like branded let's check it out and 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:36.010
 what else do we have here 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:43.889
 charger and and unnecessarily to the usual well everything is in 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:43.889
 principle warranty cards more 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.850
 there is nothing else 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.820
 we remove this aside I will continue 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.710
 3600 milliampere hours 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:59.620
 Battery processor Tekei 83 89 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.940
 quad-core running on frequency 1 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:08.260
 2 gigahertz and powervr video accelerator 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:10.960
 sgx 544 one gigabyte of RAM and 8 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.590
 gigabyte flash drive it's us 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.590
 skipping 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.419
 somewhere, too, well, we donâ€™t need it at all 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.700
 all settings of the dropped tablet and 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:38.560
 so you have to re-expose everything 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:41.020
 and operating system android 4 2 1 here 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.060
 so we just let the brightness of the stakes 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:48.040
 started talking about his tft matrix what is it 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.900
 uncomfortable let me take a look and 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:55.450
 I'll tell you, well, and you just see 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:06:00.270
 unscrew the brightness to maximum to 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.270
 ipad max look at angles 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.440
 Well, right away, yes, now I understand 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.430
 what is tft here 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.110
 and this is not a typo here 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.660
 angles especially fade to the top 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.430
 take a picture very seriously now 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.110
 There may be some in the gallery 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.860
 pictures though i doubt 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:26.820
 no pictures let's see then 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.820
 listen to some sound 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:45.099
 Well, no, that's melodies, we need melodies 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:49.319
 here they are so this is the maximum speaker we have 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:53.580
 is the speaker is at our bottom 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.580
 but evaluate friends 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.080
 well, leave 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:07.210
 and test the camera because here 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:13.500
 rear camera 5 megapixels probably 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:13.500
 I was told I will try macro photography 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.310
 let's see here are more exchanged and 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:26.980
 I took a close picture of the principle 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:31.230
 good image in the review in full 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:34.030

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.990

 send the beginning of such a top channel 

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.890
 I 'm still a second-rate channel so 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.050
 Ivan Dear viewers lucky we are with you

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:54.570
 his budget price 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.080
 but the characteristics are impressive 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.990
