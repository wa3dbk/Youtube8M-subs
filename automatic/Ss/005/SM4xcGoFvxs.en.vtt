so<00:00:06.180> there<00:00:06.330> are<00:00:06.390> several<00:00:06.680> suprahyoid<00:00:07.680> muscles

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
so there are several suprahyoid muscles

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.040 
so there are several suprahyoid muscles
that<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.610> need<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.849> be<00:00:08.940> able<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.150> identify<00:00:09.360> in

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
that you need to be able to identify in

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.780 
that you need to be able to identify in
the<00:00:10.200> laboratory<00:00:11.389> they<00:00:12.389> end<00:00:12.540> up<00:00:12.630> being<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
the laboratory they end up being the

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.029 
the laboratory they end up being the
digastric<00:00:14.790> muscle<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.990> posterior<00:00:16.529> belly<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
genial hyoid and the mylohyoid we're

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.019 
genial hyoid and the mylohyoid we're
going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> discuss<00:00:28.859> their<00:00:29.130> attachment<00:00:29.670> points

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
going to discuss their attachment points

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.270 
going to discuss their attachment points
and<00:00:31.520> their<00:00:32.989> innervation<00:00:34.280> essentially

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and their innervation essentially

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.360 
and their innervation essentially
they're<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.640> responsible<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:36.690> way<00:00:37.050> for

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
they're all responsible in some way for

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.200 
they're all responsible in some way for
raising<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.850> hyoid<00:00:39.059> bone<00:00:40.160> okay<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> first

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
raising the hyoid bone okay so the first

another<00:01:28.650> example<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> answer

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
another example of what the answer

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.020 
another example of what the answer
believe<00:01:31.320> digastric<00:01:31.650> looks<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:35.030> we

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
believe digastric looks like so here we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.249 
believe digastric looks like so here we
have<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> posterior<00:01:36.840> belly<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
have the posterior belly of the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.859 
have the posterior belly of the
digastric<00:01:40.490> going<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.790> truly<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> common

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
digastric going and truly at the common

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.350 
digastric going and truly at the common
tendon<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> loops<00:01:44.640> around<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
tendon and then it loops around and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.139 
tendon and then it loops around and
becomes<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:49.729> anterior<00:01:50.729> belly<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
becomes the anterior belly of the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.200 
becomes the anterior belly of the
digastric<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:52.130> where<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.280> inserts<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
digastric here where it inserts into the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.609 
digastric here where it inserts into the
digastric<00:01:54.869> fossa<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.369> underside<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
digastric fossa on the underside of the

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.760 
digastric fossa on the underside of the
mandible<00:01:59.450> innervated<00:02:00.450> by<00:02:00.479> v3

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.740 

next<00:02:05.770> we<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.350> stylohyoid<00:02:08.399> muscle<00:02:09.750> which

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
next we have the stylohyoid muscle which

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.130 
next we have the stylohyoid muscle which
originates<00:02:11.260> from<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.650> styloid<00:02:12.370> process

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
originates from the styloid process

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.190 
originates from the styloid process
steadily<00:02:14.140> process<00:02:14.560> being<00:02:14.740> right<00:02:14.980> here<00:02:16.200> this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
steadily process being right here this

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.320 
steadily process being right here this
muscle<00:02:17.620> fiber<00:02:17.800> actually<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.700> usually<00:02:19.090> pinned

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
muscle fiber actually is usually pinned

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.770 
muscle fiber actually is usually pinned
down<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.110> will<00:02:21.100> come<00:02:21.340> down<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.880> it

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
down like this and will come down and it

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.890 
down like this and will come down and it
forks<00:02:23.320> over<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:24.450> intermediate<00:02:25.450> tender<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
forks over the intermediate tender the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.100 
forks over the intermediate tender the
common<00:02:26.290> tendon<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.980> digastric<00:02:27.160> and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
common tendon of the digastric and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.760 
common tendon of the digastric and
pushes<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.370> hyoid<00:02:30.670> bone<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.650> if

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
pushes that on to the hyoid bone and if

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.380 
pushes that on to the hyoid bone and if
you<00:02:32.860> can<00:02:32.980> feel<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.550> hyoid<00:02:33.700> bone<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
you can feel for the hyoid bone the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.900 
you can feel for the hyoid bone the
hyoid<00:02:34.720> bone<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:34.959> actually<00:02:35.500> right<00:02:35.740> here<00:02:36.070> so

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
hyoid bone is actually right here so

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.370 
hyoid bone is actually right here so
we'll<00:02:37.030> be<00:02:37.150> coming<00:02:37.480> down<00:02:37.570> right<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
we'll be coming down right on to the

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.240 
the superior surface of the hyoid bone
and<00:06:32.530> then<00:06:33.530> the<00:06:33.710> inferior<00:06:34.490> constrictor<00:06:36.250> will

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
and then the inferior constrictor will

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.420 
and then the inferior constrictor will
originate<00:06:37.430> from<00:06:37.790> the<00:06:38.030> pharyngeal<00:06:38.540> Rifai<00:06:39.110> and

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
originate from the pharyngeal Rifai and

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.150 
originate from the pharyngeal Rifai and
insert<00:06:40.430> into<00:06:40.670> the<00:06:41.140> oblique<00:06:42.140> line<00:06:42.440> of<00:06:42.710> the

insert into the oblique line of the

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.680 
insert into the oblique line of the
thyroid<00:06:43.580> cartilage<00:06:45.940> which<00:06:46.940> is<00:06:46.970> this<00:06:47.450> being

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
thyroid cartilage which is this being

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.810 
thyroid cartilage which is this being
the<00:06:47.810> thyroid<00:06:48.140> cartilage<00:06:48.530> right<00:06:48.680> here<00:06:48.890> okay

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
the thyroid cartilage right here okay

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.120 
the thyroid cartilage right here okay
and<00:06:50.030> so<00:06:50.750> what<00:06:50.990> it<00:06:51.080> does<00:06:51.260> is<00:06:51.500> it<00:06:51.620> creates<00:06:51.740> this

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
and so what it does is it creates this

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.080 
and so what it does is it creates this
open<00:06:53.060> area<00:06:54.020> within<00:06:54.680> the<00:06:54.890> pharynx<00:06:55.280> at<00:06:55.490> the

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
open area within the pharynx at the

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.150 
open area within the pharynx at the
level<00:06:56.390> of<00:06:56.450> c6<00:06:56.930> that<00:06:57.140> closes<00:06:57.530> off<00:06:57.680> and<00:06:58.010> it

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
level of c6 that closes off and it

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.700 
level of c6 that closes off and it
becomes<00:06:58.250> the<00:06:58.670> esophagus<00:07:02.350> also<00:07:03.350> worth<00:07:03.530> noting

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
becomes the esophagus also worth noting

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.230 
becomes the esophagus also worth noting
something<00:07:04.130> that<00:07:04.400> I<00:07:04.430> didn't<00:07:04.730> bring<00:07:04.820> up<00:07:05.000> to<00:07:05.180> you

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
something that I didn't bring up to you

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.720 
something that I didn't bring up to you
before<00:07:05.650> but<00:07:06.650> a<00:07:06.710> muscle<00:07:07.160> that<00:07:07.250> I<00:07:07.310> would<00:07:07.490> like<00:07:07.610> to

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:07.730 
before but a muscle that I would like to

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:15.010

show you is this muscle here which also
I'm<00:07:15.470> bringing<00:07:15.800> it<00:07:15.890> up<00:07:16.010> because<00:07:16.240> I<00:07:17.240> just<00:07:18.140> talked

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.320 
I'm bringing it up because I just talked

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.250 
I'm bringing it up because I just talked

about the tear go mandibular Rafa and

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.870 
about the tear go mandibular Rafa and
you're<00:07:21.710> going<00:07:21.830> to<00:07:21.860> have<00:07:22.100> the<00:07:22.340> tear<00:07:22.730> go

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
you're going to have the tear go

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.720 
you're going to have the tear go
mandibular<00:07:23.330> Rafi<00:07:23.840> where<00:07:24.140> the<00:07:24.730> superior
