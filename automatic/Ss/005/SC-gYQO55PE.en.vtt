00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
little proton one here you can see this

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.400 
little proton one here you can see this
is<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> full<00:00:53.430> retail<00:00:53.760> box<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.270> practice<00:00:54.750> will

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
is a full retail box with practice will

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.189 
is a full retail box with practice will
retail<00:00:55.739> box<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.160> nitron<00:00:56.930> will<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:57.989> getting

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
retail box with nitron will be getting

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
retail box with nitron will be getting
into<00:00:58.379> those<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> minute<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.129> check<00:00:59.579> out<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
into those a minute but check out the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.030 
into those a minute but check out the
proton<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:03.320> there<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> equipment

Krakens whisper easy
a<00:01:40.280> little<00:01:41.280> bit<00:01:41.400> more<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.690> feels

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
a little bit more this is it feels

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.300 
a little bit more this is it feels
pretty<00:01:48.930> nice<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.860> where<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> disks<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.270> in

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
pretty nice to see where the disks go in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.300 
pretty nice to see where the disks go in
holds<00:01:56.310> pretty<00:01:56.520> simple<00:01:57.150> pretty<00:01:57.360> nicely<00:01:57.630> and

kind of grab on to it and ya lookin for
a<00:02:03.450> look<00:02:03.690> for<00:02:03.870> a<00:02:03.900> little<00:02:04.730> little<00:02:05.730> guns<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
a look for a little little guns is this

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.070 
a look for a little little guns is this
is<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.320> bad<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> let's<00:02:09.360> check<00:02:09.540> out<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
is not bad at all so let's check out the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.150 
is not bad at all so let's check out the
controversy<00:02:10.950> right<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:12.000> these<00:02:12.420> are<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
controversy right here these are the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.300 
controversy right here these are the
brand<00:02:14.160> new<00:02:14.370> discs<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:16.980> they<00:02:17.100> look<00:02:17.280> like

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
brand new discs so what they look like

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.949 
brand new discs so what they look like
they're<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:18.530> wait<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.740> like<00:02:19.920> they're<00:02:20.400> kind<00:02:20.459> of

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
they're on wait for like they're kind of

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.080 
they're on wait for like they're kind of
pretty<00:02:21.959> light<00:02:23.180> it's<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.560> soft<00:02:25.560> foamy<00:02:26.490> kind

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
pretty light it's like a soft foamy kind

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.340 
pretty light it's like a soft foamy kind
of<00:02:27.209> outside<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.959> them<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:29.570> little<00:02:30.570> opening<00:02:30.840> on

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
of outside to them a little opening on

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.610 
of outside to them a little opening on
the<00:02:31.470> bottom<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.100> little<00:02:32.700> aerodynamics<00:02:33.620> it's

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the bottom a little aerodynamics it's

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.810 
the bottom a little aerodynamics it's
almost<00:02:34.800> like<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> little<00:02:36.410> mini<00:02:37.410> soft<00:02:38.100> frisbee<00:02:38.790> I

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
almost like a little mini soft frisbee I

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.490 
almost like a little mini soft frisbee I
guess<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.330> sorts<00:02:39.660> um<00:02:41.720> yeah<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.110> this

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
guess of sorts um yeah this is it this

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.070 
guess of sorts um yeah this is it this
is<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.830> new<00:02:44.480> nerf<00:02:45.480> vortex<00:02:45.930> proton<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:48.080> can't

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
is the new nerf vortex proton and can't

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110 
is the new nerf vortex proton and can't
wait<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> give<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.470> shot<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.980> check<00:02:50.850> out<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
wait to give it a shot so check out the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880 
wait to give it a shot so check out the
next<00:02:51.209> video<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.810> we'll<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.530> looking<00:02:52.650> at<00:02:52.860> the
