this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.969> exercise<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.450> was

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
this is a little exercise that was

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.830 
this is a little exercise that was
something<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.879> picked<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.360> listening<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
something that I picked up listening to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
something that I picked up listening to
Buddy<00:00:43.140> Rich<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.890> don't<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.579> whether<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
Buddy Rich I don't know whether the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.549 
Buddy Rich I don't know whether the
stickings<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.750> exactly<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> same<00:00:46.320> whether

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
stickings are exactly the same whether

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.950 
stickings are exactly the same whether
he<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.160> using<00:00:47.370> single<00:00:48.000> notes<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.450> doubles<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
he was using single notes or doubles of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
he was using single notes or doubles of
what<00:00:49.079> he<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.350> using<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.309> was<00:00:50.430> usually

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
what he was using because it was usually

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.819 
what he was using because it was usually
too<00:00:50.940> fast<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.449> understand<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> was

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
too fast to understand but this was

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.350 
too fast to understand but this was
something<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.399> gleaned<00:00:53.730> from<00:00:53.910> listening

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
something that I gleaned from listening

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
something that I gleaned from listening
to<00:00:54.420> those<00:00:54.719> records<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.829> many<00:00:55.980> years<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to those records for so many years as a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
to those records for so many years as a
young<00:00:56.730> player
