round<00:05:53.060> is<00:05:53.240> not<00:05:53.419> as<00:05:53.600> difficult<00:05:53.630> than<00:05:54.140> it<00:05:54.169> was

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410

last<00:05:54.440> year<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:54.950> still<00:05:55.220> think<00:05:55.400> that<00:05:55.460> we<00:05:55.640> were

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
last year I still think that we were

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.130 
last year I still think that we were
probably<00:05:55.940> going<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.270> finish<00:05:56.419> in<00:05:56.720> last<00:05:56.900> place

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
probably going to finish in last place

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.140 
probably going to finish in last place
maybe<00:05:57.470> third<00:05:57.800> place<00:05:58.040> I<00:05:58.280> think<00:05:58.580> that<00:05:58.910> we<00:05:59.000> might

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
maybe third place I think that we might

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.670 
maybe third place I think that we might
be<00:05:59.330> able<00:05:59.479> to<00:05:59.630> draw<00:05:59.960> maybe<00:06:00.229> even<00:06:00.440> beat<00:06:00.650> the

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
be able to draw maybe even beat the

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.640 
be able to draw maybe even beat the

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.010 
Dynamo the other thing I'm off but other
than<00:06:03.770> that<00:06:03.950> I<00:06:04.400> don't<00:06:04.430> think<00:06:04.850> that<00:06:04.880> I<00:06:05.510> think

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020
