00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
consider teaching them you know I think

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.880 
consider teaching them you know I think
I<00:02:02.970> think<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> understand

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I think that you have to understand

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.249 
I think that you have to understand
something<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.430> idea<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:06.240> funding<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.720> losses

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
something the idea of funding the losses

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.300 
something the idea of funding the losses
was<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.840> buy<00:02:09.989> time<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.560> find<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:10.890> whether<00:02:11.069> we

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
was to buy time to find out whether we

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.040 
was to buy time to find out whether we
could<00:02:11.520> build<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.180> building<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.569> keep<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> team

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
could build a building to keep the team

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.940 
could build a building to keep the team
here<00:02:13.200> long<00:02:13.410> term

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

on<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.550> basis<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.270> was<00:02:15.390> probably<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.750> wise

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
on that basis it was probably a wise

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.479 
on that basis it was probably a wise
investment<00:02:15.959> for<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.770> government<00:02:17.190> because

investment for the government because

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.740 
investment for the government because

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.790 
think that the first question is is
there<00:04:17.570> enough<00:04:17.750> money<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:18.170> build<00:04:18.320> building

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 
there enough money to build building

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.680 
there enough money to build building
that's<00:04:19.550> the<00:04:19.670> first<00:04:19.880> question<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.390> second

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
that's the first question the second

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.360 
that's the first question the second
question<00:04:21.080> is<00:04:21.230> I<00:04:21.440> don't<00:04:21.739> know<00:04:21.950> whether<00:04:22.160> my

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
purely business transaction yes the NHL

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.230 
purely business transaction yes the NHL
is<00:06:03.590> too<00:06:03.710> big<00:06:03.860> for<00:06:03.890> Winnipeg<00:06:04.310> and<00:06:04.940> I<00:06:05.030> think

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
is too big for Winnipeg and I think

is too big for Winnipeg and I think

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480
