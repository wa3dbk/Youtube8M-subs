simple<00:00:25.910> major<00:00:26.240> scales<00:00:26.600> if<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:28.490> harmonic

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
simple major scales if so the harmonic

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.940 
simple major scales if so the harmonic
minor<00:00:29.420> scale<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:30.020> one<00:00:30.140> of<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.320> most<00:00:30.560> unique

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
minor scale is one of the most unique

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.160 
minor scale is one of the most unique
sounding<00:00:31.369> scales<00:00:31.640> out<00:00:31.850> there<00:00:32.119> it's<00:00:32.810> using

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
sounding scales out there it's using

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.940 
sounding scales out there it's using
metal<00:00:33.560> fusion<00:00:34.250> Latin<00:00:35.180> Spanish<00:00:35.950> neoclassical

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
metal fusion Latin Spanish neoclassical

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.369 
metal fusion Latin Spanish neoclassical
and<00:00:37.040> world<00:00:37.280> music<00:00:37.640> well<00:00:38.450> such<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.600> unique<00:00:39.020> scale

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
and world music well such a unique scale

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.380 
and world music well such a unique scale
I<00:00:39.710> think<00:00:40.040> we<00:00:40.309> should<00:00:40.430> take<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.610> peek<00:00:40.940> at<00:00:41.120> what<00:00:41.150> it

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
I think we should take a peek at what it

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.119 
I think we should take a peek at what it
is<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.840> have<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.200> lick<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.530> use<00:00:42.680> with<00:00:42.830> it

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
is and have a lick to use with it

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.070 
is and have a lick to use with it
here<00:00:43.700> we<00:00:43.790> go<00:00:43.970> well<00:00:44.809> well<00:00:45.379> well<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:47.690> want<00:00:47.989> to

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
here we go well well well so you want to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.590 
here we go well well well so you want to
learn<00:00:48.230> about<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.710> harmonic<00:00:49.220> minor<00:00:49.400> scale<00:00:49.940> huh

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
learn about the harmonic minor scale huh

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.890 
learn about the harmonic minor scale huh
good<00:00:51.350> for<00:00:51.590> you<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:52.760> scales<00:00:53.090> not<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.720> much

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
good for you the scales not that much

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.560 
good for you the scales not that much
different<00:00:54.320> than<00:00:54.380> an<00:00:54.560> Aeolian<00:00:55.040> scale<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:56.210> only

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
different than an Aeolian scale the only

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.210 
different than an Aeolian scale the only
difference<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.500> seventh<00:00:57.890> note<00:00:58.040> of

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
difference is that the seventh note of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.970 
difference is that the seventh note of
harmonic<00:00:58.610> minor<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:59.120> one<00:00:59.840> fret<00:01:00.140> higher<00:01:00.170> than

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
harmonic minor is one fret higher than

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.319 
harmonic minor is one fret higher than
the<00:01:01.100> seventh<00:01:01.399> note<00:01:01.550> of<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.730> alien<00:01:02.090> scale

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
the seventh note of the alien scale

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.139 
the seventh note of the alien scale
that's<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.200> the<00:01:04.100> distance<00:01:04.489> between<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.880> flat

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
that's it the distance between the flat

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.840 
that's it the distance between the flat
six<00:01:05.509> and<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.200> regular<00:01:06.530> seventh<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.640> what

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
six and the regular seventh is what

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.460 
six and the regular seventh is what
gives<00:01:08.000> us<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.210> scale<00:01:08.420> such<00:01:08.660> a<00:01:08.690> unique<00:01:09.140> sound

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
gives us the scale such a unique sound

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.889 
gives us the scale such a unique sound
and<00:01:09.740> feel<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.130> guitar<00:01:10.430> fretboard<00:01:10.750> okay

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
and feel in the guitar fretboard okay

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.740 
and feel in the guitar fretboard okay
so<00:01:12.350> first<00:01:12.619> let's<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.040> check<00:01:13.220> out<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.490> scale

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
so first let's just check out the scale

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.670 
so first let's just check out the scale
start<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:14.930> string<00:01:15.080> on<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.560> sixth<00:01:17.680> first

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
start on the a string on the sixth first

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.410 
start on the a string on the sixth first
gonna<00:01:18.860> start<00:01:19.130> off<00:01:19.280> playing<00:01:19.460> normally<00:01:20.210> as<00:01:20.300> it

it in a more musical way usually when

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
it in a more musical way usually when
I'm<00:02:37.500> playing<00:02:37.709> scales

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
I'm playing scales

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.979 
I'm playing scales
I'll<00:02:38.459> rarely<00:02:39.000> run<00:02:39.180> them<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.599> down<00:02:39.780> because

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
I'll rarely run them up and down because

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.570 
I'll rarely run them up and down because
that's<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:40.530> pretty<00:02:40.680> boring<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.310> do<00:02:41.430> it

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
that's that's pretty boring to do it

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.280 
that's that's pretty boring to do it
that<00:02:41.730> way<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.150> don't<00:02:42.330> recommend<00:02:42.720> doing<00:02:43.080> it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
that way and I don't recommend doing it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.620 
that way and I don't recommend doing it
that<00:02:43.440> way<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.370> we're<00:02:45.000> gonna<00:02:45.090> look<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.420> low

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
that way so we're gonna look at this low

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.630 
that way so we're gonna look at this low

so you can do it however you want this
is<00:03:08.670> how<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.880> would<00:03:08.970> start<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.360> improvise<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
is how it would start to improvise and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.740 
is how it would start to improvise and
practice<00:03:11.069> these<00:03:11.250> scales<00:03:11.580> they<00:03:12.299> end<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.510> being

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
practice these scales they end up being

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.530 
practice these scales they end up being
way<00:03:13.019> more<00:03:13.049> musical<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.010> end<00:03:14.220> plus<00:03:14.880> if<00:03:15.209> you

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
way more musical in the end plus if you

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.509 
way more musical in the end plus if you
practice<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.319> way<00:03:16.500> you'll<00:03:17.340> end<00:03:17.489> up

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
practice in this way you'll end up

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.280 
practice in this way you'll end up
improvising<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.269> way<00:03:18.450> that's<00:03:19.049> what<00:03:19.170> you
