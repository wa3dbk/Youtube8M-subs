here here's a video dispatch from what's

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.160 
here here's a video dispatch from what's
going<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.549> Iran<00:02:33.819> right<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:34.480> in<00:02:34.989> many

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
going on in Iran right now so in many

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.360 
going on in Iran right now so in many
ways<00:02:35.409> you<00:02:35.560> could<00:02:35.680> think<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:35.980> as<00:02:36.099> being

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
ways you could think of this as being

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.490 
ways you could think of this as being
comparable<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.150> type<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.389> video<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.260> we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
comparable to the type of video that we

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.959 
comparable to the type of video that we
were<00:02:38.590> seeing<00:02:38.799> on<00:02:38.950> Sky<00:02:39.219> News<00:02:39.400> but<00:02:39.669> this<00:02:39.790> being

really excited about the potential for
games<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.579> mobile<00:02:51.760> devices<00:02:51.879> because<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:53.049> a

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
games on mobile devices because it's a

games on mobile devices because it's a
real<00:02:53.290> common<00:02:53.620> use<00:02:53.799> case<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.669> I've<00:02:54.790> navigated

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:54.969 
real common use case so I've navigated

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.740 
real common use case so I've navigated
over<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.780> flash<00:02:56.049> games<00:02:56.349> 247<00:02:57.159> calm<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:58.209> UI<00:02:58.419> that

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
over to flash games 247 calm the UI that

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.330 
over to flash games 247 calm the UI that
I'm<00:02:58.900> seeing<00:02:59.199> here<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.769> little<00:03:00.010> different

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
I'm seeing here is a little different

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.569 
I'm seeing here is a little different
from<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.549> UI<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.879> might<00:03:01.180> see<00:03:01.449> on<00:03:01.799> your<00:03:02.799> PC<00:03:03.340> or

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
from the UI you might see on your PC or

from the UI you might see on your PC or
a<00:03:03.669> laptop<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.409> reason<00:03:05.859> is<00:03:06.069> that<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.819> is

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
a laptop and the reason is that this is

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.580 
a laptop and the reason is that this is
showing<00:03:07.359> just<00:03:07.540> games<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.049> work<00:03:08.199> really<00:03:08.409> well
