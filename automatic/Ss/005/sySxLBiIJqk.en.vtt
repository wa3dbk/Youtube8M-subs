00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.260 
the table but you want to head off any
objections<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.670> early<00:02:24.030> read<00:02:24.240> on

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
objections so you get that early read on

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.570 
objections so you get that early read on
what<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.630> buyer<00:02:24.810> might<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.230> thinking<00:02:25.740> about<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
what the buyer might be thinking about a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.750 
what the buyer might be thinking about a
particular<00:02:26.730> solution<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.650> why<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.520> so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
particular solution so why is it so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.610 
particular solution so why is it so
difficult<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.690> salespeople

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620

who<00:02:31.890> frame<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.640> right<00:02:32.820> questions<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.930> think

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
who frame the right questions I think

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.830 
who frame the right questions I think
there<00:02:34.710> are<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:35.100> couple<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.850> really<00:02:36.540> clear

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
there are a couple of really clear

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.610 
there are a couple of really clear
reasons<00:02:37.290> one<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.430> those<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:40.380> have

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
reasons one of those is that we have

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.770 
reasons one of those is that we have
many<00:02:40.800> negative<00:02:41.340> messages<00:02:41.850> about<00:02:42.270> questions

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
many negative messages about questions

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.050 
many negative messages about questions
and<00:02:42.960> many<00:02:43.320> salespeople<00:02:43.710> then<00:02:44.130> fear<00:02:44.550> asking

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
and many salespeople then fear asking

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.480 
and many salespeople then fear asking
questions<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:46.320> think<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.770> like<00:02:46.980> being<00:02:47.370> in

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
questions they think it's like being in

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.640 
questions they think it's like being in
a<00:02:47.580> courtroom<00:02:47.970> TV<00:02:48.570> drama<00:02:48.930> where<00:02:49.260> only<00:02:49.560> the
