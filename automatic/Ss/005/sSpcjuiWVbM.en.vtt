00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.590
 first of all I am very grateful for 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.389
 to be able to play in such a big club on 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.969
 first match with Real Madrid was 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.820
 something very special for me naturally 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.550
 but the most beautiful moments arrive 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.910
 when you win titles with the club to 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.680
 me those were the most beautiful moments 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.500
 for example the final against Barcelona 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.570
 when we beat him the supercopa or the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.350
 league title that remains in the memory 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.690
 efe forever hd course 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.370
 naturally in general our goal 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.710
 is to show on the lawn our 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.719
 potential and win the matches 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.850
 now we are in the semifinals and we play 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:49.120
 against Barcelona our goal is 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.170
 logically obtain good results what 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.170
 we will give everything to win 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.090
 we know the potential that Christian has 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.280
 ronaldo is one of the best players 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.110
 of the world and in recent years has 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.510
 demonstrated how important it is to 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.000
 this equipment but after all 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.830
 it's about the team not Christian or other 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.970
 player 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.880
 naturally we know your points 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.260
 We need you strong but we have to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.840
 work as a team to succeed 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.070
 How should I answer this question? 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.710
 logically I'm happy because the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.530
 people see me so my goal is always 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.420
 offer my potential on the lawn I 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.430
 I enjoy playing football I enjoy 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 being in the field and playing with the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.540
 ball that say something like that makes me proud 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.160
 of course we naturally know that the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 barcelona has a very powerful team 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.680
 with very good players but we 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.750
 we focus on ourselves we are in a good 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.030
 moment and now we play at home against 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.950
 Our goal is to win 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 the match and offer it to our 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.610
 amateurs we want to qualify for 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.610
 the end that is clear 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.220
 it's the biggest derby in the world and all 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.710
 world follows naturally is always 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.140
 something special for us 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.890
 players we want to show us measure ourselves 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.880
 always the best 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.819
 logically one always wants to win 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.090
 this type of matches especially by the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.709
 fans who support us all year and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.360
 that we want to thank you with a 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.360
 victory against Barcelona 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.600
 I do not want to leave in this respect both 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.820
 teams arrive well are among the best 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.660
 Spanish clubs wish you good luck 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.660
 And may the best win
