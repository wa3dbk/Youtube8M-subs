00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 I suppose that in these days you have given 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.609
 realize that we have changed sponsor 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.259
 now fifa.com sponsors a page 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.120
 totally reliable all the attention in 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.710
 Spanish are super fast of their payments 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.179
 below in the description you have a video 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 how to buy our coins if not 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.990
 you are able to buy them by putting the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.520
 tobalina code will apply a 5 for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.750
 percent discount so if you want 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.710
 buy coins to try is the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.710
 better page to do it 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.390
 just to make a very video 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.980
 short of a minute and peak for 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.600
 explain a little bit above how 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.430
 I'm going to draw that susaeta that we have 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.250
 removed here and here I am seeing the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.870
 facebook twitter tabs and 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.640
 also from instagram and also you are 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.320
 seeing the one of my sponsor where 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.550
 they buy the coins simply with 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 give it to the facebook you are going to go 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.460
 directly to my facebook to my page 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.350
 of facebook where I have a 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.730
 publication and that same publication 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.500
 giving me like you know 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.210
 participating I feel a lot to the people that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.590
 does not have the facebook or that's how it's free 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.360
 so you can do it and you can 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.950
 participate quietly but for me 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.660
 it's a very comfortable way since you found 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.430
 I like to store all the 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.450
 names there after I can remove them as 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.490
 six watching there three hundred and so 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.770
 people already participating this susaeta 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.420
 everything is so much for the xbox platform 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 as for the playstation so the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.149
 winner is simply going to have me 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.040
 say what platform game I can 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.840
 pass it on and as I'm already seeing there are 300 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.160
 and peak people as well I say what 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.869
 It happens that these people came forward because 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.910
 once he posted things here in 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.050
 facebook jumps the twitter and they already 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.940
 they moved forward but I also wanted 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.619
