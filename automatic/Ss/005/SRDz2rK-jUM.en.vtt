split<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> tracks<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.140> always<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.160> it's<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
split the tracks I always think it's a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.300 
split the tracks I always think it's a
good<00:01:32.460> idea<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:33.060> ahead<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.540> split<00:01:33.720> them

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
good idea to go ahead and split them

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.640 
good idea to go ahead and split them
before<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.700> started<00:01:36.240> installing<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.380> so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
before you get started installing it so

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
before you get started installing it so
it's<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> whole<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:38.910> of<00:01:39.030> stop<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.270> go<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it's not a whole lot of stop and go you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440 
it's not a whole lot of stop and go you
can<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.800> know<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.160> in<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.369> rhythm<00:01:41.550> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
can just you know get in a rhythm and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.650 
can just you know get in a rhythm and
just<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.830> see<00:01:44.450> it's<00:01:45.450> like

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
just get it so as you can see it's like

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.249 
just get it so as you can see it's like
a<00:01:45.690> double<00:01:46.200> whip<00:01:46.410> right<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> can

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
a double whip right and then as you can

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
actually look at this it's already on

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.050 
actually look at this it's already on
the<00:01:55.380> verge<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.710> coming<00:01:56.040> apart<00:01:56.310> which<00:01:56.550> is<00:01:56.729> what

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
