I'm only putting back on three because

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.990 
I'm only putting back on three because
to<00:02:16.560> speed<00:02:16.830> up<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> process<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.580> screws<00:02:23.820> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
to speed up the process and it screws in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.460 
to speed up the process and it screws in
very<00:02:24.210> easily<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.540> there's<00:02:27.810> no<00:02:27.960> need<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.230> apply

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
very easily and there's no need to apply

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:41.780 
very easily and there's no need to apply
a<00:02:28.500> lot<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.710> pressure<00:02:28.950> at<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> end<00:02:39.980> okay<00:02:40.980> just

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
a lot of pressure at the end okay just

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:55.850 
a lot of pressure at the end okay just
about<00:02:41.970> done<00:02:42.210> now

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.770 

all<00:02:56.860> right<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.940> new<00:02:58.060> circuit<00:02:58.420> board<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.660> on

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
all right so the new circuit board is on

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.979 
all right so the new circuit board is on
now<00:02:59.590> we're<00:02:59.830> going<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.780> reconnect<00:03:01.780> all<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
now we're going to reconnect all the

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:11.460 
now we're going to reconnect all the
cords<00:03:04.470> here<00:03:05.470> we<00:03:05.620> go<00:03:07.890> here<00:03:08.890> we<00:03:09.010> go<00:03:10.140> okay<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.200> now

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
cords here we go here we go okay so now

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.880 
cords here we go here we go okay so now
we're<00:03:11.590> ready<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.800> power<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.220> again<00:03:14.940> so

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
we're ready to power it on again so

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:27.509 
we're ready to power it on again so
let's<00:03:17.890> go<00:03:18.100> ahead<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.459> do<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:26.160> okay<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.370> you

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
let's go ahead and do that okay so you

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.740 
let's go ahead and do that okay so you
heard<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:27.819> time<00:03:28.060> there<00:03:28.209> was<00:03:28.300> no<00:03:28.360> clicking

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
heard this time there was no clicking

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.449 
heard this time there was no clicking
sounds<00:03:29.290> I'm<00:03:29.739> not<00:03:29.890> sure<00:03:30.069> if<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.190> heard<00:03:30.340> the

two steps you will find the right

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.080 
two steps you will find the right
circuit<00:04:55.300> board<00:04:55.479> for<00:04:55.690> your<00:04:55.780> hard<00:04:55.960> drive

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.910 

so<00:05:01.090> let's<00:05:01.330> that's<00:05:01.630> pretty<00:05:01.960> much<00:05:02.110> only<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.740> know

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
so let's that's pretty much only to know

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.550 
so let's that's pretty much only to know
if<00:05:03.670> your<00:05:04.270> hard<00:05:04.510> drive<00:05:04.750> has<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.020> circuit<00:05:05.440> board

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
if your hard drive has a circuit board

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.350 
if your hard drive has a circuit board
problem<00:05:06.010> you<00:05:06.580> should<00:05:06.760> keep<00:05:06.880> in<00:05:07.030> mind<00:05:07.060> that

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
problem you should keep in mind that

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.210 
problem you should keep in mind that
while<00:05:07.600> we<00:05:07.900> prepare<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.410> clicking<00:05:08.830> hard<00:05:09.070> drive

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
while we prepare the clicking hard drive

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.010 
while we prepare the clicking hard drive
by<00:05:09.340> simply<00:05:09.670> replacing<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.270> circuit<00:05:10.630> board<00:05:10.840> that

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
by simply replacing a circuit board that

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.100 
by simply replacing a circuit board that
is<00:05:11.620> not<00:05:11.770> always<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.400> case<00:05:12.690> some<00:05:13.690> hard<00:05:13.900> drives

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
is not always the case some hard drives

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.170 
is not always the case some hard drives
are<00:05:14.650> clicking<00:05:15.130> but<00:05:15.370> they<00:05:15.580> also<00:05:15.760> have<00:05:16.000> some

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
are clicking but they also have some

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.000 
are clicking but they also have some
internal<00:05:16.660> damage<00:05:16.930> for<00:05:17.320> example<00:05:17.710> they<00:05:17.830> have<00:05:17.980> a

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
internal damage for example they have a

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.820 
internal damage for example they have a
