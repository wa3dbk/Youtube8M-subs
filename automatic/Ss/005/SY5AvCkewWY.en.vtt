00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
actually adopting it because I think

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.200 
actually adopting it because I think
it's<00:00:33.570> too<00:00:34.230> risky<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.829> buy<00:00:35.160> at<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> store

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it's too risky to buy at the store

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.360 
it's too risky to buy at the store
especially<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.530> neutered<00:00:38.190> or

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
especially if it's not neutered or

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.869 
especially if it's not neutered or
spayed<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.090> my<00:00:39.600> money<00:00:39.840> um<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.100> girl<00:00:41.370> the
