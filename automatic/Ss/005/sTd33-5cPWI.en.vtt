00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
version 7 I could quote the build number

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.250 
version 7 I could quote the build number
but<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.490> very<00:00:23.640> long<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.960> guys<00:00:25.050> probably

you which is the easiest way would have

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.479 
you which is the easiest way would have
been<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.059> actually<00:00:33.630> go<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:33.899> Odin<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.530> flash

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
been to actually go into Odin and flash

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.060 
been to actually go into Odin and flash
the<00:00:35.850> stock<00:00:35.910> image<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.660> get<00:00:36.780> back<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.290> stock<00:00:37.710> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the stock image to get back to stock so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
the stock image to get back to stock so
if<00:00:38.190> your<00:00:38.340> unlocked<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:39.180> rooted<00:00:39.600> you're

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
if your unlocked your rooted you're

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.420 
if your unlocked your rooted you're
running<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> custom<00:00:40.230> rom<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:41.129> would<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.309> had

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
running a custom rom you would have had

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
you could have received over the air

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.369 
you could have received over the air
upgrade<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> could<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:45.989> rooted<00:00:46.260> your

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
upgrade then you could have rooted your

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.479

phone then you could have unlocked the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
phone then you could have unlocked the
bootloader<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.899> would<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.110> been<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
bootloader and that would have been a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
bootloader and that would have been a
pain<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.070> could<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.730> way

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
pain right so you could do it that way

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.400 
pain right so you could do it that way
or<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.840> way<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.289> head

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
are on the latest build probably going

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.360
