starting<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.779> 60<00:00:31.199> degrees<00:00:31.910> that's<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
starting at 60 degrees that's not a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
starting at 60 degrees that's not a
terrible<00:00:33.719> time<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.230> that's<00:00:34.410> not<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
terrible time but that's not really a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.119 
terrible time but that's not really a
good<00:00:35.340> time<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.200> had<00:00:37.320> happened<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.920> I

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
good time and what had happened was I

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.330 
good time and what had happened was I
think<00:00:38.399> part<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> problem<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:40.340> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
think part of the problem is the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.850 
think part of the problem is the
distance<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.719> way<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.989> set<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
distance the way it's set up here the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.950 
distance the way it's set up here the
way<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.160> supposed<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.640> used<00:00:44.960> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
way it's supposed to be used the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
way it's supposed to be used the
distance<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> top<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> burner<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
distance from the top of the burner to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
distance from the top of the burner to
the<00:00:47.670> bottom<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> pot<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:49.079> this

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the bottom of the pot in this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.549 
the bottom of the pot in this
configuration<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:52.340> 3/4<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> an<00:00:53.579> inch<00:00:54.350> if<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
configuration is 3/4 of an inch if you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.529 
configuration is 3/4 of an inch if you
go<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> Jets<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> bottom<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
go from the Jets up to the bottom of the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.689 
go from the Jets up to the bottom of the
pot<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.050> only<00:00:58.199> makes<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.770> 7/8<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.579> an

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
pot that only makes it about 7/8 of an

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.410 
pot that only makes it about 7/8 of an
inch<00:00:59.989> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> past<00:01:01.469> we've<00:01:01.800> seen<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.420> there

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
inch in the past we've seen that there

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.219 
inch in the past we've seen that there
needs<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.470> inch<00:01:04.769> between<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
needs to be about an inch between the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.600 
needs to be about an inch between the
top<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> burner<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> bottom<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
top of the burner to the bottom of the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.539 
top of the burner to the bottom of the
pot<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.260> soon<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.770> done<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
pot so as soon as I got done with this I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
pot so as soon as I got done with this I
kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.880> figured<00:01:12.290> well<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
kind of figured well what if this is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.580 
kind of figured well what if this is
another<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.430> those<00:01:14.600> pot<00:01:15.600> stands<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.380> works

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
another one of those pot stands it works

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
another one of those pot stands it works
better<00:01:16.860> upside<00:01:17.369> down<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.750> don't

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
better upside down but you know I don't

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.770 
better upside down but you know I don't
really<00:01:19.170> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.400> had<00:01:21.330> some

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
really want to do that but I had some

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.800 
really want to do that but I had some
suggestions<00:01:22.619> from<00:01:22.830> people<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.420> bebop

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
suggestions from people like the bebop

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.840 
suggestions from people like the bebop
er<00:01:25.189> Z<00:01:26.189> usable<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.000> Catskill<00:01:27.750> Mountain<00:01:28.170> Girl

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.149 
er Z usable and Catskill Mountain Girl
where<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.060> suggested<00:01:30.840> taking<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
where they suggested taking it out of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.600 
where they suggested taking it out of
the<00:01:32.280> pots<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.850> burner<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> pot<00:01:33.750> stand

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
the pots the burner out of the pot stand

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.050 
the pots the burner out of the pot stand
and<00:01:36.110> just<00:01:37.110> putting<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.530> underneath<00:01:37.909> with<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and just putting it underneath with the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.130 
and just putting it underneath with the
pot<00:01:39.270> stand<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.840> top<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:42.450> distance

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pot stand on top like that this distance

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.960 
pot stand on top like that this distance
now<00:01:43.380> from<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> top<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> burner<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
now from the top of the burner to the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.440 
now from the top of the burner to the
bottom<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> pot<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.649> about<00:01:46.979> 1<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.310> 5/8<00:01:47.820> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
bottom of the pot is about 1 and 5/8 so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.660 
bottom of the pot is about 1 and 5/8 so
we<00:01:48.600> kind<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.930> went<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> other<00:01:49.229> way<00:01:49.670> but

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
we kind of went the other way but

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.429 
we kind of went the other way but
sometimes<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.200> better

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
sometimes a little bit more is better

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.460 
sometimes a little bit more is better
than<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:53.040> enough<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> thought<00:01:55.140> I'd<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
than not enough so I thought I'd do a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.880 
than not enough so I thought I'd do a
quick<00:01:55.829> test<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.110> see<00:01:58.110> what<00:01:58.350> happens<00:01:58.380> if

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
quick test here and see what happens if

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.709 
quick test here and see what happens if
I<00:01:59.009> put<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.180> burner<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:02.159> ground<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.880> then

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
I put the burner on the ground and then

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.130 
I put the burner on the ground and then
just<00:02:03.960> put<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> pot<00:02:04.469> stand<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:04.979> top<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
just put the pot stand on top of it and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.220 
just put the pot stand on top of it and
see<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.469> does<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.039> let<00:02:08.250> me<00:02:08.340> just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.360 

hmm<00:02:12.230> like<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.560> said<00:02:12.740> these<00:02:12.890> are<00:02:12.950> terrible

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
hmm like I said these are terrible

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.530 
hmm like I said these are terrible
matches<00:02:17.680> not<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.069> old<00:02:19.190> ones<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:19.700> I've

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
matches not like the old ones so I've

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.530 
matches not like the old ones so I've
lit<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:24.520> let's<00:02:25.520> wait<00:02:25.730> until<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.060> gets<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
lit that let's wait until it gets to a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.520 
lit that let's wait until it gets to a
bloom<00:02:31.600> I'm<00:02:32.600> hoping<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.080> works<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.440> little

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
bloom I'm hoping this works a little

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.980 
bloom I'm hoping this works a little
better<00:02:33.800> but<00:02:34.250> we'll<00:02:34.700> see<00:02:35.000> okay<00:02:35.630> we've<00:02:35.780> got<00:02:35.959> a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
better but we'll see okay we've got a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.500 
better but we'll see okay we've got a
bloom<00:02:36.290> there<00:02:36.560> I've<00:02:37.340> got<00:02:37.640> 2<00:02:37.850> cups<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.239> water

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
bloom there I've got 2 cups of water

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.900 
bloom there I've got 2 cups of water
here<00:02:40.270> setting<00:02:41.270> at<00:02:41.450> 60<00:02:41.989> degrees<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.739> let's<00:02:43.670> see

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
here setting at 60 degrees and let's see

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.890 
here setting at 60 degrees and let's see
where<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.239> goes

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.720 

okay<00:02:47.900> now<00:02:47.959> we're<00:02:48.230> about<00:02:48.350> three<00:02:48.860> minutes<00:02:48.890> into

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
okay now we're about three minutes into

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.890 
okay now we're about three minutes into
the<00:02:49.880> test<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:52.670> can<00:02:52.820> see<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.450> flames

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
the test you can see that the flames

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.240 
the test you can see that the flames
look<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.320> little<00:02:54.500> bit<00:02:54.680> different<00:02:55.040> than<00:02:55.160> the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
look a little bit different than the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.320 
look a little bit different than the
last<00:02:55.459> time<00:02:56.200> much<00:02:57.200> bigger<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.730> we'll<00:02:59.030> see<00:02:59.239> if

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
last time much bigger so we'll see if

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.770 
last time much bigger so we'll see if
this<00:02:59.540> makes<00:02:59.840> any<00:03:00.110> change<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:05.390> here<00:03:05.540> we<00:03:05.660> have

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
this makes any change and here we have

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:19.170 
this makes any change and here we have
210<00:03:08.080> 211<00:03:12.010> 212<00:03:13.010> at<00:03:13.670> 5:52

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.930 

how<00:03:20.180> about<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:23.860> let<00:03:24.860> me<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:25.160> take<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:25.640> off

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
how about that let me just take this off

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:40.600 
how about that let me just take this off
so<00:03:29.470> what<00:03:30.470> we<00:03:30.620> got<00:03:30.799> there<00:03:31.130> was<00:03:39.220> two<00:03:40.220> cups<00:03:40.489> of

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
so what we got there was two cups of

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.350 
so what we got there was two cups of
water<00:03:40.820> starting<00:03:41.329> at<00:03:41.480> 60<00:03:42.170> degrees<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.940> time

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
water starting at 60 degrees this time

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.069 
water starting at 60 degrees this time
came<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:45.079> full<00:03:45.380> boil<00:03:45.650> with<00:03:46.130> 212<00:03:46.760> in<00:03:47.079> 5

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
came to a full boil with 212 in 5

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.270 
came to a full boil with 212 in 5
minutes<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.650> 52<00:03:49.070> seconds<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.620> last<00:03:51.829> test

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
minutes and 52 seconds the last test

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.250 
minutes and 52 seconds the last test
with<00:03:52.610> using<00:03:53.060> this<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.390> right<00:03:53.570> way<00:03:53.810> where<00:03:54.110> the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
with using this the right way where the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.650 
with using this the right way where the
Trangia<00:03:54.650> burner<00:03:55.310> was<00:03:55.579> on<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.820> top<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.450> pot

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
Trangia burner was on the top of the pot

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.930 
Trangia burner was on the top of the pot
stamp<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:58.010> was<00:03:58.190> 8<00:03:58.370> minutes<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:58.910> 39<00:03:59.269> seconds<00:04:00.940> so

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
stamp it was 8 minutes and 39 seconds so

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.810 
stamp it was 8 minutes and 39 seconds so
6<00:04:02.390> that<00:04:02.630> saved<00:04:02.959> us<00:04:03.140> about<00:04:03.500> 2<00:04:04.220> minutes<00:04:04.459> right

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
6 that saved us about 2 minutes right

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.650 
6 that saved us about 2 minutes right
there<00:04:04.870> two<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.049> half<00:04:06.200> minutes<00:04:07.660> interesting

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
there two and a half minutes interesting

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.720 
there two and a half minutes interesting
so<00:04:11.660> there<00:04:11.930> we<00:04:12.050> go<00:04:12.080> again<00:04:12.830> a<00:04:16.209> little<00:04:17.209> bit<00:04:17.330> warm

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
so there we go again a little bit warm

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.930 
so there we go again a little bit warm
but<00:04:20.560> these<00:04:21.560> waves<00:04:21.800> in<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.160> test

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
but these waves in this test

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.350 
but these waves in this test
it<00:04:23.360> looks<00:04:23.660> like<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.580> Trangia<00:04:25.580> burner<00:04:26.150> is

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
it looks like the Trangia burner is

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.900 
it looks like the Trangia burner is
better<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.750> be<00:04:26.870> set<00:04:27.080> on<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.320> ground<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.950> then

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
better to be set on the ground and then

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.070 
better to be set on the ground and then
just<00:04:29.240> have<00:04:29.420> this<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.880> pot<00:04:32.120> stand<00:04:32.420> placed<00:04:32.720> over

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
just have this the pot stand placed over

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.080 
just have this the pot stand placed over
top<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.620> now<00:04:34.310> there's<00:04:34.550> all<00:04:34.700> kinds<00:04:35.030> of

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
top of it now there's all kinds of

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.910 
top of it now there's all kinds of
variations<00:04:35.420> here<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:36.140> we<00:04:36.260> could<00:04:36.410> put<00:04:36.650> you

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
variations here that we could put you

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.100 
variations here that we could put you
know<00:04:37.700> something<00:04:38.180> underneath<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.720> burner<00:04:38.960> to

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
know something underneath the burner to

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.070 
know something underneath the burner to
raise<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.740> up<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:40.010> little<00:04:40.130> bit<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:41.240> fine-tune<00:04:41.930> it

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
raise it up a little bit to fine-tune it

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.540 
raise it up a little bit to fine-tune it
but<00:04:43.010> even<00:04:43.280> just<00:04:43.400> doing<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:44.950> that<00:04:45.950> saves<00:04:46.340> you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
but even just doing this that saves you

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.730 
but even just doing this that saves you
about<00:04:46.700> two<00:04:47.150> minutes<00:04:47.510> right<00:04:47.720> there<00:04:47.780> two<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.710> a

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
about two minutes right there two and a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.650 
about two minutes right there two and a
half<00:04:48.920> minutes<00:04:50.260> cool<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.430> think<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:53.240> bebop

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
half minutes cool so I think the bebop

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.280 
half minutes cool so I think the bebop
er<00:04:53.900> Z<00:04:54.470> usable<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.660> Catskill<00:04:56.660> Mountain<00:04:57.140> girl
