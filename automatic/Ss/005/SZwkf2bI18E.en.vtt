00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
the dads don't really enjoy the dancing

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.800 
the dads don't really enjoy the dancing

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
Kristin she was doing about four or five

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.789 
Kristin she was doing about four or five
hours<00:03:13.870> ago<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.290> she<00:03:14.380> would<00:03:14.470> say<00:03:14.590> there<00:03:14.739> are

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
hours ago and she would say there are
