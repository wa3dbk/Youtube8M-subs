which<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.639> students<00:00:15.089> had<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.330> opportunity

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
which the students had the opportunity

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.080 
which the students had the opportunity
to<00:00:16.049> pursue<00:00:16.770> independent<00:00:17.369> research<00:00:17.640> projects

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
to pursue independent research projects

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.060 
to pursue independent research projects
the<00:00:18.420> whole<00:00:18.570> purpose<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> program<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the whole purpose of the program was to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.779 
the whole purpose of the program was to
immerse<00:00:20.609> students<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.109> science<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.789> to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
immerse students in the science and to

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.120 
immerse students in the science and to
have<00:00:24.119> them<00:00:24.449> conduct<00:00:24.930> real<00:00:25.289> research<00:00:25.740> with

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
have them conduct real research with

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.650 
have them conduct real research with
data<00:00:26.369> they<00:00:26.580> collected<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:27.599> very

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
data they collected so it was very

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.960 
data they collected so it was very
personal<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> them<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.039> lab<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.580> deployed

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
personal to them that lab you deployed

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.900 
personal to them that lab you deployed
the<00:00:30.480> equipment<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.460> retrieved<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.610> there

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the equipment and retrieved it there

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
the equipment and retrieved it there
were<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> bunch<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.540> different<00:00:33.930> bottles<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
were a bunch of different bottles in a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.709 
were a bunch of different bottles in a
carousel<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.700> would<00:00:35.790> deploy<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.329> over<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
carousel you would deploy it over the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.840 
carousel you would deploy it over the
side<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> ship<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.530> lower<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:38.460> into

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
side of the ship and lower it down into

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
side of the ship and lower it down into
the<00:00:38.969> water<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.510> watch<00:00:40.170> how<00:00:40.530> far<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> was<00:00:41.010> going

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the water and watch how far it was going

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
the water and watch how far it was going
down<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> way<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:43.140> would

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
down and then on the way up you would

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
down and then on the way up you would
stop<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> trigger<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> bottles<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.270> go

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
stop it and trigger the bottles to go

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.650 
stop it and trigger the bottles to go
off<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.960> collect<00:00:46.649> water<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.489> sampling<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
off and collect water for sampling the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
off and collect water for sampling the
students<00:00:49.020> also<00:00:49.200> were<00:00:49.590> part<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> crew<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
students also were part of a crew of the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.279 
students also were part of a crew of the
boat<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.940> they<00:00:51.210> had<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> help<00:00:51.719> sail<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
boat so they had to help sail and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.200 
boat so they had to help sail and
operate<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.890> vessel<00:00:53.219> during<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> whole<00:00:53.850> time

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
operate the vessel during the whole time

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.380 
operate the vessel during the whole time
this<00:00:54.960> involved<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.800> seamanship<00:00:56.489> putting<00:00:57.300> up

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
this involved a seamanship putting up

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
this involved a seamanship putting up
sales<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:58.620> were<00:00:58.680> trained<00:00:59.010> by<00:00:59.100> SCA

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
sales which they were trained by SCA

sales which they were trained by SCA
personnel<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.690> had<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.199> line<00:01:01.500> chase<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
personnel we had a line chase as a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
personnel we had a line chase as a
little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> an<00:01:02.940> incentive<00:01:03.239> learn<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:03.960> the

little bit of an incentive learn all the
sales<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> lines<00:01:05.549> quickly<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
sales and all of the lines quickly it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
sales and all of the lines quickly it
was<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.960> neat<00:01:07.140> because<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:08.070> got<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> learn

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
was really neat because you got to learn

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.620 
was really neat because you got to learn
how<00:01:09.140> sailing<00:01:10.140> has<00:01:10.290> been<00:01:10.439> done<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:11.040> centuries

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
how sailing has been done for centuries

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.969 
how sailing has been done for centuries
everybody<00:01:12.630> learned<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> lines<00:01:13.320> learn<00:01:13.770> the

sails learned how to sail a tall ship

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.399 
sails learned how to sail a tall ship
within<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.060> week<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.810> amazing<00:01:18.900> I

within a week and it was amazing I
learned<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> ship<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
learned on the ship that you have to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.499 
learned on the ship that you have to
work<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.369> team<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.390> affects

work as a team what you do affects
everyone<00:01:25.140> else<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.740> were<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:25.979> thrilled<00:01:26.880> with

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
everyone else we were just thrilled with

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.020 
everyone else we were just thrilled with
how<00:01:27.750> much<00:01:27.990> an<00:01:28.310> individual<00:01:29.310> student<00:01:29.670> learned

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
how much an individual student learned

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.990 
how much an individual student learned
while<00:01:30.630> being<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.439> how<00:01:32.070> much<00:01:32.729> they

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
while being at it see how much they

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.719 
while being at it see how much they
transformed<00:01:33.869> into<00:01:34.170> being<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.650> scientist<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.460> lot

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
transformed into being a scientist a lot

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.520 
transformed into being a scientist a lot
of<00:01:35.850> students<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.390> got<00:01:36.509> any<00:01:36.659> experience<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
of students really got any experience of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.260 
of students really got any experience of
what<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> research<00:01:38.310> at<00:01:38.490> sea<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.030> they

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
what it is to research at sea and they

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 
what it is to research at sea and they
can<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.659> make<00:01:40.229> much<00:01:40.680> better<00:01:40.710> decisions<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
can now make much better decisions as to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
can now make much better decisions as to
if<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.930> research<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.380> sea<00:01:43.560> for

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
if they want to do research at sea for

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
if they want to do research at sea for
graduate<00:01:44.070> school<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.640> was<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> good<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
graduate school it was a good time to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.499 
graduate school it was a good time to
just<00:01:46.220> really<00:01:47.220> put<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> lot<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.820> things<00:01:48.119> into

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
just really put a lot of things into

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.910 
just really put a lot of things into
perspective<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.170> thought<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:49.890> a
