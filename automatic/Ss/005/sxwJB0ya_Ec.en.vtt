00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.580
 and internet beauty 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.300
 A good video today, it's a good one. 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.020
 basic explanation about stolen chuchu 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.880
 the fishery to taste good I'm going to make a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.519
 more complete video explaining legal 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.439
 so most of the kind of rain that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.449
 there is but I'm a painting today 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 so pretty basic even for you either 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.260
 do a beach fishery so what? 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.260
 Do you need to buy the beach fishery? 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:48.059
 use the material to fish play there 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:51.539
 far out you need 2014 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.789
 here it is if I'm not mistaken it has 130 grams 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:01.579
 This pyramid is what we call it. 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.299
 Here I am going to explain what 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:12.540
 I usually use this one here is the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.189
 next when stopped is not running 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 Are you going to use this kind of show here? 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.460
 team depends on your stick 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.930
 time is now my use this one of 130 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.850
 She can take even more distance 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.240
 that I want and also not to force 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:36.240
 much the vacancy is is over 130 grams 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.040
 this quiet far 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.040
 so if you want to play well away 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.159
 can handle 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.159
 Okay, you're not going to break the porch door. 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.840
 writing is how much weight she can bear 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 kef ok you will know the weight she 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.030
 Can you play a minimum of mass? 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.399
 throw away a calm sea day the lead 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.370
 It is that here is the best that has several 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.860
 models more often here by the dynamics 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.010
 of him too 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.610
 they would have better then it has and in the background 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.530
 it stays only on the rocker but like the water 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.270
 stop there is no problem with that sea 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.140
 calm, do not worry 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.980
 now if you are on a sea day 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.400
 agitated 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:40.230
 the essence that pyramid because it hit 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.730
 there it will sink in the sand and it will be 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.340
 harder to run of course than day 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.740
 that people are going to fish that the automaker 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.140
 said here it will run a billion that 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.940
 wins the day're giving for fish will 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.980
 To run more, you can give to hold 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.370
 I usually use this one here number four 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:03.239
 the number 5 until such a size of it is well 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:05.310
 Heavy is not a boring thing 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.920
 understood why when the line does not stop 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.440
 It's very annoying but you usually a 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.950
 service number four is already good 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.110
 size if you do a beach fishing 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:24.870
 bearable for when you're running 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:26.489
 much in the sand and ended up locked there now 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.200
 there are a lot of people who use this kind of 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.299
 rain that even with calm sea but it is not 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.910
 cool to us because when you pull 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.190
 you will bring that weight all this 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.410
 Do not know how your lead fish is going 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.480
 forcing the material into a towel and 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.190
 Do not have this, then you have to give. 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.970
 priority buy this type of rain 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.320
 here it can be this type here is also 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.080
 Little taboo but I'm talking so 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.760
 showing the model is in my case the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.160
 my beach research use this one here 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.440
 with this weight of 130 grams 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.239
 pretend that this is a good ball, okay? 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.010
 account that is the ball which also has 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.540
 130 thousand would also serve very well for 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.700
 fishing also against this but 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.549
 it's not so good aerodynamics 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.900
 this one it helps more then this 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.220
 I always said here okay and to sea day 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.160
 agitated 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.250
 the lead is this here it's freaking 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.849
 four accounts the best there is only one 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.180
 this way, under a fishing rain of 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:30.910
 beach is good, so basically people 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.830
 fell like always ask you will have 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.669
 have that one of the lead here 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.240
 this one is calm sea and to this here 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.240
 rough sea 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.800
 the latest models are more like this 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.870
 same variety but the two main ones 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.669
 projection research and will make a 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.610
 complete video in saying so to 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.350
 The majority of the game was able to show 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.210
 you 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.010
