00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
Potter series that's a tough one it's

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.800 
Potter series that's a tough one it's
very<00:02:54.489> difficult<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.030> answer<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.569> question

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
very difficult to answer that question

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.099 
very difficult to answer that question
because<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:57.280> might<00:02:58.180> be<00:02:58.209> giving<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.690> race<00:02:58.900> and

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
because I might be giving a race and

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.630 
because I might be giving a race and
plot<00:03:00.269> last-known<00:03:01.269> perhaps<00:03:01.630> but<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.950> had<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> good

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
plot last-known perhaps but I had a good

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.690 
plot last-known perhaps but I had a good
time<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.350> very<00:03:05.560> first<00:03:05.890> scene<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.340> shot

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
time with the very first scene I shot

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.180 
time with the very first scene I shot

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
because that's where you say to the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.039 
because that's where you say to the
director<00:03:09.700> rather<00:03:09.940> than<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.540> stand<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:11.019> front

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
director rather than just stand in front

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.099 
director rather than just stand in front
of<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:12.190> kids<00:03:12.519> could<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.910> crash<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.930> door

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
and and then you discover that your

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.830 
and and then you discover that your
character<00:03:17.739> has<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.250> lot<00:03:18.819> of<00:03:18.940> explosive<00:03:19.660> energy

as well as standing still so it was good

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.870 
as well as standing still so it was good
