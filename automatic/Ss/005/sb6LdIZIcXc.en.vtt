00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
was thinking was go with the agility

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.939 
was thinking was go with the agility
focus<00:01:03.270> sash<00:01:03.420> combo<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.290> focus<00:01:04.650> ash<00:01:04.799> is

focus sash combo that focus ash is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:05.899 
focus sash combo that focus ash is
pretty<00:01:05.129> much<00:01:05.250> gonna<00:01:05.489> make<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> where

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
pretty much gonna make it to where

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.340 
pretty much gonna make it to where
you're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.510> an<00:01:06.600> agility<00:01:06.840> off<00:01:07.140> which

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you're going to get an agility off which

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
you're going to get an agility off which
means<00:01:07.560> never<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> crazy<00:01:08.490> amount<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.850> speed

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
means never have a crazy amount of speed

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.070 
means never have a crazy amount of speed
over<00:01:10.159> 250<00:01:11.159> speed<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.729> level<00:01:12.150> 50<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.869> going

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
over 250 speed at level 50 that's going

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
over 250 speed at level 50 that's going
to<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.229> fast<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:13.650> almost<00:01:14.130> 500<00:01:14.729> speed<00:01:15.000> at

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to be fast that's almost 500 speed at

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
to be fast that's almost 500 speed at
level<00:01:15.659> 100<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.110> believe<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.680> doesn't

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
level 100 I believe because it doesn't

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
level 100 I believe because it doesn't
scale<00:01:17.159> quite<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.150> same<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.780> overall<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
scale quite the same but overall you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.390 
scale quite the same but overall you
know<00:01:19.320> you're<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.890> agility<00:01:20.100> and

with cheer force you don't take the 10%
recoil<00:02:16.710> damage<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.580> that's<00:02:17.730> really<00:02:17.910> nice

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
recoil damage so that's really nice

recoil damage so that's really nice
which<00:02:18.360> means<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:19.200> solve<00:02:19.410> rock<00:02:19.680> slide<00:02:19.950> so

which means you can solve rock slide so
rock<00:02:20.610> slide<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:20.880> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> get<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> 30%<00:02:21.510> boost

with the life form and that's going to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.310 
with the life form and that's going to
be<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> high<00:02:27.180> amount<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.510> attack<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.780> makes<00:02:28.170> up

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
be a high amount of attack that makes up

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
for having the jelly nature so it's

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.760 
for having the jelly nature so it's
kinda<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.630> know<00:02:30.750> do<00:02:31.140> what<00:02:31.380> knock<00:02:31.530> off<00:02:31.740> a

kinda like you know do what knock off a
rock<00:02:32.100> slide<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.610> essentially<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.330> question

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
rock slide is essentially the question

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.360 
rock slide is essentially the question

any<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.390> those<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:37.110> top<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.770> was

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
any one of those on top of that I was

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.160 
any one of those on top of that I was
also<00:02:38.160> looking<00:02:38.370> into<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.820> more<00:02:39.180> helpful<00:02:39.480> key<00:02:39.900> set

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
also looking into a more helpful key set

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
also looking into a more helpful key set
that<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> Pokemon<00:02:41.310> that's<00:02:41.459> going<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.670> be

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that with a Pokemon that's going to be

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.880 
that with a Pokemon that's going to be
setting<00:02:42.060> up<00:02:42.209> or<00:02:42.420> physical<00:02:42.990> attacker<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.770> did

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
setting up or physical attacker so did

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.320 
setting up or physical attacker so did
you<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.160> lot<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.370> good<00:02:44.610> base<00:02:44.790> defense<00:02:45.150> you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
you have a lot of good base defense you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.820 
you have a lot of good base defense you
can<00:02:45.360> make<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.810> work<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.170> your<00:02:46.260> favor<00:02:46.500> with

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
can make that work in your favor with

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.130 
can make that work in your favor with
that<00:02:47.070> good<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.730> hit<00:02:47.940> point<00:02:48.180> investment<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
that good in hit point investment so the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.890 
that good in hit point investment so the
idea<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.950> even<00:02:50.489> at<00:02:50.580> level<00:02:50.640> 100<00:02:50.880> 200<00:02:51.630> speed

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
idea is that even at level 100 200 speed

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.320 
idea is that even at level 100 200 speed
so<00:02:52.380> you're<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.190> over<00:02:53.550> 400<00:02:54.030> speed<00:02:54.209> at

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
so you're going to be over 400 speed at

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.510 
so you're going to be over 400 speed at
level<00:02:54.600> 100<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> jolly<00:02:55.800> nature<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.370> no

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
level 100 with a jolly nature but no

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.490 
level 100 with a jolly nature but no
speed<00:02:56.850> investment<00:02:57.390> when<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.930> do<00:02:58.320> that

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
speed investment when you do that

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
defense you have a naturally high

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.550 
defense you have a naturally high
defense<00:04:28.190> decent<00:04:29.000> yeah<00:04:29.330> actually<00:04:29.810> points<00:04:30.470> of

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
defense decent yeah actually points of

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.050 
defense decent yeah actually points of
pretty<00:04:30.740> poor<00:04:30.980> so<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.280> need<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.640> put<00:04:31.790> all<00:04:31.820> the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
pretty poor so you need to put all the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.970 
pretty poor so you need to put all the
investment<00:04:32.540> you<00:04:32.600> can<00:04:32.810> into<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:33.440> Lygia

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
investment you can into that and Lygia

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.380 
investment you can into that and Lygia
Swords<00:04:34.550> Dance<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.880> going<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.150> boost<00:04:35.330> your

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
Swords Dance is going to boost your

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.240 
Swords Dance is going to boost your
attack<00:04:35.690> really<00:04:35.990> high<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.380> because<00:04:36.860> of<00:04:37.070> crack

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
attack really high and because of crack

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.370 
attack really high and because of crack
camera<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.880> don't<00:04:37.910> need<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.450> sheer<00:04:38.930> force<00:04:39.200> so

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
camera you don't need a sheer force so

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.380 
camera you don't need a sheer force so
shale<00:04:39.590> armor<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:39.920> good<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.130> have<00:04:40.280> hyper<00:04:41.060> cutter

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
shale armor is good to have hyper cutter

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.900 
shale armor is good to have hyper cutter
could<00:04:42.200> be<00:04:42.350> useful<00:04:42.770> but<00:04:42.980> shell<00:04:43.250> armor<00:04:43.610> I<00:04:43.640> think

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
could be useful but shell armor I think

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.040 
could be useful but shell armor I think
is<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.120> one<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.420> you're<00:04:44.600> going<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.840> want

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
is the one that you're going to want

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.170 
is the one that you're going to want
chest<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.740> resto<00:04:46.130> for<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.430> heal<00:04:46.610> engine<00:04:47.000> and

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
chest a resto for the heal engine and

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.760 
chest a resto for the heal engine and
then<00:04:47.510> you're<00:04:47.660> good<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.900> go<00:04:47.930> on<00:04:48.290> top<00:04:48.560> of<00:04:48.680> that

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
then you're good to go on top of that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.070 
then you're good to go on top of that
you<00:04:48.860> can<00:04:48.980> also<00:04:49.100> put<00:04:49.220> rockslide<00:04:49.790> here<00:04:50.000> just<00:04:50.480> the

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
you can also put rockslide here just the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.960 
you can also put rockslide here just the
only<00:04:51.530> real<00:04:51.890> problem<00:04:52.100> with<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.550> is<00:04:52.670> crabhammer

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
only real problem with it is crabhammer

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.840 
only real problem with it is crabhammer
can<00:04:53.420> get<00:04:53.600> water<00:04:53.840> absorb<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:54.950> rockslide<00:04:55.550> you're

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
can get water absorb so rockslide you're

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.430 
can get water absorb so rockslide you're
not<00:04:56.030> going<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.360> be<00:04:56.450> really<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.140> can<00:04:57.320> get

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
not going to be really you can get

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.870 
not going to be really you can get
resisted<00:04:57.950> but<00:04:58.070> you're<00:04:58.190> not<00:04:58.310> going<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.580> be<00:04:58.700> a

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
resisted but you're not going to be a

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.360 
resisted but you're not going to be a
mutant<00:04:59.300> walled<00:04:59.480> out<00:04:59.720> and<00:05:00.050> with<00:05:00.980> that<00:05:01.220> you

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
mutant walled out and with that you

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.130 
mutant walled out and with that you
could<00:05:01.520> maybe<00:05:01.820> go<00:05:02.060> shear<00:05:02.300> force<00:05:02.600> for<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.870> extra

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
could maybe go shear force for the extra

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.810 
could maybe go shear force for the extra
damage<00:05:03.290> it's<00:05:03.860> really<00:05:04.070> up<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.430> if<00:05:04.550> you<00:05:04.640> want
