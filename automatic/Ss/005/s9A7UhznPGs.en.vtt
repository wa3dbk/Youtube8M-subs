this<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:10.099> responsible<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.129> modifying<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this is responsible for modifying and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.330 
this is responsible for modifying and
packaging<00:02:12.599> proteins<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.590> are<00:02:13.709> made<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.160> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
packaging proteins that are made on the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.630 
packaging proteins that are made on the
rough<00:02:14.519> ER<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:16.170> sends<00:02:16.650> them<00:02:16.830> either<00:02:17.250> to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
rough ER and it sends them either to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.750 
rough ER and it sends them either to
lysosomes<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.049> cell<00:02:19.230> membrane<00:02:19.260> or<00:02:20.040> for

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
exocytosis cytosis out of the cell these

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.190 
exocytosis cytosis out of the cell these
are<00:02:29.430> any<00:02:29.879> should<00:02:30.180> organelles<00:02:33.200> mitochondria

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
are any should organelles mitochondria

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.500 
are any should organelles mitochondria
and<00:02:34.590> they<00:02:35.250> are<00:02:35.430> responsible<00:02:35.849> for<00:02:36.329> producing

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
and they are responsible for producing

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.420 
and they are responsible for producing
ATP<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:38.599> then<00:02:39.599> we<00:02:39.780> also<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.349> some<00:02:41.310> other

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
ATP and then we also have some other

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.300 
ATP and then we also have some other
organelles<00:02:42.090> which<00:02:42.540> are<00:02:42.950> lysosomes<00:02:43.950> and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
organelles which are lysosomes and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
organelles which are lysosomes and
peroxisomes<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.900> kind<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.230> hard<00:02:46.470> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
peroxisomes but it's kind of hard to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.979 
peroxisomes but it's kind of hard to
tell<00:02:46.860> which<00:02:47.670> ones<00:02:48.000> are<00:02:48.239> which<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.690> we<00:02:48.810> just

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
tell which ones are which so we just

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.220 
tell which ones are which so we just
want<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> stick<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> main<00:02:50.160> organelles

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
want to stick with the main organelles

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.800 
want to stick with the main organelles
so<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:52.410> let's<00:02:53.040> take<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.280> closer<00:02:53.640> look<00:02:53.790> at<00:02:54.660> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
so now let's take a closer look at the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.809 
so now let's take a closer look at the
cell<00:02:55.019> membrane<00:03:00.950> these<00:03:01.950> are<00:03:02.129> our<00:03:02.250> two<00:03:02.459> models

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
cell membrane these are our two models

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.199 
cell membrane these are our two models
of<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.120> cell<00:03:03.299> membrane<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.220> model<00:03:05.609> we

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
of the cell membrane in this model we

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.150 
of the cell membrane in this model we
couldn't<00:03:06.780> see<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.260> cell<00:03:07.530> membrane<00:03:07.950> is

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
couldn't see what the cell membrane is

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.849 
couldn't see what the cell membrane is
composed<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.569> it's<00:03:09.930> easy<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.290> think<00:03:10.560> that

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
composed of so it's easy to think that

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.199

we<00:03:11.370> have<00:03:11.670> two<00:03:12.359> lipids<00:03:12.780> two<00:03:13.230> proteins<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:14.209> two

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
we have two lipids two proteins and two

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.289 
we have two lipids two proteins and two

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
carbohydrates so the two lipids we have

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.199 
carbohydrates so the two lipids we have
are<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.940> phospholipids<00:03:21.470> shown<00:03:22.470> here<00:03:22.829> and

cholesterol shown here so the

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.990

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.570 
form chromosomes the nuclear envelope
dissolves<00:06:03.439> and<00:06:03.589> the<00:06:03.679> nucleolus<00:06:04.159> disappears

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.820 

the<00:06:07.580> next<00:06:07.909> stage<00:06:08.089> is<00:06:08.360> metaphase<00:06:08.839> where<00:06:09.649> the

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
the next stage is metaphase where the

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.609 
the next stage is metaphase where the
chromosomes<00:06:10.399> line<00:06:10.759> up<00:06:11.119> in<00:06:11.599> the<00:06:12.050> equatorial

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:12.619 
chromosomes line up in the equatorial

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:17.920 
chromosomes line up in the equatorial
plane<00:06:15.369> following<00:06:16.369> metaphase<00:06:16.879> we<00:06:17.689> have

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
plane following metaphase we have

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.749 
plane following metaphase we have
anaphase<00:06:18.969> anaphase<00:06:20.349> begins<00:06:21.349> as<00:06:21.830> soon<00:06:21.919> as<00:06:22.490> the

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
anaphase anaphase begins as soon as the

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.170 
anaphase anaphase begins as soon as the
chromosomes<00:06:23.800> separate<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:25.099> you<00:06:25.639> can<00:06:25.819> see<00:06:25.999> the

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
chromosomes separate and you can see the

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.719 
chromosomes separate and you can see the
centrioles<00:06:26.749> at<00:06:27.469> each<00:06:27.709> end<00:06:28.009> of<00:06:28.159> the<00:06:28.279> cell<00:06:28.490> and

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
centrioles at each end of the cell and

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.540 
centrioles at each end of the cell and
the<00:06:29.659> mitotic<00:06:29.930> spindle<00:06:30.189> draws<00:06:31.189> the

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
the mitotic spindle draws the

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.600 
the mitotic spindle draws the
chromosomes<00:06:32.469> towards<00:06:33.469> each<00:06:33.949> end<00:06:36.550> telophase

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
chromosomes towards each end telophase

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.399 
chromosomes towards each end telophase
is<00:06:37.969> the<00:06:38.959> last<00:06:39.199> phase<00:06:39.529> and<00:06:40.599> telophase<00:06:41.599> is<00:06:42.050> the

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
is the last phase and telophase is the

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:46.259 
is the last phase and telophase is the
reverse<00:06:42.740> of<00:06:43.039> prophase<00:06:43.719> so<00:06:44.830> during<00:06:45.830> telophase

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:46.269 
reverse of prophase so during telophase

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:49.059 
reverse of prophase so during telophase
the<00:06:47.269> chromosomes<00:06:47.869> are<00:06:48.589> gonna<00:06:48.860> become

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:49.069 
the chromosomes are gonna become

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.850 
the chromosomes are gonna become
chromatin<00:06:49.789> the<00:06:50.329> nuclear<00:06:50.839> envelope<00:06:51.050> is<00:06:51.619> going

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
chromatin the nuclear envelope is going

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.730 
chromatin the nuclear envelope is going
to<00:06:52.189> appear<00:06:52.579> and<00:06:52.819> so<00:06:53.449> is<00:06:53.599> the<00:06:53.779> nucleolus<00:06:54.259> and

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
to appear and so is the nucleolus and

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.939 
to appear and so is the nucleolus and
here<00:06:55.459> we<00:06:55.610> can<00:06:55.789> see<00:06:55.999> that<00:06:56.360> cytokinesis<00:06:57.259> cell

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949 
here we can see that cytokinesis cell

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.399 
here we can see that cytokinesis cell
