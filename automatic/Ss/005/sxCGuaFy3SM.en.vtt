I<00:00:17.010> get<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.460> play<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.640> full<00:00:17.970> version<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.720> game

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I get to play a full version of the game

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.519 
I get to play a full version of the game
but<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.660> trying<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.869> grab<00:00:22.109> from

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
but it's this it is trying to grab from

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.470 
but it's this it is trying to grab from
outside<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> ring<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.460> someone<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.390> year

outside the ring to someone in the year

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.670 
outside the ring to someone in the year
the<00:00:24.750> apron<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:25.949> inside<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.369> ring<00:00:27.380> apron<00:00:28.380> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the apron or inside the ring apron you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
the apron or inside the ring apron you
still<00:00:28.920> dragged<00:00:29.160> him<00:00:29.250> off<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.550> from<00:00:29.820> vehicles

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
still dragged him off but from vehicles

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.759 
still dragged him off but from vehicles
doing<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.720> can't<00:00:30.990> pull<00:00:31.199> them<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.470> can't<00:00:31.679> do

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
doing you can't pull them you can't do

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.720 
doing you can't pull them you can't do
the<00:00:31.859> stun<00:00:32.130> gun<00:00:33.649> and<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> referee<00:00:35.160> drag<00:00:35.520> as

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the stun gun and the referee drag as

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.490 
the stun gun and the referee drag as
well<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> referee<00:00:36.660> drag<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.230> glitch

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
well but the referee drag was glitch

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.630 
well but the referee drag was glitch
which<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.829> why<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.040> thinking<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.460> might<00:00:38.489> be

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
which is why I'm thinking it might be

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.180 
which is why I'm thinking it might be
removed<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.530> stop<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.710> glitch<00:00:41.010> from

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
removed to stop this glitch from

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.270 
removed to stop this glitch from
occurring<00:00:42.290> because<00:00:43.290> obviously<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.950> ref<00:00:44.129> was

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
occurring because obviously the ref was

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.240 
occurring because obviously the ref was
sliding<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.629> previous<00:00:46.050> year's<00:00:46.260> games<00:00:46.590> if

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sliding and in previous year's games if

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.110 
sliding and in previous year's games if
the<00:00:47.610> ref<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:47.940> near<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:49.230> ropes<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.120> someone

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the ref was near the ropes and someone

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.850 
the ref was near the ropes and someone
dragged<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.930> referee<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.559> fully

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
dragged them the referee would be fully

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.580 
dragged them the referee would be fully
dragged<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> played<00:00:54.510> out<00:00:55.610> but<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.820> 15

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
dragged out and played out but in 15

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.959 
dragged out and played out but in 15
basically<00:00:58.590> because<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> whole<00:00:59.399> rest

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
basically because of the whole rest

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
basically because of the whole rest
lighting<00:01:00.329> situation<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.260> did<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> when

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
lighting situation if you did that when

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100 
lighting situation if you did that when
they<00:01:02.219> near<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> ropes<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.239> would<00:01:03.539> cause<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
they near the ropes it would cause the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
they near the ropes it would cause the
ref<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.559> freeze<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.280> basically<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.090> found<00:01:06.299> an

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
ref to freeze and basically we found an

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.460 
ref to freeze and basically we found an
going<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.439> arena<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.780> into<00:01:10.020> kid<00:01:10.200> 40

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
going that the arena so but into kid 40

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.219 
going that the arena so but into kid 40
i<00:01:10.619> tried<00:01:10.830> i<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.659> telling<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:12.810> being<00:01:13.080> he

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
i tried i was telling all being he

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.359 
i tried i was telling all being he
didn't<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> never<00:01:16.409> notice<00:01:16.799> before<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.280> i

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
didn't you never notice before because i

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
didn't you never notice before because i
think<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> common<00:01:18.420> thing<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
think it's not a common thing to do a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.960 
think it's not a common thing to do a
drag<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> stun<00:01:20.040> gun<00:01:20.070> buys<00:01:20.430> him<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
drag and do a stun gun buys him to do it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.450 
drag and do a stun gun buys him to do it
a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.479> don't<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.810> why<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.340> be

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
a lot I don't know why it could just be

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.399 
a lot I don't know why it could just be
the<00:01:23.640> build<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> planing<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.600> minimize<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the build of a planing to minimize the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.440 
the build of a planing to minimize the
amount<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.680> bugs<00:01:25.920> possible<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.640> still<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.210> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
amount of bugs possible I still think it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.240 
amount of bugs possible I still think it
will<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> game<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.100> was

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
will be in the game it's just it was

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130 
will be in the game it's just it was
something<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.880> playable<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> game<00:01:30.840> big

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
something not playable in the game big

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.300 
something not playable in the game big
glitch<00:01:32.720> don't<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.350> caused<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.740> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
glitch don't have what caused that I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.370 
glitch don't have what caused that I
think<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.299> busted<00:01:36.659> open<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.140> suddenly

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
think it got busted open and suddenly

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.280 
think it got busted open and suddenly
just<00:01:37.530> picked<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.369> again<00:01:38.869> not<00:01:39.869> good<00:01:40.110> for

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
just picked them up again not good for

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.490 
just picked them up again not good for
the<00:01:40.320> DB<00:01:41.009> that's<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.549> sure<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.409> reckon<00:01:43.409> they'll

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the DB that's for sure I reckon they'll

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.609 
the DB that's for sure I reckon they'll
still<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.950> back<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:45.470> hopefully<00:01:46.470> next

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
still have it back in hopefully next

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
still have it back in hopefully next
time<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> play<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.399> game<00:01:47.640> will<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
time I get to play the game will be a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
time I get to play the game will be a
near-field<00:01:48.960> build<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.740> i<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.280> try

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
near-field build and we get i get to try

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.740 
near-field build and we get i get to try
it<00:01:50.520> more<00:01:50.700> things<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.119> want<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.360> try<00:01:51.509> double
