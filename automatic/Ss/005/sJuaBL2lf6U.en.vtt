 "Carcinogenic retrovirus in eggs" 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.790
 Recall: "Some viruses commonly infect and cause many cancers 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.120
 diseases in chickens and turkeys intended for human consumption. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.000
 These include avian leukosis / sarcoma, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.450
 reticuloendotheliosis and the Mark's disease virus. 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.880
 Avian leukosis / sarcoma viruses and reticuloendotheliosis are 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.859
 the most effective cancer causing agents. Here they can run in poultry 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.769
 already a few days. " 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.760
 This is Mark's disease. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.400
 In this photo you can see a lot of small tumors in your skin. 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.660
 The disease can also affect the eyes. 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.210
 How's it about people? 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.300
 These viruses are found in raw poultry products, including raw poultry 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.190
 or poorly cooked poultry meat and eggs for human consumption. 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.230
 They are also present in vaccines grown on poultry eggs. ” 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.210
 They cite the study the researchers were looking for 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.090
 leukosis / sarcoma viruses, carcinogenic retrovirus. 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.740
 They found them in commonly available eggs obtained directly from supermarket outlets. 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.920
 14% of the samples were infested with 20. 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 Test samples were from randomly selected retail outlets in New Orleans. 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.969
 "The general population is routinely exposed ... 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.939
 We are therefore very interested in finding out if they are causing these viruses 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.810
 cancer also in humans. " 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.159
 We do not know for sure, however: "This extensive study provides evidence 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.469
 that a group of people often come into contact with a large number of cancerous viruses 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.470
 has an increased risk of death from certain cancers. " 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
 This is not just about poultry workers; with respect to the general public, 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.039
 “Possible consequences of the excessive occurrence of some of these cancers in workers 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.340
 could be associated with exposure 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.669
 oncogenic viruses are not negligible for public health. "
