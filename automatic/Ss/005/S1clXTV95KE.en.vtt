things are located on the motherboard

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.070 
things are located on the motherboard
how<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> set<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.320> very<00:00:52.620> quickly<00:00:54.080> we

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
how to get it set up very quickly we

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.920 
how to get it set up very quickly we
have<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:55.710> i/o<00:00:56.190> shield<00:00:58.850> we<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.000> few<00:01:00.330> serial

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
have an i/o shield we have a few serial

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560 
have an i/o shield we have a few serial
ata<00:01:01.350> cables<00:01:01.830> actually<00:01:02.130> we<00:01:02.220> have<00:01:02.430> both<00:01:02.670> 60<00:01:03.360> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
ata cables actually we have both 60 and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.270 
ata cables actually we have both 60 and
3G<00:01:04.019> cables<00:01:04.939> we<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.179> a<00:01:06.420> custom<00:01:06.990> IO<00:01:07.200> cover<00:01:07.920> this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
3G cables we have a custom IO cover this

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.010 
3G cables we have a custom IO cover this
goes<00:01:08.520> right<00:01:08.820> over<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.119> i/o<00:01:09.240> cover<00:01:09.600> makes<00:01:09.929> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
goes right over the i/o cover makes it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.779 
goes right over the i/o cover makes it
look<00:01:10.170> nice<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.560> show<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.009> just<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
look nice will show you that just a

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.179 
look nice will show you that just a
little<00:01:11.999> bit<00:01:12.149> we<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> screw<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:14.039> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
little bit we have a screw here for the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.359 
little bit we have a screw here for the
mSATA<00:01:14.759> /m<00:01:15.299> PCIe<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.679> if<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:16.920> using<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
mSATA /m PCIe so if you're using one of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.130 
mSATA /m PCIe so if you're using one of
those<00:01:17.520> cards<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:17.969> can<00:01:18.149> use<00:01:18.179> that<00:01:18.479> screw<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
those cards you can use that screw to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.760 
those cards you can use that screw to
keep<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.649> place<00:01:21.020> we<00:01:22.020> also<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.319> a<00:01:22.499> few

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
keep it in place we also have a few

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.489 
keep it in place we also have a few
cables<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.399> EVGA<00:01:23.999> easy<00:01:24.299> voltage<00:01:24.899> readings<00:01:25.289> so

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
cables for EVGA easy voltage readings so

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.349 
cables for EVGA easy voltage readings so
what<00:01:25.679> you<00:01:25.799> need<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.039> do<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.399> use<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> voltmeter<00:01:27.149> a

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
what you need to do is use a voltmeter a

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.999 
what you need to do is use a voltmeter a
multimeter<00:01:27.810> plug<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.319> directly<00:01:28.409> into<00:01:28.889> those

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
multimeter plug it directly into those

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
multimeter plug it directly into those
cables<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.639> makes<00:01:29.789> it<00:01:29.939> very<00:01:29.999> simple<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:31.079> we

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
cables it makes it very simple and we

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
cables it makes it very simple and we
also<00:01:31.469> have<00:01:31.889> GPU<00:01:32.549> hot<00:01:32.759> link<00:01:32.969> cables<00:01:33.389> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
also have GPU hot link cables this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.779 
also have GPU hot link cables this
allows<00:01:34.109> you<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:34.499> control<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.249> voltage<00:01:35.429> on

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
allows you to control the voltage on

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.010 
allows you to control the voltage on
your<00:01:35.909> graphics<00:01:36.210> card<00:01:36.420> from<00:01:36.719> them<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.960> the
