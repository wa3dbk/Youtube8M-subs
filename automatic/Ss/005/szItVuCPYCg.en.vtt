00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
quality but also it doesn't perform as

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
quality but also it doesn't perform as
well<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.280> more<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.550> wait<00:00:59.670> long<00:00:59.820> version

pops<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.540> cuban<00:01:06.810> does<00:01:07.049> take<00:01:07.560> quite<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.770> lot

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
pops on this cuban does take quite a lot

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
pops on this cuban does take quite a lot
of<00:01:08.070> force<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> pull<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.790> piece<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> as

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
of force to pull one piece out and as

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.929 
of force to pull one piece out and as
for<00:01:09.990> lockups<00:01:10.439> goes<00:01:10.710> i've<00:01:10.979> had<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.430> three<00:01:11.790> or

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
for lockups goes i've had like three or

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.789 
for lockups goes i've had like three or
four<00:01:11.970> lockups<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.659> cube<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.590> just

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
four lockups on this cube and it's just

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.320 
four lockups on this cube and it's just
I'm<00:01:14.070> not<00:01:14.130> used<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.610> cube<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> don't

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
I'm not used to this cube and I don't

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.820 
I'm not used to this cube and I don't
really<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.869> fee<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.380> cube<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
really like the fee of this cube and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
really like the fee of this cube and
also<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> mechanism<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.600> slightly

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
also the mechanism which is slightly

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170 
also the mechanism which is slightly
yeah<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.040> doesn't<00:01:20.340> work<00:01:20.580> too<00:01:20.790> well<00:01:20.820> my

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
yeah it just doesn't work too well my

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.130 
yeah it just doesn't work too well my
opinion<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.630> I'll<00:01:21.689> show<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> guys<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
opinion so I'll show you guys the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.840 
opinion so I'll show you guys the
mechanism<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.610> guys<00:01:23.670> can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
mechanism right now so here you guys can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
mechanism right now so here you guys can
see<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> corner<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.689> edge<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.619> see

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
see is the corner and edge you can see

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.380 
see is the corner and edge you can see
the<00:01:26.070> edge<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.369> pretty<00:01:26.580> similar<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.119> they've

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the edge is pretty similar but they've

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.870 
the edge is pretty similar but they've
added<00:01:27.720> tracks<00:01:28.020> into<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.740> here's<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
added tracks into that and here's the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
added tracks into that and here's the
corner<00:01:30.180> piece<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.659> still<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:31.409> understand

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
corner piece I still don't understand

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.190 
corner piece I still don't understand
why<00:01:32.130> did<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:32.670> change<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.689> design<00:01:34.140> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
why did not change like the design of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.560 
why did not change like the design of
this<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:34.890> really<00:01:35.240> understand<00:01:36.240> gapes

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
this I don't really understand gapes

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
this I don't really understand gapes
here<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> cause<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.729> lock

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
here it's just going to cause like lock

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.300 
here it's just going to cause like lock
ups<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.390> stuff<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.470> yeah<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.130> don't

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
ups and stuff and I'm just yeah I don't

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.420 
ups and stuff and I'm just yeah I don't
like<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> bit<00:01:42.689> too<00:01:42.810> sharp<00:01:43.430> on

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
like it and it's a bit too sharp on

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310 
like it and it's a bit too sharp on
these<00:01:44.729> pic<00:01:44.970> parts<00:01:45.360> maybe<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.840> why<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.049> causes

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
these pic parts maybe it's why it causes

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440 
these pic parts maybe it's why it causes
slightly<00:01:46.950> la<00:01:47.130> cops<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.610> crunchy<00:01:48.060> crispy

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
slightly la cops and that crunchy crispy

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.780 
slightly la cops and that crunchy crispy
feel<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> mechanism<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.700> my

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
feel so that's the mechanism so for my

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
feel so that's the mechanism so for my
recommendation<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> recommend<00:01:52.170> getting

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
recommendation what I recommend getting

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.130 
recommendation what I recommend getting
this<00:01:52.649> cube<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> version<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.899> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this cube if you like the version one of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.319 
this cube if you like the version one of
the<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.560> yang<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> good<00:01:56.790> upgrade<00:01:56.969> for

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the one yang this is a good upgrade for

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.969 
the one yang this is a good upgrade for
it<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.600> also<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> gas<00:01:58.649> three

it and also if you like the gas three
puzzles<00:01:59.399> three<00:02:00.119> by<00:02:00.240> threes<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.079> is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
puzzles three by threes I think this is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.069
