00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
system now first of all like I said

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.709 
system now first of all like I said
seven<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.590> half<00:01:23.619> pounds<00:01:24.039> that<00:01:24.639> is<00:01:24.909> awesome

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
seven and a half pounds that is awesome

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.929 
seven and a half pounds that is awesome
because<00:01:25.869> what<00:01:26.170> our<00:01:26.259> moms<00:01:26.530> do<00:01:26.740> we<00:01:27.159> loop<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:27.850> on

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
because what our moms do we loop it on

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.169 
because what our moms do we loop it on
her<00:01:28.060> arms<00:01:28.389> when<00:01:28.539> we<00:01:28.600> carry<00:01:28.869> up<00:01:29.200> 15<00:01:30.100> 20<00:01:30.490> 25<00:01:30.909> pound

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
her arms when we carry up 15 20 25 pound

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.510 
her arms when we carry up 15 20 25 pound
baby<00:01:31.479> in<00:01:31.569> a<00:01:31.659> seat<00:01:31.899> loop<00:01:32.170> on<00:01:32.439> our<00:01:32.710> elbows<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.399> the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
baby in a seat loop on our elbows so the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.219 
baby in a seat loop on our elbows so the
seat<00:01:33.729> needs<00:01:33.969> to<00:01:34.210> be<00:01:34.299> lightweight<00:01:34.539> in<00:01:35.079> my

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
seat needs to be lightweight in my

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.840 
seat needs to be lightweight in my
opinion<00:01:35.710> so<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.069> we're<00:01:36.219> not<00:01:36.249> weighed<00:01:36.819> down

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
opinion so that we're not weighed down

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.029 
opinion so that we're not weighed down
even<00:01:37.389> more<00:01:37.420> what<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.259> like<00:01:38.409> about<00:01:38.530> it<00:01:38.740> is<00:01:38.829> there

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
even more what I like about it is there

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.669 
even more what I like about it is there
is<00:01:39.219> a<00:01:39.459> rubberized<00:01:40.240> handle<00:01:40.479> up<00:01:40.780> here<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.409> it's

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
is a rubberized handle up here so it's

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.349 
is a rubberized handle up here so it's
really<00:01:41.920> really<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:42.429> rubberized<00:01:42.850> so<00:01:43.060> if<00:01:43.179> you

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
really really it's rubberized so if you

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.359 
really really it's rubberized so if you
have<00:01:43.509> a<00:01:43.539> good<00:01:43.719> handle<00:01:44.139> on<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:44.499> but<00:01:44.920> over<00:01:45.069> here
