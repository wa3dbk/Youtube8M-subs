00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.459
 this theme 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.109
 Hand and foot 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.619
 Zingst world the traces of the soul what act merger case guess 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.230
 I'm also a night relatively new topic 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 I have been working for two years 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.759
 that's the old one 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.149
 van Gerwen has long grown aware of my partner ISAF Peter Forster 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.279
 country 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.600
 bring together 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.450
 this book form works 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 that a wonderful possibility 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.780
 who have shown me these last years already 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.110
 In a very simple way Philipp Kiefer know about himself valued 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.539
 alone 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.870
 the hands can say so much about us 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 I was surprised what my hands say about me 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.199
 we know 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.199
 for the first time she wants to decide who left or right handed 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.240
 especially important thing a paternity test can show that 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.490
 active hand 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.310
 is the 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.790
 which now announced every right-handed person with me 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 but many are not quite ignite Sumann intrepid 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.230
 Left-hander actually 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.510
 would mean a big life decision 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.870
 in the right direction if you go to his 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.720
 what is sent and how it is sent is how it is sent 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.380
 left handed 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.870
 sent left and measures things with left 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.150
 the next step would be to look at which item match ours 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.100
 hands 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.790
 is that a practical he disguises the pragmatist 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 or is it more one 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.510
 water tap 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.130
 the well-known Lingen 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.480
 Wants to express feelings 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.980
 would tend to caress 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.560
 it is a fiery hand where the fingers are short flames of a strong hand 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.790
 create interests of the people distinguishes 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.770
 SSL air hand 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.630
 the latte 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 Air locks also paint in the air naturally 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 For this too, he puts his tables people 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.169
 and then combs watch the finals 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.529
 Do not avoid besides many primal principle assign thumbs the Mars principle 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.519
 Index finger the logical principle 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.519
 Middle finger whose Saturn them principle 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.200
 Ring finger summer Principle Dolphins the Märker principle he blessed long as 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.969
 We then have children with this particular clock prince-environment we will find 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.890
 the Venusberg with many principles 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.490
 in the moon mountain opposite 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.739
 everything would 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.949
 Kan wants to look at the fingertips 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.959
 which many laces feel then push the world we will notice 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.460
 our fingertips are usually not spiky because there are people out there 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.520
 pretty corrosive and can again be honed closer to the other rounds 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.209
 Fingertips tapping the diplomatic 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.639
 and there are also those with the tip of your fingers go 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.459
 we can look at the fingerprints 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.469
 we have 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.899
 actually a wonderful in the fingerprints 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.269
 Tool to recognize ourselves 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.059
 for the citizens suspecting 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.759
 Sprints God a year the fingerprints around a person completely 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.039
 clearly identifiable 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.339
 and we can fingerprint our life task 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.259
 identify 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:19.959
 four essential criteria for this 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.609
 Loops shapes 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:23.989
 circular 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.259
 Fingerprint circular fingerprint 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:28.660
 Trees or Vilbel 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.619
 very easy 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.249
 to look up the traces of the soul as well 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:33.739
 and then you can see each other 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.659
 The move when the loops then outweighs this corresponding 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.879
 life theme 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.869
 outweighs me though 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:43.130
 or do I now have an essential topic with the circles 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.989
 then I am fixed there 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.049
 Servette a big hassle 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.049
 with psychotherapy in a possible with drugs 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.640
 what to find what she is not the job of a man 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.670
 It's so easy in the evenings and fingerprints that still keep me 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.229
 are recorded 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.409
 and with the fingers we have now it does not seem differentiated system 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.449
 Content the two years version left-right 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.390
 the four elements 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.909
 the 7 classic only principles 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.909
 and then these four 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.199
 Sign fingerprints 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.149
 and even more exciting 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.049
 are actually the feet 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.499
 because actually the fingers are 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:24.439
 Of course the manipulation would not be exposed as it would be said so sparingly 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.309
 only with manicure but all sorts 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:27.870
 with goals 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.169
 but so much the cases looked a lot of time on it 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.249
 to change the tenants 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.020
 They stay very honest if you see so 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.139
 which principles areas must be bent 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.860
 where the fingers are bent and so on known to show a lot 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.009
 the feet show even more 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.770
 Hands show our relationship to the world 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.840
 how we access them as they get under control and their feet show who 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.729
 in the world stand «our understanding of law 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.150
 and since 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.390
 is a lot more honesty 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.400
 in the game 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.469
 simply because we do not care much about it 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.430
 the manipulation ISI up there is simply where we came from 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.639
 the honest at 4 then we can again correspond to the elements 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.300
 to arrange our feet 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.279
 to see what foot arch we have 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.709
 how safe and firm we are in the world we can see ours 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.950
 From the angle are also for the Premier Awards Shell or civil law 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.439
 always give up here 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.860
 all that could or something 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.620
 very easy to see 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.430
 Also, as the 10 associated with each they had exciting theme 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.449
 So there we see a grief Zehelein wanted to see in the big 10 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:40.319
 across from 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.479
 we see arise the kur-trust Klein 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.279
 and in another little movie the later the fear 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.599
 we have creativity 10 we have a love and a affection scene 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.380
 there is really a lot there 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.730
 which gives us direct information as we do with big essentials of life 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.949
 bypass 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.680
 and again Dior as we go to things 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.680
 Master Celtic Antic 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.389
 pretty direct and aggressive or so it is very diplomatic 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.610
 prompt 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.979
 or just game and things are amazed 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.740
 there is something very nice to see 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.069
 are the 10th 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.189
 formally dammed 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:24.409
 there will be jamming on the topics 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.149
 There are deep skidelsky shapes that are very easy to image 

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:33.050
 translate them we can read as we do so in the world 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.189
 on the way 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.210
 A total of 1 of the simplest diagnostics were with 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.879
 very obvious to me and in the 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.010
 result of 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.760
 Clapper Mirror of the soul 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.119
 directly swinging 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:48.229
 Now, reading from the face has left us face to face 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:49.919
 written 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.330
 Craftsmen go a little deeper 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.409
 because we could 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:55.659
 something in our hands 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:56.820
 given is 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.699
 the hands are laid 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.699
 For example, seeing the chains 400 times like we do with others 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.869
 act together 

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:05.620
 No we stop hindering 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.150
 countless concerts - are it handicapped 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.639
 Look ahead to how are my hands and the elements 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.639
 and every partner's weight is already very much over it 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.649
 Arndt, I can see it like me 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:21.979
 The world is getting on my feet 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.389
 a wonderful with goals 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.270
 the traces of the soul what hand and foot and is 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.949
 she will tell us 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.879
 about our so are our life's tasks 

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.939
 if I heartily recommend him 

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.729
 the traces of the soul 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:38.319
 the hand and foot 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:39.370
 warned betrayed
