00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.250 
been trying my best to just just keep up
with<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.340> pace<00:03:39.370> but<00:03:39.850> so<00:03:40.750> far<00:03:40.930> it's<00:03:41.140> been

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
with the pace but so far it's been

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.380 
with the pace but so far it's been
really<00:03:41.440> well<00:03:41.710> what<00:03:42.130> makes<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.460> challenge<00:03:42.850> I'd

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
really well what makes a challenge I'd

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.550 
really well what makes a challenge I'd
say<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.810> biggest<00:03:43.840> challenge<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.530> just

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
say the biggest challenge is just

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.620 
say the biggest challenge is just
adjusting<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.670> speed<00:03:45.940> really<00:03:46.240> you<00:03:46.450> know

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
adjusting to the speed really you know

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.010 
adjusting to the speed really you know
it<00:03:47.140> only<00:03:47.260> takes<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.800> few<00:03:48.660> practices<00:03:49.660> here<00:03:49.900> and

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
it only takes a few practices here and

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.020 
it only takes a few practices here and
there<00:03:50.140> but<00:03:50.280> once<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.370> get<00:03:51.460> it<00:03:51.580> down<00:03:51.610> it's<00:03:52.000> just

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
there but once you get it down it's just

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.990 
there but once you get it down it's just
playing<00:03:52.330> football<00:03:52.540> it's<00:03:52.930> it's<00:03:53.680> any<00:03:53.950> level

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.060
