00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
between I think 25 and 27 dollars so i

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.200 
between I think 25 and 27 dollars so i
think<00:00:54.899> i<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.020> they're<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.640> 2650<00:00:56.640> or

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
think i think they're like 2650 or

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
think i think they're like 2650 or
something<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:58.219> but<00:00:59.690> it's<00:01:00.690> half<00:01:00.960> off<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
something like that but it's half off so

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.719 
something like that but it's half off so
paying<00:01:02.670> half<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.729> naive

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
paying half of that so that's like naive

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.770 
paying half of that so that's like naive
and<00:01:06.030> 15<00:01:06.450> bucks<00:01:07.100> for<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> set<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> wheels<00:01:08.780> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and 15 bucks for a set of wheels that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.469 
and 15 bucks for a set of wheels that
are<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:10.290> nice<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.040> good<00:01:11.700> quality<00:01:12.000> fame

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

and<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> EFS<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.360> basically<00:01:15.540> stands

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and the EFS what that basically stands

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.469 
and the EFS what that basically stands
for<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.439> engineered<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.950> slide<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:18.299> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
for is engineered for slide but you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.359 
for is engineered for slide but you
would<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:19.259> me<00:01:19.439> usually<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.189> like

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
would think like me usually if it's like

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
would think like me usually if it's like
oh<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.090> sliding<00:01:21.630> uh<00:01:21.659> isn't<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
oh it's a will for sliding uh isn't that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.080 
oh it's a will for sliding uh isn't that
going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> bit<00:01:23.130> clattering<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> feel

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
going to be a bit clattering and feel

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330 
going to be a bit clattering and feel
really<00:01:24.570> hard<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:25.830> probably<00:01:26.040> end<00:01:26.250> up

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
really hard and I would probably end up

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.330 
really hard and I would probably end up
slipping<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.909> lot<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.570> tricks<00:01:28.130> with<00:01:29.130> better

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
