 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.040
 mac skill tutorial or 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.199
 today we will learn how to share 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 any file so that they 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.760
 be accessible to other people 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.730
 who are connected to your network 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.140
 so to share a file you have to 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.670
 first create a new one 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.439
 you can go faster 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.410
 right click and choose read the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.680
 information and tick the box folders 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.680
 shared 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.870
 so when your coach is box he will be 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 default shared read-only 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.160
 that is, people will be able to 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.350
 access but can only 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.360
 view its content if you wish 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.969
 change his rights he must go in 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.340
 system preferences 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.469
 click on sharing and find yourself 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.719
 so here in the file sharing 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.520
 find you here the folder that I 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.040
 have just created 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 so as I told you he is in 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.140
 reading writing proves even what is 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.189
 normal but it's read-only for 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.119
 other people who want to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.710
 access you can decide to give a 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.630
 right in reading writing ie 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.250
 that people will be able to do everything 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.990
 say delete the files that there 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.100
 find in add consulted etc so 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.150
 read-only will allow access 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.530
 only in reading ie 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.540
 that they will also be able to visualize 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.180
 files found there 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.680
 you can choose write only 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 so that's it transforms this folder into 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 drop boxes people will be able to 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.159
 dragging elements but will not be able to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.470
 not access the contents of the folder have 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.560
 forbidden access that's to use for 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.200
 more specific cases 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.799
 So here we are going to leave we will choose 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700
 reading writing for all so it's up to 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.619
 say all the people who are 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.149
 connected to the network and you see here 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.000
 that you already have a folder that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.369

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.750
 precisely to allow people 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.440
 to send you files through 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.909
