00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
knobby here and then your new coals are
started<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.490> basically<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.939> my<00:02:00.020> this

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
started up and basically this is my this

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.630 
started up and basically this is my this
design<00:02:01.619> came<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.610> three<00:02:03.540> different

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
design came out of like three different

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.639 
design came out of like three different
three<00:02:05.640> different<00:02:05.729> design<00:02:06.240> cues<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.259> ended

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
three different design cues and I ended

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.740 
three different design cues and I ended
up<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.209> fixing<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:09.599> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
up just just fixing on this because it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.480 
up just just fixing on this because it
was<00:02:09.869> easier

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
was easier

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.090 
was easier
however<00:02:11.120> Italy<00:02:11.420> was<00:02:11.540> going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.590> solid

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
however Italy was going to just do solid

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.420 
however Italy was going to just do solid
tiles<00:02:13.720> along<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> whole<00:02:15.110> thing<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.160> ended

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
tiles along the whole thing but it ended

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.050 
tiles along the whole thing but it ended
up<00:02:16.580> not<00:02:17.020> not<00:02:18.020> coming<00:02:18.320> out<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.680> way<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:20.030> I

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
up not not coming out that way so I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.910 
up not not coming out that way so I
ended<00:02:20.360> up<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:20.900> breaking<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.290> tiles<00:02:21.740> had

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
ended up just breaking up the tiles had

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.010 
ended up just breaking up the tiles had
some<00:02:22.070> Mexican<00:02:22.430> tile<00:02:22.780> mixed<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.870> with<00:02:23.960> some

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
some Mexican tile mixed it with some

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.310 
some Mexican tile mixed it with some
white<00:02:24.350> tile<00:02:24.680> I'm<00:02:25.550> just<00:02:25.700> kind<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.020> did<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.230> I'm

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
white tile I'm just kind of did that I'm

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.860 
white tile I'm just kind of did that I'm
not<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> very<00:02:27.770> artistic<00:02:28.490> person<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.450> did

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
not a very artistic person so I just did

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.160 
not a very artistic person so I just did
what<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.050> thought<00:02:30.320> looked<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.830> best<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:32.170> so

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
more of a more of an indirect heat you

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.740 
more of a more of an indirect heat you
can<00:03:39.770> put<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.950> little<00:03:40.220> water<00:03:40.400> pan<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:41.150> there<00:03:41.420> or

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
can put a little water pan in there or

there and turns it into a water smoker
I<00:03:49.030> can't<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.420> chunks<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.840> I've<00:03:50.960> been<00:03:51.050> using

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
I can't the chunks that I've been using

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.430 
I can't the chunks that I've been using
or<00:03:51.560> two<00:03:51.910> are<00:03:52.910> too<00:03:53.120> big<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.720> stick<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.290> these

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.190 
or two are too big to stick in these
side<00:03:54.710> holes<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:55.970> basically<00:03:56.300> just<00:03:56.540> took<00:03:57.020> out

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
side holes so I basically just took out

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.740 
side holes so I basically just took out
the<00:03:57.320> water<00:03:57.530> pan<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.550> I've<00:03:58.910> just<00:03:59.060> been<00:03:59.180> filling

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the water pan and I've just been filling

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.450 
the water pan and I've just been filling
the<00:03:59.900> bigger<00:04:00.410> chunks<00:04:00.860> in<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.310> then<00:04:01.400> I

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
the bigger chunks in there and then I

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.090 
the bigger chunks in there and then I
