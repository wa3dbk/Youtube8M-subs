such<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.640> complex<00:03:33.180> character<00:03:33.540> actually

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
such a complex character actually

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.540 
such a complex character actually
because<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.470> think<00:03:34.739> she's<00:03:34.950> one<00:03:35.160> thing<00:03:35.400> and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
because you think she's one thing and

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.809 
because you think she's one thing and
then<00:03:35.640> she's<00:03:35.850> something<00:03:36.180> else<00:03:36.270> so<00:03:37.640> there<00:03:38.640> it

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
then she's something else so there it

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.600 
then she's something else so there it
was<00:03:38.850> neat<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.360> be<00:03:39.660> able<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.200> implant<00:03:40.830> little

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
was neat to be able to implant little

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.820 
was neat to be able to implant little
things<00:03:41.850> into<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.209> performance<00:03:42.750> along<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
things into the performance along the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.460 
things into the performance along the
way<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.130> may<00:03:44.700> seem<00:03:45.060> odd<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.630> then<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:46.350> know

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
way that may seem odd and then you know

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.130 
way that may seem odd and then you know
at<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.709> end<00:03:46.860> you<00:03:47.010> understand<00:03:47.489> why<00:03:48.140> human

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
at the end you understand why human

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.979 
at the end you understand why human
bodies<00:03:49.610> take<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.730> lot<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.910> getting<00:03:51.180> used<00:03:51.330> to

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989
