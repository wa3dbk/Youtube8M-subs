00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
 Why 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.869
 winnie 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.489
 in the world 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.300
 such 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 today the minister 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.220
 visit 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.069
 for the moment the vote is settling 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:36.869
 these botrytis this noble so the threat it does not worry me 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.830
 3 besides this delicious 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400
 it's a huge constant fire 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.360
 at stake because the crisis is magnificent 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 without opinion 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.050
 de Gaulle 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 it must be said that a hiding place of this regularity there you will not see 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.550
 often in a vacuum 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.040
 that's almost 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 this sort that is done here it's really minute bubbles on 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.690
 urgent it's really at the top of the seam 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.690
 this is really beautiful 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.440
 and here they are yahiya are these golden reflections some small reflections 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.920
 green the data overall it's born a big crowd where I've been 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.760
 of fact mature 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.830
 and this honesty of maturity not just give that freshness 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.450
 she also puts this complexity and this 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.380
 the aromatic diversity that is dear to us 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.450
 so that the vintage in white as we can see looks very beautiful 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.510
 the unfortunately quantity and it will be lower 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.390
 really a little more of this year clearly 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 and to make a good harvest shot 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.140
 why do you have it bad weather plus it's dry 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.290
 the crowd but the end finally it's a very complicated year legault backlot 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.250
 beat the mans 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.770
 what's important is the grapes is so normal that pick them up to the good 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.860
 moment 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.219
 as they mature 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.459
 we're going to do that after a very nice vintage who who follows 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.369
 this follows since May 2009 and 2010 they are three very vigilant so 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.389
 I do not judge 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.389
 but think makes a very very beautiful another very good vintage 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.429
 another very beautiful vintage of white and ski 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:31.419
 that no because it would be expensive hours should surprise years in time 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.849
 I have a very beautiful city there are tolls that are around three big 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.119
 that the very fresh 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.259
 and I like the freshness in white wines 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:42.499
 mid-February this is the 10th aromatic side of these seeds well 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.839
 golden that are there 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.179
 each chapter brings a little bit yes abidjan 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:52.589
 it was written that this gives the aromatic complexity the grapes a 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.959
 little bit more light yet given the coolness to take a look too much 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.619
 but the aromatic side the future of its reserves soon 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.799
 and it is this mixture 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.249
 of his grapes a little weaker 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:09.469
 and the others it's a little bit more golden that will give this complexity 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.809
 in Brazil 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.479
 but the 2011 vintage saÃ¯d plans are made 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.279
 and we know what we have to do 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.699
 in the box even though 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.209
 however at a press point 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.509
 tom pyatt 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.509
 though 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.969
 garage 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:39.729
 Yes
