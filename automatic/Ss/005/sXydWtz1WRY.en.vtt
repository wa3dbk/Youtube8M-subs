00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.510
 remove makeup but you can see that 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:55.140
 can use it for several more things 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:59.190
 and what I do is in a cotton quoted 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.200
 seconds actually two seconds deal 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.880
 do not let the high time 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.909
 I like to use almond oil because 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 It is very soft and gentle with my skin the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.090
 Eye skin is very thin and much more 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.840
 delicate than in other parts of the face 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.880
 so I try to be the gentlest 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.880
 possible with those areas 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.729

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.100

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.019

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.640

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.170
 What I do is clean my face with this 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.170
 request cleaning milk 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.430

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.330

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.970
 This virgin milk is much more 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.350

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.840
 because it leaves my skin too 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.200
