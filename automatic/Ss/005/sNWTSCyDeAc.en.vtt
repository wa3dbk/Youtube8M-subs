00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
table if we if you do well and then at

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.340 
table if we if you do well and then at
the<00:00:17.730> end<00:00:17.760> we're<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> see<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.930> hope<00:00:19.140> that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the end we're going to see we hope that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.290 
the end we're going to see we hope that
we're<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> win<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> league<00:00:20.310> because<00:00:20.640> we

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
we're going to win the league because we

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
we're going to win the league because we
believe<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.720> us<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.260> think<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.279> are<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
believe in us and I think we are the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.250 
believe in us and I think we are the
best<00:00:24.830> we<00:00:25.830> seem<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.210> sit<00:00:27.210> back<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:27.840> bit

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
best we seem to sit back a little bit

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.460 
best we seem to sit back a little bit
after<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.400> first<00:00:29.730> goal<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.390> those<00:00:30.869> two<00:00:31.140> goals

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
after the first goal but those two goals

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
after the first goal but those two goals
before<00:00:32.460> half-time<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:33.329> how<00:00:33.420> important<00:00:33.899> were

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
before half-time just how important were

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.319 
before half-time just how important were
they<00:00:34.260> yeah<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.340> very<00:00:35.790> important

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
they yeah that was very important

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.569 
they yeah that was very important
because<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.809> think<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.140> started<00:00:37.530> well<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.920> then

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
because I think we started well and then

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.720 
because I think we started well and then
that<00:00:38.969> go<00:00:39.180> from<00:00:39.809> penalty<00:00:40.309> from<00:00:41.309> from

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
that go from penalty from from

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.279 
that go from penalty from from
Southampton<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:45.260> was<00:00:46.260> very

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
Southampton was was like was very

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
Southampton was was like was very
difficult<00:00:46.649> because<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.219> was<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:47.670> 38th

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
difficult because it was I think 38th

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.500 
difficult because it was I think 38th
minute<00:00:49.070> but<00:00:50.070> after<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.850> show<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.360> we

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
minute but after that we show that we

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.410 
minute but after that we show that we
are<00:00:51.539> big<00:00:51.930> chart<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.520> are<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.969> very<00:00:54.329> good
