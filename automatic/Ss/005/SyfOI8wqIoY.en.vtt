out<00:00:13.130> which<00:00:14.130> prevented<00:00:14.580> me<00:00:14.759> from<00:00:14.790> doing<00:00:15.179> it

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
out which prevented me from doing it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.800

sign<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.410> just<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.710> sealing<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.630> so<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.660> just
