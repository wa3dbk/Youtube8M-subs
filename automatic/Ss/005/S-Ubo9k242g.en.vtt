again when this ball is coming in watch
my<00:04:09.650> right<00:04:09.859> shoulder<00:04:10.099> does<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.549> works<00:04:10.790> closer

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
my right shoulder does it works closer

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.960 
my right shoulder does it works closer
to<00:04:11.569> what<00:04:11.750> I'm<00:04:11.840> about<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.260> hit<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.190> just<00:04:13.549> like<00:04:13.790> in

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
to what I'm about to hit so just like in

little too short to hit but you can see

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.430 
little too short to hit but you can see
my<00:04:18.829> point<00:04:19.070> here<00:04:19.370> as<00:04:19.519> poor<00:04:20.449> play<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.870> this<00:04:21.139> way

my point here as poor play is this way

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.620 
my point here as poor play is this way
where<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.250> club<00:04:22.639> or<00:04:22.849> in<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:23.210> case<00:04:23.419> the

the correct place so you can hit the
golf<00:04:50.570> ball<00:04:50.659> and<00:04:51.080> then<00:04:51.680> take<00:04:51.979> a<00:04:52.009> divot<00:04:52.310> because

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
golf ball and then take a divot because

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.060 
golf ball and then take a divot because
in<00:04:53.150> baseball<00:04:53.659> you're<00:04:54.080> not<00:04:54.259> holding<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.889> bat

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
in baseball you're not holding the bat

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.980 
in baseball you're not holding the bat
unless<00:04:55.490> it's<00:04:55.729> a<00:04:55.820> check<00:04:56.090> swing<00:04:56.240> you're

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
unless it's a check swing you're

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.200 
unless it's a check swing you're
swinging<00:04:57.590> away<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:58.130> some<00:04:58.699> were<00:04:58.849> in<00:04:59.000> here

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
swinging away and some were in here

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.580 
swinging away and some were in here
guess<00:04:59.509> what<00:04:59.720> you'd<00:04:59.870> have<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.199> great

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
guess what you'd have that great

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.370 
guess what you'd have that great
alignment<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.789> all<00:05:02.030> good<00:05:02.539> batters<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.139> by

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
alignment that all good batters and by

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.830 
alignment that all good batters and by
the<00:05:03.440> way<00:05:03.650> all<00:05:03.889> good<00:05:04.250> golfers<00:05:04.729> have<00:05:05.000> so<00:05:05.659> what

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
the way all good golfers have so what

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.550 
the way all good golfers have so what
are<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:07.000> prerequisites<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:08.450> well<00:05:09.349> one

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
are the prerequisites to that well one

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.930 
are the prerequisites to that well one
is<00:05:09.800> our<00:05:10.279> weight<00:05:10.520> has<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.849> be<00:05:11.060> left

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
is our weight has to be left

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.250 
is our weight has to be left
and<00:05:12.030> my<00:05:12.180> other<00:05:12.270> tips<00:05:12.600> I've<00:05:12.780> talked<00:05:13.020> about

and learning how to hit this little
punch<00:06:35.800> shot<00:06:36.100> and<00:06:36.610> guess<00:06:36.850> what<00:06:37.120> we<00:06:37.390> had<00:06:37.600> ball

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350

punch shot and guess what we had ball
turf<00:06:39.160> contact<00:06:39.970> so<00:06:40.690> very<00:06:41.110> very<00:06:41.440> vital<00:06:41.740> on<00:06:42.040> how

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
turf contact so very very vital on how

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.930 
turf contact so very very vital on how
to<00:06:42.910> strike<00:06:43.420> the<00:06:43.600> golf<00:06:43.810> ball<00:06:44.340> successfully<00:06:45.340> we

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
to strike the golf ball successfully we

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.570 
to strike the golf ball successfully we
have<00:06:46.180> to<00:06:46.390> get<00:06:46.570> our<00:06:46.690> weight<00:06:46.930> left<00:06:47.620> you<00:06:48.340> didn't

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
have to get our weight left you didn't

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.160 
have to get our weight left you didn't
see<00:06:48.700> my<00:06:48.910> head<00:06:49.180> and<00:06:49.360> everything<00:06:49.630> go<00:06:49.780> with<00:06:49.990> me

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
see my head and everything go with me

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.140 
see my head and everything go with me
but<00:06:50.710> it's<00:06:50.890> really<00:06:50.980> important<00:06:51.850> to<00:06:51.940> learn<00:06:52.090> how

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150

you<00:06:55.750> already<00:06:56.020> know<00:06:56.350> how<00:06:56.650> to<00:06:56.680> do<00:06:56.950> well<00:06:57.130> when<00:06:57.400> you

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
you already know how to do well when you

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.450 
you already know how to do well when you
throw<00:06:57.790> a<00:06:57.820> football<00:06:58.150> when<00:06:59.080> you<00:06:59.230> use<00:07:00.040> a<00:07:00.070> baseball
