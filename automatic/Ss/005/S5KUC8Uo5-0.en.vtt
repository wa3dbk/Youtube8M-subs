 they have play 4 that we are going to see what wave 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.550
 his accomplices were of passing position 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.670
 number 7 I'm not going very well to say or 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.980
 mechanical and the light poster we go with 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.510
 all 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.580
 for here perfect and here we make a 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.940
 perfect braking in that environment of 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.970
 wonder 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.100
 for which 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.270
 more super fast the compis already go 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.630
 ahead 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.870
 the truth that they started super powerful 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.310
 that I stayed here 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.350
 yes that's right there's already first place so 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.460

 there we are my compis achieving the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.500
