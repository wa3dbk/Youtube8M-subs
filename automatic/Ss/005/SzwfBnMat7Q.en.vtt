and kept them Todd clever who's a pretty
charismatic<00:02:36.420> guy<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.530> think<00:02:37.920> we're<00:02:38.040> with<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
charismatic guy so I think we're with a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.130 
charismatic guy so I think we're with a
reasonable<00:02:38.640> chance<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:39.030> beating<00:02:39.210> some<00:02:39.960> over

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
reasonable chance of beating some over

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220 
reasonable chance of beating some over
Scotland<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.830> Japan<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.820> then<00:02:42.180> South<00:02:42.840> Africa

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
Scotland and Japan and then South Africa

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.680 
Scotland and Japan and then South Africa
with<00:02:43.470> twice<00:02:43.920> world<00:02:44.160> champions<00:02:44.580> we've<00:02:45.510> got

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
with twice world champions we've got

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.210 
with twice world champions we've got
some<00:02:45.810> good<00:02:45.960> momentum<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.560> had<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> few<00:02:47.070> good

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
some good momentum and had a few good

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.190 
some good momentum and had a few good
wins<00:02:47.430> over<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.700> last<00:02:47.910> year<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.690> think<00:02:48.990> we'll

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
wins over the last year so I think we'll

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:00.570 
wins over the last year so I think we'll
be<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.440> good<00:02:49.590> place<00:02:49.710> come<00:02:50.070> 2015
