00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.980
 marakasi you watch the show chic 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.679
 position issue 78 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 and the first location is on 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.650
 mosquito map in square f4 and you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.920
 ipad sa 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.590
 preferably with a good overview from here you 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.550
 will be able to fire quite large 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.920
 the territory itself is small cardboard 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.890
 and therefore from both positions you can 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.309
 get so many opponents 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.530
 besides you will be extremely difficult 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.290
 light up because there are a lot of bushes 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.719
 and plus affects your disguise but 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 if you even light up you can 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.899
 very quickly move down and hide 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.390
 behind the main terrain 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.940
 a disadvantage of this position, I think that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.840
 that if opponents start to push and this 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 direction 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.239
 then naturally they will disturb you aspen 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.719
 there will be no allies left then 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.250
 then obviously you will have to leave here but 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.799
 so generally the normal position goes further 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.780
 very vigorous tactics on the map of the south 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.360
 shore in square f6 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.090
 here you need to go on a fast tank in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.920
 the beginning of the battle here you can meet 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.920
 resistance is desirable as possible 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 faster then destroy the enemy or 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.110
 go straight to the tactics position 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 quite risky and because on 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.689
 center frequency meet opponents 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.900
 so if you have a fast car 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.250
 better this way right away 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.670
 climb this hill 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.520
 Well, that's basically there is this 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.950
 position where you can fire 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.250
 enemies from here highlight them somehow 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.590
 trolling is generally very interesting 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.500
 as you can see 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.200
 After all, the enemy on kvass already fell for 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.289
 this provocation and begins to ram 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.229
 of our e25 which is very brave here 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.450
 fights of course he was lucky that the enemies 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.759
 not much on the center 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.729
 but still this moment I decided 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.269
 show you more because like this 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.250
 not everyone can play 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.650
 surely there was luck in it 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.340
 moment but still here and so go 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.250
 on the center and take this position in my 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.829
 it's very cool and from here how are you 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.349
 can see you can cram from the back 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.410
 the enemy then there is a little 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.900
 somewhat to hide 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.329
 highlight opponents in general tactics 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.470
 very interesting and enjoy those 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.489
 who likes cheerfully 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.970
 rashit next position is on 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.410
 map of Kharkov e8 square and you 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.489
 need inconspicuous pt-sau for example 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.519
 E25 or Barce 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.889
 and from here you can shoot perfectly 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.480
 enemies that glow in the apron of this 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:04.670
 road position is really simple but 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.440
 effective because enemies don't see 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.769
 because there are so many ahead 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.500
 bushes and trees that cover you 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.310
 thus you can shoot at enemies 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.579
 and not lighten up but naturally for this 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.459
 you will need a very subtle sa 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.799
 such as borschik but if someone from 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.359
 enemies will drive very close as 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.919
 for example panther 2 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:33.560
 the chance of light will be extremely high well 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:36.260
 as well as the place is very good allows 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.109
 inflict a lot of damage need only 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.860
 so that someone has allies highlighted 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:45.170
 enemies but in most cases 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.500
 constantly someone shines and you remain 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.260
 only inflict damage on us talking 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.270
 interesting position for rock climbers then 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.750
 there are up to players who like to climb 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.140
 on all sorts of unusual places and is 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.630
 it is on the map mines in square j9 you 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.790
 need a fast tank and a little 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.010
 patience 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.800
 perhaps of course you will be a little here 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.990
 stuck but after a while all 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.390
 you climb up from here and you 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.880
 will be able to shoot at enemies who 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.190
 attacking from the village that is if they 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.669
 snuggled up here to that mountain you can with 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.500
 ease of damage and very important 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.740
 that from here you can get 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.230
 opponents who climbed the mountain 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.360
 however, they are unlikely to expect that 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.200
 from here you will shoot at him 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.300
 the most you will easily hit them and this 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.669
 will be very good 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.890
 also worth noting that here you are 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.800
 you can hide very easily 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.320
 because the terrain is uneven and small 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.720
 the tank will easily find a place where he is 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.350
 will be able to hide from the shots of opponents 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.200
 if you drive on there you can go 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.290
 But in such a hole in where you can again 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.440
 easy to hide lean out and shoot 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.070
 On opponents in general, a great place 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.990
 then you will be difficult to destroy 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.120
 opponents naturally get here 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.930
 most likely will not be able to take it from them 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.030
 too much time and you can 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.460
 from here it's very good to shoot at them 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.840
 the whole place is just gorgeous 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.699
 and the last position today is 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:31.940
 on the map is the pearl river in j9 square 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:35.479
 The place is suitable for inconspicuous signed with 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.220
 good vertical angles i 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.000
 himself actually used this 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.729
 position and it impressed me seemed 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.789
 would be a very simple place but at low 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:50.419
 levels can then become very 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:53.479
 defend well the thing is playing 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.930
 from these bushes you can shine well and 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.539
 at the same time do not shine yourself that is, you 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.150
 you can shoot at enemies 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.630
 who are starting to drive to your base 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.220
 from here you are her principle quite well 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.310
 shoot only in some places 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.370
 and the blind zone for you and so from here you 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.430
 very good can throw enemies on 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.909
 such tanks as t29 for example, you can 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.970
 drive off a little from the bushes and perfectly 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:25.789
 safe to shoot blind tanks by 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.530
 At least I did 4 frags and 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:30.229
 i wasnâ€™t even lit up 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.750
 but then time ran out because my 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.150
 the team starred in the general cool place 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.469
 I advise everyone if you do not have such 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:42.430
 your team situation has merged 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:45.530
 tom go here and bend over 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.289
