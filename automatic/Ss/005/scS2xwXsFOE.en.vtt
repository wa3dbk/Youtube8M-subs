so<00:01:32.679> i'll<00:01:32.920> put<00:01:33.069> tests<00:01:33.459> with<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.729> password<00:01:34.209> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
so i'll put tests with the password and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.639 
so i'll put tests with the password and
you<00:01:35.799> always<00:01:35.979> want<00:01:36.219> to<00:01:36.280> test<00:01:36.459> your<00:01:36.579> connection

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
you always want to test your connection

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.690 
you always want to test your connection
obviously<00:01:38.649> in<00:01:38.829> this<00:01:38.979> case<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.429> see<00:01:39.609> it

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
obviously in this case you see it

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.639 
obviously in this case you see it
testing<00:01:40.179> it's<00:01:40.509> not<00:01:40.719> going<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:40.990> go<00:01:41.079> do<00:01:41.289> anything

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
testing it's not going to go do anything

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.550 
testing it's not going to go do anything
because<00:01:41.829> this<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.280> just<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.640> test<00:01:42.880> if<00:01:43.299> you<00:01:44.229> put

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
because this is just the test if you put

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.199 
because this is just the test if you put
in<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.739> current<00:01:45.009> password<00:01:45.189> and<00:01:45.610> setting<00:01:46.090> is

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
in the current password and setting is

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:47.999 
in the current password and setting is
