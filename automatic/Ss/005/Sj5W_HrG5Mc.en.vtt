00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:08.080
 goodbye to you but how goodbye 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.540
 we didn't say much goodbye we went to 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.330
 second advertising sat volcano gigabyte 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.830
 with scart new course is shorter all garbage with 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.289
 us clement who just won 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.800
 summit for you first time for two 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.740
 your titles 2 1 2 championship for 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.170
 a week of 200 thousand dollars we decided straight 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.170
 which is very good you feel 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.689
 now everything is cool now let's say 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.970
 so what has changed and what has changed is 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.760
 we tried wrong something 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.220
 do before starladder put for and 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.440
 on the captain slot and you know, we 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.130
 there were so many problems that people did not 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.940
 understand what they do not want to play by name 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.870
 as if for 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.579
 or gustav and if you put on 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.520
 captain slot then you yourself know 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.370
 strategy is better than others then it 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.559
 It means that you yourself think more and you 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.789
 play better maybe for it was 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.770
 too much but for gustav 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.499
 like a normal topic that just 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.240
 captain the game and he plays better than 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:12.759
 other tournaments now because i will say 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.270
 how u so i play better when i to 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.450
 food okay yes because it is always 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.889
 here 5 also plays better anyway 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.069
 when he is a captain and not someone else 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:27.069
 it's just natural you have to 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:30.039
 you know what to do better than 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.659
 all others you pay much attention to this 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.929
 such of course he does not repent always when 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.579
 you 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.159
 especially when you are in the world, here is how 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.889
 captains in a world that plays media 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.590
 Yes, as of the four do not have them 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:45.669
 in fact very mania was once 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.130
 Burning was once with 4 now again s4 

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:50.619
 well actually there we discussed here 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.139
 five days almost constantly until that 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.939
 sheep write on the internet and so on oh my 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.439
 drink it not banned oh god bought something from 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.630
 people just in the head habit still 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.130
 so far it all makes buy well here here 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.569
 in a nutshell, Masha let it go like you 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.059
 looks like coordination then 4 that is 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.709
 You pike together, but the game is clear 

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:07.179
 corner what is he really or somehow 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.300
 their help as it happens 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.160
 coordinates to 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.590
 how to play better this is best 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.630
 when everyone can talk with us 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.270
 there were some problems that arthur and i 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.120
 I wanted to do some other things, but I 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.470
 I think even if I was now captain 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.040
 us, these problems would not have been 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:36.290
 or or even for if the lessons are great with us 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.970
 how better the strategy is now so something 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.500
 asked but I'm just in command with you 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.840
 the most important thing is not this fight 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 canon well i will tell some heroes this 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.860
 as art style fight situation but i am 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.890
 telling him which characters are very good 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.490
 you need to ban some things and he 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.290
 hears it the most like of all and 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.220
 from this I like to do it as if 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.380
 normal theme will come two tournaments 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.330
 two consecutive tournaments in a row varietal here 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.500
 so everything was cool and I think what else 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.290
 so it goes of course but 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.480
 but the money is shorter look watch 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.250
 new patch and 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.370
 from the last place the secret immediately to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.200
 the first twice in a row is convenient for you 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.030
 this patch well, that is, as if all but this 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.920
 or data don't know read no illidan 2 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.870
 din en i do n't like it either i don't 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.180
 I can play some kind of heroes 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.260
 Naga Siren and Terrorblade because of this 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.230
 that how would I play already how many pubs have 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.050
 I'm somewhere out there 7.2 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.630
 mr i just done still don't believe 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.550
 but of course I just played leg siren 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.440
 very much and minimum and all these 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.720
 other heroes this very strong were on 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.489
 farmer slot 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.380
 now i always lacquer this game on this 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.220
 I give naga siren 8 minutes farm 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.890
 absolutely everything but I could not farmer 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.370
 in 8 minutes I couldnâ€™t farm me 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.980
 tarasku when I fed two lines into the forest 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.980
 the door did not climb two lines forest 2 no no forest 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.040
 like this 8 minutes and I had four 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.870
 200 thousand gold is not normal but I 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.550
 understand the need to have all the same that it 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.220
 change international think change something 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:16.160
 I think I think not, but it would be better 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.810
 if they changed to be okay okay 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.120
 do not delay long before these all 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.049
 ways and so on you play this site 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.270
 Gina Red Bull 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.129
 there was so very heavy 32 and so 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.870
 further in the group stage was so 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.729
 more or less lightly then you played 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.620
 with almost all top teams 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.970
 Well, in general, here you have ahead even if 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.460
 they were torn only have a goal frankfort 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.590
 right pride international or we 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.720
 go to China if we go on m l h and 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.060
 that is, head or on mdl 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.690
 or on mlg. we had problems may 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.870
 to be with visas then we could not 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.520
 it certainly is not clear here 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.740
 Generally what I think in kendo let's go 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.190
 then frankfurt international realized 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.050
 then such a simple question for now 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.520
 moment like that what is basic 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.860
 contenders for victory on the Internet is it 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.110
 you are Chinese 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:09.530
 that's why they played so badly here 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:12.020
 who I think they are a little what could be 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.030
 dizmorali on how would you come to the tournament 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.699
 after 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.580
 the loser is like against us and why should they 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.979
 for that lost it will give morality and 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.659
 Do they immediately always pen and come 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:28.550
 here and i think vici gaming 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.650
 very cool team i think they 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.099
 should have been maybe even win this 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.300
 to the tournament but going for this that they are too 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.599
 plays aggressively 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.009
 they seem aggressive and hail but too 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.870
 aggressively i think that when they 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.300
 lost ask vampires that's not exactly 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.159
 plays very aggressively as a network but 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.199
 the best russian teams like them 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.879
 play they wake up and if you play 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.520
 some screams of the game against them they 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:54.560
 will dive you in the second minute on 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.120
 I do the same thing but because they do not 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.500
 lose they just lost 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.599
 opposite vampire they think it is 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.129
 the coolest things will do it and 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.969
 now maybe they came to this 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:07.879
 tournament u play like this but i think go and 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.639
 we don't care if you will 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.229
 such things to do this proved it 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.940
 by the way about empire you said how are you 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.849
 think this year they will succeed 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.849
 something or and na'vi will immediately 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.669
 quit navi qualification they play 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:25.000
 against and there is little chance of the Jordan 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:28.020
 United orter know it 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.450
 I think that they can take second place 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.200
 as if alonso is not much more pushing 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:38.350
 in second place they can finish the empire 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.510
 empire you didn't play lan with them 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.790
 every time we don't even galis bit her 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.540
 generally never a time when we 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.570
 were 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:51.280
 when they played some other plan we 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:53.560
 somewhere else was before sibl beat 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.840
 but they were on a starladder and you 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.200
 until the internet was going to meet they leg 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.910
 goal frankfurt don't fly china no no they 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.030
 lose qualifications 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.530
 very often such words are as in 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.500
 So what do you think about the project? 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.180
 the empire teams are very good to me they 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:15.060
 I like the way they like people too 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.720
 and they train all the time 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.080
 passports and impe 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:23.260
 every day is okay heart 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.300
