00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:42.969 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:46.030 

we<00:03:43.969> decided<00:03:44.599> against<00:03:45.110> having<00:03:45.439> having

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
we decided against having having

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.099 
we decided against having having
character<00:03:46.519> levels<00:03:46.849> or<00:03:47.030> experience<00:03:47.599> points

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
character levels or experience points

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.709 
character levels or experience points
because<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.189> usually<00:03:50.150> leads<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.510> situations

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
because that usually leads to situations

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.559 
because that usually leads to situations
where<00:03:51.469> a<00:03:51.739> player<00:03:52.340> who<00:03:52.549> puts<00:03:52.790> in<00:03:52.939> a<00:03:53.000> lot<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.180> time

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
where a player who puts in a lot of time

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.140 
where a player who puts in a lot of time
is<00:03:53.840> undefeatable<00:03:54.469> at<00:03:54.709> some<00:03:54.980> point<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.939> player

is undefeatable at some point the player

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.740 
is undefeatable at some point the player
defines<00:03:57.069> himself<00:03:58.069> only<00:03:58.340> with<00:03:59.030> those<00:03:59.209> items

something in the highest bid wins notes

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.550 
something in the highest bid wins notes
it's<00:06:06.210> more<00:06:06.419> like<00:06:06.540> a<00:06:06.570> marketplace<00:06:07.229> where<00:06:07.530> you

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
I really like about the game design is

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.200 
I really like about the game design is
that<00:06:22.080> you<00:06:22.169> can<00:06:22.380> build<00:06:23.340> your<00:06:23.520> city<00:06:23.850> that<00:06:24.090> you

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210

can<00:06:24.360> build<00:06:24.630> your<00:06:24.750> realms<00:06:25.110> that<00:06:25.590> you<00:06:25.680> can<00:06:25.860> build

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
can build your realms that you can build

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.540 
can build your realms that you can build
with<00:06:26.490> political<00:06:27.150> systems<00:06:28.130> where<00:06:29.130> at<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.520> end

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
with political systems where at the end

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.290 
with political systems where at the end
hopefully<00:06:30.210> a<00:06:31.490> armies<00:06:32.490> will<00:06:32.700> clash<00:06:33.000> as

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
just want to want to go out there and

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.570 
just want to want to go out there and
kill<00:06:51.660> something<00:06:52.140> and<00:06:52.350> you<00:06:52.680> can't<00:06:52.919> do<00:06:53.070> both<00:06:53.280> in
