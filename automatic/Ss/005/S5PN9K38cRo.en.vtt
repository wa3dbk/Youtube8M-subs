00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.010
 is 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.359
 then here in the state of the river 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:25.550
 almost divine that they think we apply 50 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.970
 home and we are doing it because 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.880
 they do not really have one time 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.430
 but it looks like a train from my old west. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.430
 simple the heart there is no secret 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.289
 It looks like we 're really in the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.110
 20s and will going to happen there is that 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.750
 story that happens to a lot of people 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.360
 in this crowd there trying to play and show 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.860
 your work until a guy appears 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.510
 wants to take advantage and in the middle of it all 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.510
 It's always that love story. 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.460
 come here to my surprise that my daughter 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.380
 It is participating the first time 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.100
 book of seven months she will appear in the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.780
 clip 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:17.040
 You will see the person plus an extra 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:19.920
 more beautiful my daughter is very cool is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.130
 our first overproduction is not 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 let's say we receive twice as much 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.530
 Neitiznot affection train music he would 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.509
 training thing to observe but he 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 brought a script so cool you do not have 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.520
 a playful thing that we love is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.020
 as an average between agents to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.899
 a sound boost 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.000
 only that the video band and the 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.470
 music itself being changed 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.080
 taking only I think very important you 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.759
 You trust the people who work 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.759
 with art and the author of the assault 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.050
 I came watching it very nice to have kiton 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.090
 last few months on YouTube a few times 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.220
 complete and then I got a script 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.830
 which obviously is a movie film 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.569
 much more different than we have 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.160
 since this team had to be done 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.289
 inside a train when gabriel arrived 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.540
 travel with all his vision to us 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.090
 talked and the production was amazing 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.490
 work to get this location to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.980
 People are five hours from the river by car. 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.319
 are two daily but I think in the hour 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.280
 that we come all fit to people 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.890
 will see how much it was worth to go to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 simpler to the heart 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.450
 I think the main idea of the clip 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 people respect the cinema world understood 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.980
 it's not making a silent movie now in 2014 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.500
 Modern HD and got to respect time 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.989
 in the location so we fought a lot 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.170
 even to be a real lease and when 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.830
 We found it here in the 7th - this Maria 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.880
 smoke guy, it's incredible, I did 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.150
 that we have all the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.670
 black and white B &amp; W monitors 4 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.170
 for three for us to feel even this 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.780
 I was impressed how it worked 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.860
 everybody went in the direction of 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.300
 art 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.230
 the entire production team was a 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.860
 perfect complement 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.650
 the atmosphere of the place also helps a lot 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.360
 in all you know the team is very cool 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.599
 everyone working together to do 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.420
 the best and this place is beautiful is poetic 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:28.080
 climate is poetic fifi ethical then doing 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.080
 very cool and legal hur 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.340
 pencil a sample of what I already said 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.090
 so it 's very interesting from the point 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.040
 from a visual view which is different from 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.650
 common he is using black and white to 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.850
 favored the climate of a bygone era and 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.880
 I think it will be enough 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.880
 interesting I think the game had 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.940
 I think it's going to be very handy. 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.440
 To stay a story is different and is 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.330
 that you are normally accustomed to seeing 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.310
 in the clips I think it's going to be and I do not have it 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.890
 I think a lot of five of us 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.140
 playing the song is a bit like a 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.880
 trail for the movie is a short I think 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.770
 a short three minute little music 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.360
 It's a silent movie and music to be the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.840
 This story track I think is more 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.840
 or less there 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.960
 the train music she already has more or less 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.639
 a blues footprint right is the letter it gives 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.770
 a move the whole story has a 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.150
 movement in the letter itself and everything to see 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.889
 this script knows everyone 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.289
 characterized by things of the time 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.669
 feeling really then it just gives 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.620
 want to play blues and 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.430
 To return and see your fun like this is 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.430
 a delight 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.919
 ayew
