00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.689
 the hangover 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:18.320
 and if we are sure it is that the car does it that start 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 you have trouble understanding 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.130
 on the contrary if going back 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.220
 it all starts when his father george weah as well as I'm a pastor's son 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.560
 I listen to you 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.380
 tame him when my father the pastor country neighbors he decides to change the 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.660
 even church life purpose these churches in general with an idea according to him 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 the revolutionaries and economic 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.180
 my father often has ideas according to him revolutionary 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.490
 alex augustine his summer he is simply to trace a species 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.330
 of Roannais newspaper of the rout for the monthly of the evidences which would bring together 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.990
 all the information of authentic eastern churches the event is 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.500
 all twittos end of match instructor a diary after day monday 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.170
 churches 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.770
 and in the end it's true that she announces such an event the car seems 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 a small pool 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.240
 how to tell the reality of things is that when he announced who 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.150
 had to judge the newspaper 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 That's what happened 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.720
 and so that's how I ended up a little bit like the big 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.760
 lucky of this event that lasts 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.960
 as you can see 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.450
 however she did not intend for me was to establish a newspaper 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.490
 but very sincerely I did not feel this diary a lot 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.720
 a little more innovative so here I decided to write a memoir 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.900
 ram memory on our church are the churches that after Sunday we try 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.099
 to push even more crazy 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.810
 why not a series 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.869
 a series this is the city of Levis 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.869
 and there I started looking for a year 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.109
 I found reds 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.889
 in fact I love you being abused by what I realized was better 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.229
 as it was already complicated 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.309
 this procedure follows I found this idea 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.099
 i'm just taking mans 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.989
 Yes 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.199
 it's a little too much down at the shelter 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.119
 but well short anyway I'll absolutely definitely be writing to this 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.289
 debt is a creator 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.559
 I'm here I thought why not our thing with my audience 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.709
 welcome to church you have to be like that just settled it sounds 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.269
 just price of church memoirs or something like that 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.289
 after I said to myself what missed a bit of bad quality 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.239
 the building do not know but it still works from the knee and why not after 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.949
 all 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.869
 if the memories of a church 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:11.109
 so that's how that series idea was born and that's how 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.039
 she was born this super catchy title punctuation the memoirs of a church 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.919
 so here it is only left to start buying from the hotel god of 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:20.909
 all that 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.909
 and the grasslands are on their way 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.049
 then I have very quickly 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.459
 ok needless to say that the generation of my parents happened 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.719
 continued in the reality of things Wednesday I got to work very 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.719
 quickly to get to Bethune 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.099
