okay<00:00:33.300> today<00:00:33.870> I'm<00:00:34.019> going<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.199> show<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.410> how<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
okay today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.829 
okay today I'm going to show you how to
modify<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:36.180> zi8<00:00:36.570> camera<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:38.460> take<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.449> step

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
modify the zi8 camera to take a step

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.660 
modify the zi8 camera to take a step
down<00:00:40.049> ring<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.549> can<00:00:41.820> put<00:00:42.739> other<00:00:43.739> lenses<00:00:44.369> on

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
down ring so you can put other lenses on

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.020 
down ring so you can put other lenses on
the<00:00:44.909> camera<00:00:45.799> now<00:00:46.799> I<00:00:46.830> saw<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.309> being<00:00:47.580> done<00:00:47.790> on

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the camera now I saw this being done on

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170 
the camera now I saw this being done on
YouTube<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.080> I<00:00:49.140> reviewed<00:00:49.699> several<00:00:50.699> forums

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
YouTube and I reviewed several forums

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.600 
YouTube and I reviewed several forums
where<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.510> been<00:00:51.659> done<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.159> people<00:00:53.460> are

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
where it's been done a lot of people are

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.270 
where it's been done a lot of people are
doing<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.180> flips<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.049> the<00:00:55.140> zi8<00:00:55.409> but

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
doing this to flips and to the zi8 but

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.450 
doing this to flips and to the zi8 but
they're<00:00:56.430> using<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.940> super<00:00:57.750> glue<00:00:57.930> which<00:00:58.409> is<00:00:58.769> not

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
they're using a super glue which is not

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.850 
they're using a super glue which is not
that<00:00:59.729> good<00:01:00.150> a<00:01:00.619> adhesive<00:01:01.619> for<00:01:01.739> this

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
that good a adhesive for this

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.410 
that good a adhesive for this
application<00:01:02.360> super<00:01:03.360> glue<00:01:03.540> is<00:01:03.839> a

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
application super glue is a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.349 
application super glue is a
cyanoacrylate<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.939> a<00:01:09.320> very<00:01:10.320> tenacious

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
cyanoacrylate which is a very tenacious

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.630 
cyanoacrylate which is a very tenacious
bonding<00:01:12.359> adhesive<00:01:12.679> but<00:01:13.679> it<00:01:13.829> has<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.009> low<00:01:14.310> shear

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
bonding adhesive but it has a low shear

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.899 
bonding adhesive but it has a low shear
rate<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.899> low<00:01:16.320> shear<00:01:16.770> means<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
rate and what low shear means is that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.310 
rate and what low shear means is that
when<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:19.399> takes<00:01:20.630> when<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.749> glue<00:01:21.929> is<00:01:21.960> glued

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
when this takes when this glue is glued

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.219 
when this takes when this glue is glued
by<00:01:22.530> super<00:01:23.249> glue<00:01:23.429> and<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.789> takes<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.299> blow<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
by super glue and it takes a blow it's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.419 
by super glue and it takes a blow it's
hit<00:01:25.530> hard

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
hit hard

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.719 
hit hard
it'll<00:01:26.909> shear<00:01:27.119> off<00:01:27.829> it<00:01:28.829> has<00:01:29.039> low<00:01:29.429> shear

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it'll shear off it has low shear

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.929 
it'll shear off it has low shear
strength<00:01:30.140> yes<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.469> strong<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.950> hell<00:01:32.189> but

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
strength yes it's strong as hell but

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
strength yes it's strong as hell but
because<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.509> crystalline<00:01:33.929> structure<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.619> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
because it's crystalline structure it is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.660 
because it's crystalline structure it is
a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:35.069> bit<00:01:35.600> susceptible<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> shock

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
a little bit susceptible to shock

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.190 
a little bit susceptible to shock
loosening<00:01:38.670> which<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:40.289> a<00:01:40.319> shear<00:01:40.740> blow<00:01:41.100> is

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
loosening which is what a shear blow is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.749 
loosening which is what a shear blow is
so<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.469> case<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> use<00:01:44.219> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so in this case I'm going to use a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.870 
so in this case I'm going to use a
two-part<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.780> bonding<00:01:46.439> adhesive<00:01:46.700> known<00:01:47.700> as

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
two-part of bonding adhesive known as

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.080 
two-part of bonding adhesive known as
nough<00:01:48.030> poxy<00:01:48.569> which<00:01:49.289> only<00:01:49.619> degrades<00:01:50.100> over<00:01:50.609> time

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
nough poxy which only degrades over time

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.349 
nough poxy which only degrades over time
with<00:01:51.869> temperature<00:01:52.499> and<00:01:53.119> with<00:01:54.119> this

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
with temperature and with this

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.389 
with temperature and with this
application<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> would<00:01:55.289> be<00:01:55.499> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.889> 50

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
application that would be you know 50

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.940 
application that would be you know 50
years<00:01:56.429> instead<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.409> superglue<00:01:58.409> breaking

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
years instead of superglue breaking

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.910 
years instead of superglue breaking
sometime<00:01:59.399> later<00:01:59.639> in<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> year<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.710> gonna

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
sometime later in the year so I'm gonna

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.419 
sometime later in the year so I'm gonna
be<00:02:02.039> using<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.549> two-part<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.999> adhesive<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.619> ring

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
be using a two-part of adhesive the ring

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
be using a two-part of adhesive the ring
I'm<00:02:05.639> using<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.359> is<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:08.630> 25<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.929> don't<00:02:10.080> know<00:02:10.140> if

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
I'm using here is a 25 I don't know if

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.100 
I'm using here is a 25 I don't know if
you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.350> see<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.770> at<00:02:10.920> zoom<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.370> now<00:02:12.110> can't

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you can see that at zoom in now can't

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.510 
you can see that at zoom in now can't
zoom<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.500> alright<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.580> 25<00:02:15.180> by<00:02:15.570> 37<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.680> it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
zoom in alright it's a 25 by 37 and it

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.690 
zoom in alright it's a 25 by 37 and it
fits<00:02:17.850> rather<00:02:18.270> nicely<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.650> zi8

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
fits rather nicely on the zi8

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.990 
fits rather nicely on the zi8
I<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:21.060> 25<00:02:21.450> by<00:02:21.629> 37<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.349> fits<00:02:22.680> nicely<00:02:23.010> over

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
I have 25 by 37 it fits nicely over

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.040 
I have 25 by 37 it fits nicely over
where<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.599> lenses<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.769> zi8<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
where the lenses of the zi8 is and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.540 
where the lenses of the zi8 is and
before<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.040> make<00:02:29.129> sure<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.430> have

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
before you do this to make sure you have

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.720 
before you do this to make sure you have
good<00:02:29.790> adhesion<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:31.340> took<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> little<00:02:32.519> bit<00:02:32.640> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
good adhesion I took a little bit of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.699 
good adhesion I took a little bit of
sandpaper<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.720> dremel<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.319> think<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> took<00:02:34.560> a

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
sandpaper or a dremel I think I took a

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.880 
sandpaper or a dremel I think I took a
dremel<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:36.060> rough<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.230> edge<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.500> that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
dremel and I rough in this edge so that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.890 
dremel and I rough in this edge so that
the<00:02:38.280> adhesive<00:02:38.940> will<00:02:39.650> take<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> greater<00:02:41.630> bite<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the adhesive will take a greater bite of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.759 
the adhesive will take a greater bite of
the<00:02:43.140> material

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
the material

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.550 
the material
I<00:02:43.880> also<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.120> make<00:02:45.300> sure<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.480> don't<00:02:46.019> get<00:02:46.170> any<00:02:46.230> junk

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
I also to make sure I don't get any junk

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.330 
I also to make sure I don't get any junk
into<00:02:46.680> my<00:02:46.799> lens

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
into my lens

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.050 
into my lens
I<00:02:47.370> put<00:02:48.090> painting<00:02:48.750> painters<00:02:49.319> tape<00:02:49.819> over<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
I put painting painters tape over the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.180 
I put painting painters tape over the
