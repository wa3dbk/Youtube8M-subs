00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that got us to make the switch was the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.170 
that got us to make the switch was the
potato<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.660> were<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.289> had<00:00:52.739> eaten<00:00:53.430> organic

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
potato we were we had eaten organic

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580

potatoes<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> very<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:55.289> we're

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
potatoes for the very first time we're

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.170 
potatoes for the very first time we're
so<00:00:55.829> shocked<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.489> how<00:00:56.610> much<00:00:56.730> better<00:00:56.969> they

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
so shocked and how much better they

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.299

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
reason they are associated with ill

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.030 
reason they are associated with ill
health<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.490> manner<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.060> ailments<00:01:31.040> it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
health and all manner of ailments it's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.490 
health and all manner of ailments it's
primarily<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.729> they're<00:01:33.000> cooked<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.500> very

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
primarily because they're cooked in very

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.950 
primarily because they're cooked in very
bad<00:01:34.920> fats<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.759> mean<00:01:35.970> first<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.689> partially

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
bad fats I mean first it was partially

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
bad fats I mean first it was partially
hydrogenated<00:01:37.950> fats<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.090> rid

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
hydrogenated fats and then they got rid

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.050 
hydrogenated fats and then they got rid
of<00:01:39.329> those<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.869> now<00:01:40.020> they've<00:01:40.290> got<00:01:40.640> other<00:01:41.640> fats

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
of those and now they've got other fats

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.719 
of those and now they've got other fats
that<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.110> partially<00:01:43.710> hydrogenated<00:01:44.520> but

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that are not partially hydrogenated but

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.730 
that are not partially hydrogenated but
they're<00:01:45.210> processed<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.780> another<00:01:46.079> way<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
they're processed in another way and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.090 
they're processed in another way and
they're<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:47.939> bad<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.409> cannot<00:01:49.770> take

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
they're just as bad so you cannot take

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.590 
they're just as bad so you cannot take
polyunsaturated<00:01:50.549> oils<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.630> canola<00:01:51.899> or

polyunsaturated oils like canola or
