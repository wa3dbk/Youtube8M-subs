the<00:03:01.590> next<00:03:01.650> decade<00:03:02.069> so<00:03:02.880> what<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.330> really<00:03:03.599> be

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the next decade so what can really be

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.809 
the next decade so what can really be
done<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.290> accelerate<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.160> process<00:03:05.220> what

done to accelerate this process what

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.370 
done to accelerate this process what
more<00:03:06.000> should<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.239> government<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.599> doing<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
more should the government be doing the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.460 
more should the government be doing the
first<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.920> broadband<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:10.019> we<00:03:10.230> need

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
first is broadband you know we need

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.350 
first is broadband you know we need
broadband<00:03:11.040> because<00:03:11.400> Indians<00:03:11.760> are<00:03:11.940> very<00:03:11.970> very

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
broadband because Indians are very very

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.870 
broadband because Indians are very very
hungry<00:03:12.750> for<00:03:12.930> content<00:03:13.410> for<00:03:13.730> transacting<00:03:14.730> and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
hungry for content for transacting and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.310 
hungry for content for transacting and
so<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.299> forth<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.660> need<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:16.079> good

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
so on and so forth we need to have good

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.259 
so on and so forth we need to have good
connectivity<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.190> ideally<00:03:17.609> affordable

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
connectivity and ideally affordable

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.090 
connectivity and ideally affordable
broadband<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:18.900> that's<00:03:19.079> one<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.920> think

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
broadband so that's one and I think

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.380 
broadband so that's one and I think
there's<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.280> lot<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.700> government<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.269> do

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
there's a lot that the government can do

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.569 
there's a lot that the government can do
to<00:03:21.420> obviously<00:03:21.810> make<00:03:22.380> affordable<00:03:22.709> broadband<00:03:23.459> a

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
to obviously make affordable broadband a

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.729 
to obviously make affordable broadband a
reality<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.359> second<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.959> if<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.500> look<00:03:25.650> at

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
reality the second is if you look at

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.410 
reality the second is if you look at
ecommerce<00:03:26.190> specifically<00:03:26.940> it's<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.239> very
