on everything sealed up pretty well one
side<00:00:17.279> looks<00:00:17.640> like<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.880> might<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.300> add<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
side looks like I might have to add a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.950 
side looks like I might have to add a
little<00:00:18.840> weather<00:00:19.650> stripping<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.689> offset<00:00:21.689> t

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
little weather stripping to the offset t

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.909 
little weather stripping to the offset t
molding<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:23.310> reason<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.759> left<00:00:24.119> side<00:00:24.919> is

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
molding some reason this left side is

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.669 
molding some reason this left side is
off<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.669> a<00:00:27.029> little<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.929> not<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> big<00:00:28.529> deal

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
off just a little bit but not a big deal

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.140 
off just a little bit but not a big deal
I<00:00:28.710> figured<00:00:29.159> once<00:00:29.339> I<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.669> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:29.999> off

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
I figured once I was going to be off

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.639 
I figured once I was going to be off
then<00:00:32.090> I'll<00:00:33.090> open<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> show<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:34.620> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
then I'll open it up and show you what I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:53.549 
then I'll open it up and show you what I
did

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.470 

now<00:00:54.100> we<00:00:54.160> don't<00:00:54.340> have<00:00:54.460> any<00:00:54.699> hash<00:00:54.850> supports<00:00:55.329> yeah

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
now we don't have any hash supports yeah

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.450 
now we don't have any hash supports yeah
so<00:00:55.750> two<00:00:56.710> by<00:00:56.890> fours<00:00:57.190> are<00:00:57.399> working<00:00:57.699> fine<00:00:59.460> here's

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
so two by fours are working fine here's

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.580 
so two by fours are working fine here's
the<00:01:00.760> Hat<00:01:01.180> seal<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:03.100> fits<00:01:03.399> into<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.590> insert

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.020 

this<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.050> lock<00:01:49.620> mechanism<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> back

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
this is the lock mechanism for the back

this is the lock mechanism for the back
hatch<00:01:52.010> this<00:01:53.010> thing<00:01:53.280> was<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> big<00:01:53.820> pain<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
hatch this thing was a big pain in the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.160 
hatch this thing was a big pain in the
butt

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
butt

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.950 
butt
I<00:01:55.200> got<00:01:56.100> hours<00:01:56.730> into<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.540> trying<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
I got hours into this thing trying to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.710 
I got hours into this thing trying to
fit<00:01:58.230> everything<00:01:58.260> in<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.220> think<00:02:00.120> if<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.300> had<00:02:00.480> to<00:02:00.510> do

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
fit everything in I think if I had to do

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.420 
fit everything in I think if I had to do
it<00:02:00.840> over<00:02:01.080> again<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.620> would<00:02:02.010> use<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> different

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
it over again I would use a different

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.469 
it over again I would use a different
kind<00:02:02.910> of<00:02:03.060> lock<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.750> sure<00:02:05.510> but<00:02:06.510> it's<00:02:06.900> in<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
kind of lock for sure but it's in with a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.330 
kind of lock for sure but it's in with a
modern<00:02:09.479> effort<00:02:11.720> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.410> cam<00:02:14.310> of

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
modern effort this is with the cam of

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.290 
modern effort this is with the cam of
the<00:02:14.640> lock<00:02:14.880> goes<00:02:15.510> into<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.930> floor<00:02:16.560> there<00:02:16.860> I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
the lock goes into the floor there I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.030 
the lock goes into the floor there I
guess<00:02:18.300> eventually<00:02:18.450> I'll<00:02:18.930> try<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> find<00:02:19.500> some

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
guess eventually I'll try to find some

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.360 
guess eventually I'll try to find some
type<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.780> metal<00:02:21.780> plate<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.320> have<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.040> go<00:02:23.190> into

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
type of a metal plate to have it go into

00:02:23.370 --> 00:03:12.220 
type of a metal plate to have it go into
but<00:02:24.000> yeah<00:02:24.750> for<00:02:24.959> now<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.760> locks

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.830 

all<00:03:12.830> right<00:03:13.010> well<00:03:13.220> here's<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.659> offset<00:03:14.659> tea

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
all right well here's the offset tea

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:24.210 
all right well here's the offset tea
Modi

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.640 

and<00:03:24.790> when<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.630> thing<00:03:25.870> comes<00:03:26.050> down<00:03:26.200> enough

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and when this thing comes down enough

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.010 
and when this thing comes down enough
you<00:03:26.800> guys<00:03:26.920> can<00:03:27.130> see<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.370> or<00:03:27.490> not<00:03:27.610> but<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.870> just

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
you guys can see it or not but it just

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:43.180 
you guys can see it or not but it just
says<00:03:29.170> right<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.650> Hat<00:03:29.950> seal

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.690 

and<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.390> side<00:03:44.630> that's<00:03:45.280> no<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.520> don't

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
and this is the side that's no I don't

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.860 
and this is the side that's no I don't
know<00:03:46.760> if<00:03:46.850> you<00:03:46.940> can<00:03:47.030> see<00:03:47.210> that<00:03:47.360> or<00:03:47.510> not<00:03:47.570> there's

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
know if you can see that or not there's

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.020 
know if you can see that or not there's
just<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:48.170> little<00:03:48.530> bit<00:03:48.710> a<00:03:49.720> gap<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:51.050> there<00:03:52.030> and

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
just a little bit a gap in there and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.310 
just a little bit a gap in there and
this<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.780> right<00:03:53.990> side<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.450> see<00:03:56.660> the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
this is the right side you can see the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.810 
this is the right side you can see the
Hat<00:03:57.470> sail<00:03:57.710> a<00:03:57.950> little<00:03:58.190> bit<00:03:58.280> better<00:03:58.460> a<00:03:58.730> little

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
Hat sail a little bit better a little

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:22.150 
Hat sail a little bit better a little
better<00:03:59.060> lighting<00:03:59.390> on<00:03:59.630> this<00:03:59.780> side

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.040 

so<00:04:23.160> our<00:04:23.370> seams<00:04:23.730> on<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> sides<00:04:25.790> will<00:04:27.050> probably

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
so our seams on the sides will probably

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.800 
so our seams on the sides will probably
get<00:04:28.140> some<00:04:28.350> type<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:29.330> sealant<00:04:30.330> just<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.630> put

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
get some type of a sealant just to put

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.750 
get some type of a sealant just to put
in<00:04:30.930> there<00:04:31.190> everything's<00:04:32.190> already<00:04:32.370> sealed

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
in there everything's already sealed

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.620 
in there everything's already sealed
with<00:04:32.910> silicone<00:04:33.650> but<00:04:34.650> uh<00:04:35.150> yeah<00:04:36.150> we'll<00:04:36.390> go<00:04:36.540> ahead

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
with silicone but uh yeah we'll go ahead

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.020 
with silicone but uh yeah we'll go ahead
and<00:04:36.720> seal<00:04:37.020> those<00:04:37.170> outsides<00:04:37.650> or<00:04:38.010> I'll<00:04:38.130> try<00:04:38.970> to

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
and seal those outsides or I'll try to

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.190 
and seal those outsides or I'll try to
use<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:40.700> those<00:04:41.700> lumen<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.510> brazing<00:04:42.960> rods

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
use that those lumen of brazing rods

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200 
use that those lumen of brazing rods
again<00:04:43.530> maybe<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:43.980> can<00:04:44.220> fill<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:44.910> in<00:04:45.000> with<00:04:45.060> that

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
again maybe I can fill it in with that

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.810 
again maybe I can fill it in with that
not<00:04:45.930> quite<00:04:46.140> sure<00:04:46.170> yet<00:04:46.560> haven't<00:04:47.130> decided<00:04:47.400> on

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.810 

these<00:04:50.820> corners<00:04:51.150> I<00:04:51.480> brought<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.230> bottom<00:04:52.820> up

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
these corners I brought the bottom up

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.440 
these corners I brought the bottom up
and<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.180> overlap<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.990> top<00:04:55.520> part<00:04:56.520> over<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.210> one

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
and I overlap the top part over that one

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.770 
and I overlap the top part over that one
and<00:04:58.010> sealed<00:04:59.010> from<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.340> inside<00:04:59.430> also<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.570> I

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
and sealed from the inside also so I

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.360 
and sealed from the inside also so I
don't<00:05:01.050> think<00:05:01.260> any<00:05:01.380> water<00:05:01.650> will<00:05:01.830> get<00:05:01.980> into<00:05:02.220> that

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
don't think any water will get into that

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.020 
don't think any water will get into that
part

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
part

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.390 
part
I<00:05:03.060> still<00:05:03.990> haven't<00:05:04.110> cut<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.650> stripped<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:05.280> off

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
I still haven't cut the stripped it off

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.140 
I still haven't cut the stripped it off
it'll<00:05:06.180> go<00:05:06.360> across<00:05:06.660> that<00:05:07.220> scene<00:05:11.120> when<00:05:12.120> I

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
it'll go across that scene when I

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.770 
it'll go across that scene when I
started<00:05:12.570> putting<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:12.930> offset<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:15.270> molding<00:05:15.630> on

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
started putting the offset to molding on

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.810 
started putting the offset to molding on
here<00:05:16.020> I<00:05:17.210> try<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.270> use<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.920> putty<00:05:20.130> tape<00:05:20.460> the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
here I try to use the putty tape the

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.250 
here I try to use the putty tape the
butyl<00:05:21.120> putty<00:05:21.330> tape<00:05:21.680> under<00:05:22.680> it<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:22.950> it<00:05:23.190> started

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
butyl putty tape under it and it started

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.650 
butyl putty tape under it and it started
all<00:05:25.260> my<00:05:25.710> seams<00:05:26.040> everything<00:05:26.610> we're<00:05:26.790> apart<00:05:27.390> it

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
all my seams everything we're apart it

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.230 
all my seams everything we're apart it
didn't<00:05:27.990> suck<00:05:28.170> it<00:05:28.350> in<00:05:28.440> enough<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:29.010> I<00:05:29.090> ended<00:05:30.090> up

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
didn't suck it in enough so I ended up

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.220 
didn't suck it in enough so I ended up
taking<00:05:30.540> it<00:05:30.780> off<00:05:31.310> get<00:05:32.310> all<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.580> putty<00:05:32.820> off<00:05:33.230> and

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
taking it off get all the putty off and

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.580 
taking it off get all the putty off and
redoing<00:05:34.710> it<00:05:34.950> with<00:05:35.100> just<00:05:35.370> silicone<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:37.440> then

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
redoing it with just silicone and then

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.110 
redoing it with just silicone and then
everything<00:05:38.420> went<00:05:39.420> back<00:05:39.660> flush<00:05:39.990> again<00:05:40.380> and

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
everything went back flush again and

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.550 
everything went back flush again and
everything<00:05:42.120> will<00:05:42.240> be<00:05:42.330> fine<00:05:45.050> but<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.080> will<00:05:46.350> use

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
everything will be fine but I will use

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.690 
everything will be fine but I will use
the<00:05:46.830> butyl<00:05:47.630> putty<00:05:48.630> tape<00:05:48.960> on<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.410> top<00:05:50.130> part<00:05:50.490> and

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
the butyl putty tape on the top part and

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.200 
the butyl putty tape on the top part and
the<00:05:50.850> radius<00:05:51.240> on<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.650> edge<00:05:53.220> molding<00:05:53.760> there

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.160 

I've<00:05:56.960> been<00:05:57.080> working<00:05:57.410> on<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.650> doorframe<00:05:57.980> here

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
I've been working on the doorframe here

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.810 
I've been working on the doorframe here
got<00:06:00.170> all<00:06:00.290> the<00:06:00.410> radius<00:06:00.770> has<00:06:00.980> been<00:06:01.280> everything's

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
got all the radius has been everything's

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:24.200 
got all the radius has been everything's
screwed<00:06:02.090> down<00:06:04.660> how's<00:06:05.660> that<00:06:05.870> you<00:06:05.990> can<00:06:06.170> see<00:06:06.380> that

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.270 

so<00:06:24.780> I<00:06:24.810> just<00:06:24.990> have<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.320> panhead<00:06:25.830> screws<00:06:25.860> in

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
so I just have the panhead screws in

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.860 
so I just have the panhead screws in
right<00:06:26.460> now<00:06:26.639> but<00:06:26.940> when<00:06:27.120> I<00:06:27.150> actually<00:06:27.360> put<00:06:27.690> it<00:06:27.780> on

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
right now but when I actually put it on

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.710 
right now but when I actually put it on
I'll<00:06:28.110> put<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.620> countersunk<00:06:29.190> ones<00:06:29.490> in<00:06:29.699> so<00:06:29.940> make

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
I'll put the countersunk ones in so make

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.090 
I'll put the countersunk ones in so make
sure<00:06:30.750> we<00:06:30.990> have<00:06:31.139> our<00:06:31.520> space<00:06:32.520> for<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:33.000> door

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
sure we have our space for the door

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.969 
sure we have our space for the door
now<00:06:35.100> that's<00:06:35.310> molding<00:06:35.759> it<00:06:35.910> sticks<00:06:36.539> over<00:06:36.889> just<00:06:37.889> a

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
now that's molding it sticks over just a

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.590 
now that's molding it sticks over just a
little<00:06:38.190> bit<00:06:38.370> so<00:06:38.669> after<00:06:39.090> we're<00:06:39.240> done<00:06:39.360> we'll

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
little bit so after we're done we'll

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.110 
little bit so after we're done we'll
take<00:06:39.630> and<00:06:40.020> we'll<00:06:40.400> once<00:06:41.400> it's<00:06:41.580> on<00:06:41.699> permanently

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
take and we'll once it's on permanently

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.650 
take and we'll once it's on permanently
we'll<00:06:42.360> go<00:06:42.539> ahead<00:06:42.600> and<00:06:42.919> hammer<00:06:43.919> this<00:06:44.250> over<00:06:44.789> you

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
we'll go ahead and hammer this over you

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.740 
we'll go ahead and hammer this over you
know<00:06:45.810> create<00:06:46.169> a<00:06:46.229> little<00:06:46.580> edge<00:06:47.580> around<00:06:47.940> it

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.840 

we'll<00:06:51.750> start<00:06:51.960> putting<00:06:52.169> the<00:06:52.500> T<00:06:53.160> molding<00:06:53.550> around

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
we'll start putting the T molding around

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.560 
we'll start putting the T molding around
the<00:06:54.120> door<00:06:55.880> still<00:06:56.880> going<00:06:57.030> to<00:06:57.090> take<00:06:57.210> it<00:06:57.300> off<00:06:57.419> and

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570

little<00:07:03.630> bit<00:07:04.080> of<00:07:04.229> oil<00:07:04.410> canning<00:07:05.070> in<00:07:05.220> the<00:07:05.810> corner

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
little bit of oil canning in the corner

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.330 
little bit of oil canning in the corner
through<00:07:07.050> here<00:07:07.289> I'm<00:07:07.410> not<00:07:07.560> sure<00:07:07.710> if<00:07:07.860> you<00:07:07.979> can<00:07:08.160> see

this is a lock I was going to use in the

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.240 
this is a lock I was going to use in the
door<00:07:27.400> but<00:07:28.400> after<00:07:28.940> the<00:07:29.680> most<00:07:30.680> trouble<00:07:31.040> is<00:07:31.100> the
