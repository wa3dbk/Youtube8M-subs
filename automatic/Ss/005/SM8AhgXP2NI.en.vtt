00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.779 
just cover it with a different color so
it's<00:01:48.200> vital<00:01:48.679> to<00:01:48.709> have<00:01:48.919> patience<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.549> test

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's vital to have patience and test

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.209 
it's vital to have patience and test
your<00:01:49.939> cards<00:01:50.209> in<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.359> different<00:01:50.630> sheet<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.469> you

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
your cards in a different sheet and you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.839 
your cards in a different sheet and you
can<00:01:52.459> see<00:01:53.649> my<00:01:54.649> test<00:01:54.919> sheets<00:01:55.189> for<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.399> previous

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
can see my test sheets for the previous

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.959 
can see my test sheets for the previous
painting<00:01:56.119> are<00:01:56.859> very<00:01:57.859> crazy<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:58.459> covered<00:01:58.939> with

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
sheet is going to be transformed into

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.229 
sheet is going to be transformed into

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
underlying color that you're going to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.540 
underlying color that you're going to
use<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.270> a<00:03:38.360> certain<00:03:38.690> area<00:03:38.810> or<00:03:39.380> shape<00:03:39.710> and<00:03:40.370> then

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
use in a certain area or shape and then

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.610 
use in a certain area or shape and then
you<00:03:40.700> build<00:03:40.940> up<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.330> shadows<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.840> textures<00:03:42.350> to

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
you build up the shadows and textures to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.710 
you build up the shadows and textures to
get<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.860> full<00:03:43.070> watercolor<00:03:43.520> effect<00:03:43.970> so

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
get the full watercolor effect so

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.570 
get the full watercolor effect so
currently<00:03:45.080> I<00:03:45.320> made<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.650> base<00:03:45.770> flares<00:03:46.130> out<00:03:46.250> my

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
currently I made the base flares out my

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.700 
currently I made the base flares out my
entire<00:03:46.850> picture<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.510> usually<00:03:48.140> find<00:03:48.350> this<00:03:48.530> the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
entire picture I usually find this the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.590 
entire picture I usually find this the
most<00:03:48.860> difficult<00:03:49.040> step<00:03:49.520> because<00:03:50.270> when<00:03:50.510> you

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
most difficult step because when you

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.270 
most difficult step because when you
have<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.900> decide<00:03:51.230> how<00:03:51.440> all<00:03:51.650> your<00:03:51.770> colors<00:03:52.130> are

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
have to decide how all your colors are

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.860 
have to decide how all your colors are
going<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.490> look<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:52.970> what<00:03:53.330> colors<00:03:53.630> are<00:03:53.750> going

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
going to look and what colors are going

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.140 
going to look and what colors are going
to<00:03:53.990> be<00:03:54.080> where<00:03:54.260> when<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.010> do<00:03:55.130> ensure<00:03:55.670> your<00:03:55.910> scenes

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
to be where when I do ensure your scenes

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.340 
to be where when I do ensure your scenes
that<00:03:56.270> have<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.450> lot<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.720> trouble<00:03:57.080> with<00:03:57.200> this

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
that have a lot of trouble with this

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.080 
that have a lot of trouble with this
because<00:03:57.800> there's<00:03:58.040> unlimited<00:03:58.459> possibilities

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
because there's unlimited possibilities

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.970 
because there's unlimited possibilities
for<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.390> colors<00:03:59.660> that<00:03:59.810> things<00:03:59.959> can<00:04:00.170> be<00:04:00.200> when<00:04:00.920> I

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
for the colors that things can be when I

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.500 
for the colors that things can be when I
do<00:04:01.040> an<00:04:01.190> outdoor<00:04:01.370> scene<00:04:01.760> like<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.120> one<00:04:02.300> it's<00:04:02.450> a

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
do an outdoor scene like this one it's a

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.390 
do an outdoor scene like this one it's a
bit<00:04:02.660> easier<00:04:02.810> because<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.740> know<00:04:03.950> that<00:04:04.160> trees

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
bit easier because I know that trees

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.790 
bit easier because I know that trees
have<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.670> be<00:04:04.760> grading<00:04:05.240> and<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.900> does<00:04:06.080> grass<00:04:06.380> and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
have to be grading and so does grass and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.030 
have to be grading and so does grass and
buildings<00:04:07.220> maybe<00:04:07.760> red<00:04:08.120> brick<00:04:08.420> in<00:04:08.600> this<00:04:08.720> case

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
buildings maybe red brick in this case

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.070 
buildings maybe red brick in this case
so<00:04:10.040> here<00:04:10.850> you<00:04:11.030> can<00:04:11.180> see<00:04:11.390> what<00:04:11.540> I've<00:04:11.660> done<00:04:13.030> and

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
so here you can see what I've done and

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.009 
so here you can see what I've done and
I've<00:04:15.080> painted<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.800> all<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.450> is<00:04:17.450> I'm<00:04:17.630> covered<00:04:17.900> a

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
I've painted it all it is I'm covered a

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.180 
I've painted it all it is I'm covered a
bright<00:04:18.200> light<00:04:18.380> right<00:04:18.560> now<00:04:18.680> they're<00:04:19.010> going<00:04:19.130> to

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
bright light right now they're going to

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.550 
bright light right now they're going to
get<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.340> lot<00:04:19.519> darker<00:04:19.730> later<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:21.109> now<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.290> get<00:04:21.530> to

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
get a lot darker later so now I get to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.860 
get a lot darker later so now I get to
my<00:04:21.769> favorite<00:04:22.100> part<00:04:22.430> which<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.270> adding<00:04:23.570> in<00:04:23.690> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
my favorite part which is adding in the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.320 
my favorite part which is adding in the
shadows<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.470> textures<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.250> really<00:04:26.180> like

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
shadows and the textures I really like

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.090 
shadows and the textures I really like
this<00:04:26.540> part<00:04:26.870> because<00:04:27.140> it's<00:04:27.290> when<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.890> take

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
this part because it's when you take

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.340 
this part because it's when you take
what<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.090> pretty<00:04:29.390> nice<00:04:29.600> painting<00:04:30.110> but<00:04:30.260> is

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
what is a pretty nice painting but is

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.230 
what is a pretty nice painting but is
very<00:04:30.560> flat<00:04:30.919> and<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.640> turn<00:04:31.850> into<00:04:32.000> something

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
very flat and you turn into something

00:04:32.240 --> 00:05:47.580 
very flat and you turn into something
that<00:04:32.390> looks<00:04:32.570> completely<00:04:32.930> 3d<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.710> rape

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:06:52.040 

I
