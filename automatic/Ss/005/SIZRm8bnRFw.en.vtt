has 16 gigabytes of internal memory but
does<00:03:51.910> not<00:03:52.209> include<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:53.140> micro<00:03:53.590> SD<00:03:54.010> card<00:03:54.280> the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
does not include that micro SD card the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.850 
does not include that micro SD card the
slot<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:55.239> still<00:03:55.480> there<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.200> can<00:03:56.350> still<00:03:56.590> buy

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
slot is still there so you can still buy

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.759 
slot is still there so you can still buy
that<00:03:57.100> 16<00:03:57.519> gigabyte<00:03:57.970> card<00:03:58.840> they're<00:03:59.200> not<00:03:59.440> very

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
that 16 gigabyte card they're not very

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.720 
that 16 gigabyte card they're not very
expensive<00:04:01.350> but<00:04:02.350> it's<00:04:02.769> not<00:04:03.070> included<00:04:03.549> any

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
expensive but it's not included any

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.370 
expensive but it's not included any
longer<00:04:04.209> so<00:04:04.329> that's<00:04:04.480> just<00:04:04.540> one<00:04:04.720> thing<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:05.110> keep

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
longer so that's just one thing to keep

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.380 
longer so that's just one thing to keep
in<00:04:05.530> mind<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.430> that's<00:04:06.940> really<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.269> only

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
in mind so that's really the only

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.390 
in mind so that's really the only
difference<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.079> there<00:04:08.410> there's<00:04:08.829> like<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.220> said

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
difference is there there's like I said

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.680 
difference is there there's like I said
they're<00:04:09.549> very<00:04:09.730> very<00:04:09.910> much<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.329> similar
