well<00:01:24.400> it<00:01:24.490> seems<00:01:24.730> like<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.150> last<00:01:25.450> couple<00:01:26.170> of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
well it seems like the last couple of

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.140 
well it seems like the last couple of
legends<00:01:27.070> that<00:01:27.280> we've<00:01:27.430> had<00:01:29.940> almost<00:01:30.940> kind<00:01:31.120> of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
legends that we've had almost kind of

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.960 
legends that we've had almost kind of
turning-point<00:01:31.810> campaigns<00:01:32.520> kind<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.640> nervous

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
turning-point campaigns kind of nervous

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.330 
turning-point campaigns kind of nervous
about<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:34.810> like<00:01:34.930> it's<00:01:35.080> coming<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:36.250> it

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
about it it's like it's coming here it

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.420 
about it it's like it's coming here it
is<00:01:36.810> 2012<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.080> election<00:01:38.470> I<00:01:38.680> think<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:39.070> needs<00:01:39.220> to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
is 2012 the election I think it needs to

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.700 
is 2012 the election I think it needs to
reflect<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.570> changes<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.110> we've<00:01:41.290> seen<00:01:41.530> in

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
reflect the changes that we've seen in

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.460 
reflect the changes that we've seen in
the<00:01:41.770> last<00:01:41.800> two<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.550> half<00:01:42.670> years<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:44.229> we

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
the last two and a half years then we

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.940 
the last two and a half years then we
had<00:01:44.680> an<00:01:45.100> underdog<00:01:46.000> senator<00:01:46.740> nobody<00:01:47.740> thought

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
had an underdog senator nobody thought

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.030

that<00:01:48.250> he<00:01:49.030> had<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.180> chance<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.470> now<00:01:50.710> he's<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
that he had a chance and now he's the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.910 
that he had a chance and now he's the
president<00:01:51.550> I<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:52.420> saw<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.660> energy<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.710> hope

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
president I just saw the energy and hope

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.700
