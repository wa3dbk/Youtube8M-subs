to fix the alien speed problem now the

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.550 
to fix the alien speed problem now the
speed<00:01:12.070> looks<00:01:12.310> what<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.790> should<00:01:13.090> be<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.560> first

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
speed looks what it should be and first

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.740 
speed looks what it should be and first
couple<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:15.040> minutes<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.670> was<00:01:15.850> bit<00:01:16.030> hard<00:01:16.300> to<00:01:16.479> get

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
couple of minutes it was bit hard to get

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.840 
couple of minutes it was bit hard to get
used<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.229> controls<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:18.220> after<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.700> couple

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
used to the controls but after a couple

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.770 
used to the controls but after a couple
of<00:01:19.030> deaths<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.690> a<00:01:20.410> couple<00:01:20.619> of<00:01:20.800> rounds<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:22.060> felt

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
of deaths and a couple of rounds it felt

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:34.830 
of deaths and a couple of rounds it felt
almost<00:01:23.080> pretty<00:01:23.800> good<00:01:24.130> almost<00:01:32.790> as<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:34.450> can<00:01:34.630> see

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
almost pretty good almost as you can see

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.440 
almost pretty good almost as you can see
the<00:01:35.140> attacks<00:01:35.530> are<00:01:35.770> nice<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.280> powerful<00:01:36.759> but

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
the attacks are nice and powerful but

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.240 
the attacks are nice and powerful but
the<00:01:37.570> thing<00:01:37.780> that<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:38.020> felt<00:01:38.320> bit<00:01:38.530> weird<00:01:38.830> was<00:01:39.070> the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
the thing that I felt bit weird was the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.460 
the thing that I felt bit weird was the
delay<00:01:39.520> between<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.970> attacks<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:40.780> if<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.290> miss

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
delay between the attacks so if you miss

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.740 
delay between the attacks so if you miss
one<00:01:41.500> shot<00:01:41.979> in<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.280> beginning<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:43.210> takes<00:01:43.479> kind

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
one shot in the beginning it takes kind

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.450 
one shot in the beginning it takes kind
a<00:01:43.840> lot<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.080> time<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.410> be<00:01:44.440> able<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.979> hit<00:01:45.160> again

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
a lot of time to be able to hit again

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.190 
a lot of time to be able to hit again
but<00:01:46.060> usually<00:01:46.300> you<00:01:46.630> don't<00:01:46.780> need<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.080> worry

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
but usually you don't need to worry

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.020 
but usually you don't need to worry
about<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.710> cause<00:01:47.740> other<00:01:48.190> person<00:01:48.640> killed<00:01:48.880> you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
about that cause other person killed you

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.570 
about that cause other person killed you

all<00:02:11.350> day<00:02:11.530> Liam<00:02:11.799> was<00:02:11.980> cut<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.370> pleasure<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:13.090> play

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
all day Liam was cut a pleasure to play

all day Liam was cut a pleasure to play
and<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.750> think<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.080> movement<00:02:14.500> box<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.920> delays

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and I think the movement box and delays

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.580 
and I think the movement box and delays
will<00:02:15.519> be<00:02:15.700> fixed<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.450> final<00:02:16.840> product<00:02:17.290> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
will be fixed in the final product I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.200 
will be fixed in the final product I
hope<00:02:18.400> so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
hope so

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.600

things<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.830> every<00:03:17.100> game<00:03:17.340> but<00:03:18.120> then<00:03:18.390> there<00:03:18.660> are

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
things in every game but then there are

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.840 
things in every game but then there are
just<00:03:19.050> moments<00:03:19.320> when<00:03:19.830> even<00:03:20.250> shooting<00:03:20.670> isn't

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
just moments when even shooting isn't

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.180 
just moments when even shooting isn't
enough<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.570> then<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.350> will<00:03:22.560> lose<00:03:22.739> your<00:03:22.770> nerve

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
enough and then you will lose your nerve
