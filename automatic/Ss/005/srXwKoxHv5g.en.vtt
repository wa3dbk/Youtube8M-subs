another<00:07:21.430> view<00:07:21.760> of<00:07:21.910> this<00:07:22.210> bond<00:07:23.140> of<00:07:24.150> the<00:07:25.150> final

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:25.480 
another view of this bond of the final

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.690 
another view of this bond of the final
product<00:07:26.250> so<00:07:27.250> this<00:07:27.700> is<00:07:27.730> the<00:07:28.120> ratio<00:07:28.300> easy<00:07:29.050> to

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700 
product so this is the ratio easy to

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.700 
product so this is the ratio easy to
write
