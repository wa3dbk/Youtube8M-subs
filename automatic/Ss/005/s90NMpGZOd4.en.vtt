Tory<00:00:26.529> I've<00:00:26.619> been<00:00:26.710> thinking<00:00:26.980> about<00:00:27.039> the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
Tory I've been thinking about the

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.220 
Tory I've been thinking about the
ballistic<00:00:28.239> breakout<00:00:28.720> thing<00:00:28.930> and<00:00:29.079> I<00:00:29.169> don't

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
ballistic breakout thing and I don't

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.530 
ballistic breakout thing and I don't
think<00:00:29.410> you<00:00:29.649> can<00:00:29.770> just<00:00:29.950> stand<00:00:30.309> on<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.880> floor<00:00:31.509> and

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
think you can just stand on a floor and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.150 
think you can just stand on a floor and
start<00:00:31.989> shooting<00:00:32.290> around<00:00:32.680> yourself<00:00:33.010> there's

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
start shooting around yourself there's

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.369 
start shooting around yourself there's
too<00:00:33.280> much<00:00:33.370> risk<00:00:33.700> from<00:00:34.149> either<00:00:34.570> ricochets<00:00:35.170> or

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
too much risk from either ricochets or

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.990 
too much risk from either ricochets or
secondary<00:00:35.800> ricochets<00:00:36.219> from<00:00:36.340> like<00:00:36.460> nails<00:00:36.730> and

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
secondary ricochets from like nails and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.790 
secondary ricochets from like nails and
wood<00:00:37.180> chips<00:00:37.210> not<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.170> mention<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:38.649> might

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
wood chips not to mention that I might

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.979 
wood chips not to mention that I might
shoot<00:00:38.950> my<00:00:39.039> foot<00:00:39.250> off<00:00:39.430> if<00:00:40.000> you're<00:00:40.360> that<00:00:40.660> bad<00:00:40.930> a

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.530 
is set up with the shooting platform
positioned<00:02:02.110> over<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.409> top<00:02:03.270> well<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.450> know

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
positioned over the top well you know

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.840 
positioned over the top well you know
this<00:02:04.900> whole<00:02:05.049> experiment<00:02:05.440> is<00:02:05.740> shooting<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.640> halt

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
this whole experiment is shooting a halt

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.960 
this whole experiment is shooting a halt
to<00:02:06.880> escape<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.550> would<00:02:09.640> have<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.880> be

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
to escape and you would have to be

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.790 
to escape and you would have to be
standing<00:02:10.239> there<00:02:10.450> shooting<00:02:10.899> around<00:02:11.410> your<00:02:11.560> feet

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
we're not allowed to do that it's too

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.280 
we're not allowed to do that it's too

so<00:02:14.410> we're<00:02:14.680> going<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.100> put<00:02:15.310> 150<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.330> 180

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
so we're going to do is put 150 to 180

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.660 
so we're going to do is put 150 to 180
pounds<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.440> I'm<00:02:18.160> going<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.340> shoot<00:02:18.550> around
