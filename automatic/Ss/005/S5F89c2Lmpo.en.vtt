00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.540
 whiskey punkt.de meeting point fine 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.160
 spirits welcome whiskey store 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.049
 the meeting place in front of a ghost and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.910
 today I am a bottle here 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.190
 I have often been asked that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.580
 I would like to give it a try and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:26.369
 though this is the dm rogers of sydney 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.500
 vintage in the antique collection from the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.410
 first much sharper 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.180
 yes if you look at the cat then 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.890
 Do you know the old club ? 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.820
 bottle that was no longer going on 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.379
 but that was a glenlivet though 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.309
 also first much cherry almost and also 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.840
 comparatively old here now 995 17 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.420
 years old that's a proud one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.480
 age 15 painted and then off and first 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.190
 So much fun since we can extreme 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.129
 expect flavors 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.059
 in a special case, that is here now 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:06.270
 burned on 19 595 bottled on 19 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:10.590
 2012 euro and today we have the 14 11 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.869
 just like five weekend bottle 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 first said of cherry butt and the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.560
 bottle 464 of 789 so there will be 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.600
 have to get hold of what to get hold of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.549
 that's what rare hope he will soon 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.579
 los is just as many barrels shopped 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.470
 we did it at 1 livid did 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:40.680
 we have the full knowledge 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:44.720
 How beautiful is it ? 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.250
 initial 1994 he was at 96 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 pretty much to the end, then you already notice 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.530
 that he's from a vintage here, too 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:59.270
 I mean a maximum of 5,678 barrels 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.009
 with it the owner of single vintage 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.009
 namely the impression pages 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.190
 The independent bottler is vintage 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.310
 at the same time the owners of 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.450
 scotland's smallest distillery in the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.459
 highlands and indeed the data distillery 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.760
 and that's why the bottles are coming from now 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.890
 still bottled there and the situation are 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.420
 probably the warehouses ran there, too 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.750
 it still there the warehouses well 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.269
 misplaced so so if 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.170
 these barrels now probably in their 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:41.819
 brother cards and now since 2002 or 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.860
 so 2000/2001 i think that bought and 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.590
 then sometime in 2002/2003 can the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:54.030
 big move as suspect that ever since 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.049
 the barrels then totoblock were one 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.220
 clear contrast 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:06.560
 he has his very special aromatic 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.430
 note some hand he stinks of cemetery 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.350
 I find it interesting for me 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:20.420
 do not ambiguous so complex 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.420
 how multi-layered smell honesty 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.709
 below it is now suitable in its aroma 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.689
 very strong the normal original 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:35.329
 bottling of genesis there if I have 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:37.069
 have tried a few and whether that 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.870
 now his associates to smoker 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:45.140
 is that what I'm so somatic 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.040
 note very interesting behind it 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.799
 we come too slowly 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.549
 the fruits and too slow and the 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.549
 everything 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:35.270
 because especially full of intense aroma 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:36.979
 can be this enormously strong before 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.010
 romantic touch about it 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.280
 now the citrus comes the same 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.310
 drawer candied fruit dark 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.930
 fruits the whole wallet one 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.810
 first much sharif it is coming now 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.639
 afterwards and a saliva flow that they 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.639
 already start smacking while talking 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:08.979
 So you have to like it so I like it 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:15.800
 but you have it so extremely moss 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:17.870
 moist oak forest bark whole 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.889
 special red some people do not 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:26.270
 so be careful about that 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:31.060
 that really tastes i find it 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.060
 genius violently to taste 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:47.720
 yes i love it i love boah i love 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.080
 this first much sharif us storage for 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.630
 so long time is almost nothing for me 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.480
 over there had to watch for 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.340
 the bottle is as always limited 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.840
 I'll give it to bottles 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.520
 certainly 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.030
 and you do not have to be fast 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.360
 Heal over the next few years 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.170
 that should have been on your list 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.170
 Thank you for watching
