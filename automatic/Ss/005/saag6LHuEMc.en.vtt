00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.529
 all beaver dear friends movies 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.000
 fnafu grow like mushrooms after rain 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.490
 healthy such a mission and one another 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 more interesting if iron horse makes its 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.730
 fan movie based on your own 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.009
 visions then guys who are with me 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 recently contacted seem to be trying 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.230
 realize the movie as close as possible to the game 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.039
 but recently everything in order to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.560
 I got in touch 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.750
 the authors of the new fan-film and it will already 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 probably the third movie on five nights 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 at freddy's and they provided me 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.260
 materials directly from the filming 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 well also allowed when this one comes out 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.860
 film translate it will lay out on the channel 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.230
 so when it comes out you can expect 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.140
 I have it at first I took it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.170
 skeptical type movies movies and what their 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 and so dofiga but looking at the picture I 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 I realized that the guys are doing something really 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.730
 interesting and so let's tell what 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 I was so surprised there but 1 picture 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.660
 jobs with an estimated 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.300
 the guard behind him in front of him monitor on 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 monitor camera by the way note that one 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.890
 from the cameras which is visible on the monitor 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.379
 does not work next to him is a mask 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.689
 Freddie I think it is not necessary explains that he 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 will do with it of course i hint 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.140
 on the fact that maybe he will wear it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.360
 in order to defend against 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 animatronics next scene NER 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.500
 quite interesting because here 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 there is a guy another guy they like 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.350
 I talk yes they have a nice conversation 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.229
 lottery machines are at the back 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.420
 so this is not a pizzeria and the casino is also 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.090
 where the guy is drawn grease visible 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.200
 below what the camera shows there 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.930
 several rows 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.270
 slot machine looks like the movie will be 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.939
 not happening in our favorite pizzeria 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.369
 and in some new casino so it seems 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.939
 the filmmakers still decided to move away from 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.509
 plot 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.450
 pam pam picture with strange lighting 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.509
 maybe what it means is that this 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.549
 peasant and will violet than yes that is in 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.340
 this film, the authors decided not to wear 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.740
 purple guy and know in purple 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.219
 but they decided to do this 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 lighting actually options now 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.190
 the hottest puppet points she will be 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.200
 the movie is the first movie where i see 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.120
 so well made 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.190
 puppet and I just have 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.080
 mediv this picture has already been waiting for this 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.409
 the film is not well you look at this beauty 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.750
 super it seems that the puppet will take in 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.239
 this film is very important and 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.340
 also puppet point peeking out 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.319
 corner and we face some 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.900
 box and box clockwork 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.090
 maybe this music box 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.700
 which will calm the puppet 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.370
 next picture is a guy standing 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.129
 with a wrench maybe this is 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.769
 mapping mini-games from fnaf 3 when 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.109
 purple guy assorted animatronics 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.269
 you are not stupid that he understood 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.430
 animatronics barehanded but also 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.620
 paper guy anyone remember him 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.870
 in general he was in fnaf 2 and also in fnaf 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.750
 3 in fnaf 4 it was not observed but here 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.370
 the film, he seems to be well, and now 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.859
 a little map of the ball they are to me 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.609
 issued right from filming first child 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.129
 puppet 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.379
 means and will play some kind of child 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.329
 then do not expect a huge 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.879
 puppet will remind you that in fnaf 2 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.670
 she was very tall although possible 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.290
 the film will change its height otherwise 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.120
 speaking in one scene and will play 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.890
 little baby in a different scene and will 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.209
 play which is not a huge basketball player 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.160
 pizza office to want to despicable 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.459
 pizza on a picture when people want 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.920
 eat well and famous rules that 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.140
 were still in fnaf 1 especially happy 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.020
 rule number four is not among the floor 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.790
 please the cleaning lady is hard well so 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.980
 so here the guys that is here by 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.990
 at least there will be a puppet at 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.180
 least there will be a casino at least will 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.890
 the guard might be purple which 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.140
 will probably beat animatronics 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.370
 wrench or he is wearing a wrench 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.370
 where will he put the key
