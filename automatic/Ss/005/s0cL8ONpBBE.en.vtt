00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.680
 teach a video of how to change the 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.530
 debuts in our 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.870
 sample breathe is please remember 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.360
 that this is only for the ps3 that 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.110
 has the custom firmware both dry 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.150
 as in dex well the first thing we have 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.890
 what to do has been to watch the play 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.750
 we press what session is closed 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.810
 you always have to do this action 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.810
 closed of course and we 're going to some 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.680
 of ftp for example the world is wrong 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.850
 Yesterday 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.230
 we are going to say for example 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.970
 we have here 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.540
 we are inside 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.540
 here 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.370
 all right 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.590
 at this time 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.780
 for nothing choose a 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.750
 an ftp transmitter for example can 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.489
 be the total commander profiles and already in 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.820
 this case I have here the filicida that 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.820
 like more 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.980
 we did not see it 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.980
 first we have to know what the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.550
 ip of our play in principle not what 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.990
 I'm going to teach I already know which is the 133 of 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.930
 the show usually at the beginning or 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.570
 system information as I have 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.310
 the FTP here you can the server 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.700
 cut play 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.050
 I already like entered more in more occasions 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.370
 just from here but good you 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.460
 you put for example let's do it at 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:39.340
 beginning hundred in the entity point 168 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.330
 point 1.133 already successful so that 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.330
 we have 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.180
 just like that, both programs have them 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.180
 download on my web page 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.350
 today 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.460
 well we would say ah from scratch 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.590
 and here depending on what we want 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.420
 modify if the debut of the game of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.390
 multiplayer or the campaign debut if 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.090
 outside the campaign we would not go to the face 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.980
 and if this multiplayer we would go to the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.980
 line in this case 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.790
 we want to change the boot we are going to change 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.110
 if I remember correctly if you do not remember badly 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.530
 This game is yours to as 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.530
 comes over 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.160
 for example let's change saved and if 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:44.340
 you do not know the triangle 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.340
 file manager 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.400
 in this case I would say that it is 1945 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.939
 I know if you see it 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.939
 might 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.490
 we have church 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.890
 we choose and we would give the letter sa 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.020
 pay 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.200
 if we look for we stop here we have our 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.310
 debut 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.819
 we will look for this is the right side of the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.850
 screen is our play as you see we have 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.550
 seen the left side would be the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.290
 our computer now we would search 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.270
 on the left side where we have 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.270
 save the book well 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:39.490
 in the memory bad I would 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.490
 when growing up and I already know that I have it here 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.470
 sorry 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.290
 we click on the put 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.380
 land 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.540
 make 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.600
 tells us that we are going to change the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.840
 global experience and it's different in 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.440
 this case like me is no longer the same 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.069
 same file we should try 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.980
 we would wait 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:09.310
 and when he says listings correctly 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.710
 we give you here to close we give here to 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.340
 close 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.340
 and we could already 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.440
 choose our game 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.959
 to enter 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.450
 and play our games with the debut 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.730
 of drawing both in forces games as if 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.960
 it's infinite ammunition like the one 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.030
 you wanted to put points in 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.340
 warfare 3 according to the game that has 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.630
 write choose is worth nothing friends 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.400
