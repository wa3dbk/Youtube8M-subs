 broth of course the broths are backgrounds 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.680
 they never have salt, they never wanted to leave 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.150
 cook at a medium temperature for 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.150
 enough time the cases of vegetables 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.280
 for about 45 minutes and 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.420
 after that I already had this that I have 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 here we are going to season 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.780
 we mix 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.620
 now see what recipe so easier to 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.269
 do 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.269
 we need vegetable broth 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 avocados 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.810

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.150
 scallion the scallion is the one that comes to 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.910
 replace the onion the flavor is a lot 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.510
 more tenuous and I take advantage of once for 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.710
 put salt 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.870

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.350
 do with about three hours of 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.660
 anticipation but I also here in the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.660
 program that will get how it will look 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.140
 we serve see the consistency of the soup 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.170
 this 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.360
 and a little bit of the crab mixture or 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.360
 I'm going to put crab 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.599
 because they do not tell me that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.739
