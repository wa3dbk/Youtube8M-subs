00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.980
 Alek heavy this start with the fact that 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.750
 there is some fraternity between coaches 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.580
 he always tries to support a friend 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.320
 friend came here and saw that the players 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.790
 are in good shape for what 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.800
 I can tell the previous coach 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.200
 thank you so much more so enough 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.090
 look at the standings obviously 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.980
 that the coach did a good job but 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.599
 at the same time, I clearly understand that I 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.730
 need to do so that the team 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.950
 showed even better hockey 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.140
 and in the playoffs made at the maximum 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.540
 their first two workouts 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.519
 left me a good impression guys 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.440
 It works great that it tries 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.309
 follow instructions as precisely as possible 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.440
 the coaching staff does not help push 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.390
 I will talk about what came before me 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.870
 Sorry I saw only 2 3 games 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.609
 ska 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.320
 I can say that I will try to build 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.149
 the same model of the game as in all 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.309
 the teams that I coached before 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.019
 Great attention will be paid to the game 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.999
 unequal compositions and working off individual 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.250
 elements of both defense and offense 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.960
 in the first two lessons I will say that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.730
 the team performs well all new 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.730
 tasks and generally everything is going well 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.140
 led alexics tactics 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.060
 and behind says sport park repeat 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.400
 Of course tactics is the most important 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.290
 component of the game and any coach must 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.940
 pay much attention to this 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.890
 model of the game that adheres to our 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.630
 the coaching staff has repeatedly proved 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.000
 its worth on the international 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.290
 level and I am convinced that at the level of fluff 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.350
 him with ska team 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.830
 it will produce a crop 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.390
 enemy for bazarin. 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.100
 The first thing I told the players to guide 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.210
 the club that I am extremely happy and proud 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.130
 work ska 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.530
 this is a club with a great history one of 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.930
 the best in khl and certainly i am very happy 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.610
 that i'm here finland national team where now 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.560
 keep working too big 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.840
 number of world-class hockey players 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.490
 as well as here in ska and for any 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.640
 Coach is joy and pleasure 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.140
 work with such masters first 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.060
 queue diagnosis centered on those 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.160
 players that we have now and not on 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.720
 those that can be on the one hand in 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.910
 Our composition is very strong 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.860
 players but on the other I'm not so good yet 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.810
 I know the team to judge we need 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.090
 gain or not i need more 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.280
 several trainings and games to understand 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.290
 this and then we will have material for 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.390
 discuss possible gains but on 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.810
 This moment is clear that the composition of 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.020
 we are very strong 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.500

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.900
