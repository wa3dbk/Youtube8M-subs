method teaches say we were to tie our
hands<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:26.460> we're<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> tie<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> rope

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
hands up and we're going to tie a rope

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.400 
hands up and we're going to tie a rope
to<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> wall<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.730> rope<00:00:30.119> would<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.720> fully

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
to a wall and this rope would be fully

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.870 
to a wall and this rope would be fully
tightened<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.189> where<00:00:32.309> our<00:00:32.399> hands<00:00:32.610> cutting

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
tightened so where our hands cutting

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
tightened so where our hands cutting
budge<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:34.050> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> feel<00:00:34.559> like

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
budge and what would want to feel like

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.680 
budge and what would want to feel like
in<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> walk<00:00:35.219> away<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.670> our<00:00:35.790> hands<00:00:36.210> loading

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
in the walk away from our hands loading

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
in the walk away from our hands loading
method<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:38.129> leave<00:00:38.340> our<00:00:38.489> hands<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.910> this

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
method is we leave our hands in this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.869 
method is we leave our hands in this
position<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:40.290> stride<00:00:40.710> forward<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> our

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
position as we stride forward and our

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.340 
position as we stride forward and our
whole<00:00:42.030> body<00:00:42.239> comes<00:00:42.540> forward<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.140> our

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
whole body comes forward and we our

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
whole body comes forward and we our
hands<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.040> move<00:00:44.309> from<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.329> we

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
hands would not move from here so if we

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.119 
hands would not move from here so if we
were<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> take<00:00:45.780> my<00:00:46.050> forward<00:00:46.379> his<00:00:46.649> hands<00:00:46.890> would

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
were to take my forward his hands would

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.220 
were to take my forward his hands would
stay<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.760> circle<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.899> clearly

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
stay in this circle and we can clearly

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.619 
stay in this circle and we can clearly
see<00:00:49.620> his<00:00:50.100> hands<00:00:50.399> come<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> circle

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
see his hands come way out of the circle

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.049 
see his hands come way out of the circle
so<00:00:51.840> he's<00:00:52.079> not<00:00:52.289> walking<00:00:52.949> away<00:00:53.070> from<00:00:53.219> his<00:00:53.640> hands

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so he's not walking away from his hands

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.790 
so he's not walking away from his hands
now<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:54.780> having<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.110> lot<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.289> trouble

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
now if you're having a lot of trouble

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.700 
now if you're having a lot of trouble
getting<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.190> inside<00:00:56.699> pitches<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.530> make

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
getting to inside pitches or if you make

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.349 
getting to inside pitches or if you make
the<00:00:58.829> adjustment<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.579> inside<00:00:59.940> pitches

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the adjustment for the inside pitches

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.580 
the adjustment for the inside pitches
and<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.870> trouble<00:01:01.230> getting<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and then you have trouble getting the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
and then you have trouble getting the
outside<00:01:01.739> pitches<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.059> probably<00:01:03.480> going

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
outside pitches this is probably going

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
outside pitches this is probably going
to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> reason<00:01:04.409> why<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:04.979> we're

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
to be the reason why is because we're

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
to be the reason why is because we're
letting<00:01:05.760> these<00:01:05.820> hands<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.479> too<00:01:06.689> far<00:01:06.960> away

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
letting these hands get too far away

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.649 
letting these hands get too far away
from<00:01:07.290> our<00:01:07.650> body<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> load<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.270> loading

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
from our body in the load this loading

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
from our body in the load this loading
method<00:01:10.049> kills<00:01:10.380> our<00:01:10.590> swing<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.070> couple

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
method kills our swing in a couple

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250 
method kills our swing in a couple
different<00:01:11.760> ways<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.270> first<00:01:12.299> way<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
different ways the first way is if we

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.039 
different ways the first way is if we
leave<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:13.619> hands<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.700> circle<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.930> are

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
leave our hands in this circle we are

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859 
leave our hands in this circle we are
now<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> separate<00:01:17.250> way<00:01:18.030> too<00:01:18.090> much<00:01:18.600> from

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
now going to separate way too much from

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
now going to separate way too much from
our<00:01:18.990> body<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.490> trout's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
our body and we can see when trout's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
our body and we can see when trout's
lead<00:01:21.180> foot<00:01:21.540> lands<00:01:22.200> his<00:01:22.530> head<00:01:22.830> has<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.280> come

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
lead foot lands his head has to come

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.460 
lead foot lands his head has to come
forward<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.150> him<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.750> now<00:01:24.930> his<00:01:25.140> head<00:01:25.290> would

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
forward with him so now his head would

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.190 
forward with him so now his head would
be<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.520> his<00:01:26.790> hands<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.630> all

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
be right here and his hands would be all

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.069 
be right here and his hands would be all
the<00:01:28.770> way<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.640> waiting<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.900> now

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the way back here waiting to go and now

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.719 
the way back here waiting to go and now
this<00:01:31.380> does<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> couple<00:01:32.009> different<00:01:32.340> things<00:01:32.520> if

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
this does a couple different things if

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640 
this does a couple different things if
our<00:01:32.850> hands<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.270> way<00:01:33.450> back<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
our hands are way back this is going to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.060 
our hands are way back this is going to
straighten<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:36.030> front<00:01:36.479> arm<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:37.049> making<00:01:37.890> our

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
straighten this front arm out making our

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.120 
straighten this front arm out making our
swing<00:01:38.549> longer<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> make<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> much<00:01:40.500> harder<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
swing longer and make it much harder to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.649 
swing longer and make it much harder to
get<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> ball<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.299> why<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.540> have

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
get to the ball and this is why we have

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
get to the ball and this is why we have
a<00:01:42.689> lot<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.899> trouble<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> inside<00:01:43.890> pitches

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
a lot of trouble with the inside pitches

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.810 
a lot of trouble with the inside pitches
because<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.060> our<00:01:45.180> lead<00:01:45.390> arm<00:01:45.689> gets<00:01:46.549> locked<00:01:47.549> out

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
because if our lead arm gets locked out

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
because if our lead arm gets locked out
get<00:01:48.360> straight<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> create<00:01:49.920> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
get straight we are going to create a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.760 
get straight we are going to create a
much<00:01:50.310> longer<00:01:50.909> path<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> ball<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.619> all

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
much longer path to the ball and we all

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
much longer path to the ball and we all
know<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.189> longer<00:01:53.790> path<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.810> make<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
know a longer path is going to make it

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.840 
know a longer path is going to make it
much<00:01:55.200> tougher<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> inside<00:01:56.520> part

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
much tougher to get to the inside part

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.340 
much tougher to get to the inside part
of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> plate<00:01:57.030> because<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.079> where<00:01:58.259> we

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
of the plate because that's where we

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.800 
of the plate because that's where we
have<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.860> quickest<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.579> now<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> other

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
have to be the quickest to now the other

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.870 
have to be the quickest to now the other
big<00:02:01.229> problem<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.979> walk<00:02:02.280> away<00:02:02.549> from<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
big problem this walk away from the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.120 
big problem this walk away from the
hands<00:02:03.119> method<00:02:03.659> creates<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
hands method creates is that to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.210 
hands method creates is that to
physically<00:02:05.700> leave<00:02:06.360> our<00:02:06.950> hands<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.069> this

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
physically leave our hands in this

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.369 
physically leave our hands in this
circle<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:09.090> would<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.539> rotate<00:02:09.989> our<00:02:10.110> upper

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
circle we would have to rotate our upper

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.740 
circle we would have to rotate our upper
body<00:02:10.590> significantly<00:02:11.520> too

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
body significantly too

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.690 
body significantly too
give<00:02:12.840> room<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.200> our<00:02:13.470> hands<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.890> stay<00:02:14.160> back<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
give room for our hands to stay back and

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.600 
give room for our hands to stay back and
this<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.300> turn<00:02:15.570> our<00:02:15.720> upper<00:02:16.020> body<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:17.430> where

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
this would turn our upper body to where

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.210 
this would turn our upper body to where
our<00:02:18.060> numbers<00:02:18.930> were<00:02:19.080> almost<00:02:19.290> showing<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
our numbers were almost showing to the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.850 
our numbers were almost showing to the
pitcher<00:02:20.760> if<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.930> were<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.170> literally<00:02:22.620> leave

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
pitcher if we were to literally leave

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.310 
pitcher if we were to literally leave
our<00:02:23.070> hands<00:02:23.340> back<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.450> now<00:02:24.600> buries<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
our hands back and this now buries the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.890 
our hands back and this now buries the
hands<00:02:25.740> behind<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.340> body<00:02:26.520> creating<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.540> much

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
hands behind the body creating a much

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.410 
hands behind the body creating a much
longer<00:02:28.440> route<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.070> longer<00:02:29.550> swing<00:02:29.880> path<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
longer route and longer swing path to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.270 
longer route and longer swing path to
get<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> same<00:02:31.050> spot<00:02:31.440> we<00:02:31.590> would<00:02:31.770> be<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.070> if

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
get to the same spot we would be in if

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.860 
get to the same spot we would be in if
our<00:02:32.430> hands<00:02:32.610> were<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.940> proper<00:02:33.330> position

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
our hands were in the proper position

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.020 
our hands were in the proper position
this<00:02:34.140> also<00:02:34.380> makes<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.920> very<00:02:35.280> tough<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.910> be

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
this also makes it very tough to be

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.760 
this also makes it very tough to be
versatile<00:02:36.570> hitting<00:02:36.990> inside<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.620> outside

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
versatile hitting inside and outside

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.980 
versatile hitting inside and outside
pitches<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.730> turns<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.240> into<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.450> one<00:02:39.720> pitch

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
pitches it turns you into a one pitch

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.390 
pitches it turns you into a one pitch
hitter<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.680> all<00:02:40.800> know<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.190> especially

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
hitter and we all know it especially

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.280 
hitter and we all know it especially
when<00:02:41.880> we<00:02:41.970> start<00:02:42.060> moving<00:02:42.360> up<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.750> levels<00:02:43.110> we

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
when we start moving up in the levels we

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.810 
when we start moving up in the levels we
need<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.530> be<00:02:43.620> able<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.890> hit<00:02:44.010> every<00:02:44.340> pitch<00:02:44.610> in

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
need to be able to hit every pitch in

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.820 
need to be able to hit every pitch in
every<00:02:45.090> place<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.989> fix<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:46.620> need<00:02:46.739> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
every place so to fix this we need to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.010 
every place so to fix this we need to
stop<00:02:47.070> thinking<00:02:47.280> about<00:02:47.640> leaving<00:02:48.209> our<00:02:48.540> hands<00:02:48.810> in

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
stop thinking about leaving our hands in

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.420 
stop thinking about leaving our hands in
a<00:02:49.080> certain<00:02:49.380> place<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.860> start<00:02:50.070> thinking<00:02:50.280> about

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
a certain place and start thinking about

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.310 
a certain place and start thinking about
where<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:50.850> want<00:02:51.270> our<00:02:51.420> hands<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.989> be<00:02:52.140> in

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
where we want our hands to be in

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.930 
where we want our hands to be in
conjunction<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.920> our<00:02:53.070> body<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:53.670> can<00:02:53.790> see

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
conjunction with our body we can see

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.370 
conjunction with our body we can see
trout<00:02:54.270> here<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.600> actually<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:55.110> already<00:02:55.350> a

move back into this position that's fine

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.920 
move back into this position that's fine
too<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:15.030> going<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.570> about<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
too but this is going to be about the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.539 
too but this is going to be about the
extent<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.470> our<00:03:16.560> load<00:03:16.769> if<00:03:17.040> we<00:03:17.160> get<00:03:17.310> any<00:03:17.459> further

position<00:03:25.980> problems<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.820> we<00:03:26.910> just<00:03:27.090> talked

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
position problems that we just talked

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.720 
position problems that we just talked
about<00:03:27.510> now<00:03:28.019> conversely<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:28.920> we<00:03:28.950> take<00:03:29.549> our

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
about now conversely if we take our

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.640 
about now conversely if we take our
hands<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.239> too<00:03:30.570> much<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.049> more<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.320> take<00:03:31.500> our

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
hands in too much the more we take our

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.620 
hands in too much the more we take our
hands<00:03:31.860> in<00:03:32.070> towards<00:03:32.430> our<00:03:32.549> head<00:03:32.850> yes<00:03:33.360> we'll<00:03:33.600> be

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
hands in towards our head yes we'll be

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.570 
hands in towards our head yes we'll be
shorter<00:03:34.260> but<00:03:34.530> we're<00:03:34.650> going<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.799> lose<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.250> lot<00:03:35.519> of

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
shorter but we're going to lose a lot of

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.460 
shorter but we're going to lose a lot of
power<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.269> what<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:36.600> want<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.290> want

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
power so what we want to do is we want

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.740 
power so what we want to do is we want
to<00:03:37.500> find<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:37.920> happy<00:03:38.250> medium<00:03:38.450> where<00:03:39.450> we<00:03:39.540> have

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
to find this happy medium where we have

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.350 
to find this happy medium where we have
our<00:03:40.019> hands<00:03:40.920> about<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.610> baseball<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.269> half

with behind our shoulder to where we can

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.160 
with behind our shoulder to where we can
stretch<00:03:44.640> out<00:03:44.880> our<00:03:45.090> muscles<00:03:45.540> enough<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.989> gain<00:03:46.110> a

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
stretch out our muscles enough to gain a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.050 
stretch out our muscles enough to gain a
lot<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.470> power<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.070> still<00:03:47.310> be<00:03:47.430> plenty<00:03:47.850> quick

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
lot of power but still be plenty quick

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.300 
lot of power but still be plenty quick
enough<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.600> get<00:03:49.019> into<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.230> zone<00:03:49.590> with<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.070> lot

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
enough to get into the zone with a lot

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.970 
enough to get into the zone with a lot
of<00:03:50.430> bat<00:03:50.610> speed<00:03:50.940> now<00:03:51.870> lastly<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.560> need<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.739> talk

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
of bat speed now lastly we need to talk

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
of bat speed now lastly we need to talk
about<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.430> position<00:03:53.970> we<00:03:54.090> want<00:03:54.239> our<00:03:54.390> elbow<00:03:54.780> to

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
about the position we want our elbow to

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.600 
about the position we want our elbow to
be<00:03:55.079> in<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.500> ideally<00:03:56.190> we<00:03:56.280> would<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.579> our

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
be in and ideally we would have our

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.020 
be in and ideally we would have our
elbow<00:03:57.540> parallel<00:03:58.410> with<00:03:58.620> our<00:03:58.799> shoulder<00:03:59.310> reason

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
elbow parallel with our shoulder reason

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.670 
elbow parallel with our shoulder reason
being<00:04:00.209> now<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.570> if<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:00.810> get<00:04:00.959> this<00:04:01.110> elbow<00:04:01.500> up

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
being now is if we get this elbow up

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.949 
being now is if we get this elbow up
parallel<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.340> our<00:04:02.579> shoulder<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.450> action<00:04:03.840> of

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
parallel to our shoulder the action of

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.110 
parallel to our shoulder the action of
moving<00:04:04.110> our<00:04:04.410> elbow<00:04:04.769> up<00:04:04.980> actually<00:04:05.670> stretches

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
moving our elbow up actually stretches

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.210 
moving our elbow up actually stretches
out<00:04:06.269> our<00:04:06.420> obliques<00:04:06.900> getting<00:04:07.709> those<00:04:07.890> ready<00:04:08.160> to

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
out our obliques getting those ready to

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.890 
out our obliques getting those ready to
fire<00:04:08.519> that's<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.880> big<00:04:09.150> muscle<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.600> helps<00:04:09.720> us

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
fire that's a big muscle that helps us

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.140 
fire that's a big muscle that helps us
gain<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.110> lot<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.500> bat<00:04:10.650> speed<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.610> also<00:04:11.790> gets

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
gain a lot of bat speed and it also gets

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.210 
gain a lot of bat speed and it also gets
this<00:04:12.329> elbow<00:04:12.840> up<00:04:13.049> high<00:04:13.470> enough<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.890> where<00:04:13.920> we

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
this elbow up high enough to where we

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.759 
this elbow up high enough to where we
can<00:04:14.519> get<00:04:14.670> efficient<00:04:15.239> leverage<00:04:15.810> by<00:04:16.169> dropping

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
can get efficient leverage by dropping

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.770 
can get efficient leverage by dropping
it<00:04:16.859> into<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.400> swing<00:04:17.669> now<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.030> great<00:04:18.329> way<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.510> get

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
it into the swing now a great way to get

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.630 
it into the swing now a great way to get
into<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.109> position<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.519> the

into this position is to have the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.480 
into this position is to have the
feeling<00:04:21.060> where<00:04:21.330> we<00:04:21.479> engage<00:04:21.720> our<00:04:22.440> back<00:04:22.860> deltoid

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
feeling where we engage our back deltoid

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.420 
feeling where we engage our back deltoid
or<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.300> case<00:04:24.510> our<00:04:24.720> right<00:04:24.990> deltoid<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.860> we

or in this case our right deltoid and we
want<00:04:26.639> to<00:04:26.699> get<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.630> where<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.020> feels<00:04:28.229> nice

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
want to get that to where it feels nice

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.010 
want to get that to where it feels nice
and<00:04:28.680> firm<00:04:29.280> behind<00:04:29.850> us<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:30.419> if<00:04:30.509> you<00:04:30.630> lift<00:04:30.840> your

going to be nice and firm so that's

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.040 
going to be nice and firm so that's
going<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.380> be<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> good<00:04:34.770> muscle<00:04:35.759> to<00:04:35.850> fire<00:04:36.090> in<00:04:36.449> the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
going to be a good muscle to fire in the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.080 
going to be a good muscle to fire in the
load<00:04:37.289> to<00:04:37.590> where<00:04:37.770> we<00:04:37.889> want<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.160> get<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.850> elbow

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.740 
reason we don't want the elbow to go
above<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.160> shoulder<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.699> because<00:04:45.479> it<00:04:45.630> now

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
above the shoulder is because it now

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.080 
above the shoulder is because it now
makes<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.169> path<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.710> ball<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:47.310> little

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
makes the path to the ball a little

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.590 
makes the path to the ball a little
longer

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
longer

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.060 
longer
we<00:04:48.690> might<00:04:48.900> be<00:04:49.020> actually<00:04:49.410> be<00:04:49.530> able<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.770> gain

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
we might be actually be able to gain

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.460 
we might be actually be able to gain
about<00:04:50.639> a<00:04:51.120> mile<00:04:51.449> an<00:04:51.630> hour<00:04:51.720> or<00:04:51.960> two<00:04:52.110> miles<00:04:52.320> an

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
about a mile an hour or two miles an

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.990 
about a mile an hour or two miles an
hour<00:04:52.530> more<00:04:52.860> bat<00:04:53.100> speed<00:04:53.130> but<00:04:53.669> it<00:04:53.759> wouldn't

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
hour more bat speed but it wouldn't

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.909 
hour more bat speed but it wouldn't
justify<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.479> consistency<00:04:55.259> that<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.560> longer

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
justify the consistency that the longer

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.040 
justify the consistency that the longer
path<00:04:56.130> would<00:04:56.490> create<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.150> conversely<00:04:57.720> if<00:04:57.930> we

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
path would create and conversely if we

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.050 
path would create and conversely if we
got<00:04:58.199> this<00:04:58.380> elbow<00:04:58.800> say<00:04:59.009> below<00:04:59.340> our<00:04:59.520> shoulder<00:04:59.910> we

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
got this elbow say below our shoulder we

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.089 
got this elbow say below our shoulder we
would<00:05:00.210> now<00:05:00.449> lose<00:05:01.169> out<00:05:01.410> on<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.620> lot<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:01.889> that

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
would now lose out on a lot of that

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.950 
would now lose out on a lot of that
stretching<00:05:02.729> of<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:02.970> obliques<00:05:03.389> that<00:05:03.539> we<00:05:03.720> got

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
stretching of the obliques that we got

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.230 
stretching of the obliques that we got
to<00:05:04.380> get<00:05:04.560> those<00:05:04.800> ready<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.160> fire<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.910> we'd<00:05:06.060> also

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
to get those ready to fire and we'd also

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.689 
to get those ready to fire and we'd also
lose<00:05:06.630> out<00:05:06.900> on<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.259> height<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.280> leverage

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
lose out on the height of the leverage

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.550 
lose out on the height of the leverage
we<00:05:08.880> didn't<00:05:09.150> be<00:05:09.240> able<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.599> build<00:05:09.840> into<00:05:10.410> the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
we didn't be able to build into the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.830 
we didn't be able to build into the
swing<00:05:10.889> so<00:05:11.430> ideally<00:05:12.000> this<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.240> parallel<00:05:12.810> with

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
swing so ideally this is parallel with

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.749 
swing so ideally this is parallel with
our<00:05:12.990> shoulder<00:05:13.530> giving<00:05:13.830> us<00:05:14.009> the<00:05:14.099> most<00:05:14.280> powerful

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
our shoulder giving us the most powerful

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.249 
our shoulder giving us the most powerful
and<00:05:14.880> consistent<00:05:15.449> way<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.599> get<00:05:15.870> through<00:05:16.110> the
