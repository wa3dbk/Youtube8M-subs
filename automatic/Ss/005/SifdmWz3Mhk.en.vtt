is to find a cooler with a maximum
amount<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.939> insulation<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> sidewalls

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
amount of insulation in the sidewalls

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
amount of insulation in the sidewalls
and<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> lid<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.490> found<00:00:26.939> these<00:00:27.090> Yeti

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359

coolers and they have an amazing amount
of<00:00:29.640> insulation<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.840> one

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
of insulation on this is going to be one

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.200 
of insulation on this is going to be one
of<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> best<00:00:31.500> things<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.550> will<00:00:32.700> help<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
before you even get out and go fishing a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.790 
before you even get out and go fishing a
lot<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.690> people<00:00:45.960> will<00:00:46.140> store<00:00:46.379> their<00:00:46.559> cooler

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
lot of people will store their cooler

lot of people will store their cooler
out<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.280> hot<00:00:47.489> Sun<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.789> that's<00:00:48.030> fine<00:00:48.390> but

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
out in the hot Sun and that's fine but

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720 
out in the hot Sun and that's fine but
you<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> realize<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.129> lid<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
you have to realize that the lid and the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850 
you have to realize that the lid and the
sidewalls<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.539> hot<00:00:51.930> they're<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.350> hot<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
sidewalls are hot they're as hot as the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
sidewalls are hot they're as hot as the
outside<00:00:53.250> air<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
outside air so what you want to do is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.260 
outside air so what you want to do is
begin<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:55.770> cooling<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> cooler<00:00:56.730> down<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.210> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
begin by cooling the cooler down and you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.849 
begin by cooling the cooler down and you
can<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.719> that's<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.050> easy<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.649> throw

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
can do that that's as easy as just throw

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.439 
can do that that's as easy as just throw
in<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> sacrificial<00:00:59.489> bag<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.000> ice<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
in a sacrificial bag of ice in the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
in a sacrificial bag of ice in the
cooler<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> letting<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.649> melt<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.129> cooling

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
cooler and letting that melt and cooling

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.390 
cooler and letting that melt and cooling
down<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> sidewalls<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.870> lid<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:05.220> can

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
down the sidewalls and lid or you can

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
down the sidewalls and lid or you can
bring<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> inside<00:01:05.939> overnight<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> pros

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
bring it inside overnight what the pros

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.859 
bring it inside overnight what the pros
will<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> big<00:01:08.880> trip<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> 10-day
