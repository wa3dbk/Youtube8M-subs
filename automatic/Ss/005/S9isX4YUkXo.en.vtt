00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
it's still a little bit

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.160 
it's still a little bit
couraging<00:02:13.640> when<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:13.940> open<00:02:14.240> up<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.480> game<00:02:14.780> disc

of paper back in the machine so I did

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.770 
of paper back in the machine so I did
the<00:02:52.580> smart<00:02:52.850> thing<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.120> do<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.600> actually

the smart thing to do and actually
notified<00:02:54.470> red<00:02:54.740> box<00:02:55.010> but<00:02:55.250> all<00:02:55.430> they<00:02:55.610> did<00:02:55.670> was

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
notified red box but all they did was

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.120 
notified red box but all they did was
give<00:02:56.120> us<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.360> code<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:56.840> we<00:02:56.930> can<00:02:57.080> essentially<00:02:57.440> try

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
give us a code so we can essentially try

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.410 
give us a code so we can essentially try
