the<00:00:17.970> OEM<00:00:18.359> Series<00:00:18.750> C<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> little<00:00:19.740> hard

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the OEM Series C are a little hard

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.080 
the OEM Series C are a little hard
to<00:00:20.100> find<00:00:20.400> they<00:00:21.210> don't<00:00:21.390> generally<00:00:21.840> sell<00:00:22.170> them

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
to find they don't generally sell them

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.029 
to find they don't generally sell them
retail<00:00:24.090> because<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.570> uses<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.039> completely

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
retail because it uses a completely

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.939 
retail because it uses a completely
different<00:00:26.250> through-hole<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.210> much<00:00:27.420> thicker

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
different through-hole it's much thicker

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.349 
different through-hole it's much thicker
it's<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> completely<00:00:29.460> different<00:00:29.789> design<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
it's a completely different design so

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.270 
it's a completely different design so
what<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.560> they<00:00:31.710> are<00:00:32.340> concerned<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:33.000> as

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
what I think they are concerned about as

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
what I think they are concerned about as

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
hose clamp and the hoses is just really

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
hose clamp and the hoses is just really
there<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> hold<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> Barb<00:00:59.699> as

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
there to hold it on the on the Barb as

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.260 
there to hold it on the on the Barb as
we<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.239> put<00:01:00.539> some<00:01:00.690> load<00:01:00.930> onto<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
we as we put some load onto it the the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.690 
we as we put some load onto it the the
the<00:01:03.300> test<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> innermost<00:01:05.339> heart

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the test is that at the innermost heart

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.070 
the test is that at the innermost heart
piping<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.360> bit<00:01:06.540> below<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.960> so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
piping we're a little bit below that so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.270 
piping we're a little bit below that so
we<00:01:07.170> don't<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.439> quite<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> leverage<00:01:08.100> we

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
we don't have quite the leverage we

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.910 
we don't have quite the leverage we
would<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.500> done<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
would if this was a you know done the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.950 
would if this was a you know done the
way<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> byc<00:01:11.640> wants<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> see

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
way a byc wants it is they want to see

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.749 
way a byc wants it is they want to see
500<00:01:13.560> pounds<00:01:15.320> for<00:01:16.320> 30<00:01:16.530> seconds<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.520> c

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
500 pounds for 30 seconds that this c

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.999 
500 pounds for 30 seconds that this c
 has<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> hold<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.869> before<00:01:19.259> failing<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
 has to hold that before failing and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.550 
 has to hold that before failing and
what<00:01:20.729> we're<00:01:20.820> gonna<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:21.090> today<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
what we're gonna do today is this is the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.070 
what we're gonna do today is this is the
digital<00:01:22.890> load<00:01:23.100> cell<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:24.390> measures<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
digital load cell here that measures the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.210 
digital load cell here that measures the
load<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.590> displays<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:28.220> down

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
load and displays it up here and down

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.800 
load and displays it up here and down
here<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> other<00:01:30.240> end<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> bench<00:01:30.659> i

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
here on the other end of the bench i

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.319 
here on the other end of the bench i
have<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> self<00:01:31.439> tailing<00:01:31.740> winch<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.090> Alou

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
have a self tailing winch that when Alou

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.899 
have a self tailing winch that when Alou
used<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.960> apply<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.700> load<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> c<00:01:37.909> so

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
used to apply the load to the c so

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.359 
used to apply the load to the c so
i<00:01:39.299> am<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.229> load<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:43.009> I'm<00:01:44.009> going

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
i am going to load this up and I'm going

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.109 
i am going to load this up and I'm going

to hit peak hold on here just so that we

00:01:48.119 --> 00:02:16.340 
to hit peak hold on here just so that we
know<00:01:48.950> where<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.070> fails<00:01:51.860> exactly<00:01:53.149> here<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.240> go

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.680 
here we go 472 and then we need to be at
500<00:02:51.910> pounds<00:02:51.940> for<00:02:52.300> 30<00:02:52.510> seconds<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:54.510> there<00:02:55.510> we

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
500 pounds for 30 seconds so there we

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.860 
500 pounds for 30 seconds so there we
are<00:02:55.770> 512<00:02:56.770> pounds

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
are 512 pounds

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.630 
are 512 pounds
yeah<00:02:58.870> these<00:02:59.110> OEM<00:02:59.530> series<00:02:59.950> sea-cocks<00:03:00.370> are

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
yeah these OEM series sea-cocks are

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.820 
yeah these OEM series sea-cocks are
quite<00:03:00.850> strong<00:03:01.290> compared<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.440> last<00:03:02.620> one

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
quite strong compared to the last one

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.699 
quite strong compared to the last one
that<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.040> tested<00:03:03.489> which<00:03:04.030> failed<00:03:04.330> miserably

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
that I tested which failed miserably

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.910 
that I tested which failed miserably
below<00:03:05.709> 200<00:03:06.220> pounds<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.080> see<00:03:08.290> we're

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
below 200 pounds as you can see we're

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.270 
below 200 pounds as you can see we're
letting<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.310> 3/4<00:03:09.940> inch<00:03:10.800> Maryland<00:03:11.800> seacock

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
letting this 3/4 inch Maryland seacock

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.570 
letting this 3/4 inch Maryland seacock
hold<00:03:12.610> at<00:03:12.790> 512<00:03:13.510> pounds<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:15.040> we're<00:03:15.220> slightly

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
hold at 512 pounds then we're slightly

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.860 
hold at 512 pounds then we're slightly
below<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:16.030> but<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.269> mean<00:03:16.390> I'm<00:03:16.540> willing<00:03:16.690> to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
below this but I mean I'm willing to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.170 
below this but I mean I'm willing to
give<00:03:17.019> it<00:03:17.140> some<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.920> it's<00:03:18.280> severely<00:03:18.760> deformed

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
give it some it's it's severely deformed

actually that I believe that's GPO 3 I

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.009 
actually that I believe that's GPO 3 I
just<00:03:41.650> had<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.800> kicking<00:03:42.100> around<00:03:42.160> my<00:03:42.370> shop<00:03:43.019> so

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
just had a kicking around my shop so

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.410 
just had a kicking around my shop so
again<00:03:44.260> where<00:03:44.440> we've<00:03:44.650> well<00:03:44.890> exceeded<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:46.150> 30

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
again where we've well exceeded the 30

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.080 
again where we've well exceeded the 30
seconds<00:03:47.019> that<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.100> seacock<00:03:48.519> would<00:03:48.730> need<00:03:48.910> to

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
seconds that this seacock would need to

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.880 
seconds that this seacock would need to
pass<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> byc<00:03:50.980> test<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.470> fact<00:03:53.739> it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
pass the a byc test and the fact it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.430 
pass the a byc test and the fact it
exceeds<00:03:54.280> what<00:03:54.550> a<00:03:54.580> bronze<00:03:54.940> through<00:03:55.300> Hall<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:56.320> a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
exceeds what a bronze through Hall and a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.880 
exceeds what a bronze through Hall and a
valve<00:03:56.680> would<00:03:56.950> do<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:58.570> course<00:03:58.810> I'm<00:03:59.530> not<00:03:59.709> more

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
valve would do of course I'm not more

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.740 
valve would do of course I'm not more
knock<00:04:00.070> this<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.610> proper<00:04:01.000> seacock<00:04:01.480> and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
knock this is a proper seacock and

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.620 
knock this is a proper seacock and
that's<00:04:02.380> not<00:04:02.620> but<00:04:03.090> let's<00:04:04.090> put<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.300> little<00:04:04.450> more

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
that's not but let's put a little more

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.289 
that's not but let's put a little more
load<00:04:04.870> on<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.500> see<00:04:05.680> what<00:04:05.800> happens

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
load on this and see what happens

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:14.890 
load on this and see what happens
now<00:04:08.299> 540<00:04:12.790> by<00:04:13.790> 62

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
now 540 by 62

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.810 
now 540 by 62
she's<00:04:15.590> holding<00:04:15.769> steady<00:04:16.220> there<00:04:18.820> pretty

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
that's let's take it out a peak hole

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.340 
that's let's take it out a peak hole
just<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.300> make<00:04:26.509> sure<00:04:26.539> that<00:04:26.870> that's<00:04:27.050> where<00:04:27.229> we

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
cheap Bend here and the hose clamp is

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.909 
cheap Bend here and the hose clamp is
holding<00:05:13.789> it<00:05:13.880> on<00:05:14.030> but<00:05:14.479> again<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:15.500> valve<00:05:15.710> is

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
holding it on but again the valve is

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.740 
holding it on but again the valve is
deformed<00:05:17.440> but<00:05:18.440> it<00:05:18.710> hasn't<00:05:18.889> failed<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.750> my

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
deformed but it hasn't failed and my

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.370 
deformed but it hasn't failed and my
guess<00:05:21.020> is<00:05:21.260> that<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.620> through-hole<00:05:23.139> which<00:05:24.139> if

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
guess is that the through-hole which if

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.920 
guess is that the through-hole which if
I<00:05:24.530> can<00:05:25.090> take<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.210> camera<00:05:26.539> off<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.750> tripod

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
I can take the camera off the tripod

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.740 
I can take the camera off the tripod
here<00:05:30.190> we're<00:05:31.190> still<00:05:31.430> I<00:05:31.789> mean<00:05:32.270> with<00:05:32.570> that<00:05:32.690> our

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
here we're still I mean with that our

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.570 
here we're still I mean with that our
line<00:05:32.930> stretching<00:05:33.530> we're<00:05:33.650> still<00:05:33.889> over<00:05:34.099> 500

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
line stretching we're still over 500

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.170 
line stretching we're still over 500
pounds<00:05:34.729> you<00:05:35.720> can<00:05:35.900> see<00:05:36.699> under<00:05:37.699> here<00:05:37.970> there's

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
pounds you can see under here there's

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.510 
pounds you can see under here there's
the<00:05:38.389> through-hole<00:05:38.630> fitting<00:05:39.229> and<00:05:39.409> and<00:05:40.340> that's

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
the through-hole fitting and and that's

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.820 
the through-hole fitting and and that's
not<00:05:40.639> deformed<00:05:41.210> against<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:42.500> fiberglass

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
not deformed against the the fiberglass

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.249 
not deformed against the the fiberglass
at<00:05:43.159> all<00:05:43.280> so<00:05:43.520> that<00:05:44.060> seal<00:05:44.360> would<00:05:44.539> probably<00:05:44.990> still

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
at all so that seal would probably still

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.460 
at all so that seal would probably still
be<00:05:45.289> intact<00:05:45.710> despite<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:47.120> inside<00:05:47.659> having

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
be intact despite the inside having

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.080 
be intact despite the inside having
lifted<00:05:48.949> in<00:05:49.099> the<00:05:49.159> valve<00:05:50.060> leaning<00:05:50.990> over<00:05:51.639> again

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
you know with line stretch we're now

kick<00:05:59.360> that<00:05:59.570> up<00:05:59.750> again<00:06:02.979> you<00:06:03.979> know<00:06:04.099> holding<00:06:04.400> you
