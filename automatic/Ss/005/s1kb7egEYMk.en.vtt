00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.100
 good kids how are they going if we have 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.780
 clouds that many of you were waiting for already 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.189
 that you wanted a video with the bulldog and 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.780
 well here you have it and also with the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.910
 plus who will be comparing the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.410
 with his biggest rival is karachi to the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.059
 which is undoing the issue of how much 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.280
 people use it but it's really better 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.930
 let's find out today that the subject is 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.520
 quite interesting and before I see 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.050
 another comment about it if today 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 there has not been an intro and I know but 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.380
 if you notice you are in the description 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.030
 of the video of the other day you will know that no 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.800
 you have to worry because on Sunday 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.420
 you will have a pretty cool or at least 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.730
 that will try to depend if I can take out 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 many clips and all that and you will see well 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.300
 let's go now to ibex and start 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.700
 for the cadence that as you know will be 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.920
 relatively low in the two or at least 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.630
 it would be if there were not two damage weapons 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.220
 very high since they are the two rifles of 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.860
 high caliber assault for battlefield 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.440
 four and that's basically because it has 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.380
 a caliber of 762 that in battlefield 4 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.960
 has the model of 34% short and 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.700
 25% to long making them very good at 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.559
 all distances depending on 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.149
 assumption of your cadence and if you are a 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.700
 unfamiliar with the numbers and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.350
 good as it is normal to have such a damage 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.350
 high the rate is usually very low 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.180
 600 to 650 rounds per minute 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.700
 in which will fall is karachi with its 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.950
 620 that are honestly fine but not 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.440
 the bulldog that has an excessive 700 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.090
 that is to say award is basically an out with 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.680
 more damage and more recoil the truth is 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.439
 I think it's a bit cheated but 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.670
 in any case you earn this little dot 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.979
 but all this power that the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.049
 762 has to be paid with something and that's 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.729
 of course the retreat to which as 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.190
 you will imagine is very high in the case of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.720
 es carache will be 0-2 towards the two 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.369
 sides and 0.5 up with a 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.380
 multiplier very very low what it does 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.030
 make it easy enough to control already 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.590
 it only goes up and you know that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.080
 this type of kick is the easiest 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.909
 of controlling this recoil is also 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.119
 quite similar to the bulldog that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.500
 will be 0.3 towards both sides and from 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.119
 0.55 up with a multiplier 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.039
 that I think I remember was a little higher 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.050
 that the one of the carache or minimum the same 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.869
 so the point will go towards the scale in 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.850
 this aspect and although we have already taken the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.649
 verdict for this I wanted to comment a 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.990
 thing about recoil in particular the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.789
 visual recoil of the bulldog and that is 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.160
 is very rare that style of type 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.509
 88 that you start shooting and start 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.190
 like to dance from one place to another 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.470
 making it very difficult to control 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.280
 I hope that in a nearby patch do not put 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.440
 the arrangement for 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 recoil since it will be a thousand times more 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.069
 easy to be precise with these weapons and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.750
 again to compensate for the power that 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.400
 have we give them a charger between 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.380
 quotes worse than the rest of rifles 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.209
 assault and in quotes since if we 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.680
 we fix for example in an average and six 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.600
 a there are probably emptied their 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.180
 31 bullet magazine at the same time 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.560
 that loads them with their 620 empty the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.720
 21 am and although I've always thought 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.280
 quite coherent since there are obviously 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.840
 that limit can kill more people 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.459
 in theory, I thought it was quite 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.590
 curious but good as I told you 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.870
 both will have a 21-round bullet 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.850
 that in the case of the carache is recharged 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.670
 in an incredible time of 1.9 seconds 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.110
 for the short and impressive 2,4 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.820
 for the long and by the way I think that already 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.250
 I have commented on it again in 1 bs 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.470
 with the escape but we love the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.510
 subtlety of the long recharge by pressing the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.220
 button quoted to me the truth is that I 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.750
 love what I do not love so much is the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.970
 Reload the bulldog as it is a weapon 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.709
 wulff that as you know is characterized 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.450
 for a better hip game less 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.250
 precision pointing still nobody knows by 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.900
 what and a longer recharge of course 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.269
 they have made sure whoever is long 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.430
 taking 2.5 seconds for the short and 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.460
 3.2 seconds for the long is to say 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.260
 we have a 762 gun with more cadence 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.640
 charge faster and recharge slower a 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.070
 great handicap although of course 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.720
 necessary and that said let's move on to the 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.880
 other data let's start with the precision 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.740
 that as I told you before, it will be worse for 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.890
 the bulldog because that is what beats in the 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.970
 0.25 compared to 0.2 of lashkar that 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.190
 wins in this but another of the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.990
 characteristics of the octopuses will come to the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.090
 rescue of the bulldog will give advantage to 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.760
 the bullet speed that will be 450 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.410
 meters second compared to 410 of 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.130
 lashkar and seen their aspects more 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.810
 essentials 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.490
 let's see how they are statistically 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.770
 first of all the bulldog will win in the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.360
 cadence followed 10 later we will have a 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.250
 pretty big victory to the scale with 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.690
 the recoil and if that was overwhelming not 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.090
 I know how to call the recharge that 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.860
 will make this stay at 12 and after this 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.420
 we would have the mobility and range in 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.790
 that the bulldog will win so everything stays 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.650
 in a 32 in favor of the bulldog that wins 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.330
 the statistical thing and can win in what 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.460
 statistical but certainly can not 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.260
 to win my heart the truth is that between 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.030
 that I know is theoretically flattened and that 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.800
 absolutely everyone takes the 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.540
 that gives me a lot of disgust and 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.520
 when I say what she 's sitting on 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.050
 theory I meant that while it's 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.700
 true that statistically it is very very 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.440
 good to me has not gone so well with 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.270
 her and if I know that these conclusions are 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.690
 something that I criticized myself but 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.880
 simple 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.920
 I do not really like the truth is that I think that 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.170
 it's very very over used and I do not think that 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.820
 it is so much for its statistics but 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.560
 for all the hyde that has been created with the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.450
 cti videos from youtube ers from other 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.010
 communities to which of course not 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.900
 I will criticize for giving your opinion but 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.000
 it seems to me incredible that people 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.230
 be so influenced and if you do not remember 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.510
 of which thirty six fell 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.190
 many, many, many people in that 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.880
 placebo effect so easy to see from a 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.830
 way or another 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.390
 used to seeing her a lot but from 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.790
 then not in my hands since I've caught 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.470
 a lot of mania and I'm not going to 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.910
 bother to say my opinion about the 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.370
 You know what I think of her is 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.930
 of fn has a little recoil is very 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.300
 powerful and for me it is better than the rest 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.890
 of assault rifles of the game and if this 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.330
 includes the bulldog I sincerely believe 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.670
 that although this statistically great 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.350
 the carache still has that charm and 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.820
 that unrivaled power that elevate it 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.830
 above the rest of the rifles 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.570
 assault so it goes without saying that in 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.490
 my opinion they charge them to much to the 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.750
 bulldog and good kids that would be all 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.160
 for today's video I hope you have 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.870
 liked and as always when we make a 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.970
 v / s I ask your opinion on what 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.380
 weapon wins for you and in fact I think 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.910
 that the results are going to be very 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.040
 tightened given the amount of people that 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.870
 use the new one so do not hesitate to leave 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.790
 your opinion an opinion that also 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.770
 we will ask 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.330
 in the next video that will be of the 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.160
 new news from butterfield and os 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.230
 I can say there are many so 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.180
 I recommend that you do not miss the video of 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.030
 this Sunday we are attentive so 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.750
 nothing said this I say goodbye 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.750
 goodbye kids
