00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
as you can see my opponent has a pretty

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.189 
as you can see my opponent has a pretty
good<00:00:19.740> team<00:00:20.070> nothing<00:00:20.910> too<00:00:21.090> spectacular<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:22.109> at

good team nothing too spectacular but at
the<00:00:22.260> same<00:00:22.470> time<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.070> definitely<00:00:23.910> can't<00:00:24.180> take

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the same time I definitely can't take

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.420 
the same time I definitely can't take
them<00:00:24.480> light<00:00:24.710> even<00:00:25.710> though<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.830> went<00:00:26.130> undefeated

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
in the regular season if I lose my first

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.040 
in the regular season if I lose my first
playoff<00:00:29.250> game<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.820> definitely<00:00:30.599> would<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
playoff game I definitely would have to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.380

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
hard to tackle and in fact I think he's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.479 
hard to tackle and in fact I think he's
one<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> toughest<00:01:01.890> running<00:01:02.160> backs<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
tackle and mutt but as you can see a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.510

history I have only been playing mutt a

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.229 
history I have only been playing mutt a
little<00:02:55.290> over<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> month<00:02:55.799> but<00:02:56.610> at<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.730> same<00:02:57.000> time

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
little over a month but at the same time

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.720 
little over a month but at the same time
hey<00:02:57.510> not<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> better<00:02:58.620> time<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.010> get<00:02:59.220> my<00:02:59.370> first

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
kick return for a touchdown and I guess

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.320 
kick return for a touchdown and I guess
you<00:03:02.040> can't<00:03:02.250> even<00:03:02.459> do<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.640> anymore<00:03:03.000> because

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
you can't even do that anymore because

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.780 
you can't even do that anymore because
that<00:03:03.569> move<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:04.019> nerfed<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:05.280> now<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.430> start<00:03:05.640> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
that move is nerfed so now we start the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.000 
that move is nerfed so now we start the
second<00:03:06.120> half<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.599> look<00:03:07.260> at<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.590> forced

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
second half and look at the forced

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.600 
second half and look at the forced
fumble<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.640> Vontae<00:03:09.180> Davis<00:03:09.209> picks<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.610> so

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
fumble and Vontae Davis picks it up so

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.120 
fumble and Vontae Davis picks it up so
we<00:03:11.700> have<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.880> 14-10<00:03:12.540> lead<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.440> next<00:03:13.739> play<00:03:13.950> we

times the game but when I do it's

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.129 
times the game but when I do it's
usually<00:03:46.859> good<00:03:47.160> enough<00:03:47.370> for<00:03:47.609> a<00:03:47.639> first<00:03:47.910> down<00:03:48.139> now
