00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:02.790
 caused 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.910
 the number of weeks ago 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.699
 8 waalwijk 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.009
 it is important to take a look then to determine 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.339
 time that we are not only trained hard to remove 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.289
 for his arrival of a point 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.400
 less from here also in this small room in rotterdam 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.189
 the twenty or so are in November with six weeks of work 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.599
 we don't need bags reduction in charlottesville the young aren't the 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.919
 only unmanned director are training hard that is in the remonte 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:32.620
 Sparta 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.260
 and calling someone about physical strength is going to throw a real game 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.180
 out of it 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.359
 sanne but rarely or never can you win 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.150
 a woman in the home of martyrs 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.450
 but at this level but there they just come along very well and 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.000
 is the last tough test 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.450
 then it goes quite well by worries about the roundabout real competitions are yes yes 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.500
 we do not become that every day because without it already foresaw it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.659
 but in the competition period I prefer that I have checked here 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.190
 and that it is anyway 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.040
 well prepared and enter 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 it must be slightly heavier than the competition had to compete 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 why a little less are 8 ap know time 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.990
 such as more from the benefit 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.390
 it was that perry in the booklet 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.130
 that's what she eats 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.410
 trains in us after treatment 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.960
 is that a good preparation for the wk found signs 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.220
 these kinds of young people 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.570
 yes that extra money did not really come from gent is not mandatory 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.380
 and that works so yes I had a bit that they land quickly 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.149
 after only one year on day 2 as a trainer of the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.110
 my name is the performance and is not making a real fist 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.070
 Smith's net amount made that difficult 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.770
 According to Boksebeld's assignment, you will have to respond to what is 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.420
 happens course runs year in the school was commissioned by 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.400
 so where did he have to say 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.250
 no one to dodge 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.510
 wonderful nevertheless really wrong with it 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.520
 the pole many matches boxed third in the world 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.149
 more than once Dutch champion but eventually also thirteen games 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.239
 lost that there are ten competitions where you off stage 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.599
 yes and have not lost all that time, yes that's parties 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.199
 a he in the final in the semi-finals 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.629
 May is all fun 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.319
 European resistance 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.520
 and if that is not only to gain a bit of what 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.019
 to the music 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.090
 yes itagaki strength.and man held up 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.239
 also make it stronger 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.849
 A weaknesses yes then I would almost like my strengths more 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.549
 apparently sitting by 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.709
 the 25 year old stoch 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.370
 you can't really do that and you have to be your own 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.389
 afterwards perseverance 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.739
 well i have long 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.369
 almost certain 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:48.689
 men 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.809
 marcel it is these kind of two things doing well at the level of 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.859
 a recent study from banjo it is completely top international with one 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.249
 couple of Dutch champions 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.059
 yes those are other guys where they just train again fully 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:05.199
 trainer which especially against boys via yes especially against boys to the men 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.019
 physically strong and it is all a bit faster so a moment that they get there 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.089
 is used to 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.859
 it is a bit easier for her, not easy but easier than you can 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.859
 So you better come up with the top of the award 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.410
 yes if she doesn't do it then debate 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.899
 then they won't make it 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.919
 you should do this simply and not once in a week 9 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.419
 in bed every day 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.159
 people who recover physically 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.079
 that are faster 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.289
 We have a chance to offer good gauge 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.289
 not to look at the olympic power but how should that be from too 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.789
 but in the newspaper and on its editors 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:42.329
 We will first do this the ECA or wait and I think I am convinced of it 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.809
 that the vdab on this wk then it must then you must be there then you must be there 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:47.719
 stand well 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.049
 if the qualification is not even six months later, the next six months will not be like that 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.689
 do a lot more 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.459
 playing a problem becomes the case for the very first time I am at home 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.430
 also go if they are well of course you are there yes it 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.309
 Dutch team is May 5 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.960
 that is a dog in Sweden and nothing less 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.890
 mnm with a nice color gold invest exactly after a nice club New Year's Eve 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.130
 last year you were a third of the world, the plush is added 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.160
 names him 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.449
 it is not time that I am going to make it 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.509
 it could have been worse 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.249
 everything is allowed to lead them 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.899
 but it will certainly not be a reason for speeding well you do that 

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:24.479
 that you get ready 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.340
 and it's impossible 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.340
 considering the coming days the window for you up to the nk 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.979
 last week I had a very nice excel 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.610
 more and more of those increasingly demanding ones do keep up a bit 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.850
 she unfortunately means until the trainer plans me once 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.500
 Saturday enters 28 years it goes every day like the deletion of rules 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.889
 must comply 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.919
 we have extended the time to take the man holding them 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.200
 himself but competition tension that was also the first training 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.039
 the votes alternated with the name 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.020
 I cock young say but really as driven and incivism nbtc nipo 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.039
 the municipality and the large drawing exhibition 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.099
 and then there was also some of it 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:05.000
 jane it creates 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.240
 to live as soon as possible 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.039
 the opponent's body 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.059
 We are not going to worry about is a good thing to go we are kept alive 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:15.809
 t the new and 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:19.699
 we look at what opponent feels like I have to box and then has a book 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.659
 that is never the case with natural 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.330
 well I do that that some chances may not also pay attention to the birds 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.730
 on the channel st 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.919
 the training 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.020
 susan fisherman and vrom is very important that you have the stress 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.949
 to be able to correct that and others 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.240
 after a super commissioner the next event and inhumanely long 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.430
 the statistics show that if you organize in your own country you 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.800
 the chance that one is greater that you 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.520
 the ever home team 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.849
 but good that hard 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.449
 hangs here 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.099
 arbitrator not at the front door but perhaps short debate yes afp adv
