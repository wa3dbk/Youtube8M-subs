this<00:00:16.680> video<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.369> pal<00:00:19.189> basically

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
this video just for you pal basically

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.880 
this video just for you pal basically
what<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.020> your<00:00:22.230> amp<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.619> dial

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
what you do is you on your amp you dial

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.700 
what you do is you on your amp you dial
up<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.400> lot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.930> game<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.350> lot<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
up a lot of a lot of game a lot of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.599 
up a lot of a lot of game a lot of
distortion<00:00:26.240> little<00:00:27.240> delay<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.310> just<00:00:29.310> crank

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
distortion little delay and just crank

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.760 
distortion little delay and just crank
it<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.940> you<00:00:33.500> dive<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
it up and what you do is you dive the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.750 
it up and what you do is you dive the
bar<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.809> while<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:37.309> pulling<00:00:38.309> long<00:00:38.489> for

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
bar down while like pulling long for

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.330 
bar down while like pulling long for
playing<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> g<00:00:39.300> string<00:00:39.570> ok<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.980> kind<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
playing the g string ok so you kind of

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.569 
playing the g string ok so you kind of
lightly<00:00:47.969> touch<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> harmonic<00:00:49.340> over<00:00:50.340> either

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
lightly touch the harmonic over either

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.479 
lightly touch the harmonic over either
the<00:00:50.789> 3rd<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.329> 5th<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.469> know<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.860> seventh<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the 3rd to 5th you know the seventh and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.069 
the 3rd to 5th you know the seventh and
wherever<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> good<00:00:54.870> natural

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
wherever you get it like a good natural

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:05.990 
wherever you get it like a good natural
harmonic

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.910 

that's<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:07.180> basically<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:08.350> just<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.680> show<00:01:08.860> you

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
that's it basically so just to show you

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.110 
that's it basically so just to show you
how<00:01:09.160> I'll<00:01:09.220> show<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.430> about<00:01:09.490> that<00:01:09.760> it<00:01:09.940> goes

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
how I'll show you about that it goes

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.020 
how I'll show you about that it goes
dive<00:01:10.930> down<00:01:11.200> like<00:01:11.530> pull<00:01:12.040> off<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.580> dive<00:01:12.760> down

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
dive down like pull off and dive down

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380 
dive down like pull off and dive down
and<00:01:13.300> then<00:01:13.600> lightly<00:01:14.380> touch<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.150> hit

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
and then lightly touch it so you hit

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.510 
and then lightly touch it so you hit
that<00:01:16.510> harmonic<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.260> then<00:01:17.440> just<00:01:17.620> manipulate

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
that harmonic and then just manipulate

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.610 
that harmonic and then just manipulate
the<00:01:18.670> whammy<00:01:18.880> bar<00:01:19.030> up<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.870> down<00:01:20.050> whatever<00:01:20.530> you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
the whammy bar up and down whatever you

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.990 
the whammy bar up and down whatever you
want<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.830> do<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.010> get<00:01:21.100> that<00:01:21.250> crazy<00:01:21.550> kind<00:01:21.910> of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
want to do to get that crazy kind of

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.170 
want to do to get that crazy kind of

could be of help to you all right just
uh<00:02:43.920> one<00:02:44.640> more<00:02:44.670> point<00:02:45.200> when<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.230> say<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.560> hit<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
uh one more point when I say you hit the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.330 
uh one more point when I say you hit the
harmonic<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:48.780> exactly<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.950> don't<00:02:50.190> know<00:02:50.250> if

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
harmonic it's exactly I don't know if

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
harmonic it's exactly I don't know if
you<00:02:50.430> know<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.610> maybe<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.270> do<00:02:51.450> know<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.750> but

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
you know this maybe you do know it but

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.590 
you know this maybe you do know it but
just<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.170> keep<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.590> mind<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.910> flip

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
just to keep it in mind when you flip

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.630 
just to keep it in mind when you flip
that<00:02:54.810> string<00:02:55.290> when<00:02:55.770> you're<00:02:55.920> touching<00:02:56.160> lightly

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
that string when you're touching lightly

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.010 
that string when you're touching lightly
the<00:02:57.420> harmonic<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.230> right<00:02:59.070> over<00:02:59.660> the<00:03:00.660> friend

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
the harmonic is right over the friend

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.740 
the harmonic is right over the friend
the<00:03:01.350> actual<00:03:01.830> steel<00:03:02.640> or<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.210> know<00:03:03.330> alloyed

that's<00:03:05.910> where<00:03:06.090> you're<00:03:06.210> gonna<00:03:06.330> lightly<00:03:07.070> just

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
that's where you're gonna lightly just

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.520 
that's where you're gonna lightly just
put<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.880> bottom<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.630> your<00:03:09.660> finger<00:03:10.350> like

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
put the the bottom of your finger like

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.270 
put the the bottom of your finger like
this<00:03:10.770> part<00:03:11.190> here<00:03:12.020> over<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.260> string<00:03:14.010> while

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
this part here over the string while

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.370 
this part here over the string while
it's<00:03:14.460> vibrating<00:03:15.030> not<00:03:15.420> not<00:03:15.630> pressing<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.350> down

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
it's vibrating not not pressing it down

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.650 
it's vibrating not not pressing it down
just<00:03:16.710> a<00:03:16.890> little<00:03:17.100> bit<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.760> mean<00:03:18.120> you've<00:03:18.420> got<00:03:18.450> to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
just a little bit I mean you've got to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.200 
just a little bit I mean you've got to
practice<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:19.290> like<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.590> know<00:03:20.910> around

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
practice it like you know around

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.790 
practice it like you know around
with<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.510> little<00:03:21.540> bit<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.930> then<00:03:22.020> you'll<00:03:22.470> get

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
with it a little bit and then you'll get

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:38.400 
with it a little bit and then you'll get
that<00:03:23.600> kind<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.690> sound<00:03:24.990> you<00:03:25.140> know<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.590> it's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.460 

you<00:03:39.190> know<00:03:39.310> it's<00:03:39.730> like<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.150> but<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:40.900> that

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
you know it's like that but just that

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.920 
you know it's like that but just that
forgot<00:03:41.770> to<00:03:41.860> mention<00:03:42.160> this<00:03:42.220> before<00:03:42.400> it's<00:03:42.930> when

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
forgot to mention this before it's when

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.590 
forgot to mention this before it's when
you're<00:03:44.050> hitting<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.350> harmonic<00:03:45.240> it's<00:03:46.240> right

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
you're hitting that harmonic it's right

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.450 
you're hitting that harmonic it's right
over<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.140> actual<00:03:47.290> threat<00:03:47.830> it's<00:03:48.040> not<00:03:48.220> in

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
over the actual threat it's not in

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.050 
over the actual threat it's not in
between<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.510> frets<00:03:49.840> here<00:03:50.320> it's<00:03:51.010> over<00:03:51.820> the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
between the frets here it's over the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.520 
between the frets here it's over the
fret<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:52.480> if<00:03:52.540> you're<00:03:52.690> hitting<00:03:52.990> that<00:03:53.170> third

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
fret so if you're hitting that third

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.370 
fret so if you're hitting that third
like<00:03:54.310> on<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.550> 3rd<00:03:54.760> fret<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.810> harmonic

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
like on the 3rd fret like this harmonic

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.340 
like on the 3rd fret like this harmonic
here<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.910> would<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.240> right<00:03:58.720> over<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.200> actual

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
here it would be right over the actual

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.460 
here it would be right over the actual
fret<00:03:59.860> okay
