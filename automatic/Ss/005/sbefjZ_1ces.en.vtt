00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
how these really work I just know it's

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.979 
how these really work I just know it's
like<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.850> figure<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.330> could<00:02:39.450> use<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
like a figure you could use it with the

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.630 
like a figure you could use it with the
Skylanders<00:02:40.530> game<00:02:40.709> somehow<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.250> something

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
Skylanders game somehow or something

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.270

something<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.890> not<00:02:43.890> too<00:02:44.130> familiar

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
something like that not too familiar

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.710 
something like that not too familiar
with<00:02:44.580> these<00:02:44.850> but<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.660> know<00:02:47.239> how<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.300> says<00:02:48.569> it

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
with these but you know how it says it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.960 
with these but you know how it says it
right<00:02:48.750> here<00:02:48.900> actually<00:02:49.340> works<00:02:50.340> with<00:02:50.640> the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
anything with this 8-bit treasure let's

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.380 
anything with this 8-bit treasure let's
see<00:03:20.530> oh<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.400> know<00:03:21.580> what<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.090> it's<00:03:22.120> like

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
see oh you know what it is so it's like

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.259 
see oh you know what it is so it's like
a<00:03:22.420> zip-up<00:03:23.260> type<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.650> thing<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.970> kind<00:03:25.209> of

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
a zip-up type of thing it kind of

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.640 
a zip-up type of thing it kind of
reminds<00:03:25.569> me<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.780> one<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:25.989> those<00:03:26.140> blocks<00:03:26.500> in

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
reminds me of one of those blocks in

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.130 
reminds me of one of those blocks in
geometry<00:03:26.920> dash<00:03:27.370> right<00:03:27.700> but<00:03:28.540> yeah<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:28.900> what<00:03:29.050> you

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
geometry dash right but yeah so what you

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.540 
geometry dash right but yeah so what you
do<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.319> pretty<00:03:29.680> much<00:03:29.800> just<00:03:29.950> attach<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.489> to

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
do is pretty much just attach this to

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.820 
do is pretty much just attach this to
let's<00:03:30.849> say<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.209> give<00:03:31.870> book<00:03:32.080> back<00:03:32.260> zipper<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
let's say like give book back zipper and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.110 
let's say like give book back zipper and
it's<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.340> guess<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.640> just<00:03:33.670> makes<00:03:34.000> it

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
it's just I guess it just makes it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.530 
it's just I guess it just makes it
easier<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.540> zip<00:03:34.989> up<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.980> know<00:03:36.160> but<00:03:37.030> anyways<00:03:37.390> it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
easier to zip up you know but anyways it

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.240 
easier to zip up you know but anyways it
comes<00:03:37.810> with<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.230> definitely<00:03:38.709> reminds<00:03:39.069> me<00:03:39.160> of

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
comes with this definitely reminds me of

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.550 
comes with this definitely reminds me of
the<00:03:39.310> geometry<00:03:39.819> block<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.269> uh<00:03:40.380> geometry<00:03:41.380> dash
