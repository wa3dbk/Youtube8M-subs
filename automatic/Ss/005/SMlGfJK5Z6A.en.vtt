00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.200 

next<00:02:11.620> your<00:02:11.830> oil<00:02:12.100> should<00:02:12.400> be<00:02:12.430> heated<00:02:12.820> up<00:02:12.940> so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
like so apparently my oil was not very

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.360 
like so apparently my oil was not very
heated<00:02:19.240> up<00:02:19.450> oh<00:02:20.190> well<00:02:21.190> it'll<00:02:22.180> still<00:02:22.510> cook<00:02:22.870> and

of<00:04:07.690> garlic<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.739> easiest<00:04:09.070> way<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.370> get<00:04:09.850> the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
of garlic and the easiest way to get the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.690 
of garlic and the easiest way to get the
skin<00:04:10.150> off<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.840> smash<00:04:11.440> them<00:04:11.769> with<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.579> edge

skin off is to smash them with the edge

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.850 
skin off is to smash them with the edge
of<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:13.000> knife<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.600> that'll<00:04:14.200> kind<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.470> just<00:04:14.620> pop

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
of a knife and that'll kind of just pop

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.830 
of a knife and that'll kind of just pop
the<00:04:15.010> skin<00:04:15.220> all<00:04:15.370> off<00:04:15.579> and<00:04:15.880> then<00:04:16.390> just<00:04:16.570> chop<00:04:16.810> it

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
the skin all off and then just chop it

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.289 
the skin all off and then just chop it
up<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.229> throw<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.590> in<00:04:17.709> there<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.880> longer<00:04:19.180> you

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
up and throw it in there the longer you

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.870 
up and throw it in there the longer you
cook<00:04:19.450> garlic<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.080> less<00:04:20.410> intense<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.640> flavor

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880

kind of a non-existent skill anymore and

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.110 
kind of a non-existent skill anymore and
it's<00:05:37.029> just<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:37.659> useful<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.409> have<00:05:38.909> girls<00:05:39.909> love

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.230 
and also it saves you a ton of money you
control<00:05:44.919> exactly<00:05:45.279> what<00:05:45.639> goes<00:05:45.789> into<00:05:46.029> your<00:05:46.149> body
