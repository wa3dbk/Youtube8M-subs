we got all the pistons and when the
Pistons<00:00:53.879> are<00:00:54.030> activated<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:54.829> destroy<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
Pistons are activated they destroy the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.630 
Pistons are activated they destroy the
reeds<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.969> grown<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.039> then<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.430> reeds

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
reeds that have grown and then the reeds

reeds that have grown and then the reeds
fall<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.480> water<00:01:00.660> stream<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
fall into the water stream this is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380 
fall into the water stream this is
duplicated<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> other<00:01:02.609> side<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> way

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
duplicated on the other side by the way

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.880 
duplicated on the other side by the way
and<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:06.650> go<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.820> area

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.870

automatic<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> only<00:01:57.810> problem<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.350> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
automatic but the only problem was that

when this when the seed the beauty she
grew<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:05.219> should<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> watch

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180

grew you should know this if you watch
eat<00:02:06.420> those<00:02:06.630> labs<00:02:06.869> beauty<00:02:07.560> switch<00:02:07.890> video<00:02:08.250> but

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
eat those labs beauty switch video but

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.250 
eat those labs beauty switch video but
if<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.629> grew<00:02:10.050> then<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.310> water

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
if this grew then the water

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.500 
if this grew then the water
homes<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.780> reed<00:02:15.780> stock<00:02:16.200> stays<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:17.159> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
homes in the reed stock stays there and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.880 
homes in the reed stock stays there and
unless<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.629> come<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.959> destroy<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:19.709> won't

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
unless you come and destroy it and won't

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.300 
unless you come and destroy it and won't
grow<00:02:20.159> anymore<00:02:20.189> so<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> won't<00:02:20.970> update<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:22.310> water

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
grow anymore so I won't update the water

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.569 
grow anymore so I won't update the water
stream<00:02:23.730> anymore<00:02:24.150> causing<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.170> b<00:02:25.680> UD<00:02:26.129> switch

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
stream anymore causing the b UD switch

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.449 
stream anymore causing the b UD switch
to<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.939> useless<00:02:27.390> until<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.900> break<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.379> reed<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
to be useless until I break the reed and

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.360 
to be useless until I break the reed and
so<00:02:30.209> what<00:02:30.599> I<00:02:30.629> did<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.829> is<00:02:31.980> an<00:02:32.099> extra

so what I did here is this is an extra
attachment<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:32.970> thought<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.390> on<00:02:33.510> my<00:02:33.690> own<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.220> I

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
attachment I thought of on my own and I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.979 
attachment I thought of on my own and I

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.979 
did not copy any that anybody but
somebody<00:02:37.440> else<00:02:37.590> could<00:02:37.829> have<00:02:37.920> done<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.989> so

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
somebody else could have done this so

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.770 
somebody else could have done this so
what<00:02:40.409> I<00:02:40.440> did<00:02:40.530> was<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:41.190> placed<00:02:41.640> two<00:02:41.940> pistons<00:02:42.450> here

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
what I did was I placed two pistons here

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.259 
what I did was I placed two pistons here
and<00:02:43.909> I<00:02:44.909> kind<00:02:45.269> them<00:02:45.629> very<00:02:46.290> precisely<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.220> that

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
and I kind them very precisely so that

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.309 
and I kind them very precisely so that
it'll<00:02:50.480> undestroyed<00:02:51.480> these<00:02:51.690> Reed's<00:02:51.959> without

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
it'll undestroyed these Reed's without

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.119 
it'll undestroyed these Reed's without
updating<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.310> block<00:02:53.519> next<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.180> again<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.769> I

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
updating the block next to it again so I

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.460 
updating the block next to it again so I
know<00:02:56.879> that<00:02:57.060> was<00:02:57.239> kind<00:02:57.389> of<00:02:57.480> hard<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.810> understand

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
know that was kind of hard to understand

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.759 
know that was kind of hard to understand
but<00:02:59.450> let<00:03:00.450> me<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.569> show<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:02.659> so<00:03:03.659> I'm<00:03:04.650> just

but let me just show you so I'm just
gonna<00:03:04.970> place<00:03:05.970> some<00:03:06.000> reeds<00:03:06.420> here<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.870> you'll

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
gonna place some reeds here and you'll

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.110 
gonna place some reeds here and you'll
see<00:03:07.109> it<00:03:07.230> update<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.069> Pistons<00:03:08.579> will<00:03:08.700> push<00:03:08.940> out

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
see it update the Pistons will push out

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.300 
see it update the Pistons will push out
and<00:03:09.420> then<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.769> thing<00:03:11.010> will<00:03:11.069> go<00:03:11.340> into<00:03:11.489> action

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
and then this thing will go into action

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.689 
and then this thing will go into action
updates<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.409> and<00:03:16.680> then<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.549> saw

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
time so that the water up didn't update

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.850 
time so that the water up didn't update
itself<00:03:30.590> again<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:32.420> basically<00:03:32.990> i'll<00:03:33.200> just<00:03:33.350> you

reads right now because it didn't get

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.930 
reads right now because it didn't get
that<00:03:54.440> much<00:03:54.590> time<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:54.980> grow<00:03:55.130> before<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.550> hit<00:03:55.910> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
that much time to grow before I hit the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.500 
that much time to grow before I hit the
switch<00:03:56.300> again<00:03:57.640> all<00:03:58.640> right<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.120> just<00:04:02.300> got<00:04:02.450> a
