back<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.870> see<00:05:06.900> if<00:05:07.110> he<00:05:07.380> had<00:05:07.470> come<00:05:07.680> out<00:05:07.850> had<00:05:08.850> not

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
back to see if he had come out had not

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.030 
back to see if he had come out had not
come<00:05:09.300> out<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.690> this<00:05:10.020> is<00:05:10.080> probably<00:05:10.320> good<00:05:10.620> 10<00:05:10.920> to

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
come out and this is probably good 10 to

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.930 
come out and this is probably good 10 to
15<00:05:11.340> minutes<00:05:11.520> afterwards<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.980> mean<00:05:13.980> by<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:14.880> time

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
15 minutes afterwards I mean by the time

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.720 
15 minutes afterwards I mean by the time
we<00:05:15.750> left<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.560> had<00:05:16.710> gone<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.010> get<00:05:17.160> food<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.610> I

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
we left and had gone and get food and I

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.520 
we left and had gone and get food and I
come<00:05:17.940> back<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.420> was<00:05:18.510> probably<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.350> know<00:05:19.440> a

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
come back it was probably you know a

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.590 
come back it was probably you know a
little<00:05:19.710> over<00:05:19.980> 30<00:05:20.280> minutes<00:05:20.640> maybe<00:05:20.850> 45<00:05:21.300> minutes

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
little over 30 minutes maybe 45 minutes

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.440 
little over 30 minutes maybe 45 minutes
or<00:05:21.660> so<00:05:21.720> so<00:05:22.710> I'm<00:05:22.980> thinking<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.670> know<00:05:23.820> this<00:05:24.030> is

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
or so so I'm thinking you know this is

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.450 
or so so I'm thinking you know this is
very<00:05:24.510> possible<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:25.260> Dad<00:05:25.620> do<00:05:25.980> just<00:05:26.280> robbed
