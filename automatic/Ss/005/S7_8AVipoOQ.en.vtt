00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
right spool spool cap we've got the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.729 
right spool spool cap we've got the
small<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:38.000> medium<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.930> large<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.470> there

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
small the medium and the large and there

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.890 
small the medium and the large and there
are<00:02:39.769> reasons<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.489> use<00:02:40.519> these<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.209> see<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.690> lot<00:02:41.870> of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
are reasons to use these I see a lot of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.210 
are reasons to use these I see a lot of
people<00:02:42.080> out<00:02:42.320> there<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.650> would<00:02:42.739> tell<00:02:43.010> other

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
people oh I don't need to use them I

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.789 
people oh I don't need to use them I
change<00:02:44.660> thread<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.380> much<00:02:45.560> when<00:02:45.739> I'm

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
change thread so much when I'm

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.740 
change thread so much when I'm
embroidering<00:02:46.280> for<00:02:46.580> example<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.540> don't

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
embroidering for example but I don't

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.539 
embroidering for example but I don't
need<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.989> use<00:02:48.170> them<00:02:48.350> well<00:02:48.739> yeah<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.400> do

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
need to use them well yeah you do

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.520 
need to use them well yeah you do
because<00:02:50.390> when<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.690> machine<00:02:51.019> breaks<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.440> has

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
because when that machine breaks and has

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.210 
because when that machine breaks and has
to<00:02:51.650> go<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.830> repair<00:02:52.130> shop<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:54.160> customer<00:02:55.160> is

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and see how it gets caught on that slit

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.990 
and see how it gets caught on that slit
and<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:15.170> pulls<00:03:15.470> you'll<00:03:16.430> get<00:03:16.610> caught<00:03:16.819> in<00:03:16.910> that

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
and it pulls you'll get caught in that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.990 
and it pulls you'll get caught in that
slit<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.540> will<00:03:17.660> pull<00:03:18.340> your<00:03:19.340> needle<00:03:19.489> will<00:03:19.730> drag

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
slit it will pull your needle will drag

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.270 
slit it will pull your needle will drag
and<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.810> will<00:03:20.930> break<00:03:21.110> how<00:03:21.650> do<00:03:21.709> we<00:03:21.860> prevent<00:03:22.100> this

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
and it will break how do we prevent this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.699 
and it will break how do we prevent this
from<00:03:22.400> happening<00:03:22.660> we<00:03:23.660> use<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.110> protein<00:03:24.470> size

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
from happening we use the protein size

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.260 
from happening we use the protein size
four<00:03:25.040> cap<00:03:25.310> now<00:03:25.520> what<00:03:25.640> would<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.850> think<00:03:26.090> this

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
four cap now what would you think this

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.509 
four cap now what would you think this
one<00:03:26.450> would<00:03:26.569> take<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.780> medium<00:03:27.290> well<00:03:27.980> if<00:03:28.130> I<00:03:28.250> put<00:03:28.489> a

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
one would take a medium well if I put a

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.750 
one would take a medium well if I put a
medium<00:03:28.819> on<00:03:29.180> here<00:03:29.860> it's<00:03:30.860> not<00:03:31.069> covering<00:03:31.519> the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
medium on here it's not covering the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.220 
medium on here it's not covering the
edge<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.480> you're<00:03:32.630> still<00:03:32.870> going<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.050> get

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
edge and you're still going to get

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.710 
edge and you're still going to get
caught<00:03:33.470> in<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.650> slit<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:35.300> you're<00:03:35.450> going<00:03:35.660> to

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
caught in that slit so you're going to

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.170 
caught in that slit so you're going to
use<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:38.180> larger<00:03:38.630> one<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:40.400> larger<00:03:40.819> one<00:03:40.970> is

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
use the larger one and the larger one is

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.130 
use the larger one and the larger one is
going<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.450> give<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:43.450> enough<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.780> go<00:03:44.930> around

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
going to give you enough to go around

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.430 
going to give you enough to go around
you<00:03:45.980> see<00:03:46.160> how<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:46.430> going<00:03:46.640> around<00:03:47.440> completely

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
you see how it's going around completely

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.050 
you see how it's going around completely
goes<00:03:48.620> up<00:03:48.830> above<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.430> around<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.910> actual

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
goes up above and around the actual

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.630 
goes up above and around the actual
spool<00:03:50.569> of<00:03:50.720> thread<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.200> as<00:03:51.769> you're<00:03:51.950> feeding<00:03:52.400> it

could have a chance catching on that
slit<00:04:10.940> there<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.810> you're<00:04:11.959> going<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:12.230> put<00:04:12.590> the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
slit there so you're going to put the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.020 
slit there so you're going to put the
spool<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:15.109> largest<00:04:15.560> Pole<00:04:15.769> one<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.190> then<00:04:16.880> when

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
spool the largest Pole one and then when

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.580 
spool the largest Pole one and then when
you<00:04:17.120> feed<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.570> through<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:18.049> see<00:04:18.260> how<00:04:18.380> nice

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
you feed it through you see how nice

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.500 
you feed it through you see how nice
that's<00:04:18.829> going<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.100> feed<00:04:19.280> through<00:04:19.640> nothing's

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
that's going to feed through nothing's

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.930 
that's going to feed through nothing's
going<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.959> catch<00:04:21.200> we<00:04:21.950> assume<00:04:22.310> that<00:04:22.370> in<00:04:22.610> for<00:04:22.850> you

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
going to catch we assume that in for you

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.250 
going to catch we assume that in for you
so<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.300> see<00:04:23.510> what<00:04:23.630> I'm<00:04:23.690> talking<00:04:23.720> about<00:04:24.080> a

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
so you can see what I'm talking about a

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.490 
so you can see what I'm talking about a
little<00:04:24.560> closer<00:04:24.830> for<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:25.690> okay<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:27.080> as<00:04:27.380> you

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
little closer for you okay and as you

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.050 
little closer for you okay and as you
can<00:04:27.620> see<00:04:27.680> as<00:04:27.919> it's<00:04:28.070> feeding<00:04:28.400> is<00:04:28.610> going<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:28.910> go

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
can see as it's feeding is going to go

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.290 
can see as it's feeding is going to go
around<00:04:29.229> that<00:04:30.229> spool<00:04:31.039> cap<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.729> will<00:04:31.880> not<00:04:32.030> catch

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
around that spool cap it will not catch

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.930 
around that spool cap it will not catch
on<00:04:32.450> anything<00:04:32.570> therefore<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:34.340> will<00:04:34.490> not<00:04:34.669> break

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
on anything therefore it will not break

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.850 
on anything therefore it will not break
