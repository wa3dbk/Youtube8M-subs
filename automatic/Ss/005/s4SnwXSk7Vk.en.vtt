00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.270
 broth 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:50.460

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.010

 Let's take this one now and I'll pass the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.299
 itabom lime that I'm going to use the same 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.979

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:22.110
 our balance here in our mouths 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 then I 'll use the same campaign as 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.939
 I'll do with that chicken now. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.159
 I'll take all of it and I'll divert 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.590
 roughly when he leaned against it 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:39.479
 again we make the knife like that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.920
 said Adam Cruise is this here I 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:52.860
 well come on then it's already all over them 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:02:00.320
 Here I crucify butter with a sip of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.320
 olive oil and here together 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:10.550
 Let's put the garlic and onion 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.940
 Just to make it transparent, you can not just 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.940
 getting burned is extremely fast 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:26.480
 hello good stirred in our broth 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.640
 We put a tire with the laurel. 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.420
 has all the flavors of carrot onion 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:40.579
 okay so we do not need spices and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.870
 all are already there or melt the 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:49.760
 butter and olive oil 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:58.430
 We already come with franco and together with 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:03:08.750
 chicken a pinch of salt and a little bit 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:12.250
 and we have already entered with the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.250
 wheat flour 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:20.450
 now here with the lowest fire 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:26.709
 We're going to take it down here. 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.019
 slowly until it's fine 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.389
 minutes a minute and a half an hour 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.250
 to defend a purse is to dig this in my 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.739
 panela that he does not get on the bottom is 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.480
 So, in your house, pay attention to that. 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.750
 It's time he's going to start picking 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.510
 background life begins to change and flour 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.400
 until the onion is has all the liquids that 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.650
 have been absorbed so it gets 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.810
 drier and starts the way I see it 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.380
 Here I start shaving the bottom of my 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.079
 nature he's already getting good pay 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.540
 attention at this time to stir well not 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.669
 let's burn up some hypothesis 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.849
 This time, it's our time. 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:07.329
 start slowly and adding the 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.329
 broth 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:19.110
 and always messing around watching the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:27.990
 creaminess that appeared with the 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:31.140
 broth roll more broth and stir and here 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.210
 Now we're putting the broth on. 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.820
 seeing one thing at a time 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.340
 O to stay where we want it is 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.620
 more 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:50.820
 move, do not hurry, put dilma 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:53.610
 and stirring until no because you always 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.760
 have to wait to boil again 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.480
 you can not come to a conclusion if 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.530
 already creamy enough or not before 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.600
 to boil 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.830
 so every time you put it on 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.830
 add more broth you need 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.650
 waiting to boil again it seemed that 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.840
 It was already smooth and the 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.490
 boil and thicken or one more time there 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.490
 one more broth ladle 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:28.680
 But this one now I get to our point. 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.760
 very creamy here now it's time to 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.760
 taste the salt and pepper 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.520
 Looks very hot, very hot. 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.040
 same 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.350
 and it still fits one more thigh back 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:52.490
 It'll be the last one we'll put 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:06:06.650
 here now only the well-beaten parsley 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:10.590
 mixing the water already the plate 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:15.900
 cheese grater already leave cheese 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:19.620
 way to prove it a little here in 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.860
 soups that the entrance of the cost of a good 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:27.960
 Couple looking for soup is very cool, huh? 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:33.270
 It's already entered that it 's ready. 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:35.819
 boiled creamy consistency very beautiful 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.400
 creamy power in careful not 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:40.169
 means to be a porridge is a puree 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.250
 a creamy consistency 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.250
 I have already seen that the 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:56.939
 look how delicious creamy soup of 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.669
 franken likes too much parmesan is on the 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:03.719
 but we have already put the taste 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:08.490

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:11.159

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.729
