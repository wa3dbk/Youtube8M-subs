00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
little tighter on this side this is a

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.280 
little tighter on this side this is a
fun<00:06:51.070> easy<00:06:51.280> look<00:06:51.700> that'd<00:06:52.060> be<00:06:52.690> pretty<00:06:52.870> quick<00:06:53.080> to

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
fun easy look that'd be pretty quick to

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.350 
fun easy look that'd be pretty quick to
do<00:06:53.440> that<00:06:53.680> you<00:06:53.770> can<00:06:53.920> do<00:06:54.010> it<00:06:54.160> either<00:06:54.370> a<00:06:54.730> win<00:06:55.240> and

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
do that you can do it either a win and

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.800 
do that you can do it either a win and
fire<00:06:55.630> or<00:06:56.230> a<00:06:56.290> half<00:06:57.250> inch<00:06:57.490> flat<00:06:57.700> iron<00:06:57.910> you<00:06:58.630> could

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
fire or a half inch flat iron you could

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.270 
fire or a half inch flat iron you could
probably<00:06:58.990> do<00:06:59.170> it<00:06:59.230> you<00:06:59.410> with<00:06:59.590> the<00:06:59.710> 2-inch<00:06:59.890> water

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
probably do it you with the 2-inch water

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.970 
probably do it you with the 2-inch water
and<00:07:00.490> you<00:07:00.580> just<00:07:00.790> get<00:07:01.000> bigger<00:07:01.180> waves<00:07:01.480> so<00:07:02.470> I<00:07:02.500> hope

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980
