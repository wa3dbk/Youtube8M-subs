Madrid<00:03:10.990> I<00:03:11.400> don't<00:03:12.400> know<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.520> might<00:03:12.880> even<00:03:12.940> lose

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
Madrid I don't know I might even lose

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.600 
Madrid I don't know I might even lose
the<00:03:13.510> campaign<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:16.180> not<00:03:16.450> gonna<00:03:16.570> happen

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
the campaign but it's not gonna happen

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:37.650 
the campaign but it's not gonna happen
least<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.730> hope<00:03:18.820> not

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.140

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
over and see the army they have a lot of

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.920 
over and see the army they have a lot of
militia<00:03:58.360> type<00:03:58.660> units<00:03:59.050> and<00:03:59.610> cavalry<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.690> they

pirates<00:04:05.050> or<00:04:05.200> something<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.680> that's<00:04:06.040> kind<00:04:06.880> of

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
pirates or something and that's kind of

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.460 
pirates or something and that's kind of
what<00:04:07.120> I'm<00:04:07.240> worried<00:04:07.540> about<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.170> what

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
what I'm worried about that is what

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.400 
what I'm worried about that is what
could<00:04:08.620> beat<00:04:08.830> me<00:04:09.010> in<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.970> combat<00:04:10.900> on<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.230> wall

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
could beat me in a combat on the wall

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.530 
could beat me in a combat on the wall
the<00:04:12.250> militia<00:04:12.550> will<00:04:12.820> lose<00:04:13.030> because<00:04:13.300> they're

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
the militia will lose because they're

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.630 
the militia will lose because they're
going<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.720> be<00:04:13.810> all<00:04:13.930> demoralized<00:04:14.590> by<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:15.430> guns

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
going to be all demoralized by the guns

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.180 
going to be all demoralized by the guns
firing<00:04:15.940> at<00:04:16.209> them<00:04:16.360> in<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.540> cannons<00:04:16.989> but<00:04:17.739> the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
firing at them in the cannons but the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.699 
firing at them in the cannons but the
Pirates<00:04:18.459> might<00:04:19.450> be<00:04:19.930> able<00:04:20.020> to<00:04:20.170> fight<00:04:20.410> their<00:04:20.590> way

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
Pirates might be able to fight their way

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.240 
Pirates might be able to fight their way
up<00:04:20.860> put<00:04:21.040> their<00:04:21.190> swords<00:04:21.520> and<00:04:21.700> then<00:04:22.950> just<00:04:23.950> hack

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
up put their swords and then just hack

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
up put their swords and then just hack
down<00:04:24.580> my<00:04:25.090> armed<00:04:25.300> citizenry<00:04:26.730> so<00:04:27.730> that<00:04:27.970> could

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
down my armed citizenry so that could

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.810 
down my armed citizenry so that could
suck<00:04:28.600> but<00:04:29.200> we're<00:04:29.590> gonna<00:04:29.680> hope<00:04:30.340> for<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.610> best

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
suck but we're gonna hope for the best

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.570 
suck but we're gonna hope for the best
here<00:04:31.470> there's<00:04:32.470> only<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:32.710> regiment<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.430> them

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.700 
here there's only one regiment of them
and<00:04:33.840> hopefully<00:04:34.840> most<00:04:35.200> of<00:04:35.290> them<00:04:35.440> will<00:04:35.590> be

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
and hopefully most of them will be

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.110 
and hopefully most of them will be
killed<00:04:35.920> before<00:04:36.160> they<00:04:36.460> can<00:04:36.580> even<00:04:36.610> reach<00:04:36.940> the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
killed before they can even reach the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:48.190 
killed before they can even reach the
walls

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200

but anyway oh we killed their general
that<00:05:00.290> was<00:05:00.440> lucky<00:05:00.770> that<00:05:00.950> was<00:05:01.910> like<00:05:02.120> um<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.780> like

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
that was lucky that was like um and like

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.640 
that was lucky that was like um and like
Joseph<00:05:06.950> B<00:05:07.100> Stalin<00:05:07.610> attacked<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.240> they<00:05:08.330> just

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
Joseph B Stalin attacked and they just

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.010 
Joseph B Stalin attacked and they just
destroyed<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.860> general<00:05:10.310> in<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.490> first<00:05:10.820> shot

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
destroyed the general in the first shot

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:29.719 
destroyed the general in the first shot
it's<00:05:12.020> basically<00:05:12.410> how<00:05:12.590> lucky<00:05:12.890> this<00:05:13.070> was

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.549 

but<00:05:30.330> anyway<00:05:30.749> they're<00:05:30.930> trying<00:05:31.139> to<00:05:31.199> walk<00:05:31.379> around

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:31.559 
but anyway they're trying to walk around

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.459 
but anyway they're trying to walk around
and<00:05:32.449> that's<00:05:33.449> good<00:05:33.689> for<00:05:33.870> me<00:05:34.020> because<00:05:34.169> the

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
and that's good for me because the

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:35.989 
and that's good for me because the
further<00:05:34.650> they<00:05:34.949> walk<00:05:35.159> the<00:05:35.430> more<00:05:35.610> they'll<00:05:35.789> die

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:35.999 
further they walk the more they'll die

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.149 
further they walk the more they'll die
so<00:05:36.689> I<00:05:36.749> really<00:05:37.229> have<00:05:37.319> no<00:05:37.499> problem<00:05:37.860> with<00:05:38.009> them

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
so I really have no problem with them

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.559 
so I really have no problem with them
walking<00:05:38.430> all<00:05:38.699> the<00:05:38.729> way<00:05:38.879> around<00:05:39.059> to<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.389> back

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
walking all the way around to the back

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.640 
walking all the way around to the back
but<00:05:41.029> here<00:05:42.029> they're<00:05:42.210> going<00:05:42.389> to<00:05:42.499> see<00:05:43.499> my

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
but here they're going to see my

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.100 
but here they're going to see my
weakness<00:05:44.069> they're<00:05:44.729> gonna<00:05:44.849> start<00:05:45.240> climbing<00:05:45.990> up

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
weakness they're gonna start climbing up

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.420 
weakness they're gonna start climbing up
in<00:05:46.499> this<00:05:46.710> corner<00:05:47.389> but<00:05:48.389> sending<00:05:49.199> over<00:05:49.529> some<00:05:49.800> men

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
in this corner but sending over some men

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.119 
in this corner but sending over some men
to<00:05:50.789> help<00:05:51.620> defend<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.860> corner<00:05:53.279> and<00:05:55.009> we'll<00:05:56.009> get

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
to help defend that corner and we'll get

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:03.090 
to help defend that corner and we'll get
it<00:05:56.279> under<00:05:56.520> control

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.760 

it's<00:06:04.100> happening<00:06:04.490> on<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.700> other<00:06:04.850> side<00:06:05.120> too

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
it's happening on the other side too

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.800 
it's happening on the other side too
we've<00:06:06.770> got<00:06:06.950> this<00:06:07.160> they're<00:06:07.910> not<00:06:08.660> really

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
we've got this they're not really

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.480 
we've got this they're not really
sending<00:06:09.170> anyone<00:06:09.410> to<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.680> front<00:06:10.010> so<00:06:10.250> we<00:06:10.370> can

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
sending anyone to the front so we can

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.800 
sending anyone to the front so we can
afford<00:06:10.700> to<00:06:10.790> take<00:06:10.970> men<00:06:11.210> away<00:06:11.420> from<00:06:11.630> their

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
afford to take men away from their
