00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.600
 they are witnesses of climate change 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.000
 Calcium algae form a thinner skeleton 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.700
 as soon as the oceans became more and more acidic 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.380
 become 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.380
 but what makes it more angry 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.840
 very easily 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.550
 Carbon dioxide that lands not only in the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.449
 atmosphere and leads to rising 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.449
 temperatures 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.279
 it also gets into the sea a good 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.920
 of carbon dioxide would take up the third 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.440
 Oceans on them are a giant 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.390
 memory they cover about 70 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.739
 percent of the earth's surface but always 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.469
 even more co2 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.660
 that goes to the substance of what happens 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.000
 The carbon dioxide dissolves and reacts 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.090
 with the water to carbonated and the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.129
 makes it more angry until the end of the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.559
 expect twenty-first century 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.379
 researchers have such a low ph value in 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.010
 the seas we have been for 650 thousand years 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.650
 no more 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.290
 the consequences are serious for quite a few 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.840
 but also for others 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.430
 Marine animals are threatened in their existence 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.950
 be cold water coral sea cucumber or 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.170
 the tiny birds are snailing 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.659
 they have housing that is acidic 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.950
 more water can dissolve explorers 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.810
 provided the evidence 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.350
 they simulated the expected ones 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.150
 carbon dioxide concentration for the year 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 2100 the protective cover of the maria 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.790
 snails broke up within two 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.010
 days up 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.850
 disappear midgets would have 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.490
 follow for other fish or fish 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.160
 Seabirds need to find new sources of food 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.990
 tap 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.610
 but the acidification of the sea still has 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.900
 another will make it louder 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.090
 the vibrations, for example, through 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.190
 surf waves will arise 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 actually due to dissolved mineral water 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.970
 swallowed well again for the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.970
 Marine life and their communication 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.229
 but because of the acidification takes the 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.630
 Concentration of the mineral and the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.950
 Underwater noise too 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.650
 that can be the communication of the animals 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.050
 annoy more acid 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.390
 more loud in the next decades 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.950
 so the forecasts will be the sound level 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 solid rising
