the tank and throws it up in the air or

part<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.340> design<00:00:42.579> feature<00:00:42.969> underneath

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 

nowadays<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.259> course<00:01:16.290> most<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.100> tank<00:01:17.399> sir

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
nowadays of course most of the tank sir

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.240 
nowadays of course most of the tank sir
you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.930> something<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.799> inside

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you can see something on what was inside

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
you can see something on what was inside
the<00:01:20.430> museum<00:01:20.939> most<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.780> them<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.259> don't

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the museum most of them now they don't

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.410 
the museum most of them now they don't
have<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> rounded<00:01:23.369> shape<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> class

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
have this rounded shape of all the class

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
have this rounded shape of all the class
metal<00:01:24.990> they're<00:01:25.170> much<00:01:25.350> flatter<00:01:25.890> looking<00:01:26.579> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
metal they're much flatter looking and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
metal they're much flatter looking and
that's<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.659> no<00:01:27.899> Dharma<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.220> actually

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that's because no Dharma is not actually

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.840 
that's because no Dharma is not actually
all<00:01:29.789> metal<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.899> can't<00:01:31.200> bend<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.310> made<00:01:32.640> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
all metal they can't bend it is made of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:48.120 
all metal they can't bend it is made of
laminate

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.789 

so<00:01:48.820> sometimes<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.570> see<00:01:49.600> extra<00:01:50.080> boxes<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.710> that

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
so sometimes you see extra boxes of that

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.580 
so sometimes you see extra boxes of that
armor<00:01:51.189> is<00:01:51.220> put<00:01:51.549> on<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.759> outside<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.240> tanks<00:01:52.810> on

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
armor is put on the outside of tanks on

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.310 
armor is put on the outside of tanks on
the<00:01:53.770> turrets<00:01:54.189> on<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.460> main<00:01:54.640> hull<00:01:54.939> as<00:01:55.150> well<00:01:55.390> as

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
the turrets on the main hull as well as

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.539 
the turrets on the main hull as well as
I<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:56.619> they<00:01:56.740> can't<00:01:56.979> bend<00:01:57.190> it

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
I so they can't bend it

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.670 
I so they can't bend it
it's<00:01:57.670> made<00:01:58.000> of<00:01:58.150> things<00:01:58.330> like<00:01:58.570> rubber<00:01:58.869> ceramic

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
it's made of things like rubber ceramic

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.010 
it's made of things like rubber ceramic
metal<00:02:00.369> all<00:02:00.729> put<00:02:01.090> together<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.630> sandwich

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
metal all put together in a sandwich

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.590 
metal all put together in a sandwich
with<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.640> reason<00:02:03.939> why<00:02:04.060> those<00:02:04.240> molten

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
with it so the reason why those molten

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.749 
with it so the reason why those molten
tanks<00:02:04.899> have<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.229> very<00:02:05.470> flat<00:02:05.860> faceted<00:02:06.580> look

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
tanks have that very flat faceted look

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.639 
tanks have that very flat faceted look
not<00:02:07.360> like<00:02:07.509> this<00:02:07.720> generation<00:02:08.319> when<00:02:08.440> they<00:02:08.560> were

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
not like this generation when they were

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:24.590 
not like this generation when they were
cast<00:02:08.920> metal<00:02:09.459> or<00:02:10.239> will

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.030 

okay<00:02:25.600> these<00:02:25.810> are<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.110> world<00:02:26.290> retainers<00:02:26.860> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
okay these are the world retainers a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.350 
okay these are the world retainers a
nasty<00:02:27.490> lot<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:29.470> retain<00:02:29.920> Ian's<00:02:30.250> like<00:02:31.000> many

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
nasty lot now we retain Ian's like many

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.870 
nasty lot now we retain Ian's like many
countries<00:02:31.750> these<00:02:32.460> actually<00:02:33.460> make<00:02:33.610> their<00:02:33.850> own

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
countries these actually make their own

countries these actually make their own
taxes<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.660> got<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:34.960> from<00:02:35.080> someone<00:02:35.410> else<00:02:35.620> and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.940 
taxes I got it from someone else and
this<00:02:36.640> tank<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.840> really<00:02:38.410> good<00:02:38.680> check

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
this tank this is a really good check

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.060 
this tank this is a really good check
not<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.490> glamorous<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:40.180> if<00:02:40.720> surtax<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.470> Germans

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
not so glamorous is if surtax of Germans

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.220 
not so glamorous is if surtax of Germans
made<00:02:42.250> after<00:02:43.180> World<00:02:43.390> War<00:02:43.570> two<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:43.900> they're

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
made after World War two and they're

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.290 
made after World War two and they're
allowed<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.590> make<00:02:44.740> tanks<00:02:45.010> again<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.910> said<00:02:46.120> no

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
allowed to make tanks again but said no

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.700 
allowed to make tanks again but said no
we're<00:02:46.630> not<00:02:46.660> going<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:46.990> go<00:02:47.110> through<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> massive

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
we're not going to go through a massive

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.160 
we're not going to go through a massive
heavy<00:02:48.040> tank<00:02:48.370> like<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.030> tiger<00:02:49.690> or<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.959> king

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
heavy tank like a tiger or the king

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.170 
heavy tank like a tiger or the king
tiger<00:02:50.740> we're<00:02:51.250> going<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.430> go<00:02:51.550> for<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.760> speed

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
tiger we're going to go for the speed

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.360 
tiger we're going to go for the speed
and<00:02:52.870> that's<00:02:53.080> what<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:53.410> built<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.830> tank<00:02:54.160> for

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
and that's what we built this tank for

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.840 
and that's what we built this tank for
to<00:02:54.580> be<00:02:54.700> fast

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.810 

is<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.630> boat<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.080> wheels<00:03:03.700> what's<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
is it like a boat on wheels what's the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.730 
is it like a boat on wheels what's the
commander<00:03:05.360> need<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.690> do<00:03:05.810> very<00:03:05.840> first<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.620> all

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
commander need to do very first of all
