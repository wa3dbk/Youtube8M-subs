 santiago jackson we did not deserve that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.790
 did a good part but 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 luckily a price on a kick 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.540
 stopped it's frustrating but to have 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.680
 do the job and next at home face 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.570
 we knew it was going on the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.109
 second match does not change much 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.599
 to all the less I miss him just one 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.609
 Roman liquid angie because the whole match 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.470
 at this point still needs months hooves 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.440
 in Libya under the knife as for him 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:44.610
 bill gates music with the ax is shocked 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:45.989
 but then I think I was told 4th 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 referee and I told the referee he 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.140
 came back in the central circle 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 a foot in the face I think that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.420
 it's foul after he's tried differently 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 unfortunately for us I hope that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.870
 I hope that sometimes 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 will not reproduce that we served a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.250
 South team because we just play 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.979
 here and that we lose on an error if 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.720
 an error of the referee is frustrating 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:22.020
 backs of people who talk to me about a solid 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:24.090

 lamb seals I just spent 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.759
 I want to say it's 50 50 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.650
 despite that they have a purpose 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.090
 advanced and who failed to score 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.350
 this goal on the outside that makes so much 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.509
 good in general in doubles 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.700
 confrontations like that but at home 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.079
 we will see 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.899
 see our neighborhood that are going to be there and 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:50.369

 quantified objectives in particular at the museum 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.560
