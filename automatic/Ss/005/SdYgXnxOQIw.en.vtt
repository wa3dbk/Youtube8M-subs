you know if it's the iPad 3 if it's the
bigger<00:00:33.649> 30-pin<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
bigger 30-pin that you can see here the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
bigger 30-pin that you can see here the
iPad<00:00:37.950> 4<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> iPad<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.270> Retina<00:00:39.300> display

however<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> call<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> new<00:00:41.190> iPad

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
however you want to call it the new iPad

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.910 
however you want to call it the new iPad
is<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.930> lightning<00:00:43.379> port<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
is just a little lightning port so the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.340 
is just a little lightning port so the
smaller<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.480> kid<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> same

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
smaller one this kid these are the same

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.630 
smaller one this kid these are the same
cases<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:46.980> grabbed<00:00:47.160> two<00:00:47.190> different

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
cases I just grabbed two different

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
cases I just grabbed two different
colors<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> kind<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.480> show<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.530> uh

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
colors just to kind of show this but uh

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.069 
colors just to kind of show this but uh
same<00:00:50.460> case<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.059> Versa<00:00:51.239> cover<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
same case here the Versa cover here you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
same case here the Versa cover here you
can<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> full<00:00:52.980> cutout<00:00:53.430> being<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
can see as the full cutout being that it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.330 
can see as the full cutout being that it
was<00:00:54.480> originally<00:00:54.899> made<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> iPad<00:00:55.739> 3<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.190> as

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
was originally made for the iPad 3 so as

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.420 
was originally made for the iPad 3 so as
the<00:00:56.520> full<00:00:56.699> cutout<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> 30<00:00:57.870> pin<00:00:58.109> connector

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
the full cutout for the 30 pin connector

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.799 
the full cutout for the 30 pin connector
but<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> Lightning

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
but there you can see with the Lightning

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.799 
but there you can see with the Lightning
port<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.350> still<00:01:01.620> completely<00:01:02.550> centered<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
port it's still completely centered it's

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.690 
port it's still completely centered it's
protected<00:01:04.350> being<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.920> case<00:01:05.189> does<00:01:05.460> come

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
protected being that this case does come

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.990 
protected being that this case does come
up<00:01:05.820> off<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> edge<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.130> anyway<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.400> does<00:01:08.729> work

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
up off the edge so anyway it does work

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.690 
up off the edge so anyway it does work
the<00:01:09.420> magnet<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.799> dimensions<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the magnet and the dimensions are the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.310 
the magnet and the dimensions are the
exact<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
exact same so here you can see the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.429 
exact same so here you can see the
sleep/wake<00:01:13.799> function<00:01:14.340> still<00:01:14.700> works<00:01:14.970> out

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
sleep/wake function still works out

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.149 
sleep/wake function still works out
you're<00:01:16.439> still<00:01:16.590> great<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.790> far<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> goes

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
you're still great as far as that goes

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
you're still great as far as that goes
lots<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.250> other<00:01:20.430> cases<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:21.030> example<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
lots of other cases for example this is

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.469 
lots of other cases for example this is
the<00:01:21.689> doto<00:01:21.990> case<00:01:22.320> has<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> fully<00:01:23.880> exposed

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the doto case has just the fully exposed

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.910 
the doto case has just the fully exposed
bottom<00:01:26.240> let's<00:01:27.240> grab<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> back

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
bottom let's grab this is like a back

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
bottom let's grab this is like a back
case<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.460> works<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> Smart<00:01:30.210> Cover

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
case that works with the Smart Cover

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.840 
case that works with the Smart Cover
that<00:01:30.689> has<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> full<00:01:31.200> bottom<00:01:31.650> that's<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.700> case

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that has the full bottom that's in case

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.960 
that has the full bottom that's in case
magnetic<00:01:33.450> snap<00:01:33.860> anyway<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.460> cases<00:01:35.820> are

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
magnetic snap anyway all the cases are

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.520 
magnetic snap anyway all the cases are
going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.270> work<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.750> made<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> iPad

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
going to work that are made for the iPad

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.710 
going to work that are made for the iPad
3<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> work<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> iPad<00:01:39.299> 4<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
3 are going to work for the iPad 4 the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
3 are going to work for the iPad 4 the
dimensions<00:01:40.170> are<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> exact<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.770> except<00:01:41.640> for

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
dimensions are the exact same except for

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.960 
dimensions are the exact same except for
those<00:01:41.970> ports<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> bottom<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.939> none<00:01:44.939> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
those ports on the bottom and none of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760 
those ports on the bottom and none of
the<00:01:45.149> manufacturers<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.140> announced<00:01:46.380> that

the manufacturers have announced that
they're<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.549> cases<00:01:48.119> specifically

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
they're going to make cases specifically

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810
