hi<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:00.960> I'm<00:00:01.140> alive<00:00:01.350> dr.<00:00:01.680> clay<00:00:01.860> Ballard<00:00:02.100> and

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hi guys I'm alive dr. clay Ballard and

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.090 
hi guys I'm alive dr. clay Ballard and
recent<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.090> did<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> video<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:04.500> seven<00:00:04.920> laws

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
recent I did a video on the seven laws

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.769 
recent I did a video on the seven laws
of<00:00:05.430> compression<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.089> talks<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.629> how<00:00:06.720> to

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
of compression and talks about how to

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.089 
of compression and talks about how to
compress<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.140> golf<00:00:07.410> ball<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.680> got<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> few

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
compress a golf ball I got a few

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.339 
compress a golf ball I got a few
questions<00:00:08.130> about<00:00:08.639> spin<00:00:09.450> loft<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.929> creating

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
questions about spin loft and creating

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.990 
questions about spin loft and creating
spin<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.160> I'm<00:00:11.250> gonna<00:00:11.370> go<00:00:11.519> over<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.880> this

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
spin and I'm gonna go over that in this

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.430 
spin and I'm gonna go over that in this
video<00:00:12.300> series<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:12.809> gonna<00:00:12.929> explain<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> you

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
video series I'm gonna explain to you

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.589 
video series I'm gonna explain to you
exactly<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.980> spin<00:00:14.460> loft<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.210> how<00:00:15.540> you

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
exactly what spin loft is and how you

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.570 
exactly what spin loft is and how you
can<00:00:15.839> create<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:21.800> okay<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.130> today's<00:00:23.250> video

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
can create it okay so in today's video

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.920 
can create it okay so in today's video
I'm<00:00:23.820> gonna<00:00:23.910> go<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.210> bit<00:00:24.359> more<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.720> depth

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
I'm gonna go a little bit more in depth

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.230 
I'm gonna go a little bit more in depth
about<00:00:25.109> what<00:00:25.710> exactly<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.250> spin<00:00:26.519> loft<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.000> how

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
about what exactly is spin loft and how

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.849 
about what exactly is spin loft and how
do<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.390> create<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> golf<00:00:28.320> swing

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
do we create this in a golf swing

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.529 
do we create this in a golf swing
how<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> affect<00:00:29.699> compression

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
how is it going to affect compression

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.450 
how is it going to affect compression
and<00:00:30.720> how<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> also<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> affect<00:00:31.920> spin

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and how is it also going to affect spin

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610 
and how is it also going to affect spin
on<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.640> golf<00:00:32.850> ball<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.690> there's<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.320> two

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
on the golf ball so there's really two

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.590 
on the golf ball so there's really two
things<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:35.219> go<00:00:35.250> into<00:00:35.520> spin<00:00:36.030> loft<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
things that go into spin loft on the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.880 
things that go into spin loft on the
golf<00:00:36.780> ball<00:00:36.870> got<00:00:37.230> those<00:00:37.380> stuck<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.770> there

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
golf ball got those stuck in there

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
golf ball got those stuck in there
pretty<00:00:38.040> good<00:00:38.480> first<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> gonna<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.079> angle

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
pretty good first one is gonna be angle

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
pretty good first one is gonna be angle
of<00:00:40.440> attack<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.980> let's<00:00:41.520> imagine<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.090> golf

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
of attack so let's imagine I have a golf

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.240 
of attack so let's imagine I have a golf
ball<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> ground<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.860> hit<00:00:44.070> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
ball on the ground and as I hit this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.740 
ball on the ground and as I hit this
golf<00:00:44.520> ball<00:00:44.700> make<00:00:44.940> contact<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> golf

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
golf ball make contact with the golf

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680 
golf ball make contact with the golf
ball<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> descending<00:00:47.520> blow<00:00:47.640> or<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
ball do I have a descending blow or do I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.569 
ball do I have a descending blow or do I
have<00:00:48.930> an<00:00:49.050> ace<00:00:49.260> inning<00:00:49.770> blow<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.370> club

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
have an ace inning blow so it's my club

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.700 
have an ace inning blow so it's my club
moving<00:00:50.910> upward<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.510> downward<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.500> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
moving upward or downward and you can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.069 
moving upward or downward and you can
simply<00:00:53.129> picture<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.579> by<00:00:53.760> envisioning<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
simply picture this by envisioning in a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
simply picture this by envisioning in a
sweet<00:00:55.379> spot<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.430> moving<00:00:56.699> downward<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.360> it's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
sweet spot is it moving downward as it's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.819 
sweet spot is it moving downward as it's
hitting<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> golf<00:00:57.930> ball<00:00:58.079> or<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.680> moving

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
hitting the golf ball or is it moving

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.439 
hitting the golf ball or is it moving
upward<00:00:59.399> pretty<00:00:59.699> difficult<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.359> an

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
upward pretty difficult to have an

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.439 
upward pretty difficult to have an
upward<00:01:00.870> angle<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.550> attack<00:01:02.670> unless<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
upward angle of attack unless you have a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
upward angle of attack unless you have a
driver<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> ball<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> tee<00:01:04.830> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
driver and the ball is up on the tee so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.500 
driver and the ball is up on the tee so
for<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.700> let's<00:01:05.939> imagine<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.270> we're<00:01:06.420> gonna

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
for this let's imagine that we're gonna

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
for this let's imagine that we're gonna
hit<00:01:06.659> down<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
hit down on that so that would be at the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.090 
hit down on that so that would be at the
first<00:01:08.250> angle<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> our<00:01:09.299> spin<00:01:09.689> loft<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
first angle and our spin loft so that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310 
first angle and our spin loft so that
would<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> bottom<00:01:11.610> angle<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.140> have

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
would be the bottom angle here if I have

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
would be the bottom angle here if I have
a<00:01:13.350> downward<00:01:13.950> angle<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.430> attack<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.820> would<00:01:14.909> look

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
a downward angle of attack it would look

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
a downward angle of attack it would look
something<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.540> again<00:01:16.229> upward<00:01:16.650> angle

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
something like this again upward angle

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
something like this again upward angle
attack<00:01:17.070> would<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> PGA

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
attack would be like that now on the PGA

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.740 
attack would be like that now on the PGA
Tour<00:01:18.590> all<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.549> players<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.330> average

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
Tour all not all players but the average

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.420 
Tour all not all players but the average
for<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.960> PGA<00:01:22.200> Tour<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:22.740> negative<00:01:23.130> one

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
for the PGA Tour is about negative one

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
for the PGA Tour is about negative one
with<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> driver<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.299> negative<00:01:24.750> five<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
with a driver and negative five with a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.600 
with a driver and negative five with a
pitching<00:01:25.830> wedge<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.220> they're<00:01:26.369> getting

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
pitching wedge so they're getting

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
pitching wedge so they're getting
slightly<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.990> slightly<00:01:28.290> down<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
slightly down very very slightly down on

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
slightly down very very slightly down on
every<00:01:29.460> single<00:01:29.790> Club<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> be

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
every single Club so that's going to be

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
every single Club so that's going to be
this<00:01:30.900> bottom<00:01:31.350> angle<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> second

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
this bottom angle here now the second

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.450 
this bottom angle here now the second
angle<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.770> much<00:01:34.890> loft<00:01:35.250> I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
angle is going to be how much loft I

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
angle is going to be how much loft I
have<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.880> clubface<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> imagine

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
have on this clubface so if you imagine

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.130 
have on this clubface so if you imagine
as<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.799> making<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.189> swing<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.820> make<00:01:39.659> contact

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
as I'm making this swing I make contact

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
as I'm making this swing I make contact
with<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> ball<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> 56-degree<00:01:42.119> wedge

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
with the ball this is a 56-degree wedge

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.310 
with the ball this is a 56-degree wedge
if<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.409> had<00:01:43.619> fifty<00:01:44.610> six<00:01:44.850> degrees<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> loft<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
if it had fifty six degrees of loft the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.569 
if it had fifty six degrees of loft the
second<00:01:46.680> angle<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.070> look<00:01:47.220> something<00:01:47.369> like

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
second angle would look something like

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
second angle would look something like
this<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> would<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> loft<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this so that would be the loft on the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780 
this so that would be the loft on the
club<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> put<00:01:50.250> these<00:01:50.399> two<00:01:50.640> angles

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
club when I put these two angles

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.910 
club when I put these two angles
together<00:01:51.180> let's<00:01:52.140> imagine<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.560> coming<00:01:52.799> in

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
together let's imagine I'm coming in

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
together let's imagine I'm coming in
perfectly<00:01:53.340> shallow<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.970> would<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> zero

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
perfectly shallow that would be a zero

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
perfectly shallow that would be a zero
degree<00:01:55.200> angle<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.979> attack<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.610> be

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
degree angle of attack that would be

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.310 
degree angle of attack that would be
moving<00:01:57.149> perfectly<00:01:57.540> level<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> ground

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
moving perfectly level with the ground

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.649 
moving perfectly level with the ground
as<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.979> make<00:01:59.130> contact<00:01:59.520> with<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> ball<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.119> I

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
as I make contact with the ball and I

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.810 
as I make contact with the ball and I
have<00:02:00.840> fifty-six<00:02:01.590> degrees<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.280> loft<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
have fifty-six degrees of loft on the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940 
have fifty-six degrees of loft on the
club<00:02:02.850> face<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:03.509> my<00:02:03.630> dynamic<00:02:03.899> loft<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
club face that's my dynamic loft the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530 
club face that's my dynamic loft the
loft<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> face<00:02:05.640> when<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> hit<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> ball<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
loft on the face when I hit the ball I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.499 
loft on the face when I hit the ball I
would<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> fifty-six<00:02:08.039> degree<00:02:08.489> spin<00:02:09.300> loft

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
would have a fifty-six degree spin loft

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.530 
would have a fifty-six degree spin loft
so<00:02:10.470> level<00:02:11.069> angle<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.400> attack<00:02:11.540> fifty-six

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so level angle of attack fifty-six

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.760 
so level angle of attack fifty-six
degrees<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.959> loft

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
degrees of loft

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.880 
degrees of loft
56-degree<00:02:14.580> spin<00:02:15.150> loft<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.960> closer<00:02:16.320> these<00:02:16.590> get

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
56-degree spin loft the closer these get

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.740 
56-degree spin loft the closer these get
together<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.760> let's<00:02:17.910> imagine<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.480> still

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
together so let's imagine that I still

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.380 
together so let's imagine that I still
came<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.220> very<00:02:20.220> level<00:02:20.670> with<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.940> golf<00:02:21.150> ball

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
came in very level with the golf ball

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.900 
came in very level with the golf ball
and<00:02:22.110> now<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.410> took<00:02:22.620> some<00:02:22.950> loft<00:02:23.160> off<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.640> instead

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and now I took some loft off so instead

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.730 
and now I took some loft off so instead
of<00:02:23.970> having<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.450> perfectly<00:02:24.930> vertical<00:02:25.440> shaft

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
of having this perfectly vertical shaft

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.710 
of having this perfectly vertical shaft
and<00:02:25.920> using<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> natural<00:02:26.520> loft<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.240> club<00:02:27.270> I

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and using the natural loft on the club I

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.090 
and using the natural loft on the club I
went<00:02:28.260> ahead<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> little<00:02:28.890> bit<00:02:29.010> of

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
went ahead and got a little bit of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.590 
went ahead and got a little bit of
forward<00:02:29.340> shaft<00:02:29.640> length<00:02:29.970> let's<00:02:30.180> say<00:02:30.300> 10

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
forward shaft length let's say 10

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.690 
forward shaft length let's say 10
degrees<00:02:30.960> at<00:02:31.140> forward<00:02:31.380> shaft<00:02:31.590> lean<00:02:31.710> well<00:02:32.550> that

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
degrees at forward shaft lean well that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880 
degrees at forward shaft lean well that
would<00:02:32.820> affect<00:02:33.120> my<00:02:33.270> dynamic<00:02:33.540> loft<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:34.410> my<00:02:34.560> loft

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
would affect my dynamic loft or my loft

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.340 
would affect my dynamic loft or my loft
on<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.190> club<00:02:35.220> at<00:02:35.640> impact<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.810> started<00:02:37.230> out

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
on the club at impact so we started out

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.770 
on the club at impact so we started out
with<00:02:37.440> 56<00:02:38.010> degrees<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:39.180> time<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.540> went<00:02:39.690> ahead

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
with 56 degrees this time I went ahead

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.630 
with 56 degrees this time I went ahead
and<00:02:39.960> got<00:02:40.020> some<00:02:40.230> forward<00:02:40.470> shaft<00:02:40.740> lean<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and got some forward shaft lean and I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.420 
and got some forward shaft lean and I
bumped<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.540> 46<00:02:43.140> degrees<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.220> now

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
bumped that down to 46 degrees so now

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.340 
bumped that down to 46 degrees so now
I'm<00:02:44.610> tightening<00:02:45.060> up<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.420> angle<00:02:45.840> and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
I'm tightening up this angle and

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.810 
I'm tightening up this angle and
remember<00:02:46.710> when<00:02:46.860> we<00:02:46.950> tighten<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.460> angle

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
remember when we tighten this angle

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.090 
remember when we tighten this angle
we're<00:02:47.940> getting<00:02:48.180> more<00:02:48.390> compression<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:50.040> I

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
we're getting more compression and now I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.340 
we're getting more compression and now I
have<00:02:50.340> 46<00:02:51.120> degrees<00:02:51.510> difference<00:02:51.930> between<00:02:52.230> these

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
have 46 degrees difference between these

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.890 
have 46 degrees difference between these
two<00:02:52.530> numbers<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.000> big<00:02:54.180> question<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.600> what

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
two numbers so the big question is what

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.160 
two numbers so the big question is what
do<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.080> want<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.590> golf<00:02:55.800> swing<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.600> as<00:02:57.600> a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
do I want in a golf swing and as a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.340 
do I want in a golf swing and as a
general<00:02:58.740> rule<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.010> thumb<00:02:59.600> what<00:03:00.600> everybody<00:03:01.170> out

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
general rule of thumb what everybody out

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.780 
general rule of thumb what everybody out
there<00:03:01.560> should<00:03:01.710> be<00:03:01.830> trying<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.220> do<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
there should be trying to do is have a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.970 
there should be trying to do is have a
very<00:03:03.060> shallow<00:03:03.420> angle<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.960> attack<00:03:04.050> remember

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
very shallow angle of attack remember

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.290 
very shallow angle of attack remember
we're<00:03:05.130> going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.280> hit<00:03:05.460> down<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.730> every<00:03:06.120> single

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
we're going to hit down on every single

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.090 
we're going to hit down on every single
golf<00:03:06.630> ball<00:03:06.870> but<00:03:07.020> only<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> very<00:03:07.440> small<00:03:07.950> amount

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.190 
on the club I'm gonna get more spin
that's<00:04:02.100> why<00:04:02.340> we<00:04:02.550> spin<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.910> lob<00:04:03.330> wedge<00:04:03.600> more<00:04:03.990> than

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
that's why we spin a lob wedge more than

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.620 
that's why we spin a lob wedge more than
we<00:04:04.290> would<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.770> driver<00:04:05.400> driver<00:04:05.910> spins<00:04:06.209> much<00:04:06.420> less

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
we would a driver driver spins much less

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.870 
we would a driver driver spins much less
than<00:04:06.750> lob<00:04:06.930> wedge<00:04:07.140> but<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.040> only<00:04:08.160> happens<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.850> a

than lob wedge but it only happens to a
certain<00:04:09.270> extent<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.350> for<00:04:10.830> example<00:04:11.220> again

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430

decreasing<00:04:47.070> spin<00:04:47.430> so<00:04:48.060> there's<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.270> threshold

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
decreasing spin so there's a threshold

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.890 
decreasing spin so there's a threshold
there<00:04:49.080> which<00:04:49.260> is<00:04:49.410> maximum<00:04:49.950> friction<00:04:50.460> and

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
there which is maximum friction and

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.390 
there which is maximum friction and
again<00:04:51.900> that's<00:04:52.080> usually<00:04:52.620> around<00:04:52.950> with<00:04:53.250> your

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
again that's usually around with your

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.700 
again that's usually around with your
wedges<00:04:53.670> still<00:04:54.630> having<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:54.990> forward<00:04:55.350> forward

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
wedges still having a forward forward

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.220 
wedges still having a forward forward
angle<00:04:55.920> of<00:04:56.340> forward<00:04:57.180> angle<00:04:57.420> of<00:04:57.480> shaft<00:04:57.750> lane<00:04:58.020> at

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
angle of forward angle of shaft lane at

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.050 
angle of forward angle of shaft lane at
impact<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:58.920> actually<00:04:59.040> want<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.400> deal<00:04:59.880> off

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
impact so you actually want to deal off

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.810 
impact so you actually want to deal off
that<00:05:00.240> Club<00:05:00.480> not<00:05:00.720> only<00:05:00.990> for<00:05:01.340> compression<00:05:02.340> but

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
that Club not only for compression but

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.880 
that Club not only for compression but
also<00:05:03.000> for<00:05:03.390> spin<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:03.990> if<00:05:04.110> I'm<00:05:04.260> flipping<00:05:04.560> this

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
also for spin so if I'm flipping this

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.400 
also for spin so if I'm flipping this
club<00:05:05.190> as<00:05:05.790> I'm<00:05:06.000> coming<00:05:06.180> into<00:05:06.390> impact<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.050> I

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
club as I'm coming into impact and I

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.290 
club as I'm coming into impact and I
don't<00:05:07.650> have<00:05:07.800> forward<00:05:08.160> shaft<00:05:08.370> lean<00:05:08.520> I'm

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
don't have forward shaft lean I'm

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.880 
don't have forward shaft lean I'm
actually<00:05:09.510> not<00:05:09.780> gonna<00:05:09.870> have<00:05:10.050> maximum<00:05:10.500> friction

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
actually not gonna have maximum friction

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.760 
actually not gonna have maximum friction
and<00:05:11.130> I'm<00:05:11.490> gonna<00:05:11.640> lose<00:05:11.880> spin<00:05:12.210> also<00:05:12.450> so<00:05:13.230> both<00:05:13.500> for

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
and I'm gonna lose spin also so both for

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.430 
and I'm gonna lose spin also so both for
compression<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.610> spin<00:05:15.510> we<00:05:16.050> want<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.350> be

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
compression and spin we want to be

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.170 
compression and spin we want to be
getting<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.800> little<00:05:16.950> bit<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.370> Ford<00:05:17.610> shaft<00:05:17.910> lean

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
getting a little bit of Ford shaft lean

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.930 
getting a little bit of Ford shaft lean
at<00:05:18.450> impact<00:05:19.230> it's<00:05:19.860> gonna<00:05:19.950> help<00:05:20.220> us<00:05:20.370> for<00:05:20.640> for

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
at impact it's gonna help us for for

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.150 
at impact it's gonna help us for for
both<00:05:21.120> scenarios<00:05:21.510> so<00:05:22.500> good<00:05:22.800> luck<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:23.040> you<00:05:23.130> guys

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
good luck with your compression and your

exactly where club head speed comes from
in<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.620> golf<00:06:15.830> swing<00:06:16.040> there<00:06:16.730> are<00:06:17.060> many<00:06:17.420> little

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750

to<00:06:28.910> come<00:06:29.120> from<00:06:29.270> these<00:06:29.480> four<00:06:29.870> pieces<00:06:30.140> and<00:06:30.530> I've

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
to come from these four pieces and I've

to come from these four pieces and I've
tested<00:06:31.790> these<00:06:31.880> out<00:06:32.090> before<00:06:32.420> so<00:06:32.660> first<00:06:33.380> let's

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
tested these out before so first let's

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.980 
tested these out before so first let's
talk<00:06:33.650> about<00:06:33.710> torso<00:06:34.430> rotation<00:06:34.820> now<00:06:35.480> torso

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
talk about torso rotation now torso

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.350 
talk about torso rotation now torso
rotation<00:06:36.380> is<00:06:36.680> both<00:06:36.860> your<00:06:37.100> hips<00:06:37.370> and<00:06:37.640> your

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
rotation is both your hips and your

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.960 
rotation is both your hips and your
shoulders<00:06:38.390> and<00:06:39.140> and<00:06:39.290> more<00:06:39.680> particularly<00:06:40.310> I

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
shoulders and and more particularly I

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.270 
shoulders and and more particularly I
want<00:06:41.450> to<00:06:41.540> separate<00:06:42.080> my<00:06:42.530> hips<00:06:42.740> and<00:06:42.920> shoulders

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
want to separate my hips and shoulders

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.040 
want to separate my hips and shoulders
in<00:06:43.370> the<00:06:43.460> backswing<00:06:43.850> so<00:06:44.360> that<00:06:44.450> I<00:06:44.480> can<00:06:44.690> load

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
in the backswing so that I can load

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.480 
in the backswing so that I can load
these<00:06:45.320> muscles<00:06:45.740> in<00:06:45.860> a<00:06:45.920> position<00:06:46.160> to<00:06:46.340> where

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
these muscles in a position to where

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.630 
these muscles in a position to where
they<00:06:46.580> can<00:06:46.730> fire<00:06:47.000> so<00:06:47.780> this<00:06:47.990> would<00:06:48.170> be<00:06:48.350> me

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
they can fire so this would be me

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.550 
they can fire so this would be me
rotating<00:06:49.640> just<00:06:50.510> my<00:06:50.720> hips<00:06:50.990> and<00:06:51.140> shoulders

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
rotating just my hips and shoulders

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.200 
rotating just my hips and shoulders
together<00:06:51.740> this<00:06:52.310> is<00:06:52.520> no<00:06:52.700> separation

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
together this is no separation

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.580 
together this is no separation
whatsoever<00:06:53.840> I'm<00:06:53.960> not<00:06:54.050> going<00:06:54.170> to<00:06:54.230> get<00:06:54.320> a<00:06:54.350> lot<00:06:54.500> of

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
whatsoever I'm not going to get a lot of

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.500 
whatsoever I'm not going to get a lot of
power<00:06:54.740> from<00:06:54.950> this<00:06:55.190> a<00:06:55.400> lot<00:06:55.910> of<00:06:56.000> short<00:06:56.240> hitters

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
power from this a lot of short hitters

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.030 
power from this a lot of short hitters
will<00:06:56.690> tend<00:06:57.170> to<00:06:57.320> turn<00:06:57.470> everything<00:06:57.770> back

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
will tend to turn everything back

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.290 
will tend to turn everything back
together<00:06:58.220> you<00:06:58.520> can<00:06:58.640> see<00:06:58.730> my<00:06:58.850> hips<00:06:59.000> and<00:06:59.240> my

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
together you can see my hips and my

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.330 
together you can see my hips and my
shoulders<00:06:59.350> there's<00:07:00.350> a<00:07:00.410> rotating<00:07:00.890> back<00:07:01.010> as<00:07:01.160> one

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
shoulders there's a rotating back as one

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.610 
shoulders there's a rotating back as one
unit<00:07:01.670> and<00:07:01.760> rotating<00:07:02.660> through<00:07:02.840> is<00:07:02.960> one<00:07:03.350> unit

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
unit and rotating through is one unit

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.740 
unit and rotating through is one unit
that's<00:07:03.950> not<00:07:04.340> what<00:07:04.520> we're<00:07:04.700> looking<00:07:04.730> for<00:07:05.180> we're

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
that's not what we're looking for we're

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.330 
that's not what we're looking for we're
looking<00:07:05.780> for<00:07:06.050> some<00:07:06.320> great<00:07:06.500> separation

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
looking for some great separation

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.160 
looking for some great separation
between<00:07:07.490> this<00:07:07.820> so<00:07:08.450> the<00:07:08.600> key<00:07:08.780> to<00:07:08.960> this<00:07:08.990> is

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
between this so the key to this is

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.840 
between this so the key to this is
making<00:07:09.560> sure<00:07:09.680> that<00:07:09.920> you<00:07:10.070> limit<00:07:10.370> your<00:07:10.640> hip

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
making sure that you limit your hip

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.300 
making sure that you limit your hip
rotation<00:07:11.360> in<00:07:11.480> the<00:07:11.570> backswing<00:07:12.020> and<00:07:12.320> really

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
rotation in the backswing and really

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.340 
rotation in the backswing and really
load<00:07:13.520> up<00:07:13.550> those<00:07:13.880> shoulders<00:07:14.390> so<00:07:14.930> here's<00:07:15.169> my

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350 
load up those shoulders so here's my

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.080 
load up those shoulders so here's my
shoulders<00:07:15.950> if<00:07:16.460> I<00:07:16.610> limit<00:07:17.060> my<00:07:17.210> hip<00:07:17.450> rotation
