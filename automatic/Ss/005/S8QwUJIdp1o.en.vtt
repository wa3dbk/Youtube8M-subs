00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
because it might run for like a month

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.930 
because it might run for like a month
and<00:04:45.470> then<00:04:45.560> they<00:04:46.100> might<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.490> break<00:04:46.670> down<00:04:46.730> a

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
and then they might just break down a

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.510 
and then they might just break down a
month<00:04:47.270> later<00:04:47.650> but<00:04:48.650> I'm<00:04:48.740> not<00:04:48.920> actually<00:04:49.100> sure<00:04:49.310> I

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
month later but I'm not actually sure I

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.670 
month later but I'm not actually sure I
don't<00:04:49.820> really<00:04:50.000> own<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.510> local<00:04:50.840> device<00:04:51.230> they

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
just something that I'm not really

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.800 
just something that I'm not really
interested<00:04:54.830> in<00:04:55.070> but<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.820> seems<00:04:56.120> very<00:04:56.360> cheap
