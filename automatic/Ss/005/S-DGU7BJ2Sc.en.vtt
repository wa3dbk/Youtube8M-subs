00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
i have now have seen the random

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.049 
i have now have seen the random
attachment<00:00:57.660> series<00:00:57.989> i've<00:00:58.199> started<00:00:58.829> um<00:00:59.129> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
attachment series i've started um I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.680 
attachment series i've started um I
figured<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.940> hard<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.570> get

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
figured out that it's really hard to get

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.859 
figured out that it's really hard to get
videos<00:01:04.700> with<00:01:05.700> certain<00:01:06.000> guns<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.570> certain

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
videos with certain guns in certain

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.359 
videos with certain guns in certain
attachments<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> infrared<00:01:08.100> scope

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
attachments on like the infrared scope

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
attachments on like the infrared scope
it's<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.150> hard<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:09.720> are<00:01:09.960> certain

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it's really hard on these are certain

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
it's really hard on these are certain
guns<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.490> high<00:01:11.820> kick<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> them

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
guns that have really high kick to them

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.200 
guns that have really high kick to them
because<00:01:13.200> obviously<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.369> scope<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.030> easy

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
because obviously the scope is not easy

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
because obviously the scope is not easy
to<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.420> min<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> guys<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:16.950> i<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to a min and if you guys think i have a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
to a min and if you guys think i have a
mod<00:01:17.520> i<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:18.299> dont<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.500> really

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
mod i really dont on it just really

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.580 
mod i really dont on it just really
looks<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.880> speeds<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.630> i<00:01:21.930> don't<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
looks it speeds up the i don't know it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.570 
looks it speeds up the i don't know it
just<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:23.040> makes<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> recoilless<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
just it makes a recoilless on the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
just it makes a recoilless on the
theater<00:01:26.580> mode<00:01:26.700> i<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.750> um<00:01:28.020> slain<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
guys know I don't have a mod but also

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
guys know I don't have a mod but also
the<00:01:31.560> random<00:01:31.799> attachments<00:01:32.189> thing<00:01:32.340> I've<00:01:33.210> tried

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the random attachments thing I've tried

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
the random attachments thing I've tried
out<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> few<00:01:33.840> other<00:01:34.020> guns<00:01:34.290> besides<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> infield

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
out a few other guns besides the infield

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.010 
out a few other guns besides the infield
because<00:01:35.939> enfield<00:01:36.329> was<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.780> quite<00:01:36.900> easy

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
because enfield was actually quite easy

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
because enfield was actually quite easy
to<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> game<00:01:37.650> play<00:01:37.829> with<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.400> only<00:01:38.520> took<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to get a game play with it only took a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.550 
to get a game play with it only took a
couple<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.270> 11<00:01:40.020> game<00:01:40.200> maybe<00:01:40.380> two<00:01:41.280> maybe<00:01:41.520> um

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
couple like 11 game maybe two maybe um

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.350 
couple like 11 game maybe two maybe um
but<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.189> guess<00:01:44.369> kick<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.180> easy

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
but that's because I guess kick was easy

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940 
but that's because I guess kick was easy
to<00:01:45.509> control<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.560> were<00:01:46.680> zooming<00:01:46.829> down

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to control when you were zooming down

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.249 
to control when you were zooming down

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the infrared scope and I've used the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.469 
the infrared scope and I've used the
stoner<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.920> infrared<00:01:50.250> scope<00:01:50.490> oh<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.909> god<00:01:51.240> let

bitch<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.810> easy<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> control<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
bitch and it's not easy to control and

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
bitch and it's not easy to control and
it's<00:01:55.740> also<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.729> easy<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> game<00:01:57.420> play

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it's also not easy to get a game play

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.639 
it's also not easy to get a game play
with<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> um<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> that's<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.020> also<00:02:01.469> a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
with it um so that's that and also a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.870 
with it um so that's that and also a
couple<00:02:01.829> other<00:02:02.040> guns<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> I've<00:02:02.549> tried<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.790> get

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
couple other guns that I've tried to get

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
couple other guns that I've tried to get
a<00:02:02.909> game<00:02:03.180> play<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.649> some<00:02:04.649> weird-ass

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
a game play with some weird-ass

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.130 
a game play with some weird-ass
attachments<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.939> might<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.960> starting

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
attachments on them I might be starting

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.249 
attachments on them I might be starting
to<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.710> cog<00:02:07.950> scopes<00:02:08.280> instead<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:09.259> infrared

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to use a cog scopes instead of infrared

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
to use a cog scopes instead of infrared
because<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> sounds<00:02:11.760> are<00:02:11.849> an<00:02:11.970> infrared

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
because with the sounds are an infrared

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.410 
because with the sounds are an infrared
it's<00:02:12.720> hard

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
it's hard

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.150 
it's hard
shit<00:02:13.599> because<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.290> suppressor<00:02:14.770> takes<00:02:15.010> off

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
shit because the suppressor takes off

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.670 
shit because the suppressor takes off
range<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.330> infrared<00:02:16.720> scope<00:02:16.990> is<00:02:17.260> for

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
range and the infrared scope is for

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.470 
range and the infrared scope is for
range<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.610> when<00:02:18.849> you're<00:02:18.970> shooting<00:02:19.060> someone

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
range so when you're shooting someone

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.530 
range so when you're shooting someone
from<00:02:19.630> long<00:02:19.900> distance<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.860> kick<00:02:21.069> and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
from long distance and the kick and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.630 
from long distance and the kick and
mining<00:02:22.540> damage<00:02:23.260> from<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.530> range<00:02:23.830> because<00:02:24.489> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
mining damage from the range because the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
mining damage from the range because the
suppressor<00:02:25.030> there's<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.360> show<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> lot<00:02:25.630> of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
suppressor there's a show a lot of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.940 
suppressor there's a show a lot of
things<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:25.989> is<00:02:26.440> uh<00:02:27.480> weakening<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.840> gun<00:02:29.050> and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
things that is uh weakening the gun and

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.620 
things that is uh weakening the gun and
making<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.459> harder<00:02:30.819> but<00:02:31.120> that's<00:02:31.270> why<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.420> kind

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
making it harder but that's why I kind

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.410 
making it harder but that's why I kind
of<00:02:31.690> liked<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.989> because<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.489> gives<00:02:33.489> me<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> pretty

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
of liked it because it gives me a pretty

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.400 
of liked it because it gives me a pretty
pretty<00:02:35.020> pretty<00:02:35.620> um<00:02:36.150> what's<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.300> challenge<00:02:37.900> so

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
i joined and i do pretty well using a

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.710 
i joined and i do pretty well using a
semi-automatic<00:03:21.489> on<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:21.970> map<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.180> not<00:03:22.510> easy

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
semi-automatic on this map is not easy

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.170 
semi-automatic on this map is not easy
but<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.530> pull<00:03:23.799> it<00:03:23.950> off<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.670> was<00:03:24.820> very<00:03:24.880> proud

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
but I pull it off and I was very proud

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.590 
but I pull it off and I was very proud
of<00:03:25.269> myself<00:03:25.420> um<00:03:27.840> yeah<00:03:29.640> but<00:03:30.640> this<00:03:30.730> gun<00:03:30.940> it's

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
of myself um yeah but this gun it's

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.690 
of myself um yeah but this gun it's
really<00:03:32.019> powerful<00:03:32.500> once<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.220> put<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.400> grip<00:03:33.579> on

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
really powerful once you put the grip on

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.060 
really powerful once you put the grip on
it<00:03:33.760> as<00:03:34.030> really<00:03:34.359> no<00:03:34.540> kick<00:03:34.810> we're<00:03:35.470> not<00:03:35.650> too<00:03:35.859> much

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
it as really no kick we're not too much

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.360 
it as really no kick we're not too much
it's<00:03:36.370> easy<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.730> control<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:38.160> want<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.220> try<00:03:39.310> to

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
it's easy to control I want to try to

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.190 
it's easy to control I want to try to
get<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.549> gameplay<00:03:39.910> up<00:03:40.060> with<00:03:40.239> this<00:03:40.450> with<00:03:41.109> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
get a gameplay up with this with the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.930 
get a gameplay up with this with the
infrared<00:03:41.500> scope<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:42.340> think<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.820> would<00:03:42.880> be

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
infrared scope I think that would be

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.970 
infrared scope I think that would be
pretty<00:03:43.090> fun<00:03:43.390> just<00:03:43.989> put<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.170> grip<00:03:44.380> attachment<00:03:44.890> on

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
pretty fun just put a grip attachment on
