00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.410
 and come and join us to see the ctc and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.260
 that protects us what things we should 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.450
 avoid what things we should try to eat 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.670
 to avoid this truth that every time 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.260
 we see that it is more common I do not know why 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.720
 yes yes good and also as precisely 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.460
 for the life that we carry right now 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.960
 so much pollutant not why that's right now 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.850
 very important this afternoon and we do 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 we can for organic things because 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.960
 there's too much that will demand too much 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 tionality toxic conservation upward 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 with the idea of trying to make 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 food are they look for brand so that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.370
 have better color and that you crave more 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.469
 for what is the commercial river in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.480
 reality is being used too much 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.460
 development hormone in is more common than 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 now I say more cancer cases are seen 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.289
 what we do and of course clear desire is very 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.700
 contaminated definitely and that's why 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.140
 very important especially in cancer 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.000
 woman is very important that we 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 we have to avoid at least everything 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.629
 that are products are actually that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.789
 come from animals like the cow or from 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.050
 Dairy products bring many hormones 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.090
 are hormone-dependent then 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.370
 we can start to change to consume 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.110
 soy products since it has what it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 it's called phytoestrogens, which is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.640
 natural 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.660
 and is and is a substance that helps 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.730
 prevent cancer 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.230
 we can be inside our 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.510
 feeding start consuming what 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.090
 is soy that can be the same in the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.220
 milk in yogurts in cheeses and in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.320
 the soybean in the bean 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 soybean also even from this meat of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.310
 soy mean there are different now 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.010
 add a question for example say no 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.500
 the family already has a history of cancer 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.660
 and I say mostly breast cancer that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.120
 It is very feasible that if your your 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.380
 ancestors have is likely to you 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.450
 give you as a woman 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.310
 if there are ways then to improve 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.380
 our power to avoid 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.820
 odds that you will receive us already 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.320
 It is usually considered that if there is 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.479
 50 percent predisposition 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.960
 genetic there is no if you see it not between potatoes 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.740
 granny to mom and the daughter then 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.940
 precisely in the food is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.410
 based most diseases 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.210
 you have to start consuming fruits and 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.860
 the vegetables that are who else have 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.300
 the main antioxidants that we 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.500
 help free radicals 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.150
 that are the ones that go there our 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.190
 cells with what and what foods have 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.780
 more adversity you have to choose everything 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.429
 whatever color of account 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.840
 mainly everything that is red all 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.590
 what will be included fruits or see 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.680
 so 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.140
 citrus mandarin orange papaya the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.310
 strawberries already have substances and something very 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.450
 at least the grape to the water is very 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.760
 important because it also has 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.050
 specific substances that are the crazy 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.060
 you have to help you precisely 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.550
 prevent at least the grapes from falling 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.840
 the purple grape with me may be no 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.519
 matter can be whatever is the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.140

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.230
 cancer that is colon cancer 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.959
 everything is fiber and very 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.330
 important to add it then to treat 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.579
 of our food always remains 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.099
