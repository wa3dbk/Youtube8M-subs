00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
just took a breath and you know try to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.280 
just took a breath and you know try to
latch<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> back<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.690> actually<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.199> know

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
latch on the back and actually you know

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.980 
latch on the back and actually you know
started<00:01:04.619> making<00:01:04.860> some<00:01:04.949> time<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.400> Ryan<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.990> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
started making some time on Ryan so it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.020 
started making some time on Ryan so it
was<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> good<00:01:07.260> hot<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> second<00:01:08.580> towards<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
was a good hot for a second towards the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
was a good hot for a second towards the
end<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> actually

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
end there and you know I actually

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.560 
end there and you know I actually
learned<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.310> bit<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> went

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
learned a little bit so what I went

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
learned a little bit so what I went
through<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:14.100> whole<00:01:14.340> selection<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
through I think the whole selection that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
through I think the whole selection that
Dunlop<00:01:15.360> has<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.720> offer<00:01:15.869> us<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.430> we<00:01:17.430> basically

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
Dunlop has to offer us and we basically

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.719 
Dunlop has to offer us and we basically
went<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.470> knew<00:01:19.619> best<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.159> we

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
went back to to what we knew best so we

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.660 
went back to to what we knew best so we
were<00:01:20.850> searching<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.330> day<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.950> come<00:01:22.950> main

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
were searching all day and come main

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
were searching all day and come main
event<00:01:23.909> time<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.390> where<00:01:24.570> typically<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> little

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
event time and where typically a little

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.289 
event time and where typically a little
stronger<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> today<00:01:27.060> was

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
stronger there and and today was

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
stronger there and and today was
consistent<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> let<00:01:28.740> me<00:01:28.770> ask<00:01:28.920> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
consistent with that let me ask this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
consistent with that let me ask this
Chad<00:01:29.400> when<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.729> leading<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.630> come

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
Chad when you're leading it and you come

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.450 
Chad when you're leading it and you come
over<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.140> double<00:01:31.500> jump<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.310> back

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
over that double jump and you get back

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.679 
over that double jump and you get back
onto<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> start<00:01:33.060> line<00:01:33.210> straight<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
onto the start line straight here a

the<00:01:57.149> heat<00:01:57.299> race<00:01:57.479> where<00:01:57.750> him<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:57.990> him<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.530> Ryan

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the heat race where him and him and Ryan

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.039 
the heat race where him and him and Ryan

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
went at it and they were both fast it

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.709 
went at it and they were both fast it
seem<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.590> Ryan<00:02:01.920> had<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.460> edge<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:03.450> bit

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
seem like Ryan had the edge a little bit

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.620
