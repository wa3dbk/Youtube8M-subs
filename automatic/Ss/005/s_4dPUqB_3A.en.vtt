00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello and welcome example 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.420
 with me children's toys I introduce you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.410
 resch pack sees the garbage today 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.009
 You can see here are already small 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.960
 parcel monster and it works here 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.699
 Trash grow and here on the back 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 you can really see it there 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:28.019
 Gather many garbage bacilli and see 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.399
 Here is the limited edition 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.660
 super smart homes and so on and me 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.649
 believe here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.649
 that's so 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070
 as I realize it so it could 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.800
 well, this one is only in others 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.320
 suitable for all that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.649
 children from five years and now look 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.670
 we just let it happen 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.000
 garbage cans or whatever that may be 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.000
 should 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.400
 First, we have a small one here 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.830
 it is very soft as a whole soft 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.090
 rubber if it really is in Rome 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.530
 I'm not sure yet 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:32.800
 gives a bacillus monster yellow pink 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.090
 and then there are two more here 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.840
 container there I look now first 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:02:03.009
 Just the first one is just another 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:02:03.009
 if I recognize the company 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.680
 I honestly can not answer them 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.090
 recognize correctly 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.780
 maybe one of them is down here 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.390
 this funky fifa x-ray but I'm mine 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.120
 really not sure 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.470
 I put him first and I'll get 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.470
 the next ones out 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.490
 so light blue slightly transparent and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.180
 somehow inside the inside is what 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:54.250
 usually he looks a bit 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.490
 also as if being wrapped and or 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.510
 yellow-colored underneath so looks 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.950
 really not nice and otherwise 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.240
 yes, nothing in it and you can do that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.340
 paper go out here 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.940
 then this is a small measuring cup 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.150
 I think with respect there is synonymous 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.150
 it 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.220
 or maybe it is such a thing 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.060
 Test the bacteria in it 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.670
 can collect 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.310
 that's right, it will be like this and here 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.709
 You can top the lid on top 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.840
 but we still have another 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:34.330
 test tube and where I already have that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:42.550
 next little monster I do that 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:47.709
 Also every day from here a little 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.430
 round monster has six antennae 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:04:00.720
 somehow and on top of the head 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:00.720
 golden yellow and the best so 5 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.480
 but also disgusting that has such a long time 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.100
 lived to and so squinting eyes and 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.970
 all of which have always down here as a 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.320
 small recess so that you can 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.400
 also somewhere on it so you are stuck 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.300
 can be for example on a 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.300
 stick pencil 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.400
 So another test tube and 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:45.319
 Now I 'll ask you all 54 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:55.770
 Together, these are the five 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:56.960
 bacilli monster so there you can 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.150
 see 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.930
 One is disgusting as the other 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.210
 real monster if you like this video 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.979

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.650

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.389
 monster knows and maybe you know 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.129
 even hot 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.440
 So I just can not do it that way 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:22.370
 properly recognize who it is now here 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.370

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.479

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:37.590

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:40.880

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.880

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:51.919
