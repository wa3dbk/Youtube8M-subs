00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:18.779
 I was created to save the planet 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.779
 what people see looking at the sky 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.480
 hope and and i will take away first 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:40.720
 the world becomes only then 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:42.030
 when people die I wanted to protect the world 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.879
 indestructible armor and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:52.390
 but he made a monster artificial 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:54.190
 intellect he same program altron I 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 tired of watching people pay for our 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.370
 mistakes 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.600
 the new goal is justified to end the war and 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.020
 home 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.020
 screwed up this friend 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.030
 everything depends on us 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.230
 from our resilience and determination to save 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.230
 chalk has nowhere to retreat 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.510
 this is a date with death and and tomorrow 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.510
 free in the evening 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.350
 it is necessary to wipe them petty 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.050
 we'll tear them apart 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.950
 and from the inside 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.120
 more than 1 way 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.409
 you run into
