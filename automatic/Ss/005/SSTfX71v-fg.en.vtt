flag<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.310> hurries<00:00:26.730> at<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.750> point<00:00:28.080> white<00:00:28.590> has

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
flag out hurries at this point white has

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.179 
flag out hurries at this point white has
two<00:00:29.010> choices<00:00:30.380> extending<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.590> white<00:00:31.859> stone

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
two choices extending this white stone

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.240 
two choices extending this white stone
or<00:00:32.520> artery<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:33.690> here<00:00:34.140> let's<00:00:34.590> first<00:00:34.920> look<00:00:35.100> at

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
or artery from here let's first look at

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.779 
or artery from here let's first look at
this<00:00:35.690> black<00:00:36.690> captures<00:00:39.469> and<00:00:40.820> white<00:00:42.469> connects

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
this black captures and white connects

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.380 
this black captures and white connects
notice<00:00:45.110> why<00:00:46.110> shouldn't<00:00:47.090> connect<00:00:48.090> here

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
notice why shouldn't connect here

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.670 
notice why shouldn't connect here
otherwise<00:00:48.899> black<00:00:49.469> cuts<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.660> hard<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.079> Y

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
otherwise black cuts and it's hard for Y

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.750 
otherwise black cuts and it's hard for Y
to<00:00:52.739> keep<00:00:53.300> both<00:00:54.300> groups<00:00:54.750> alive<00:00:56.660> why<00:00:57.660> does<00:00:57.899> this

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
to keep both groups alive why does this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.060 
to keep both groups alive why does this
then<00:00:59.760> black<00:00:59.940> captures<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.469> that's<00:01:01.800> not

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
then black captures this so that's not

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.440 
then black captures this so that's not
good

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.429 

the<00:01:06.990> black<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:07.590> white<00:01:08.070> connects<00:01:08.490> black

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
the black and white connects black

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.050 
the black and white connects black
Ataris<00:01:11.240> captures<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.600> white<00:01:13.380> Ataris<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
Ataris captures and white Ataris so to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.100 
Ataris captures and white Ataris so to
choose<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.930> joseki<00:01:16.759> white<00:01:17.759> must<00:01:18.180> ensure<00:01:18.750> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
choose this joseki white must ensure it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.889 
choose this joseki white must ensure it
can<00:01:19.350> lather<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.040> black<00:01:20.369> stone<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:21.659> other

words there's no black stones along the
way<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.220> line<00:01:29.869> so

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.749 

second<00:01:34.509> choice<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.579> extend<00:01:36.909> here<00:01:38.759> black

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
second choice is to extend here black

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.940 
second choice is to extend here black
extends<00:01:41.039> why<00:01:42.039> that<00:01:42.280> hurries<00:01:42.840> extends<00:01:43.950> black

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
extends why that hurries extends black

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.120 
extends why that hurries extends black
needs<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.610> capture<00:01:46.450> these<00:01:46.689> two<00:01:47.530> white<00:01:47.770> stones

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
needs to capture these two white stones

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.309 
needs to capture these two white stones
and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:50.110> white<00:01:50.710> makes<00:01:51.039> extension<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.110> a

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
and then white makes extension this is a

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.669 
and then white makes extension this is a
very<00:01:53.829> even<00:01:54.280> joseki<00:01:55.030> white<00:01:55.539> gets<00:01:55.869> beside<00:01:56.380> and

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
very even joseki white gets beside and

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:03.980 
very even joseki white gets beside and
brackets<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.310> corner<00:01:59.729> notice<00:02:01.799> at<00:02:02.799> this<00:02:03.459> point

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
brackets the corner notice at this point

what black extends white extends but at

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.270 
what black extends white extends but at
this<00:02:23.580> point<00:02:24.350> there's<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.440> danger<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.160> the

this point there's a danger in the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.960 
this point there's a danger in the
corner

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
corner

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.630 
corner
if<00:02:27.480> white<00:02:28.520> keeps<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:30.090> extending<00:02:30.720> here<00:02:31.640> black

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
if white keeps just extending here black

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.699 
if white keeps just extending here black
and<00:02:32.940> descend<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:35.120> kills<00:02:36.120> White's<00:02:36.959> corner

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709

and descend and kills White's corner
white<00:02:38.550> plays<00:02:38.850> here<00:02:38.880> black<00:02:39.709> plays<00:02:40.709> here<00:02:40.739> white

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
white plays here black plays here white

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:50.589 
white plays here black plays here white
cannot<00:02:41.850> block<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.860> corner<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.310> dead

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:57.190 

if<00:02:51.079> it<00:02:51.260> plays<00:02:51.530> here<00:02:51.890> it's<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.189> same<00:02:52.519> result

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.550 

so<00:02:57.770> why<00:02:58.069> sneeze<00:02:58.459> why<00:02:59.450> needs<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.900> be<00:03:00.050> careful

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
so why sneeze why needs to be careful

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.130 
so why sneeze why needs to be careful
here<00:03:02.319> so<00:03:03.319> at<00:03:03.410> this<00:03:03.530> point<00:03:03.830> white<00:03:04.340> cannot<00:03:05.140> keep

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
here so at this point white cannot keep

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.870 
here so at this point white cannot keep
extending<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:08.390> should<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:09.430> capture<00:03:10.430> this

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
extending you should just capture this

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.790 
extending you should just capture this
black<00:03:11.150> stone<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.690> ensure<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.349> corner<00:03:12.709> is

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
black stone to ensure the corner is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.850 
black stone to ensure the corner is
alive<00:03:13.130> then<00:03:14.120> black<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.420> turn<00:03:15.020> and<00:03:17.860> target

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
alive then black and turn and target

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.750 
alive then black and turn and target
these<00:03:19.160> four<00:03:19.610> white<00:03:20.030> stones<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.580> this<00:03:22.580> is

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
these four white stones so this is

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.270 
these four white stones so this is
enough<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.360> say<00:03:23.569> key<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:24.980> want<00:03:25.190> to

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
enough that you say key and just want to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.270 
enough that you say key and just want to
point<00:03:25.489> out<00:03:26.140> there's<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.200> trick<00:03:27.590> here<00:03:27.980> in<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
point out there's a trick here in the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.800 
point out there's a trick here in the
corner<00:03:29.800> Thanks
