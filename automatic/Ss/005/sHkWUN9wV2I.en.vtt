good in this take um very good card so

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.140 
good in this take um very good card so
yeah<00:02:55.060> there's<00:02:56.060> gonna<00:02:56.150> be<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.330> quick<00:02:56.540> profile

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
yeah there's gonna be a quick profile

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.030 
yeah there's gonna be a quick profile
good<00:02:59.150> depth<00:02:59.480> profile<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.080> long<00:03:00.260> three<00:03:00.709> fingers

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
good depth profile so long three fingers

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.530 
good depth profile so long three fingers
change<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.430> realized<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:01.910> card<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.300> just

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
change I realized this card is just

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.540 
change I realized this card is just
amazing<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.320> really<00:03:03.980> works<00:03:04.190> getting<00:03:04.459> this

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
amazing it really works getting this

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.310 
amazing it really works getting this
deck<00:03:04.760> better<00:03:04.940> than<00:03:05.090> breakthrough<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.810> like

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
deck better than breakthrough and like

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.580 
deck better than breakthrough and like
ten<00:03:06.560> more<00:03:06.740> times<00:03:06.980> because<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:08.180> all

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
ten more times because that's all

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.510 
ten more times because that's all
because<00:03:09.590> you're<00:03:09.709> trying<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.950> protect<00:03:10.220> our

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
because you're trying to protect our

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.890 
because you're trying to protect our
client<00:03:10.970> at<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.090> same<00:03:11.300> time<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.600> negates

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
client at the same time it negates

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.620 
client at the same time it negates
effect<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:12.680> it's<00:03:12.830> amazing<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.520> mirror<00:03:14.239> force

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
effect so it's amazing to mirror force

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.620 
effect so it's amazing to mirror force
ah<00:03:14.870> it's<00:03:15.770> like<00:03:15.920> vanishes<00:03:16.760> with<00:03:16.940> dark<00:03:17.150> locks<00:03:17.390> or

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
ah it's like vanishes with dark locks or

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.710 
ah it's like vanishes with dark locks or

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
don't think I ever needed it three

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.270 
don't think I ever needed it three
actually<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:02.900> said<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.739> would<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.130> play

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
actually I said I would like to play

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.350 
actually I said I would like to play
that<00:04:04.459> too<00:04:04.700> but<00:04:05.950> like<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.190> don't<00:04:07.250> go<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.730> go<00:04:08.120> into

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
that too but like I don't go to go into

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.840 
that too but like I don't go to go into
it<00:04:08.450> as<00:04:08.600> much<00:04:08.900> for<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.769> go<00:04:09.890> onto<00:04:10.040> my<00:04:10.370> side<00:04:10.700> in

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
it as much for it to go onto my side in

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.300 
it as much for it to go onto my side in
depth<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.239> another<00:04:11.420> one<00:04:11.630> actually<00:04:11.810> because

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
depth and another one actually because

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.849 
depth and another one actually because
it's<00:04:13.310> heavy<00:04:13.489> backboard<00:04:13.970> X<00:04:14.150> would<00:04:14.330> be<00:04:14.360> good

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
it's heavy backboard X would be good

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.520 
it's heavy backboard X would be good
Koga<00:04:15.859> and<00:04:16.100> we<00:04:16.820> run<00:04:16.940> three<00:04:17.230> bubbleman<00:04:18.230> so

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
Koga and we run three bubbleman so

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.160 
Koga and we run three bubbleman so
that's<00:04:19.250> like<00:04:19.400> an<00:04:19.549> extra<00:04:19.639> reason<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.120> run<00:04:20.299> to

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
that's like an extra reason to run to

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.980 
that's like an extra reason to run to
one<00:04:22.170> clover<00:04:22.590> or<00:04:22.770> one<00:04:23.100> over<00:04:23.250> message<00:04:23.670> from

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
one clover or one over message from

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.800 
one clover or one over message from
polarization<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.310> from<00:04:26.310> miracle<00:04:27.240> fusion

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
polarization and from miracle fusion

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.590 
polarization and from miracle fusion
same<00:04:28.290> thing<00:04:28.470> above<00:04:28.890> absolute<00:04:29.460> zero<00:04:30.030> Campos

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
same thing above absolute zero Campos

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.560 
same thing above absolute zero Campos
amazing<00:04:31.140> what<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:32.120> acid<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.270> that's<00:04:33.420> really

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
amazing what the acid so that's really

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.010 
amazing what the acid so that's really
good

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.830 

now<00:04:37.020> for<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.290> oxys<00:04:38.240> we're<00:04:39.240> on<00:04:39.390> I<00:04:39.480> think<00:04:39.540> that's

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
now for the oxys we're on I think that's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.590 
now for the oxys we're on I think that's
seven<00:04:40.260> fusions<00:04:40.710> I'm<00:04:41.190> not<00:04:42.260> life<00:04:43.260> I'm<00:04:43.500> correct

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
seven fusions I'm not life I'm correct

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.430 
seven fusions I'm not life I'm correct
one<00:04:45.620> excalibur<00:04:46.650> blade<00:04:46.980> armor<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.960> number<00:04:48.960> 86

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
one excalibur blade armor and number 86

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.580 
one excalibur blade armor and number 86
um<00:04:49.910> I'm<00:04:50.910> thinking<00:04:50.970> of<00:04:51.390> taking<00:04:51.630> out<00:04:51.930> Lance<00:04:52.200> for

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
um I'm thinking of taking out Lance for

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.740 
um I'm thinking of taking out Lance for
the<00:04:52.740> sole<00:04:53.190> charge<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.670> I<00:04:53.700> could<00:04:54.000> but<00:04:54.480> once<00:04:54.630> you

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
the sole charge so I could but once you

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.090 
the sole charge so I could but once you
someone<00:04:55.020> this<00:04:55.140> guy<00:04:55.290> up<00:04:55.440> with<00:04:55.590> five<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:55.980> three

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
someone this guy up with five and three

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.770 
someone this guy up with five and three
or<00:04:56.160> five<00:04:56.520> or<00:04:56.670> four<00:04:56.850> materials<00:04:57.420> you're

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
or five or four materials you're

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.750 
or five or four materials you're
probably<00:04:57.930> gonna<00:04:58.140> win<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.410> game<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:59.550> he's

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
probably gonna win the game so he's

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.760 
probably gonna win the game so he's
really<00:05:00.060> broken<00:05:00.480> that's<00:05:00.750> number<00:05:00.990> 86<00:05:01.470> if<00:05:01.650> you

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
really broken that's number 86 if you

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.260 
really broken that's number 86 if you
don't<00:05:01.920> know<00:05:01.980> what<00:05:02.100> he<00:05:02.160> does<00:05:02.310> on<00:05:02.520> it's<00:05:02.970> just

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
don't know what he does on it's just

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.540 
don't know what he does on it's just
like<00:05:03.420> it's<00:05:03.780> it's<00:05:04.590> impossible<00:05:04.830> get<00:05:05.280> over

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550
