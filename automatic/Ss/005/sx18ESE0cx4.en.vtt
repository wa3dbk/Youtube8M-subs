 my mother I made the wrong map 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.770
 see that where it's worth the most 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.290
 fast so the fuchsia city this is already 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.719
 charm and asked for russia and the island 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.940
 where is the 33 ball you've been here 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.940
 is here so you have to surf 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 good 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 something else I do not know what I told him 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.790
 several of us had sharp ameal and no 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.710
 we had stacked in you I do not 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.510
 agreed or that it had solar ray that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.140
 there was only change per sharp blade but 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.470
 good 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.700
 referred sharp blade to plant 05 attacks 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.700
 and well, let's go there 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.380
 well nothing happens we load 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.380
 right away 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.500
 of can followed by a host 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.579
 nothing happens, a company like that for 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.579
 encourage the environment not 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.400
 presents guilty pity that it does not rain 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.400
 but I do not care 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.870
 we'll see 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.880
 with blows you say what 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:53.149
 maestri who has special things 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.189
 now 70 cloud today we are going to take out and 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.399
 we have not seen him for a long time 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.399
 weather 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.840
 as it happens to be custom has the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.719
 super attack 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.470
 well I teach it for the super attack that 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.620
 has to flip 255 has more and more 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.690
 activity 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.680
 so we give it an earthquake 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.680
 the azzurri do 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.920
 caused with 30 cross earthquake is going to 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.310
 to fall fixed fixed fixed 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.209
 there is 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.200
 and the next one but I think golding yes 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:42.220
 we are not going to change that all 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.540
 Almost all good has left because it comes out 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.580
 and a little 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.050
 with a little fresh air 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.960
 now we prepare the solar ray 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.450
 use waterfall and this makes us go backwards 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.600
 not because you already passed one of the most 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.600
 rapid 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.630
 let's see how much it takes away 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.000
 hits 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.110
 it is art that millennium is not very offensive 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.260
 but 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.810
 the license level is there so good 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.540
 good after this slip 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.630
 coach we thought I could win 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.830
 tense with 15 levels what are we going to 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.160
 get down here 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.820
 the 30 points are always tentacles 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.820
 there is more pokemon 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.080
 I'm not going to raise the level 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.560
 with what will give me a little like 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.710
 but 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.010
 because what they put now in their sight 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.459
 It is not very opportune moment 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.939
 and still eludes let's see let's 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.939
 see what is 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.450
 to level 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:03.740
 I think that neither that nor that good anymore 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:08.420
 supported by another good side on this island 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:11.420
 has been captured 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.099
 or defeated in the other site 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.170
 and what I have to do is follow the 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.820
 this way very linear follow here 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.200
 with the city ​​with the rocks 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.930
 and we are already here in the cavern 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.240
 underwater we will continue here and here 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.830
 will be the guys so let's talk 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.830
 with him is 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.480
 I'm not going to notice much , I lost a little 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.610
 of time with the coach but hey 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.410
 but the goal in the goal is to 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.410
 videos so that that country what is 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.470
 for diaz now and try to capture it 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.830
 or whatever 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.540
 what I'm going to do is 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.780
 uses a master bowl of a data that 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.780
 I have 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.180
 this always works so 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.180
 for patio in our 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.240
 well that was all beautiful prayer I'm going to 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.310
 see what the pokédex puts 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.550
 has a temperament 12 and hates fighting 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.220
 you have corals 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.030
 it's also worth flying faster 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.030
 that an airplane 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.920
 a nice funny 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.510
 where the manger goes with his partner 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.470
 and that's it 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.470
 let's get out of here 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.419
 as I say 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.189
 the legendary ones that remain are grau don 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.029
 tiraxi and the birds defend I do not know 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.029

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:52.700
 people and rayco and an eye like pussy is said 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:55.370
 but by the word 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.790
 and to see who else who else who more or 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.790
 he left me 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.870

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.320

 see if u2 can not be captured and boxes 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.940
 I do not think so, so I'm just missing 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.190

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.960

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.380
 I keep to make sure that I have 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.660

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.780
 and good the world master to the same 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.370
