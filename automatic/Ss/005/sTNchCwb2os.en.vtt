00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
all right this is the test burn on the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.570 
all right this is the test burn on the
new<00:00:05.400> rocket<00:00:05.879> stove<00:00:06.919> my<00:00:07.919> wood<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.370> really

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
new rocket stove my wood is really

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.110 
new rocket stove my wood is really
shitty

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
shitty

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.339 
shitty
it's<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.889> poplar<00:00:11.670> tree<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:12.240> blew<00:00:12.630> down<00:00:12.870> last

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
it's a poplar tree that blew down last

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.769 
it's a poplar tree that blew down last
summer<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.839> cut<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.990> up<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:17.270> didn't<00:00:18.270> split<00:00:18.600> it

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
summer I cut it up and didn't split it

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.830 
summer I cut it up and didn't split it
or<00:00:18.930> anything<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.460> still<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:20.970> 95

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
or anything so it's still about 95

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.849 
or anything so it's still about 95
percent<00:00:22.189> moisture<00:00:24.140> but<00:00:25.140> I'm<00:00:25.260> getting<00:00:25.560> some

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
percent moisture but I'm getting some

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.080 
percent moisture but I'm getting some
decent<00:00:26.460> heat<00:00:26.939> off<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.900> stove<00:00:28.380> even

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
decent heat off of the stove even

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.090 
decent heat off of the stove even
despite<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.359> fact<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:31.279> did<00:00:32.279> take<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> couple

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
despite that fact I did take a couple

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.910 
despite that fact I did take a couple
really<00:00:35.100> twisted<00:00:35.730> two<00:00:35.910> by<00:00:36.059> fours<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.920> split

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
really twisted two by fours and split

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.510 
really twisted two by fours and split
them<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.670> center<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.360> help<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.750> burn<00:00:40.520> but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
them down the center to help it burn but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.709 
them down the center to help it burn but
the<00:00:42.950> little<00:00:43.950> window<00:00:44.399> here

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.430 

Veon<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:49.800> not

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.880 

it's<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> hard<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.190> focus<00:00:56.700> in<00:00:57.059> there

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
it's kind of hard to focus in there

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.150 
it's kind of hard to focus in there
we're<00:00:58.890> getting<00:01:01.220> reflection<00:01:02.220> from<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> glass

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
we're getting reflection from the glass

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.740 
we're getting reflection from the glass
but<00:01:05.160> it's<00:01:05.370> it's<00:01:05.670> kind<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:06.060> neat<00:01:06.270> you're<00:01:06.570> gonna

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
but it's it's kind of neat you're gonna

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.950 
but it's it's kind of neat you're gonna
look<00:01:06.870> in<00:01:07.050> there<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.640> flames<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
look in there and see the flames at the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.490 
look in there and see the flames at the
top<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.740> bend<00:01:11.670> down<00:01:11.850> around<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:16.100> really<00:01:18.500> I've

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
top and bend down around and really I've

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.430 
top and bend down around and really I've
had<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.100> put<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.720> poplar<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.900> top<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
had to put the poplar on top of the

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.480 
had to put the poplar on top of the
stove<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:24.060> dry<00:01:24.300> it<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:24.869> bit<00:01:25.490> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
stove just to dry it out a little bit it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.240 
stove just to dry it out a little bit it
got<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.090> hot<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.380> started<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
got so hot up there that it started to

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.499 
got so hot up there that it started to
burn<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> poplar<00:01:32.750> but<00:01:35.509> obviously

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
burn it's all the poplar but obviously

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:45.100 
burn it's all the poplar but obviously
it<00:01:37.580> were<00:01:39.290> 213<00:01:40.290> degrees<00:01:40.940> on<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.890> top<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
it were 213 degrees on the top of that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.350 
it were 213 degrees on the top of that
the<00:01:46.110> chimney<00:01:47.720> is<00:01:49.340> 98<00:01:50.340> degrees<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.430> don't

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the chimney is 98 degrees so I don't

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
the chimney is 98 degrees so I don't
know<00:01:54.450> why<00:01:54.600> my<00:01:54.840> camera<00:01:55.289> doesn't<00:01:55.680> focus<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
know why my camera doesn't focus like it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.660 
know why my camera doesn't focus like it
should<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:58.470> doesn't<00:01:59.630> but<00:02:00.630> anyways<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.670> test

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
should it doesn't but anyways the test

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.980 
should it doesn't but anyways the test
burden<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.300> rocket<00:02:03.720> stove<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:05.850> took<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
burden on the rocket stove I took the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.390 
burden on the rocket stove I took the
old<00:02:07.080> one<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:09.390> was<00:02:09.920> pretty<00:02:10.920> melted

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
old one out and it was pretty melted

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.140 
old one out and it was pretty melted
inside

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
inside

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.750 
inside
so<00:02:12.900> hopefully<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.530> fire<00:02:13.770> bricks<00:02:14.130> gonna<00:02:14.430> do

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so hopefully this fire bricks gonna do

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.309 
so hopefully this fire bricks gonna do
the<00:02:15.030> trick<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:17.250> fresh<00:02:17.700> air<00:02:18.080> coming<00:02:19.080> in

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
the trick I have fresh air coming in

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.150 
the trick I have fresh air coming in
from<00:02:19.530> outside<00:02:20.840> going<00:02:21.840> into<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.560> bottom<00:02:23.040> of

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
from outside going into the bottom of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.290 
from outside going into the bottom of
the<00:02:23.790> stove<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.040> then<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.580> whole<00:02:26.849> bottom

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the stove and then this whole bottom

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.650 
the stove and then this whole bottom
chamber<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.530> separate<00:02:29.459> from<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.420> burn

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
chamber is separate from the burn

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.010 
chamber is separate from the burn
chamber<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.280> chimney<00:02:33.030> temperature<00:02:36.020> 105

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
chamber so the chimney temperature 105

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.880 
chamber so the chimney temperature 105
our<00:02:37.590> 107<00:02:38.099> degrees<00:02:38.459> down<00:02:39.150> at<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.390> bottom<00:02:39.890> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
our 107 degrees down at the bottom the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.390 
our 107 degrees down at the bottom the
camera<00:02:41.790> itself<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:44.360> 210<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.590> I'm<00:02:46.680> losing<00:02:47.190> quite

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
camera itself is 210 so I'm losing quite

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.670 
camera itself is 210 so I'm losing quite
a<00:02:47.459> bit<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.790> heat<00:02:48.060> I'm<00:02:48.930> losing<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.410> hundred

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
a bit of heat I'm losing a hundred

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.240 
a bit of heat I'm losing a hundred
degrees<00:02:49.800> from<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.239> top<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:52.020> down<00:02:52.410> and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
degrees from the top of the can down and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.710 
degrees from the top of the can down and
that's<00:02:53.580> blowing<00:02:53.910> into<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.360> room

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.690 

the<00:02:58.769> fresh<00:02:59.769> air<00:03:00.989> comes<00:03:01.989> from<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.379> bottom<00:03:05.700> from

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
the fresh air comes from the bottom from

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.839 
the fresh air comes from the bottom from
the<00:03:06.819> bottom<00:03:06.910> here<00:03:07.890> goes<00:03:08.890> oh<00:03:09.069> through<00:03:09.370> here<00:03:09.670> I

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
the bottom here goes oh through here I

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.290 
the bottom here goes oh through here I
can<00:03:10.510> touch<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.260> ashtray<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.220> it's<00:03:12.970> cool

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
can touch the ashtray and it's cool

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.890 
can touch the ashtray and it's cool
because<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:14.019> fresh<00:03:14.260> air<00:03:14.470> coming<00:03:14.799> in<00:03:15.900> getting

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
because the fresh air coming in getting

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.600 
because the fresh air coming in getting
the<00:03:17.019> fuel<00:03:17.200> ashes<00:03:17.739> there<00:03:19.170> but<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.769> think<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
the fuel ashes there but I think the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.130 
the fuel ashes there but I think the
fire<00:03:21.849> brick<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.360> going<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.660> make<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.810> big

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
fire brick is going to make a big

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.699 
fire brick is going to make a big
difference<00:03:24.599> I'm<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:25.660> little<00:03:25.959> concerned<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.590> I

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
difference I'm a little concerned that I

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.180 
difference I'm a little concerned that I
might<00:03:27.010> end<00:03:27.250> up<00:03:27.670> breaking<00:03:27.970> these<00:03:28.420> top<00:03:28.750> ones<00:03:29.190> if

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
might end up breaking these top ones if

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.250 
might end up breaking these top ones if
I<00:03:30.579> do<00:03:30.640> break<00:03:31.150> them<00:03:31.390> I'm<00:03:31.599> going<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.930> cut<00:03:32.079> the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260

I do break them I'm going to cut the
side<00:03:32.560> ones<00:03:32.860> now<00:03:33.299> about<00:03:34.299> another<00:03:34.450> eighth<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.200> an

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
side ones now about another eighth of an

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.000 
side ones now about another eighth of an
inch<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:37.060> I'll<00:03:37.660> put<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> piece<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.230> stainless

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.660 
inch and I'll put a piece of stainless
steel<00:03:39.549> on<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.420> top<00:03:41.069> see<00:03:42.069> if<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.340> does

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
steel on the top see if that does

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.530 
steel on the top see if that does
anything<00:03:43.860> but<00:03:44.860> no<00:03:45.160> I'm<00:03:45.340> quite<00:03:45.910> impressed<00:03:46.090> with
