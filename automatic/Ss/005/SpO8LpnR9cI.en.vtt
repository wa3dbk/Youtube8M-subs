museum<00:00:22.430> construction<00:00:23.430> kit<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.330> actually

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
museum construction kit this actually

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.210 
museum construction kit this actually
sounds<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.699> dnd<00:00:26.699> role-playing<00:00:27.359> toolbox

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
sounds like a dnd role-playing toolbox

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
sounds like a dnd role-playing toolbox
but<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.730> actually<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.119> game<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
but it's not it's actually a game and I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.010 
but it's not it's actually a game and I
think<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.830> game<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.420> this<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.660> another

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
think in this game you this is another

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.260 
think in this game you this is another
one<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.320> those<00:00:34.469> themes<00:00:35.219> or<00:00:35.430> might<00:00:35.610> come<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.059> now

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
one of those themes or might come on now

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
one of those themes or might come on now
but<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> package<00:00:37.680> there<00:00:37.920> was<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> sort

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
but you get a package there was a sort

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.400 
but you get a package there was a sort
of<00:00:38.280> tiny<00:00:38.670> symbols<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.809> made<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> game<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
of tiny symbols and so we made a game of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.790 
of tiny symbols and so we made a game of
it<00:00:43.610> okay<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.780> don't<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
it okay I I don't know what it is this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.000 
it okay I I don't know what it is this
is<00:00:46.980> really<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.090> abstract<00:00:48.840> game<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.500> game

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
is really just an abstract game a game

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.380 
is really just an abstract game a game
what<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.399> trying<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> play<00:00:50.730> tiles<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
what you're trying to play tiles and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.850 
what you're trying to play tiles and
trying<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> place<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
trying to place them so that you get a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.490 
trying to place them so that you get a
larger<00:00:53.399> group<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.969> cymbals<00:00:54.840> together<00:00:54.989> than

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
larger group of cymbals together than

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.549 
larger group of cymbals together than
your<00:00:55.649> opponent<00:00:56.160> does<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.510> any<00:00:57.719> good<00:00:57.750> well

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
your opponent does is it any good well

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:13.090 
your opponent does is it any good well
let's<00:00:58.710> look<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:59.010> it

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.200 

at<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.219> beginning<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> game<00:01:14.850> each<00:01:15.180> player

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
at the beginning of the game each player

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.569 
at the beginning of the game each player
gets<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.320> tile<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.799> placed<00:01:17.039> in<00:01:17.189> front<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.460> them

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
gets a tile it's placed in front of them

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.609 
gets a tile it's placed in front of them
so<00:01:17.700> let's<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> closer<00:01:18.270> look<00:01:18.390> each<00:01:19.079> tile<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
so let's take a closer look each tile is

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.889 
so let's take a closer look each tile is
going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> show<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.450> artifacts

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
going to show one of the artifacts

so<00:02:30.380> let's<00:02:30.530> say<00:02:30.709> for<00:02:30.920> example<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.520> was

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
so let's say for example this was

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.690 
so let's say for example this was
something<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:32.840> ended<00:02:33.650> up<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.459> game

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
something that I ended up with in a game

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.940 
something that I ended up with in a game
I'm<00:02:35.330> going<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.810> get<00:02:35.900> points<00:02:36.260> depending<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.800> how

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
I'm going to get points depending on how

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.860 
I'm going to get points depending on how
many<00:02:37.010> players<00:02:37.459> were<00:02:38.120> involved<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> game

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
many players were involved with the game

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.170 
many players were involved with the game
now<00:02:39.470> obviously<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.250> nick<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.610> complete

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
now obviously this is nick a complete

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.240 
now obviously this is nick a complete
game<00:02:41.510> although<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.900> could<00:02:42.140> be<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:43.130> was

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
game although it could be if there was

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.949 
game although it could be if there was
five<00:02:43.520> players<00:02:43.850> because<00:02:44.209> there's<00:02:44.360> only<00:02:44.450> 90

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
five players because there's only 90

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.900 
five players because there's only 90
tiles<00:02:45.410> involved<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.459> game<00:02:46.610> what<00:02:46.790> do<00:02:46.850> I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
tiles involved in the game what do I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.790 
tiles involved in the game what do I
have<00:02:47.060> here<00:02:47.120> 2<00:02:47.420> 4<00:02:47.660> 6<00:02:47.870> 8<00:02:48.050> 10<00:02:48.440> 11<00:02:48.500> 12<00:02:50.200> 18<00:02:51.200> tiles<00:02:51.650> so

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
have here 2 4 6 8 10 11 12 18 tiles so

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.100 
have here 2 4 6 8 10 11 12 18 tiles so
yeah<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.459> very<00:02:52.670> possible<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.930> would

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
yeah it's very possible that this would

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.020 
yeah it's very possible that this would
be<00:02:54.200> all<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.380> would<00:02:54.590> end<00:02:54.739> up<00:02:54.830> with<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.850> in<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
be all I would end up with and so in a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.030 
be all I would end up with and so in a
five-player<00:02:56.540> game<00:02:56.810> I'm<00:02:57.020> going<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.590> look<00:02:57.739> if<00:02:57.890> I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
five-player game I'm going to look if I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.040 
five-player game I'm going to look if I
don't<00:02:58.340> have<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> specific<00:02:58.970> time<00:02:59.569> of<00:02:59.600> collection

do<00:04:04.489> for<00:04:05.000> each<00:04:05.090> number<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:05.510> players<00:04:05.739> getting

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
do for each number of players getting

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.680 
do for each number of players getting
all<00:04:06.920> 10<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.250> one<00:04:07.519> type<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.000> five<00:04:08.180> player<00:04:08.420> game

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
all 10 of one type and five player game

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.270 
all 10 of one type and five player game
I'm<00:04:08.959> going<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.350> say<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.709> virtually<00:04:10.190> impossible

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
I'm going to say is virtually impossible

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.130 
I'm going to say is virtually impossible
unless<00:04:10.850> you<00:04:11.090> happen<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.450> draw<00:04:11.690> those<00:04:11.959> and

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
unless you happen to draw those and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.289 
unless you happen to draw those and
everyone<00:04:12.380> else<00:04:12.500> is<00:04:12.650> falling<00:04:12.980> asleep<00:04:13.299> when

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
everyone else is falling asleep when

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.280 
everyone else is falling asleep when
you're<00:04:14.420> putting<00:04:14.600> these<00:04:14.780> tiles<00:04:15.049> together

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
you're putting these tiles together

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.110 
you're putting these tiles together
obviously<00:04:16.250> you're<00:04:16.370> constrained<00:04:16.700> about<00:04:16.970> the

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
obviously you're constrained about the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.699 
obviously you're constrained about the
colors<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.600> decides<00:04:17.959> but<00:04:18.470> you're<00:04:18.590> also

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
colors and decides but you're also

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.900 
colors and decides but you're also
watching<00:04:19.100> your<00:04:19.190> opponents<00:04:19.549> because<00:04:19.669> they

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
watching your opponents because they

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.210 
watching your opponents because they
might<00:04:20.150> have<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:21.229> might<00:04:21.350> put<00:04:21.620> one<00:04:21.769> there<00:04:21.799> just

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
might have you might put one there just

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.650 
might have you might put one there just
to<00:04:22.340> block<00:04:22.520> them<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.150> you'll<00:04:23.300> find<00:04:23.510> that

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
to block them but you'll find that

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.750 
to block them but you'll find that
usually<00:04:24.289> you're<00:04:24.440> playing<00:04:24.710> tiles<00:04:25.010> in<00:04:25.310> your<00:04:25.580> own

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
usually you're playing tiles in your own

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.640 
usually you're playing tiles in your own
the<00:04:26.570> only<00:04:26.750> time<00:04:26.870> you'll<00:04:27.020> throw<00:04:27.200> tiles<00:04:27.440> and

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
the only time you'll throw tiles and

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.620 
the only time you'll throw tiles and
opponents<00:04:28.100> is<00:04:28.220> if<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:29.210> want<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.479> make<00:04:29.600> sure

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
opponents is if you want to make sure

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.150 
opponents is if you want to make sure
they<00:04:29.900> have<00:04:29.930> at<00:04:30.169> least<00:04:30.320> one<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.740> type<00:04:30.919> so

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
they have at least one of the type so

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.870 
they have at least one of the type so
that<00:04:31.280> they<00:04:31.340> don't<00:04:31.460> get<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:33.710> 10<00:04:34.370> points<00:04:34.760> for

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
that they don't get the 10 points for

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.090 
that they don't get the 10 points for
that<00:04:35.000> or<00:04:35.450> so<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.470> know<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.620> can<00:04:36.860> stop

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
that or so that you know you can stop

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.560 
that or so that you know you can stop
them<00:04:37.280> from<00:04:37.370> getting<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.700> big<00:04:37.880> group<00:04:38.210> but<00:04:38.450> what

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
them from getting a big group but what

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.210 
them from getting a big group but what
your<00:04:38.750> whole<00:04:38.990> goal<00:04:39.260> is<00:04:39.440> trying<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:39.890> get<00:04:39.979> as<00:04:40.070> big

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
your whole goal is trying to get as big

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.580 
your whole goal is trying to get as big
of<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.400> group<00:04:40.580> as<00:04:40.729> possible<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.450> to<00:04:42.020> keep<00:04:42.200> yours

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
of a group as possible and to keep yours

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.510 
of a group as possible and to keep yours
dance<00:04:42.950> west<00:04:43.250> you

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
dance west you

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.999 
dance west you
types<00:04:43.819> as<00:04:44.060> possible<00:04:44.599> because<00:04:45.199> you<00:04:45.349> can<00:04:45.590> see<00:04:45.800> if

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
types as possible because you can see if

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.950 
types as possible because you can see if
you<00:04:46.400> only<00:04:46.580> have<00:04:46.759> one<00:04:47.000> or<00:04:47.120> two<00:04:47.240> types<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:47.780> yours

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
you only have one or two types and yours

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.080 
you only have one or two types and yours
you're<00:04:48.470> going<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.800> win<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.370> could<00:04:49.669> end<00:04:49.910> up

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
you're going to win so you could end up

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.059 
you're going to win so you could end up
and<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:50.479> had<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:50.870> have<00:04:51.080> at<00:04:51.259> his<00:04:51.379> plate<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:51.830> just

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
and I had this have at his plate I just

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.350 
and I had this have at his plate I just
said<00:04:52.190> it<00:04:52.340> doesn't<00:04:52.520> happen<00:04:52.759> very<00:04:52.909> often<00:04:53.150> but<00:04:53.270> I

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
said it doesn't happen very often but I

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.149 
said it doesn't happen very often but I
have<00:04:53.569> played<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.810> game<00:04:53.990> where<00:04:54.560> people<00:04:54.919> very

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
have played a game where people very

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.559 
have played a game where people very
rarely<00:04:55.430> plated<00:04:55.879> their<00:04:55.970> own<00:04:56.090> at<00:04:56.210> all<00:04:56.330> and

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
rarely plated their own at all and

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.029 
rarely plated their own at all and
almost<00:04:56.810> always<00:04:57.050> play<00:04:57.289> exclusively<00:04:57.919> and

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
almost always play exclusively and

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.309 
almost always play exclusively and
others<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.940> that<00:04:58.970> they<00:04:59.150> could<00:04:59.539> expand<00:05:00.229> the

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
others so that they could expand the

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.839 
others so that they could expand the
others<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.740> when<00:05:01.009> that<00:05:01.159> happens<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.699> game

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
others and when that happens the game

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.420 
others and when that happens the game
gets<00:05:02.090> much<00:05:02.569> progressively<00:05:03.199> better<00:05:03.470> well

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
gets much progressively better well

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.879 
gets much progressively better well
there<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.759> have<00:05:04.789> it<00:05:07.690> it's<00:05:08.690> not<00:05:09.050> a<00:05:09.110> bad<00:05:09.530> game

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
there you have it it's not a bad game

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.089 
there you have it it's not a bad game
and<00:05:10.190> yet<00:05:10.819> doesn't<00:05:11.780> really<00:05:12.110> outshine<00:05:12.680> anything

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
and yet doesn't really outshine anything

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.529 
and yet doesn't really outshine anything
else<00:05:13.250> there's<00:05:13.430> nothing<00:05:13.729> really<00:05:13.970> here<00:05:14.330> that's

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
else there's nothing really here that's

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.480 
else there's nothing really here that's
that<00:05:15.699> interesting<00:05:16.780> well<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.919> fact<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.280> you

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
that interesting well the fact that you

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.540 
that interesting well the fact that you
don't<00:05:19.819> want<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.270> have<00:05:20.539> any<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.919> different

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
don't want to have any of different

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.980 
don't want to have any of different
kinds<00:05:22.849> as<00:05:22.940> interesting<00:05:23.360> you<00:05:23.449> can<00:05:23.569> throw<00:05:23.780> a

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
kinds as interesting you can throw a

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.110 
kinds as interesting you can throw a
town<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.710> somebody<00:05:24.979> else's<00:05:25.280> of<00:05:25.520> a<00:05:25.789> certain

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
town of somebody else's of a certain

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.790 
town of somebody else's of a certain
type<00:05:26.479> I<00:05:26.780> could<00:05:27.229> put<00:05:27.319> us<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:29.020> jade<00:05:30.020> statue<00:05:30.380> into

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
type I could put us a jade statue into

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.270 
type I could put us a jade statue into
your<00:05:31.460> museum<00:05:32.389> just<00:05:33.110> so<00:05:33.289> that<00:05:33.409> you<00:05:33.500> don't<00:05:34.099> get

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
your museum just so that you don't get

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.480 
your museum just so that you don't get
those<00:05:34.430> ten<00:05:34.699> points<00:05:35.090> that's<00:05:35.449> interesting

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
those ten points that's interesting

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.439 
those ten points that's interesting
there's<00:05:37.490> certainly<00:05:37.729> been<00:05:37.789> lucky<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.240> tile

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
there's certainly been lucky the tile

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.409 
there's certainly been lucky the tile
draw<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:40.370> tiles<00:05:40.759> I<00:05:40.969> went<00:05:41.150> through<00:05:41.270> and

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
draw and the tiles I went through and

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.700 
draw and the tiles I went through and
looked<00:05:41.449> at<00:05:41.659> all<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:41.870> different<00:05:41.990> sets<00:05:42.409> and

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
looked at all the different sets and

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.920 
looked at all the different sets and
some<00:05:43.400> sets<00:05:43.669> have<00:05:43.819> more<00:05:44.030> red<00:05:44.240> side<00:05:44.449> some<00:05:44.719> sets

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
some sets have more red side some sets

there's a problem and not a problem but
it's<00:06:23.750> just<00:06:23.900> not<00:06:23.960> worth<00:06:24.229> me<00:06:24.409> getting<00:06:24.680> now<00:06:25.430> it

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669
