00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.310
 hello people welcome to tutorial 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.160
 of rpg mpx and this however I go back 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.140
 because it's not a tutorial that teaches today 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.849
 today was a very different thing to have 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.410
 that being the following I received many 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.170
 messages from people not following 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.019
 How was it that I just kept talking? 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.290
 rpg maker online how do i do 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.900
 can you create an emmy pg make people 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.970
 I already said my turn I will not do it 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.100
 tori because it takes a beating 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.450
 I'm not going to give a model as a model. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.879
 these things 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.440
 wanting or not not insisting 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.440
 because he called showed that the internet 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.440
 do not do that so detail it no 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.390
 does it work in mmx rpg is this in my 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.820
 favorite program using fg 6 that 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.509
 it does not work is a way to do 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.610
 because I do not like much earlier 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.930
 so it 's mostly tutorial tale 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.000
 does rpg maker xp work and I well say 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.670
 which I used for two weeks at pm 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.429
 Boy, I'm like this 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.649
 part of the light or nobel design in the 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.390
 I do not really like the chip because I 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.050
 bring a few times I did not think 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.450
 very good so do not move then 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.310
 I'm not going to do any thoreau, I will. 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.580
 only make available that some links 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.990
 that teach you to do something great 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.390
 why not tell you everything else 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.330
 complicated because it does not teach 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.970
 because you do not need is just 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.709
 necessary you are one of the reason 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.660
 Doing what is needed not only repeats 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:54.050
 make but also in this you have a 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.330
 basic knowledge of rgs 3 the best 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.220
 rgss it looks like it is the programming language 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.789
 of the script that you here 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.530
 here and here too if the language 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.229
 population wants to make so you have to 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.270
 to know and this weighed Basque know 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.789
 configure it and besides it has to 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.310
 have an account at ipÃª is a site that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.810
 make available to you 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.610
 make a business there I forgot that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.030
 is also to preserve and create 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.610
 radio narok without mentioning that in some 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.099
 It seems that I saw the power you can achieve. 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.130
 make an emmy rpg that neither narok than not 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.220
 Level up game in several people while playing 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.040
 time on a server and log in 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.260
 you need to be paying 11 hosted a 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.960
 the company that hosts the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.570
 server is paid you have to pay in 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.060
 money and a motorbike too but not all 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.920
 but some must discover without speaking 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.450
 Here's how xp works 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.960
 You have to know the population of xp that 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.160
 would be the rgss script do not cheat rgs2 is 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.020
 something like that 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.300
 so I will use here three sites that 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.620
 can help the inter leader here but if 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.320
 I want here is an online game that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.680
 those free games online have 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.680
 young people reached the normal free is well 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.020
 I do not know if I have to run the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.310
 your normal game but I know that in XP it has 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.560
 a way of working 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.060
 then we will formalize that in the link in the 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.270
 Video description here under the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.880
 video description you will find 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.430
 with some links you can create 80 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.920
 make your game online so do not 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.810
 ask anyone who asked me to 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.180
 comment or send a response that 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.760
 video here so if that tutorial is not 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.830
 just a warning to end up with 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.930
 these messages of repentance is 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.250
 online then be the next I'll go 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.910
 make available here 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.730
 the dotcom rpg js that if you can 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.550
 create online games might leave 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.650
 your goal there I do not know if it's via server 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.170
 or so but what you more or less 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.060
 how does it work that your 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.970
 game and ready 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.010
 I'm playing I can walk here now 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.920
 I do not know a login so I can 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.250
 create a new xp scheme appeared mode 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.190
 seems seems so is this because she 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.050
 you can from here then close it it does not come out 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.660
 I created here that own 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.120
 This one from the site changes pg make 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.700
 and the other is from a youtube video that 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.830
 displays the body that ufpb xp one there it is 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.520
 which gives you a file you download then you 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.860
 low and that's it look there you look no 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.350
 be overcome and that behind their own 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.990
 things in these things to leave a lay of 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.240
 site is tricky you can not miss 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.460
 of any you have to go behind is 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.680
 so you may not want it all in 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.090
 your hands then that's all this is what 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.980
 It's to talk to you. 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.810
 so any pair already in the comments 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.270
 which is doubtful according to video 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.730
 I like not to like the club there. I do not 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.470
 I care a lot about this but it is 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.420
 subscribe to the channel you follow yes 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.150
 tutorials for a video start at what else 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.410
 cops even teaching so this is it 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.250
 until the next 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.250
 said
