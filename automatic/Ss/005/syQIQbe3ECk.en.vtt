00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
harmonize the courts let's start with

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.770 
harmonize the courts let's start with
our<00:01:09.900> e7<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.789> if<00:01:11.789> you<00:01:11.850> take<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.149> two<00:01:12.360> notes

that I'm fretting in this gorebridge of

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.010 
that I'm fretting in this gorebridge of
the<00:01:14.430> B<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> G<00:01:16.560> sharp<00:01:17.780> what<00:01:18.780> we're<00:01:18.930> going

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the B and the G sharp what we're going

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.330 
the B and the G sharp what we're going
to<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.410> we're<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> take<00:01:19.830> each<00:01:20.039> of

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to do is we're going to take each of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
to do is we're going to take each of
them<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.820> move<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> same

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
them and just move them up on the same

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.210 
them and just move them up on the same
string<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:23.940> higher<00:01:24.210> fret<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:25.679> next<00:01:26.070> node

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
string to a higher fret to the next node

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.600 
string to a higher fret to the next node
in<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.429> E<00:01:26.520> major<00:01:26.850> scale<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.929> beam<00:01:28.610> will

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
in the E major scale so this beam will

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.430 
in the E major scale so this beam will
go<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.380> C<00:01:31.380> sharp<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.640> G<00:01:32.880> sharp<00:01:33.440> go

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
go up to the C sharp and this G sharp go

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.389 
go up to the C sharp and this G sharp go
up<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:39.200> then<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:41.220> more<00:01:41.280> time

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
up to the a then we go up one more time

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.109 
up to the a then we go up one more time
again<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.179> C<00:01:42.450> sharp<00:01:42.750> will<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> D<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
again the C sharp will go up to a D and

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.160 
again the C sharp will go up to a D and
the<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.150> will<00:01:45.570> go<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.719 

in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> back<00:01:52.500> down<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.490> I'm<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.700> to
