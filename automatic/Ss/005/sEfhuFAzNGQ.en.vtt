00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 the nissan juke is this little urban suv 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.759
 who has before all a terrible mouth a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.139
 mouth that keep even in its version 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.299
 entry-level that we try 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.710
 today this basic finish of a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.930
 available only with one engine 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.630
 the subscript meaning 94 horses 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.130
 in the program no frills the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.779
 exterior mirrors and handles 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 of doors are black and not color 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.660
 bodywork as on the version 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.160
 higher 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.730
 likewise the wheels are 16 inches with 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.859
 hubcaps 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.270
 but even so the guard looks very 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.170
 dynamic regardless of the angle of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.790
 inside view no fuss 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.250
 equipment at the hands air conditioning 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.590
 the gps the bluetooth kit or the regulator 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.270
 inaccessible speed even in option 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.190
 but we still have the windows 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.930
 front electric or car radio the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.219
 presentation remains particular with the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.050
 gear lever implanted on a 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.760
 element that evokes the motorcycle tank 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 in the back is good for two adults 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.469
 but not three one of the weak points 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.109
 juke comes from his chest with 251 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.309
 cubic decimeters it is very far from the 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.710
 377 cubic decimetres of a renault captur 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.110
 in addition the loading threshold is too 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.760
 even to follow every day that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.950
 we had tried was dynamic ip 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.540
 even to be firm 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.890
 this version of the juke with its wheels 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.330
 16 inches and more considerate in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.770
 suspension but still nice to 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.540
 to drive and not sensitive to the roll 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 the little engine is quite 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.290
 sufficient in city principal vocation 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.890
 of the car it is more discreet to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 low regime 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.460
 on the road the 94 horses are of course 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.470
 less comfortable but still more 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.820
 convincing that catches or 2008 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.119
 with their three-cylinder input 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.829
 range 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.450
 weak points on the road 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.180
 soundproofing and distances from 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.979
 excessive braking 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.030
 the juke is above all a look even gold 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.350
 in this version more or less 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.689
 stripped he keeps his mouth of 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.799
 concept cars rolling good surprise 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.329
 this version proved one of 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.070
 more comfortable of the range and the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.960
 little donkey and just overall 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.310
 one of the only weak points comes from 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.930
 the poor equipment in series is 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.149
 impossible to enrich by way of 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 options the only proposed and the painting 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.840
 metallized for 1000 euros more the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.549
 Deleting finish enriches rims 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.320
 alloy is a manual air conditioning 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.790
 it's another opinion a better choice 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.790
 which is reasonable in budget
