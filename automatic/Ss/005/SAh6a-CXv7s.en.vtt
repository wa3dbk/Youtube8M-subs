the<00:05:39.949> end<00:05:40.159> and<00:05:40.580> it's<00:05:40.729> not<00:05:40.909> supposed<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.120> be<00:05:41.270> the

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
the end and it's not supposed to be the

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.649 
the end and it's not supposed to be the
exactly<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.990> same<00:05:42.819> it's<00:05:43.819> an<00:05:44.000> inspired<00:05:44.360> look
