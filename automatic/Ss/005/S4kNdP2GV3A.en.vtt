 link in the description of the tenth place on 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.940

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.950
 real Americans at that moment everything 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.530
 longed for pushing for the whole team and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.480
 predicted winning team championships 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.129
 came the main show of the year passed 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.800

 matches were knocked out exactly real 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.039
 the Americans and the hold was held 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.289
 it was us who spent the match furious 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.270
 swagger began to hit the swiss 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.160
 because he is the one to blame 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.140
 that they could not win the command 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.820
 championship scuffle over 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.869
 that swagger was a form of vat and infection wines 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.060
 which meant temporary sesara sisters 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.280
 9th place in ninth place is located 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.200

 russia by and more this time he 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.850
 I was thrown out but managed to catch my feet 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.369
 behind the stairs like he was already laying on the floor 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.320
 well, my legs were still on the stairs so 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.630
 he remained a legitimate participant in the match 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.150
 in general, quite a great move was 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.909
 shown by an African and it was probably his 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.369

 pretty good for the div constantly 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.049
 in the ring there were some actions 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 sometimes even in any spot 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.670
 almost all participants participated in the general 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.409
 the point is that g was able to protect her 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.960
 div champion title forced to surrender 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.870

 toga lingerie on and kane in amazing 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.130
 fast match legends were merged never 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.900
 getting the opportunity to either die 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.209
 opponents for the account it was the second 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.099
 victory on the main show of the year but in this 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.840
 year you how they fell apart from someone 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.940
 former members of the group strick 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.350
 victories on pc mind is not interrupted even he 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.819
 so far and equal to only 20 third place 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.709
 top three opens Daniel Brian 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.569
 who at the beginning of the show defeated the player and 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.760
 won the opportunity to May 9 fight for 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.590
 the main title of the company they drink themselves 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.690
 the player started many months before 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.459
 just breaking their standoff 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.620
 shifted of something more personal 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.090
 leadership did not give brian 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.489
 the opportunity to fight for the main title 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.530
 Companies at Wrestling but thought 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.630
 that trip can stop brian and and 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.240
 the player himself with his big nose well and 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.550
 yeah sure, headlining the amount of it 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.340
 in the end, Brian won a clean simau 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.220
 hall and went to the main event the second 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.140
 place and we have the second line and on it 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.330
 Danian Bryan is also located 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.130
 until his antiphones will be indignant but all 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.500
 the amount was essentially dedicated 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.210
 bearded to evil and this does not change a 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.070
 also do not understand why people think 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.320
 brianna perry banned from but still 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.330
 compares it with a log brand with its 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.760
 Growth copes with rivals 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.380
 many times larger than its dimensions and main 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.750
 event last time lomani did not 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.090
 except he was able to defeat 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.130
 baty and orton and for the third time become 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.169
 champion of david willy and if you look 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.600
 Forward, we then know that even for this 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.900
 since he held the title longer but lost 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.789
 its also not a particularly good way 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.590
 first place well and in the first place 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.990
 located not wrestler and events 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.090
 which shocked the whole wrestling world of brokers 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.160
 Lesnar defeated the undertaker and stopped 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.780
 win-win series of the undertaker on 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.030
 wrestling for more than twenty years 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.550
 the undertaker defeated anyone who got up 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.950
 in his way, and it did not care that stood 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.340
 at stake the dead man still won in 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.560
 last year given 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.540
 1 undertaker and broker style 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.610
 Lesnar showed us a disgusting 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.520
 match up for quality he was terrible 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.910
 the outcome was even worse sheared interrupted end 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.650
 the era 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.530
