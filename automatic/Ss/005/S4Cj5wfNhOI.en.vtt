00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
below the chassis so what we really

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.000 
below the chassis so what we really

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
foot by taking a shot off it or

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.780 
foot by taking a shot off it or
something<00:00:55.470> like<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.640> went

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
something like that but we really went

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.600 
something like that but we really went
for<00:00:56.880> comfort<00:00:57.390> first<00:00:58.220> you<00:00:59.220> know<00:00:59.309> weren't<00:00:59.460> so

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
issues those were secondary measures to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.520 
issues those were secondary measures to
making<00:01:03.420> sure<00:01:03.450> that<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.110> player<00:01:04.320> was

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
wheels or bigger wheels are just faster

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.880 
wheels or bigger wheels are just faster
it's<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.960> how<00:02:48.050> it's<00:02:48.320> always<00:02:48.440> been<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.740> way

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
it's just how it's always been that way

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.370 
it's just how it's always been that way
it's<00:02:49.400> science<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.870> can't<00:02:51.080> really<00:02:51.140> argue

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
it's science and you can't really argue

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.760 
it's science and you can't really argue
that<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:51.860> what<00:02:52.430> we<00:02:52.550> said<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:53.030> ok<00:02:53.590> all<00:02:54.590> these

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
that so what we said is ok all these

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.470 
that so what we said is ok all these
other<00:02:54.950> companies<00:02:55.100> whether<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.580> 80-76<00:02:56.209> all

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
other companies whether it's 80-76 all

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.140 
other companies whether it's 80-76 all
80s<00:02:56.810> have<00:02:56.900> been<00:02:57.020> slowly<00:02:57.590> incrementally

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
80s have been slowly incrementally

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.360 
80s have been slowly incrementally
increasing<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.480> size<00:02:59.660> but<00:03:00.230> we<00:03:00.380> felt<00:03:00.680> like<00:03:00.770> you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
increasing the size but we felt like you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.730 
increasing the size but we felt like you
know<00:03:01.570> offering<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.660> one-percent<00:03:03.230> advantage<00:03:03.620> or

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
know offering a one-percent advantage or

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.930 
know offering a one-percent advantage or
a<00:03:03.770> two<00:03:03.890> percent<00:03:04.160> advantage<00:03:04.459> really<00:03:04.640> wasn't

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
a two percent advantage really wasn't

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.010 
a two percent advantage really wasn't
enough<00:03:05.150> for<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.390> skater<00:03:05.600> to<00:03:05.720> feel<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
enough for the skater to feel the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.199 
enough for the skater to feel the
difference<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:06.920> we<00:03:07.100> decided<00:03:07.430> after<00:03:07.790> all<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
difference so we decided after all the

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.820 
difference so we decided after all the
testing<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.660> 100<00:03:09.020> millimeter<00:03:09.320> see<00:03:09.560> note<00:03:09.709> on

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
testing that 100 millimeter see note on

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.090 
testing that 100 millimeter see note on
the<00:03:09.890> back<00:03:10.070> with<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.670> 376<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:13.010> know

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
the back with the 376 is for a you know

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.370 
the back with the 376 is for a you know
average<00:03:13.400> size<00:03:13.580> of<00:03:13.670> doe<00:03:13.880> size<00:03:14.840> like<00:03:15.050> sickened

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
average size of doe size like sickened

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.260 
average size of doe size like sickened
at<00:03:15.560> six<00:03:15.770> and<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:15.890> half<00:03:15.920> skatin<00:03:16.370> up<00:03:16.520> that<00:03:17.000> that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
at six and a half skatin up that that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.840 
at six and a half skatin up that that
was<00:03:17.540> ideal<00:03:18.050> contact<00:03:19.010> patch<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.400> ideal<00:03:19.640> wheel

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
was ideal contact patch and ideal wheel

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.610 
was ideal contact patch and ideal wheel
size<00:03:20.120> for<00:03:20.360> them<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.690> generate<00:03:21.140> top-end<00:03:21.530> speed

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
size for them to generate top-end speed

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.190 
size for them to generate top-end speed
yeah<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.550> mean<00:03:22.760> it's<00:03:22.820> definitely<00:03:23.630> one<00:03:24.050> of<00:03:24.080> the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
yeah I mean it's definitely one of the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.710 
yeah I mean it's definitely one of the
most<00:03:24.320> noticeable<00:03:25.150> advanced<00:03:26.150> as<00:03:26.269> far<00:03:26.300> as<00:03:26.540> wheel

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
most noticeable advanced as far as wheel

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.960 
most noticeable advanced as far as wheel
let's<00:03:27.110> go<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:28.280> mean<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.519> do<00:03:28.700> still<00:03:28.940> have

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
let's go and I mean you do still have

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.910 
let's go and I mean you do still have
those<00:03:29.330> smaller<00:03:29.660> wheels<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.050> front<00:03:30.140> so<00:03:30.890> I

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
those smaller wheels in the front so I

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.900 
those smaller wheels in the front so I
mean<00:03:31.070> you're<00:03:31.100> still<00:03:31.370> going<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.519> have<00:03:31.610> some<00:03:31.880> of

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
mean you're still going to have some of

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.220 
mean you're still going to have some of
that<00:03:32.060> sharp<00:03:32.330> turning<00:03:32.750> all<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.019> good<00:03:33.200> stuff

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
that sharp turning all that good stuff

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.400 
that sharp turning all that good stuff
as<00:03:33.620> well<00:03:33.800> keeps<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.459> keeps<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:35.030> um<00:03:35.410> without

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
as well keeps you keeps you um without

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.990 
as well keeps you keeps you um without
moving<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.830> too<00:03:37.040> high<00:03:37.220> off<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.580> ground<00:03:37.730> you

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
moving you too high off the ground you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.370 
moving you too high off the ground you
know<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.239> you're<00:03:38.690> going<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.840> get<00:03:38.989> some<00:03:39.140> sharp

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
know that you're going to get some sharp

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.780 
know that you're going to get some sharp
turning<00:03:39.739> stuff<00:03:39.920> with<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.100> big<00:03:40.310> wheel<00:03:40.459> as<00:03:40.640> well

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
turning stuff with a big wheel as well

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.310 
turning stuff with a big wheel as well
just<00:03:41.000> because<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.390> fact<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:42.170> can

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
just because of the fact that you can

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.930 
just because of the fact that you can
compress<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:42.950> get<00:03:43.100> such<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> big<00:03:43.489> contact

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
compress it and get such a big contact

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.729 
compress it and get such a big contact
patch<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.330> you're<00:03:44.480> not<00:03:44.630> used<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.620> know

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
patch that you're not used to you know

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.759 
patch that you're not used to you know
so<00:03:46.400> you're<00:03:46.550> able<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.910> help<00:03:47.480> make<00:03:47.780> up<00:03:47.810> enable

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
so you're able to help make up enable

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.140 
so you're able to help make up enable
your<00:03:48.890> slow<00:03:49.040> yourself<00:03:49.160> down<00:03:49.430> if<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.790> need<00:03:49.820> to

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
your slow yourself down if you need to

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150 
your slow yourself down if you need to
for<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:50.630> top<00:03:50.870> end<00:03:51.080> speed<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:52.040> you're

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
for that top end speed that you're

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.509 
for that top end speed that you're
already<00:03:52.400> at<00:03:52.640> but<00:03:53.269> also<00:03:53.480> by<00:03:54.230> having<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.560> 376<00:03:55.340> is

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
already at but also by having the 376 is

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.190 
already at but also by having the 376 is
we<00:03:55.850> don't<00:03:55.940> extend<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.450> con<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.959> length

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
we don't extend the con the length

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.930 
we don't extend the con the length
overall<00:03:57.560> length<00:03:57.800> too<00:03:58.070> far<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.459> where<00:03:58.550> fields

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
overall length too far to where fields

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.699 
overall length too far to where fields
like<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.269> know<00:03:59.360> your<00:03:59.570> your<00:03:59.780> cornering<00:04:00.500> like<00:04:00.680> a

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
like you know your your cornering like a

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.530 
like you know your your cornering like a
boat<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.250> know<00:04:01.430> yeah<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.150> gives<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.510> a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
boat you know yeah and gives you a

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.759 
boat you know yeah and gives you a
loaded<00:04:02.840> F<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.080> ground<00:04:03.350> where<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.620> can

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
loaded F to the ground where you can

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.050 
loaded F to the ground where you can
make<00:04:03.860> those<00:04:04.070> hard<00:04:04.250> angle<00:04:04.580> turns<00:04:04.790> like<00:04:04.970> you

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
make those hard angle turns like you

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.979 
make those hard angle turns like you
were<00:04:05.150> talking<00:04:05.300> about<00:04:05.540> yeah<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:05.750> mean<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.959> think

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
were talking about yeah I mean I think

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.540 
were talking about yeah I mean I think
that's<00:04:06.260> definitely<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.980> good<00:04:07.010> point<00:04:07.310> as<00:04:07.430> well

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
that's definitely a good point as well

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.070 
that's definitely a good point as well
to<00:04:07.820> note<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.269> front<00:04:08.750> wheel<00:04:08.870> isn't

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
to note that that front wheel isn't

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.720 
to note that that front wheel isn't
really<00:04:09.320> sticking<00:04:09.620> out<00:04:09.860> as<00:04:10.130> far<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.489> if<00:04:10.610> you're

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
really sticking out as far and if you're

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.699 
really sticking out as far and if you're
looking<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.570> know<00:04:11.660> down<00:04:11.900> on<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.290> top<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.530> the

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
looking you know down on the top of the

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.009 
looking you know down on the top of the
skate<00:04:12.950> or<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.820> know<00:04:13.940> if<00:04:14.030> we<00:04:14.120> can<00:04:14.269> get<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.690> on

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
skate or you know if we can get that on

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.960 
skate or you know if we can get that on
camera<00:04:15.080> just<00:04:15.560> looking<00:04:16.010> down<00:04:16.400> on<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.729> skate

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
camera just looking down on the skate

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.699 
camera just looking down on the skate
that<00:04:17.450> that<00:04:17.660> front<00:04:18.019> wheel<00:04:18.169> really<00:04:18.470> isn't

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
that that front wheel really isn't

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.289 
that that front wheel really isn't
sticking<00:04:18.979> out<00:04:19.190> too<00:04:19.549> far<00:04:19.790> on<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.060> skates

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
sticking out too far on the skates

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.789 
sticking out too far on the skates
you're<00:04:20.510> still<00:04:20.690> having<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.109> know<00:04:21.320> similar

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
you're still having you know similar

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.560 
you're still having you know similar
yeah<00:04:22.340> we've<00:04:22.490> done<00:04:22.640> a<00:04:22.669> few<00:04:22.940> things<00:04:23.000> there<00:04:23.390> we

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
yeah we've done a few things there we

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.360 
yeah we've done a few things there we
have<00:04:24.080> probably<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.650> narrowest<00:04:25.220> gap<00:04:25.640> between

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
have probably the narrowest gap between

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.530 
have probably the narrowest gap between
wheels<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.790> you'll<00:04:26.910> ever<00:04:27.060> find<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.479> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
wheels that you'll ever find in the

you<00:04:30.840> know<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.080> we<00:04:31.199> have<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.410> be<00:04:31.500> very<00:04:31.620> precise

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
you know so we have to be very precise

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.800 
you know so we have to be very precise
in<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.310> frame<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.760> help<00:04:33.210> make<00:04:33.449> it<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:33.750> you

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
in the frame to help make it so you

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.230 
in the frame to help make it so you
don't<00:04:33.900> have<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.410> adjust<00:04:34.830> too<00:04:35.100> much<00:04:35.280> one<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.150> the

don't have to adjust too much one of the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
other things that we did was you know

other things that we did was you know
it's<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.570> myth<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:40.139> kind<00:04:40.350> of<00:04:40.729> eliminate<00:04:41.729> is

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
it's a myth the kind of eliminate is

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.240 
it's a myth the kind of eliminate is
that<00:04:42.120> all<00:04:42.270> your<00:04:42.449> angled<00:04:42.870> more<00:04:43.050> well<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.800> angle

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
that all your angled more well the angle

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.430 
that all your angled more well the angle
of<00:04:44.400> your<00:04:44.760> where<00:04:45.240> your<00:04:45.360> foot<00:04:45.600> is<00:04:45.660> is<00:04:45.900> determined

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
of your where your foot is is determined

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.010 
of your where your foot is is determined
by<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:47.160> slope<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.120> boot<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.449> by<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
by the slope of the boot and by the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.020 
by the slope of the boot and by the
height<00:04:49.410> differentials<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.310> angles<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:50.880> the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
height differentials and angles of the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
back and front mounting plates not by

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.790 
back and front mounting plates not by
your<00:04:53.220> wheel<00:04:53.490> base<00:04:54.449> so<00:04:54.990> what<00:04:55.169> we've<00:04:55.320> done<00:04:55.350> is

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
your wheel base so what we've done is

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.340 
your wheel base so what we've done is
we've<00:04:56.070> adjusted<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.360> front<00:04:57.750> mounting<00:04:58.110> plate

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
we've adjusted the front mounting plate

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.290 
we've adjusted the front mounting plate
in<00:04:58.590> correlation<00:04:59.250> with<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.610> back<00:04:59.760> metal<00:05:00.060> plate

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
in correlation with the back metal plate

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.520 
in correlation with the back metal plate
to<00:05:00.449> keep<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.720> at<00:05:00.840> what<00:05:01.020> we<00:05:01.169> feel<00:05:01.350> is<00:05:01.380> ideal

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
to keep you at what we feel is ideal

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.159 
to keep you at what we feel is ideal
angle<00:05:02.370> for<00:05:02.610> maximum<00:05:03.000> stride<00:05:03.330> now<00:05:03.630> would<00:05:04.050> you

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
angle for maximum stride now would you

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.110 
angle for maximum stride now would you
say<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.889> height<00:05:05.130> above<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.580> rink<00:05:05.850> is<00:05:06.000> going

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
say the height above the rink is going

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.490 
say the height above the rink is going
to<00:05:06.180> be<00:05:06.240> about<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.510> same<00:05:06.690> on<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:06.990> skate<00:05:07.229> for

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
to be about the same on this skate for

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.560 
to be about the same on this skate for
some<00:05:07.710> more<00:05:07.830> traditional<00:05:08.280> skates<00:05:08.520> it's<00:05:09.360> about

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
some more traditional skates it's about

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.450 
some more traditional skates it's about
eight<00:05:09.900> millimeters<00:05:10.410> is<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.860> difference<00:05:11.250> you

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
eight millimeters is the difference you

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.850 
eight millimeters is the difference you
I<00:05:11.490> mean<00:05:11.699> you<00:05:11.820> won't<00:05:12.000> even<00:05:12.120> really<00:05:12.300> recognize

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
I mean you won't even really recognize

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.610 
I mean you won't even really recognize
it<00:05:13.860> i<00:05:13.979> mean<00:05:14.100> that<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:14.460> know<00:05:14.580> anybody<00:05:15.270> who<00:05:15.660> can

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
it i mean that you know anybody who can

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.870 
it i mean that you know anybody who can
really<00:05:16.770> feel<00:05:16.979> eight<00:05:17.160> millimeters<00:05:17.520> difference

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
really feel eight millimeters difference

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.120 
really feel eight millimeters difference
is<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.210> most<00:05:18.600> sensitive<00:05:18.900> person<00:05:19.260> either<00:05:19.380> yeah

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
is the most sensitive person either yeah

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.980 
is the most sensitive person either yeah
it's<00:05:20.940> pretty<00:05:21.090> small<00:05:21.240> difference<00:05:21.720> right<00:05:21.900> there

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
it's pretty small difference right there
