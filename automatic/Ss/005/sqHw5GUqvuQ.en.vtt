every

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
every
and<00:01:48.810> attach<00:01:49.049> things<00:01:49.290> late<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> run<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and attach things late so you can run it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.340 
and attach things late so you can run it
off<00:01:50.399> curbs<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.869> pretty<00:01:52.020> much

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
off curbs it's going to be pretty much

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.970 
off curbs it's going to be pretty much

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.760 

one<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.240> important<00:01:59.660> factors<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.170> remember

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
one of the important factors to remember

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.440 
one of the important factors to remember
is<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:00.980> by<00:02:01.310> being<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.240> set<00:02:02.510> design

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
is that by being on the set design

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.529 
is that by being on the set design
the<00:02:04.810> bag<00:02:05.079> can't<00:02:05.560> collapse<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.670> turn<00:02:07.329> and

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
the bag can't collapse and turn and

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.469 
the bag can't collapse and turn and
become<00:02:08.020> difficult<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.830> carry<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.179> go<00:02:10.269> up

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
become difficult to carry and can go up

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:20.459 
become difficult to carry and can go up
and<00:02:10.660> down<00:02:10.780> stairs<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:12.280> very<00:02:12.940> likely

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.440 

not<00:02:21.469> only<00:02:21.650> heavy<00:02:22.040> duty<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:22.609> it's<00:02:23.060> really

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
not only heavy duty but it's really

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.150 
not only heavy duty but it's really
engineered<00:02:24.439> to<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:25.489> durable

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.780 

it's<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.670> well<00:02:30.060> made

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
it's just well made

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.369 
it's just well made
then<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.959> whole<00:02:33.140> concept<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.549> allow<00:02:35.379> the

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
then the whole concept is to allow the

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.830 
then the whole concept is to allow the
hardware's<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.250> be<00:02:37.370> protected<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.329> carried

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
hardware's to be protected and carried

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.199 
hardware's to be protected and carried
well<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.739> user<00:02:40.069> not<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:40.760> have<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:41.000> work

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
well and the user not to have to work

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.570 
well and the user not to have to work
any<00:02:41.420> harder<00:02:41.540> than<00:02:41.870> he<00:02:42.079> has<00:02:42.290> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.360 

so<00:02:46.580> it's<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.090> very<00:02:47.120> versatile<00:02:47.810> bag<00:02:48.020> as<00:02:48.260> well<00:02:48.470> so

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
so it's a very versatile bag as well so

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.640 
so it's a very versatile bag as well so
that's<00:02:49.580> something<00:02:50.030> new<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.840> from<00:02:51.350> an<00:02:51.470> art

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
that's something new in the from an art

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.490 
that's something new in the from an art
