I<00:01:21.870> guess<00:01:22.870> I<00:01:22.960> think<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.260> little<00:01:23.350> bit<00:01:23.620> harder

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
I guess I think is a little bit harder

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.650 
I guess I think is a little bit harder
like<00:01:24.220> iron<00:01:24.460> man<00:01:24.490> could<00:01:24.790> still<00:01:25.000> get<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.360> angles

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
like iron man could still get the angles

james chen just maneuvering his way back
into<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.019> chair<00:02:23.050> here<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.910> see<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> joker<00:02:25.390> can

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
into the chair here I see a joker can

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.710 
into the chair here I see a joker can
make<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.780> two<00:02:25.930> straight<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:31.540> he<00:02:31.600> was

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
make it two straight I think he was

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.120 
make it two straight I think he was
taking<00:02:31.989> some<00:02:32.110> notes<00:02:32.260> watching<00:02:32.680> Howard<00:02:32.860> Aaron

good<00:02:38.620> first<00:02:38.950> game<00:02:39.190> there<00:02:39.459> yeah<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:41.489> mean<00:02:42.489> it's

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
good first game there yeah I mean it's

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.729 
good first game there yeah I mean it's
tricky<00:02:43.180> because<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.780> lot<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.140> people<00:02:44.260> don't<00:02:44.620> use

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
tricky because a lot of people don't use

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.229 
tricky because a lot of people don't use
Iron<00:02:45.010> Man<00:02:45.130> so<00:02:45.280> you're<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.489> really<00:02:45.549> used<00:02:46.090> to

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
Iron Man so you're not really used to

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.000 
Iron Man so you're not really used to
having<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.720> deal<00:02:46.930> with<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.320> repulsor<00:02:47.799> blast

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
having to deal with that repulsor blast

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.009 
having to deal with that repulsor blast
assist<00:02:48.430> coming<00:02:48.850> out<00:02:49.000> under<00:02:49.329> youth<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.750> since

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
assist coming out under youth and since

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.690 
assist coming out under youth and since
it's<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.230> projectile<00:02:50.680> will<00:02:50.950> go<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> lot<00:02:51.519> of

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
it's a projectile will go a lot of

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.850 
it's a projectile will go a lot of
Morgan's<00:02:52.290> projectiles<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.440> here<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.680> go

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
Morgan's projectiles and here we go

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.979 
Morgan's projectiles and here we go
picking<00:02:54.549> up<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.790> more<00:02:55.000> again<00:02:55.239> now<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.840> off

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
picking up on more again now this is off

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.660 
picking up on more again now this is off
her<00:02:56.200> throw<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:56.799> it's<00:02:57.010> gonna<00:02:57.100> be<00:02:57.190> fifty<00:02:57.459> percent

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
her throw so it's gonna be fifty percent

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.160 
her throw so it's gonna be fifty percent
damage<00:02:57.820> he's<00:02:58.090> gonna<00:02:58.209> have<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.510> do<00:02:58.630> either<00:02:59.049> a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
damage he's gonna have to do either a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.009 
damage he's gonna have to do either a
TAC<00:02:59.560> or<00:03:00.150> hopefully<00:03:01.150> gravity<00:03:01.570> squeeze<00:03:01.840> can

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
TAC or hopefully gravity squeeze can

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.610 
TAC or hopefully gravity squeeze can
finish<00:03:02.200> her<00:03:02.380> off<00:03:03.420> yeah<00:03:04.420> yeah<00:03:04.959> gravity<00:03:05.410> squeeze

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
finish her off yeah yeah gravity squeeze

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.590 
finish her off yeah yeah gravity squeeze
gonna<00:03:05.860> push<00:03:06.040> her<00:03:06.190> off<00:03:06.310> but<00:03:06.489> maybe<00:03:07.120> at<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.510> edge

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
gonna push her off but maybe at the edge

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.390 
gonna push her off but maybe at the edge

assist level 3 all right so do it here
some<00:03:26.350> really<00:03:26.620> well-constructed<00:03:27.100> team<00:03:27.640> here

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
some really well-constructed team here

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.820 
some really well-constructed team here
no<00:03:28.540> matter<00:03:28.660> what<00:03:28.930> order<00:03:29.140> he<00:03:29.290> has<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.710> it<00:03:29.800> just

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
no matter what order he has it it just

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.960 
no matter what order he has it it just
works<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.370> should<00:03:30.550> be<00:03:30.580> able<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.850> get

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
works and you should be able to get

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.160 
works and you should be able to get
another<00:03:31.240> smart<00:03:32.020> bomb<00:03:32.230> yeah<00:03:32.970> chases<00:03:33.970> him<00:03:34.120> down

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
another smart bomb yeah chases him down

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.390 
another smart bomb yeah chases him down
yep<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:35.470> if<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.650> had<00:03:35.710> to<00:03:35.890> use<00:03:36.010> these<00:03:36.130> drones

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
yep so if you had to use these drones

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.980 
yep so if you had to use these drones
assist<00:03:36.760> now<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:37.330> doesn't<00:03:37.540> get<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.750> free

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
assist now so it doesn't get the free

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.740 
assist now so it doesn't get the free
mix<00:03:38.230> up<00:03:38.410> like<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.710> do<00:03:39.090> cuz<00:03:40.090> repulsor<00:03:40.510> blast

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
mix up like you do cuz repulsor blast

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.180 
mix up like you do cuz repulsor blast
there's<00:03:40.960> no<00:03:41.110> get<00:03:41.290> away<00:03:41.380> from<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.740> on<00:03:41.860> tagging

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
there's no get away from it on tagging

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.560 
there's no get away from it on tagging
you<00:03:42.280> have<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.550> take<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.000> fall<00:03:43.270> into<00:03:43.480> the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
you have to take it and fall into the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.150 
you have to take it and fall into the
drones<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:46.570> I'm<00:03:46.630> thinking<00:03:46.950> there's<00:03:47.950> probably

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
drones so I'm thinking there's probably

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.980 
drones so I'm thinking there's probably
a<00:03:48.250> little<00:03:48.370> outgunned<00:03:48.850> right<00:03:49.060> now<00:03:49.180> ghostrobo

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
a little outgunned right now ghostrobo

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.650 
a little outgunned right now ghostrobo
that's<00:03:50.830> chris<00:03:51.220> g<00:03:51.490> like<00:03:51.850> I<00:03:51.970> said<00:03:52.240> he's<00:03:52.480> the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
this joker now Oh Christie is checking

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.560 
this joker now Oh Christie is checking
his<00:04:23.500> stick<00:04:23.830> except<00:04:24.820> i<00:04:24.940> don't<00:04:25.060> think<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.390> stick

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
his stick except i don't think the stick

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.180 
his stick except i don't think the stick
was<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.780> problem<00:04:25.990> like<00:04:26.169> when<00:04:26.350> joker<00:04:26.680> opened

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
was the problem like when joker opened

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.860 
was the problem like when joker opened
up<00:04:27.280> Morgan<00:04:27.669> it's<00:04:27.880> cuz<00:04:28.120> he<00:04:28.240> crossed<00:04:28.540> her<00:04:28.720> up

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
up Morgan it's cuz he crossed her up

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.570 
up Morgan it's cuz he crossed her up
right<00:04:29.110> away<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.650> flight<00:04:29.890> canceled<00:04:30.280> inputs

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
right away so the flight canceled inputs

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.800 
right away so the flight canceled inputs
probably<00:04:30.880> got<00:04:30.970> screwed<00:04:31.210> up<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:31.450> she<00:04:31.510> hung

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
probably got screwed up so she hung

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.180 
probably got screwed up so she hung
there<00:04:32.050> for<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.380> extra<00:04:32.560> second<00:04:32.919> that's<00:04:33.040> all

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
there for that extra second that's all

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.540 
there for that extra second that's all
the<00:04:33.280> time<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.520> needed<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.940> get<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.180> air<00:04:34.300> throw

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
the time I needed to get the air throw

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.800 
the time I needed to get the air throw
all<00:04:36.550> right<00:04:36.700> let's<00:04:36.880> see<00:04:37.000> what<00:04:37.030> Joker<00:04:37.450> do<00:04:37.600> let's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
see if he can finish this off he's

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.090 
see if he can finish this off he's
gotten<00:04:40.570> most<00:04:40.750> of<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.020> way<00:04:41.140> home<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:41.740> there

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
gotten most of the way home and there

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.980 
gotten most of the way home and there
you<00:04:42.190> go<00:04:42.220> there's<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.820> runaway<00:04:43.270> strategy<00:04:43.810> like

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
you go there's the runaway strategy like

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.960 
you go there's the runaway strategy like
I<00:04:44.020> said<00:04:44.230> don't<00:04:44.680> touch<00:04:44.890> buttons<00:04:45.370> go<00:04:45.610> up<00:04:45.790> there

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
I said don't touch buttons go up there

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.730 
I said don't touch buttons go up there
and<00:04:46.150> just<00:04:46.360> chill<00:04:46.630> wait<00:04:47.110> till<00:04:47.290> astro-vision

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
and just chill wait till astro-vision

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.710 
and just chill wait till astro-vision
runs<00:04:48.250> out<00:04:48.430> stop<00:04:48.700> eating<00:04:49.000> but<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.210> was<00:04:49.419> really

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720

nice big blast why is he hitting buttons
see<00:04:52.690> even<00:04:52.960> though<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.080> might<00:04:53.320> have<00:04:53.440> been<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.590> good

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
see even though I might have been a good

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.100 
see even though I might have been a good
time<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.520> get<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.910> you<00:04:55.360> know<00:04:55.450> em<00:04:55.690> disrupt<00:04:56.020> her

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
with the gun yeah it's like oh that

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.520 
with the gun yeah it's like oh that
setup<00:05:20.520> man<00:05:20.820> that's<00:05:21.060> so<00:05:21.270> hard<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.540> block<00:05:21.810> and

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
setup man that's so hard to block and

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.810 
setup man that's so hard to block and
you<00:05:22.680> know<00:05:22.770> what<00:05:22.919> the<00:05:23.010> best<00:05:23.160> thing<00:05:23.280> about<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.610> is

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
you know what the best thing about it is

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.940 
you know what the best thing about it is
probably<00:05:24.660> joker<00:05:25.260> can<00:05:25.410> do<00:05:25.530> it<00:05:25.620> at<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> specific

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
probably joker can do it at a specific

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.800 
probably joker can do it at a specific
timing<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.639> he<00:05:26.880> doesn't<00:05:27.090> know<00:05:27.330> which<00:05:27.510> way<00:05:27.570> to

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
timing that he doesn't know which way to

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.390 
timing that he doesn't know which way to
block<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.380> if<00:05:28.650> he<00:05:28.710> doesn't<00:05:29.040> know<00:05:29.220> which<00:05:29.340> way

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
block and if he doesn't know which way

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.400 
block and if he doesn't know which way
to<00:05:29.580> block<00:05:29.790> it's<00:05:30.060> impossible<00:05:30.660> for<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.050> know

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
to block it's impossible for you to know

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.040 
to block it's impossible for you to know
which<00:05:31.620> way<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.860> block<00:05:32.100> oh<00:05:32.810> that's<00:05:33.810> gonna<00:05:33.930> be

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
which way to block oh that's gonna be

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.570
