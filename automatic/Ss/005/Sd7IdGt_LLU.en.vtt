project could be done completely by hand

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.910 
project could be done completely by hand
the<00:00:57.180> x-carve<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> cool<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> try<00:00:58.710> out

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the x-carve was a cool thing to try out

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.729 
the x-carve was a cool thing to try out
to<00:00:59.160> do<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.989> cutting<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.109> unusual

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
to do this and cutting this unusual

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.789 
to do this and cutting this unusual
shape<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> did<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.320> took<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.559> piece<00:01:04.769> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
shape what I did was I took a piece of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.060 
shape what I did was I took a piece of
scrap<00:01:05.159> wood<00:01:06.140> put<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> piece<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
scrap wood put the piece on it and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
scrap wood put the piece on it and
traced<00:01:08.340> around<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
traced around it that way I have a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.880 
traced around it that way I have a
square<00:01:10.939> board<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.240> measure<00:01:12.450> off<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
square board to measure off of but I can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
square board to measure off of but I can
still<00:01:14.130> kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.490> how<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:14.970> layout<00:01:15.330> looks<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
still kind of see how my layout looks so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.660 
still kind of see how my layout looks so
you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.070> were<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.369> test

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you can see here these were my test

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.460 
you can see here these were my test
scarves<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.210> were<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> vicinity<00:01:19.229> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
scarves they were in the vicinity I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.050 
scarves they were in the vicinity I
wanted<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> actually<00:01:20.040> moved<00:01:20.369> over<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> nine<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
wanted to actually moved over the nine a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
wanted to actually moved over the nine a
little<00:01:21.420> bit<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.380> worked<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:22.830> well

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
little bit and it worked out really well

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.210 
little bit and it worked out really well
so<00:01:23.310> that's<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.240> did<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:25.159> now<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so that's what I did here now the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.190 
so that's what I did here now the
x-carve<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> great<00:01:27.030> tool<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.840> takes<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
x-carve is a great tool but it takes a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080 
x-carve is a great tool but it takes a
while<00:01:28.409> cutting<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.310> these<00:01:29.549> four<00:01:29.850> letters

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
while cutting just these four letters

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.649 
while cutting just these four letters
took<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.659> 20<00:01:31.079> or<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.009> minutes<00:01:32.299> which<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.329> kind

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
took like 20 or so minutes which is kind

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.640 
took like 20 or so minutes which is kind
of<00:01:33.720> nice<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.500> other

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of nice because then I can do other

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.080 
of nice because then I can do other
stuff<00:01:34.860> while<00:01:35.070> I'm<00:01:35.159> waiting<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.880> cut

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
stuff while I'm waiting for that to cut

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
stuff while I'm waiting for that to cut
so<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> let<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.049> cut<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.619> did<00:01:37.799> its<00:01:37.979> thing<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.579> I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so I let it cut it did its thing and I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
so I let it cut it did its thing and I
was<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.119> set<00:01:39.390> once<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> numbers<00:01:40.470> were<00:01:40.650> cut<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
was all set once the numbers were cut I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.870 
was all set once the numbers were cut I
wanted<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.670> fill<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.240> epoxy<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.880> so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
wanted to fill them with epoxy and so

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850 
wanted to fill them with epoxy and so
what<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> did<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.509> took<00:01:45.540> some<00:01:45.750> epoxy<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> mixed

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
what I did was I took some epoxy I mixed

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
what I did was I took some epoxy I mixed
it<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.369> actually<00:01:47.549> mix<00:01:47.939> some<00:01:48.240> mica

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it up and I actually mix some mica

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.319 
it up and I actually mix some mica
powder<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.770> used<00:01:49.920> when<00:01:50.430> I'm<00:01:50.520> casting<00:01:50.790> pen

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
powder that I used when I'm casting pen

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.870 
powder that I used when I'm casting pen
parts<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.560> mixed<00:01:52.860> some<00:01:52.890> mica<00:01:53.189> powder<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.610> use

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
parts and I mixed some mica powder I use

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.120 
parts and I mixed some mica powder I use
gold<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> letters<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.799> came<00:01:55.950> out

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
gold for the letters and it came out

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.730 
gold for the letters and it came out
looking<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:56.520> good<00:01:56.939> when<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> put<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> gold

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
looking really good when I put the gold

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
looking really good when I put the gold
in<00:01:58.950> there<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.340> looked<00:01:59.520> amazing<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.299> was

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
in there it looked amazing and it was

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.840 
in there it looked amazing and it was
bright<00:02:00.659> gold<00:02:00.990> once<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.710> sanded<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.640> got<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
bright gold once I sanded it it got a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.730 
bright gold once I sanded it it got a
little<00:02:03.030> dull<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.689> some<00:02:03.899> black<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
little dull with some black in it I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.630 
little dull with some black in it I
don't<00:02:05.189> know<00:02:05.369> why<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> happened<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.229> also

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
don't know why that happened but I also

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.270 
don't know why that happened but I also
because<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.789> book<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.739> slice<00:02:10.739> had<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.160> many

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
because this book this slice had so many

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.170 
because this book this slice had so many
cracks<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:11.970> from<00:02:12.209> drying

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
cracks in it from drying

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.740 
cracks in it from drying
I<00:02:13.239> decided<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.989> mix<00:02:14.140> up<00:02:14.379> this<00:02:14.530> copper<00:02:15.040> color

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
I decided to mix up this copper color

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.509 
I decided to mix up this copper color
epoxy<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.930> put<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.859> all<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.069> cracks<00:02:18.340> so

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
epoxy and put that in all the cracks so

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.580 
epoxy and put that in all the cracks so
I<00:02:18.549> just<00:02:18.819> kind<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.060> smeared<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.629> around<00:02:20.109> into

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
I just kind of smeared that around into

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.069 
I just kind of smeared that around into
all<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.859> cracks<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.340> as<00:02:22.299> it<00:02:22.450> turns<00:02:22.659> out<00:02:22.870> it

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
all the cracks and as it turns out it

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.360 
all the cracks and as it turns out it
was<00:02:23.170> kind<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.379> a<00:02:23.469> waste<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.739> time<00:02:23.920> because<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
was kind of a waste of time because the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.789 
was kind of a waste of time because the
cracks<00:02:24.670> are<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:25.030> small<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.780> can't<00:02:26.379> even<00:02:26.439> see

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
cracks are so small you can't even see

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.080 
cracks are so small you can't even see
the<00:02:27.010> lines<00:02:27.219> it<00:02:27.459> just<00:02:27.609> looks<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:27.849> a<00:02:27.879> little

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
the lines it just looks like a little

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.599 
the lines it just looks like a little
dark<00:02:28.359> line<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:29.079> it<00:02:29.859> didn't<00:02:30.040> really<00:02:30.129> add<00:02:30.340> any

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
dark line so it didn't really add any

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.369 
dark line so it didn't really add any
color<00:02:30.879> add<00:02:31.299> anything<00:02:31.629> to<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.139> I<00:02:32.260> probably

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
color add anything to it so I probably

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.199 
color add anything to it so I probably
won't<00:02:32.560> do<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.859> in<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> future<00:02:33.370> unless<00:02:33.909> it's

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
won't do that in the future unless it's

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.780 
won't do that in the future unless it's
a<00:02:34.269> pretty<00:02:34.540> big<00:02:34.840> crack<00:02:35.170> then<00:02:35.409> it<00:02:35.530> shows<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:35.799> on

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
a pretty big crack then it shows up on

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.240 
a pretty big crack then it shows up on
the<00:02:37.269> back<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.480> needed<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.019> relief<00:02:38.349> cut<00:02:38.680> out<00:02:38.859> for

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the back I needed the relief cut out for

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.569 
the back I needed the relief cut out for
the<00:02:40.500> clock<00:02:41.500> mechanism<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:42.219> could<00:02:42.370> have<00:02:42.459> done

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
the clock mechanism I could have done

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.490 
the clock mechanism I could have done
that<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.969> CNC<00:02:43.389> machine<00:02:43.689> but<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.349> would

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
that on the CNC machine but it would

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.020 
that on the CNC machine but it would
have<00:02:44.590> taken<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.859> long<00:02:45.010> time<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.549> it's<00:02:45.669> just<00:02:45.909> as

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
have taken a long time and it's just as

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.399 
have taken a long time and it's just as
easy<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.329> use<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.569> Forstner<00:02:46.959> bit<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.379> I

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
easy to use a Forstner bit and I

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.039 
easy to use a Forstner bit and I
hollowed<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.859> out<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.569> one<00:02:49.569> thing<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.900> would

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
hollowed it out and one thing I would

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.539 
hollowed it out and one thing I would
recommend<00:02:50.169> is<00:02:50.620> if<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:50.859> buy<00:02:51.040> these<00:02:51.099> clock

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
recommend is if you buy these clock

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.509 
recommend is if you buy these clock
mechanisms<00:02:52.239> make<00:02:52.780> sure<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.049> get<00:02:53.169> the<00:02:53.379> right

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
mechanisms make sure you get the right

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.979 
mechanisms make sure you get the right
length<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:55.060> shaft<00:02:55.329> in<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.840> goes

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
length of the shaft in it that goes

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.929 
length of the shaft in it that goes
through<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.439> material<00:02:56.919> I<00:02:57.069> happen<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.819> have

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
through the material I happen to have

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.729 
through the material I happen to have
this<00:02:58.150> pack<00:02:58.389> that<00:02:58.419> someone<00:02:58.989> gave<00:02:59.169> me<00:02:59.349> and<00:02:59.590> it

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
this pack that someone gave me and it

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.280 
this pack that someone gave me and it
was<00:02:59.859> short<00:03:00.250> ones<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.209> had<00:03:01.419> to<00:03:01.540> keep<00:03:01.719> drilling

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
was short ones so I had to keep drilling

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.050 
was short ones so I had to keep drilling
down<00:03:02.500> further<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.400> further<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.730> further<00:03:03.879> to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
down further and further and further to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.670 
down further and further and further to
get<00:03:04.299> this<00:03:04.480> thin<00:03:04.780> enough<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.319> actually

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
get this thin enough and it's actually

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.190 
get this thin enough and it's actually
only<00:03:05.889> like<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.280> quarter<00:03:06.969> of<00:03:07.150> an<00:03:07.209> inch<00:03:07.299> thick<00:03:07.689> to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
only like a quarter of an inch thick to

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.780 
only like a quarter of an inch thick to

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
and put the clock mechanism in it I

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.319 
and put the clock mechanism in it I
would<00:03:49.090> have<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:49.419> running<00:03:49.629> for<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.079> however<00:03:50.439> I
