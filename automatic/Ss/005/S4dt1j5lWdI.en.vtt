00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello as we have already seen in several others 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.210
 videos here on the channel the cdi is a mirror 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
 from selic 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 so if the selic is in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.519
 trajectory of fall 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 senai will also be on a trajectory of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.660
 drop whenever you are on the road 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.490
 the cd will accompany this 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.010
 movement as well as profitability 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 all investments linked to these 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 indicators 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 so it is important to know how 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.349
 choose the investment according to the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.539
 interest rate in our economy 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.410
 Let's talk a little about four types of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.640
 investment to understand this logic 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.840
 Let's talk a little about the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 savings 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.550
 savings does not change with respect to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.500
 to cdi 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.899
 so she will always continue 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.190
 yielding half a cent per year plus tr 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.710
 certain is if the target selic rate is in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.480
 less than 8 6 per cent per year 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.430
 then the savings have a lot 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.559
 change in profitability and yields 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.149
 70 percent of the selic but only happened 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.700
 once in a lifetime it 's 2 cblc exercises a 06 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 fixed income assets in general exist 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.189
 pre-fixed fixed income assets and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.510
 post-fixed for fixed-pres may 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.580
 be hired at a rate already 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.100
 defined as up to 10% per year 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.780
 even if the syringes and here in your hand 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.259
 it will maintain profitability 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.479
 already among the post-fixed assets 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.229
 known are those linked to the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.240
 cdi 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.390
 therefore when the investor closes a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.520
 cdb a bank it already knows that the rate that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.280
 will receive is relative to a percentage 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.950
 example, the investor goes to the bank 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.049
 and get a rate of 90 percent of the cdi 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.000
 this means that your cd displays 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.490
 10 c profitability in the next two 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.049
 months the investor will receive 90% say 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.210
 or 9% 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.090
 the Selic trajectory was 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.439
 and it will increase your income by 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.810
 over time with this mode of 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.509
 post-fixed application because the indicator 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.780
 will accompany this movement and is 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.640
 application in the case of funds is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.649
 which is another type of investment 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.810
 there are several types of 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.879
 investment more than 30 ratings 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.380
 I'm going to basically keep the funds. 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.110
 references of itÃ¡polis accompany 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.440
 their referenced funds are funds 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.480
 which must obligatorily apply 95% 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.910
 their assets in tied assets 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.380
 directly to its basic indicator that 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.240
 we call benchmarking 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.160
 therefore if the fund is a fund 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.010
 referenced then it should 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.020
 obligatorily have its capital 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.630
 applied in securities that vary from the same 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.390
 so that cti so funds 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.280
 referenced thereafter follow the same logic 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.850
 of fixed income assets tied to the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.740
 cdi and follow the variations you read in 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.950
 direct treasure let's talk only two 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.290
 the treasury bonds lft and the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.290
 prefixed treasury ltn 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.730
 the treasure lfts would accompany the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.320
 selic oscillation 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.750
 logo if the investor wishes to accompany the 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.240
 movement of selic can evaluate 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.820
 the possibility of investment is 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.280
 a similar effect to the cdi that the funds 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.290
 hence ltn are prefixed with pre-paid rates 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.670
 defined the hiring if the trajectory 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.430
 the Selic is low at the moment is is the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.800
 high then makes a propitious moment 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.840
 for you to buy a fixed bond is 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.880
 when the rate starts falling 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.830
 how to choose an investment of 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.930
 according to the movement of interest if the 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.890
 elites if it is in the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.110
 high 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.760
 you can opt for post investment 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.740
 attached to the cdi and wesselink 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.600
 such as fixed income fixed assets 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.650
 to cdi treasury bond funds 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.959
 selic 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.120
 This is quiet if the selic is in 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.040
 trajectory you can opt for 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.890
 pre investments secured by it will 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.230
 drop you catch your rate on the level 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.630
 established and so it would be that this is in 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.570
 fall and cpm will remain with your 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.209
 profitability locked up 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.360
 appropriate investments are the assets of 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.900
 Fixed income fixed 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.630
 issuance as cdbs 6l is that of 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.060
 issue a series of sneakers for this 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.709
 opportunity to set rates 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.470
 however here is a detail that needs 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.180
 be understood by the investor in 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.459
 change the strategy 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.609
 in fact the investor should not 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.740
 time to place all ligaments 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.659
 set elsewhere at all it can 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.310
 to fix the correct is to observe a 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:29.400
 global investment planning 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.280
 as I already said a lot without many videos 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.379
 here on the channel is always in accordance with 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.780
 all plans mega investor but let's go 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.699
 think also the following I will speak 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.870
 information here that reflects the 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.969
 nowadays 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.889
 while the product this video but 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:46.530
 you stay watchful eye on the board 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.840
 will be able to make its interpretation in 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.550
 any time even if you just 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.409
 watch this video here one or two years 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.620
 for example 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:58.219
 so let's go there today on the production date 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.240
 this video the target selic rate is in 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:02.159
 13.75 percent per year 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.400
 the market expectation according to the 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:08.639
 latest focus bulletin released on December 3 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.580
 July is that it rises to 14 6 until the 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.770
 end of 2015 so the 3 75 is still going 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.629
 upload until the end of 2015 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.789
 So in that logic that night that you 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.560
 think then I should prioritize the 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.000
 investments in post-fixed assets at 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.189
 answer is depends 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.259
 if you have a certain capital and 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.919
 may apply for two or three years for 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.719
 example 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.000
 it is advisable to evaluate non-interest 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.909
 today but expectation of movement 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.610
 interest in the coming years 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.830
 the interest increase goal now 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.650
 is essentially and essentially attached 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.419
 control of inflation so the objective is to 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.949
 interest rate increase is precisely 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.930
 to bring down inflation 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.240
 to the extent that inflation returns to 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.189
 normality right? 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.349
 it is natural for interest to fall again 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:54.289
 because high interest rates are less for 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:57.060
 economic activity and for jobs and 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.830
 so if at the moment the bank 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.300
 central working with this rate 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.800
 interest rate so high 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.439
 means that soon the results 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.189
 this measure will allow a reduction of 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.430
 interest 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:10.169
 so if you look at the same bulletin focus 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.479
 you will see that the market works with 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.479
 an interest expectation of 12 points 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.830
 25% per year to the end of the following year 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.020
 2016 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.210
 that is, interest rates can continue to rise 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.009
 now but next year should change to 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.770
 trajectory for the fall 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.360
 then the present moment can be attractive 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.750
 for the investment in pre- 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.529
 fixed for the horizon 23 years since 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.889
 hope that in a given moment 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:38.469
 guess kuyt then when to look at 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.229
 possibility of prefixing, please note that 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:43.299
 opportunities can be in a 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.149
 when the Selic rate begins to 

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:47.889
 but rather a little earlier because if the 

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:50.499
 market begins to work with the 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.049
 expectation of falling in the near future 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:54.999
 the actual rates offered by the 

00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:57.639
 fixed assets are already decreasing 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:59.709
 understood then this will happen 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.019
 of course in another very detail 

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:05.379
 important is that part of its capital 

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:07.179
 needs to remain postfixed 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.889
 because it is fundamental that it has liquidity 

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:11.379
 for emergencies 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.759
 then in those movements at that time 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.429
 You do not have to do it that way. 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:17.889
 and not with much of the 

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:20.589
 its capital, but with that part of 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.869
 your investment portfolio 

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:25.569
 in that game you will be 23 years old 

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:26.289
 there another very valuable tip is the 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:28.269
 Following 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:30.399
 usually the investor has a profile 

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:32.309
 of accumulator of assets or 

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.929
 maintains a frequency of monthly contributions 

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:35.919
 to further grow your 

00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:37.839
 patrimony 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.879
 depending on this you do not need 

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:41.679
 redeem investments to change the 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.049
 position of interest but only and 

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:46.509
 redirecting the new contributions that you 

00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:49.119
 you do so you eliminate costs 

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:51.489
 operational and tax obligations 

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:53.979
 It's a smart way you and 

00:07:51.489 --> 00:07:55.599
 fixing I can fixing a money that 

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:58.719
 goes cruising monthly 

00:07:55.599 --> 00:08:02.159
 I hope you, yes, a big hug and 

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:02.159
 until the next video such
