00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.910
 there is beauty here who is speaking 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.259
 you already know 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.910
 joining the description of the video is not e 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.270
 show you 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.300
 the street fighter panel that I 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.279
 and I bought a lot of people asked me is with 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.369
 these functions of him what happens is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.189
 easy to install or is not is not 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 Fascist, I did not have to send the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.879
 mechanical because he had to wire 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.850
 panel wire is not 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.399
 arrived to take the same clear had his 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 profile for him makes it clear already knew or not 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:56.690
 I knew a lot but at last it works 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 so it just shows the gasoline shows 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:08.299
 mileage is the hour the gears are shown 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.299
 It is the first second and third 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:18.479
 he shows the blinkers in the high 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.960
 it shows gasoline and water only eats 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.439
 also magnified in a monster 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.930
 there are the functions of travel here 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.090
 while you can read here also the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.220
 mileage you 've made 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.619
 the maximum speed you've done during 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.020
 the course to do there is also this number 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.930
 only problem I saw in it the shift 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.610
 light that we can not just yet 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.840
 will count in 10 thousand 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:55.409
 I could not lower it to 789. 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:58.140
 only 10 is that you can configure one of the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.149
 two buttons together are configured to 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.740
 mileage wheel circumference 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.629
 of the bitch in miles or kilometers 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.319
 here it was called a two or 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.319
 four cylinders 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.590
 I do not know who else helped in the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.880
 time to set the speed and if pn 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.150
 up here 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:29.010
 I also do not know what I want, I do not 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:36.380
 Minimal idea, this is it, people liked it. 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.380
 Because on my bike for you, that's it. 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.240
 This is it, do not worry 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:33.060
 It's raining late today, I do not know. 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.310
 I will not record a lap but soon after 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.390
