00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
makes sense I'm gonna make things a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.760 
makes sense I'm gonna make things a
little<00:01:06.119> bit<00:01:06.330> easier<00:01:06.630> cross-platform<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
little bit easier cross-platform the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.490 
little bit easier cross-platform the
other<00:01:07.860> thing<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.070> well<00:01:08.220> we've<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
other thing as well we've got a a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.230 
other thing as well we've got a a
application<00:01:10.500> called<00:01:10.740> continuum<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
application called continuum so

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.399 
application called continuum so
continuum<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> piece<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> piece<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
continuum is a piece of a piece of

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
continuum is a piece of a piece of
software<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.010> allows<00:01:14.189> Windows<00:01:14.820> 10<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.210> know

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
software that allows Windows 10 to know

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.260 
software that allows Windows 10 to know
what<00:01:15.900> device<00:01:16.290> you're<00:01:16.560> using<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.119> for

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
what device you're using it on so for

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.429 
what device you're using it on so for
example<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:18.840> using<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.140> two<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.380> one

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
example if I'm using a two and one

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.630 
example if I'm using a two and one
assume<00:01:19.710> they're<00:01:19.830> shown<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> few<00:01:20.280> minutes<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
assume they're shown a few minutes of

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.570 
assume they're shown a few minutes of
you<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.060> take<00:01:21.570> off<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> keyboard<00:01:22.580> continuum

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you I take off the keyboard continuum

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.460 
you I take off the keyboard continuum
knows<00:01:23.820> I've<00:01:24.119> removed<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> keyboard<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.990> asks

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
knows I've removed the keyboard and asks

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620 
knows I've removed the keyboard and asks
me<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.250> turn<00:01:26.460> my<00:01:26.670> screen<00:01:27.240> into<00:01:27.600> a

me do we want to turn my screen into a
tablet<00:01:28.080> mode<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> hit<00:01:29.220> yes<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.850> goes<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
tablet mode so if I hit yes it goes to a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.660 
tablet mode so if I hit yes it goes to a
large<00:01:30.450> screen<00:01:30.780> large<00:01:31.170> icons<00:01:31.619> very<00:01:32.340> very<00:01:32.520> terse

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.660 
large screen large icons very very terse
centric<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.750> easy<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.079> use<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.670> continuum

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
centric very easy to use and continuum

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
centric very easy to use and continuum
is<00:01:35.729> also<00:01:36.119> enough<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.450> allows<00:01:36.600> me<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.900> know

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is also enough that allows me to know

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.800 
is also enough that allows me to know
what<00:01:37.530> size<00:01:38.159> screen<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:39.030> viewing<00:01:39.630> documents

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
what size screen I'm viewing documents

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.350 
what size screen I'm viewing documents
on<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> create<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.890> word<00:01:41.100> document<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.850> my

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
on so if I create a word document on my

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
on so if I create a word document on my
PC<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:43.950> at<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.130> my<00:01:44.220> phone

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
PC and I want to look at on my phone

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.620 
PC and I want to look at on my phone
rather<00:01:44.850> than<00:01:45.000> getting<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.270> watered-down

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
rather than getting a watered-down

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.420 
rather than getting a watered-down
version<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.320> phone<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.009> does<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
version on my phone what it does is it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.940 
version on my phone what it does is it
just<00:01:47.460> reduces<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> size<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.869> window<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
just reduces the size of the window to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
just reduces the size of the window to
fit<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> screen<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:50.640> looking<00:01:50.670> at<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
fit the screen I'm looking at it on so I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.660 
fit the screen I'm looking at it on so I
see<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> same<00:01:52.229> experience<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
see the same experience but just on a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.249 
see the same experience but just on a
smaller<00:01:54.000> screen<00:01:54.299> continuum<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.960> also

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
smaller screen continuum is also

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
smaller screen continuum is also
integrated<00:01:55.710> across<00:01:55.829> our<00:01:56.070> platform<00:01:56.490> story<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
integrated across our platform story so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.310 
integrated across our platform story so
as<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.210> said<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> knows<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.899> device<00:01:58.140> were

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
as I said it knows what device were

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.719 
as I said it knows what device were
looking<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.740> continuum<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.189> also<00:01:59.460> involved

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
looking at so continuum is also involved

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.209 
looking at so continuum is also involved
in<00:02:00.000> our<00:02:00.509> applications<00:02:01.290> working<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.680> Xbox<00:02:02.040> as

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219

so<00:02:25.340> you're<00:02:25.489> talking<00:02:25.610> about<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:26.060> phone<00:02:26.420> app<00:02:26.630> that

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
so you're talking about a phone app that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.020 
so you're talking about a phone app that
will<00:02:26.900> replicate<00:02:27.110> down<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> tablet<00:02:28.130> PC<00:02:28.850> and

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
will replicate down to a tablet PC and

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.330 
will replicate down to a tablet PC and
on<00:02:29.270> Xbox<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:29.870> well<00:02:30.020> it's<00:02:30.500> very<00:02:30.590> easy<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.100> read

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
on Xbox as well it's very easy to read

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.800 
on Xbox as well it's very easy to read
and<00:02:31.520> create<00:02:31.670> encoding<00:02:32.090> for<00:02:32.270> lots<00:02:32.660> of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
and create encoding for lots of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.600 
and create encoding for lots of
different<00:02:32.870> maps<00:02:33.410> they'll<00:02:34.160> be<00:02:34.280> able<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.459> create

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
different maps they'll be able to create

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.000 
different maps they'll be able to create
one<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.660> will<00:02:35.780> work<00:02:35.810> seamlessly<00:02:36.380> across<00:02:36.620> all

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
one that will work seamlessly across all

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.680 
one that will work seamlessly across all
of<00:02:37.100> our<00:02:37.190> voices<00:02:37.489> if<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:37.970> swipe<00:02:38.209> in<00:02:38.390> from<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
of our voices if I swipe in from the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.320 
of our voices if I swipe in from the
left<00:02:38.870> hand<00:02:39.620> side<00:02:39.769> so<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:39.950> do<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.430> what<00:02:41.300> I

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
left hand side so just do this what I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.790 
left hand side so just do this what I
get<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.599> list<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.989> all<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.380> apps<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.650> I've

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
get is a list of all the apps that I've

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.280 
get is a list of all the apps that I've
got<00:02:42.950> open<00:02:43.069> currently<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.630> what<00:02:44.840> we've<00:02:44.959> had<00:02:45.140> for

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
got open currently so what we've had for

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.600 
got open currently so what we've had for
what<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.440> mentioned<00:02:45.800> we<00:02:45.860> have<00:02:45.980> had<00:02:46.069> snap<00:02:46.370> for

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
what I mentioned we have had snap for

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.280 
what I mentioned we have had snap for
quite<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.819> while<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.630> open<00:02:47.870> up<00:02:47.930> one<00:02:48.019> day

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
quite a while so I just open up one day

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.380 
quite a while so I just open up one day
icons<00:02:48.739> there<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.160> would've<00:02:49.970> been<00:02:50.060> able<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.209> snap

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
icons there I would've been able to snap

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.699 
icons there I would've been able to snap
to<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.569> right<00:02:50.690> hand<00:02:50.840> side<00:02:51.019> but<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.319> would<00:02:51.560> have

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
to the right hand side but I would have

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.590 
to the right hand side but I would have
had<00:02:52.250> before<00:02:52.400> was<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> black<00:02:52.910> screen<00:02:53.090> beside<00:02:53.330> it

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
had before was a black screen beside it

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.180 
had before was a black screen beside it
but<00:02:53.720> now<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.870> get<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.230> abscissa<00:02:54.769> called<00:02:54.980> snap

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
but now I get the abscissa called snap

device you're currently using for

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.430 
device you're currently using for
compatibility<00:06:19.449> and<00:06:20.449> let<00:06:20.599> you<00:06:20.719> know<00:06:20.870> if<00:06:20.900> you're

capable of getting the upgrade Windows

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.149 
capable of getting the upgrade Windows
10<00:06:23.900> as<00:06:24.169> a<00:06:24.199> program<00:06:24.800> is<00:06:25.009> smaller<00:06:25.819> than<00:06:26.719> 8<00:06:27.199> and<00:06:27.529> 7

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
10 as a program is smaller than 8 and 7

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:29.889 
10 as a program is smaller than 8 and 7
so<00:06:28.940> what<00:06:29.089> we<00:06:29.209> like<00:06:29.300> to<00:06:29.389> do<00:06:29.509> when<00:06:29.599> you're<00:06:29.630> great

so what we like to do when you're great

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:32.529 
so what we like to do when you're great
it<00:06:29.990> will<00:06:30.080> actually<00:06:30.759> free<00:06:31.759> up<00:06:31.909> some<00:06:32.089> extra

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
it will actually free up some extra

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:33.490 
it will actually free up some extra
space<00:06:32.719> in<00:06:32.930> your<00:06:32.990> devices

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
space in your devices

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.530 
space in your devices
exercise<00:06:34.040> is<00:06:34.280> quite<00:06:34.430> small<00:06:34.700> compared<00:06:35.090> to<00:06:35.150> the

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
exercise is quite small compared to the

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.050 
exercise is quite small compared to the
operating<00:06:35.810> systems<00:06:36.110> of<00:06:36.200> a<00:06:36.260> 87<00:06:36.860> said<00:06:37.040> what<00:06:37.970> you

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
operating systems of a 87 said what you

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.370 
operating systems of a 87 said what you
get<00:06:38.240> with<00:06:38.360> that<00:06:38.390> is<00:06:38.630> a<00:06:38.840> better<00:06:39.080> battery<00:06:39.260> life

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
get with that is a better battery life

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.200 
get with that is a better battery life
as<00:06:39.620> well<00:06:39.770> so<00:06:40.100> make<00:06:40.520> your<00:06:40.640> battery<00:06:40.820> life<00:06:40.970> better

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
and what actually frames of space on the

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.960 
and what actually frames of space on the
device<00:06:42.740> because<00:06:43.220> the<00:06:43.250> onus<00:06:43.490> it's<00:06:43.610> a<00:06:43.670> really

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
device because the onus it's a really
