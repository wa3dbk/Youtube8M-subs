00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.240
 hello guys in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.580
 teach how to make a headband braid 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.389
 let's start by dividing the hair by 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.749
 half then you are going to make a division 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.120
 from that half to the ear and divide 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:19.060
 that part 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.070
 rigol apart and the same from the other side 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:28.800
 from the middle to the ear 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 and then you put it back again with the other 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.660
 you pick up the hair from behind in a 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.040
 tail or in a clamp or something so that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.070
 I get in your way and you start brushing everything 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.680
 the hair for one side and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.980
 you make sure they do not have any knots 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.040
 knot a knot nothing you hold a small 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.960
 section next to your ear and the 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.570
 divide into 3 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.270
 then you pass the section that is on the side 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.540
 your face down in the middle and 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.250
 then the other one below in the middle one 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.300
 as the French star is grabbing 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.110
 hair down and on the other side that 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.110
 It's not in your face, you do not grab hair 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 now let's touch your hair 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.830
 you go down and the other side does not 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.159
 you grab hair, you just pass it by 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.120
 down 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.720
 put the ring down below 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.400
 and so on all over the head 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.730
 this braid not recommend that you do 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.210
 so tight because it seems to me 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.150
 nice to be seen as well as as a 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.510
 little volume in that part of the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.510
 hair 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.000
 we follow below down below and 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.000
 under 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.050
 is tense with the practice you're going to 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.810
 be much more better better better not 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.600
 manches I can not believe I said 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.800
 that ok to holy day 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.530
 you're still braiding and you're safe with a 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.050
 pin and then you tie it back 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.630
 you like to tie fabric back and so 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.280
 I hope you liked it and forgive me 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.280
 forgive me for saying more better
