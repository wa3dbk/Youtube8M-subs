 so let's go 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.930
 this door also gives a breeding ground for 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.750

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.150
 wait he was able to install but discuss 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.150
 a little bit with him

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.660
 that it's a boy that you come I'm 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.420
 sometimes designer stops and I announce 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.069
 a little more each time I come 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.820
 what a beautiful city is so 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.840
 warm 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.920
 yes that's it I'm discovering this 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.120
 morning witness the scene the woman the 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.120
 Saint-Louis will crumble 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.450
 is that it's great it's a lot 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.800
 does that look like a little theater 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.640
 giving these sites need with the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.640
 skies numbers it's cool it's cozy 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.209
 what do you still want two 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.010
 tests but it is in the continuity of 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.010
 first was absent at his bar 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.690
 sick body arles is abnormal add 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.010
 first song that I had written all 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.650
 at the section motor are in the good 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.850
 new but I wrote a lot and I 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.560
 think it's very focused on 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.299
 paradoxes the meaning of functioning 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.769
 it is really for this purpose that 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:29.880
 I wrote the album that made traveling 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:34.890
 very young people start at 83 years old already 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:39.410
 apologize to me 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.410
 j as the fall is also very young 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.510
 and a grid the inspiration comes 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.630
 to bring me when I was 18 years old I 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.620
 met a composer the sand like 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.000
 what they got me this conversation 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.530
 he told me and it's today 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.830
 launch the best brutality but 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.860
 never gave her ex husband told me this is 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.140
 simple for us that people listen to it 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.489
 people by tribes argue with 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.500
 people you do not know back 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.019
 and you can still in this world people 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.220
 and it opens your mind that sandrine all 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:22.380
 some people do not talk to 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:23.580
 others from the lives of others I think that 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:42.680
 you learn things by talking to 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:42.680

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:51.660
