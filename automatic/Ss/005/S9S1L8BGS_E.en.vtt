00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
episode 3 of my redstone tutorials and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.080 
episode 3 of my redstone tutorials and
today<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.650> covering

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
today we are going to be covering

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.080 
today we are going to be covering
redstone<00:00:24.090> clocks<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.720> vertical<00:00:25.349> circuitry

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
redstone clocks and vertical circuitry

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.600 
redstone clocks and vertical circuitry
alright<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.330> getting<00:00:28.080> started<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.400> are

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
alright so getting started when you are

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.150 
alright so getting started when you are
moving<00:00:30.270> redstone<00:00:31.170> from<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.770> level<00:00:31.980> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
moving redstone from one level to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.200 
moving redstone from one level to
another<00:00:32.460> level<00:00:33.290> a<00:00:34.290> lot<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> people<00:00:35.129> do<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.000> in

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
another level a lot of people do it in

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.990 
another level a lot of people do it in
this<00:00:36.900> style<00:00:37.170> set<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.730> block

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this style set up we just have one block

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
this style set up we just have one block
leading<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> nags<00:00:39.809> leading<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> next

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
leading to the nags leading to the next

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.350 
leading to the nags leading to the next
and<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> until<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.180> where<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and so on until you get to where you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.720 
and so on until you get to where you
need<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.250> obviously<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.460> works

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
need to go and obviously this works

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.640 
need to go and obviously this works
because<00:00:45.000> well<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.110> red<00:00:46.260> stone<00:00:46.440> isn't

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
because well the red stone isn't

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.910 
because well the red stone isn't
obstructed<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:48.150> that<00:00:48.720> is<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.530> very

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
obstructed but that is not a very

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.939 
obstructed but that is not a very
efficient<00:00:50.370> way<00:00:50.400> of<00:00:50.820> doing<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:54.650> alright<00:00:55.650> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
efficient way of doing so alright so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.329 
efficient way of doing so alright so
this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.210> way<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> sending<00:00:58.350> redstone

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
this is one way of sending redstone

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.110 
this is one way of sending redstone
upwards<00:01:01.460> basically<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.970> you<00:01:03.089> have

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
upwards basically all you do is you have

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.390 
upwards basically all you do is you have
a<00:01:03.269> block<00:01:03.839> with<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.500> redstone<00:01:04.890> torch<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
a block with at redstone torch on the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.550 
a block with at redstone torch on the
side<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.450> plates<00:01:06.750> blocks<00:01:07.290> on

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
side of it and then you plates blocks on

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.410 
side of it and then you plates blocks on
top<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.340> redstone<00:01:08.670> torches<00:01:09.030> placed

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
top of it with redstone torches placed

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.570 
top of it with redstone torches placed
on<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> top<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> block<00:01:11.180> just<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.420> so

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
on the top of the block just like so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.630 
on the top of the block just like so
until<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.060> where<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.299> need<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:16.640> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
until you get to where you need to be so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.359 
until you get to where you need to be so
now<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.060> flip<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> switch<00:01:18.859> you<00:01:19.859> can<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
now if I flip the switch you can see the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.270 
now if I flip the switch you can see the
when<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> power<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.960> Redstone<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
when I power the Redstone in here it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.490 
when I power the Redstone in here it
charges<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.359> block<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:24.990> turns<00:01:25.289> this

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
charges the block which turns this

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.349 
charges the block which turns this
redstone<00:01:25.859> off<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.520> allows<00:01:26.759> us<00:01:26.969> to<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.210> on

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
redstone off which allows us to be on

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.039 
redstone off which allows us to be on
off<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:28.259> off<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.880> all<00:01:29.880> right<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.359> then<00:01:30.509> when

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
off on off on all right so then when

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.929 
off on off on all right so then when
turn<00:01:31.229> back<00:01:31.409> off<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> see<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> torch<00:01:32.759> come

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
turn back off you can see the torch come

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.569 
turn back off you can see the torch come
on<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.420> every<00:01:33.840> single<00:01:34.020> torch<00:01:34.469> switches<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
on and every single torch switches and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.469 
on and every single torch switches and
this<00:01:36.270> one's<00:01:36.450> off<00:01:38.030> alright<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.329> works

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
this one's off alright so that works

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
this one's off alright so that works
really<00:01:39.570> good<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
really good and then as you see here it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.399 
really good and then as you see here it
will<00:01:42.149> open<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> door<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.020> flip<00:01:43.259> this

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
will open the door when I flip this

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.139 
will open the door when I flip this
switch<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.679> more<00:01:46.890> condensed<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.579> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
switch just a more condensed way of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.520 
switch just a more condensed way of
sending<00:01:48.950> redstone<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.219> a<00:01:50.399> upward<00:01:50.789> fashion

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
sending redstone in a upward fashion

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.760 
sending redstone in a upward fashion
compared<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.100> bowl<00:01:53.369> p<00:01:53.520> design<00:01:54.140> now<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
compared to this bowl p design now you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
compared to this bowl p design now you
may<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:55.950> thinking<00:01:56.100> ok<00:01:56.789> that's<00:01:56.999> great<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.450> it's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
may be thinking ok that's great but it's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.849 
may be thinking ok that's great but it's
definitely<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.319> be<00:01:58.409> able<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.649> send

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
definitely not going to be able to send

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.370 
definitely not going to be able to send
it<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.299> alright<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.539> then<00:02:00.689> that's<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.200> this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it down alright so then that's what this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.830 
it down alright so then that's what this
contraptions<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.219> basically<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> way<00:02:03.719> it's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
contraptions for basically the way it's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.709 
contraptions for basically the way it's
set<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.340> when<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.759> receives<00:02:06.329> current

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
set up is when this receives current

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.859 
set up is when this receives current
then<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.069> torches<00:02:08.550> off<00:02:08.759> which<00:02:09.390> allows<00:02:09.690> this

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
then this torches off which allows this

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.050 
then this torches off which allows this
for<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.530> off<00:02:10.649> which<00:02:11.520> lets<00:02:11.819> this

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
for it's going to be off which lets this

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.200 
for it's going to be off which lets this
torch<00:02:12.270> beyond<00:02:13.370> which<00:02:14.370> powers<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.880> redstone

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
torch beyond which powers this redstone

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.670 
torch beyond which powers this redstone
off<00:02:15.569> off<00:02:16.490> on<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:18.180> off<00:02:18.780> off<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:21.060> off<00:02:21.560> then<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
off off on on off off on on off then the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.920 
off off on on off off on on off then the
door<00:02:22.830> shuts

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
door shuts

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.130 
door shuts
so<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.980> turn<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.510> power<00:02:28.170> off<00:02:30.140> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
so then if we turn the power off the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.070 
so then if we turn the power off the
door<00:02:31.740> opens<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:32.970> heard<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.390> Thunder

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
door opens and if you heard that Thunder

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.660 
door opens and if you heard that Thunder
right<00:02:34.200> there<00:02:34.440> there's<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.160> pretty<00:02:35.340> bad<00:02:35.520> storm

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
right there there's a pretty bad storm

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.980 
right there there's a pretty bad storm
going<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.590> my<00:02:37.590> area<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.810> basically

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
going on my area so this is basically

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.100 
going on my area so this is basically
just<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.620> way<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:41.970> send<00:02:42.600> redstone

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
just a way that you can send redstone

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.740 
just a way that you can send redstone
downward<00:02:43.770> in<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.460> very<00:02:44.700> condensed<00:02:45.090> fashion<00:02:45.570> you

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
downward in a very condensed fashion you

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.380 
downward in a very condensed fashion you
see<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.050> just<00:02:46.290> takes<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:46.740> block<00:02:47.390> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
see this just takes up one block and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.190 
see this just takes up one block and
with<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.430> three<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:51.950> length<00:02:53.570> with<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
with and three in length with the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.590 
with and three in length with the
exclusion<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.890> whatever<00:02:56.520> input<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.270> output

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
exclusion of whatever input and output

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.980 
exclusion of whatever input and output
that<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.840> want<00:02:58.940> alright<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.120> moving<00:03:00.570> one<00:03:00.870> two

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
that you want alright so moving one two

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.400 
that you want alright so moving one two
clocks<00:03:01.230> what<00:03:02.070> if<00:03:02.160> life<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.630> allows<00:03:03.990> the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
clocks what if life is is it allows the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.280 
clocks what if life is is it allows the
redstone<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.280> pulse<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.930> way<00:03:08.510> lake<00:03:09.510> okay<00:03:10.230> so

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
redstone to pulse in a way lake okay so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.980 
redstone to pulse in a way lake okay so
then<00:03:10.610> let<00:03:11.610> me<00:03:11.670> show<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.880> how<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.000> works<00:03:12.300> this

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
then let me show you how this works this

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.900 
then let me show you how this works this
redstone<00:03:13.290> torch<00:03:13.650> powers<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.550> redstone

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
redstone torch powers this redstone

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.560 
redstone torch powers this redstone
which<00:03:15.900> turns<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.370> block<00:03:17.640> into<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.970> charged<00:03:18.330> a

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
which turns this block into a charged a

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.170 
which turns this block into a charged a
wedge<00:03:19.110> terms<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.650> torch<00:03:19.920> off<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.820> if<00:03:20.940> this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
wedge terms this torch off and if this

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.690 
wedge terms this torch off and if this
redstone<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.690> off<00:03:22.050> which<00:03:22.740> allows<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.280> for<00:03:23.550> to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
redstone is off which allows this for to

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.030 
redstone is off which allows this for to
be<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:23.960> then<00:03:24.960> this<00:03:25.170> redstone<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.590> powered<00:03:26.010> by

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
be on then this redstone is powered by

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.420 
be on then this redstone is powered by
the<00:03:26.160> torch<00:03:26.520> which<00:03:27.030> turns<00:03:27.330> this<00:03:27.660> torch<00:03:27.960> off<00:03:28.430> and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
the torch which turns this torch off and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.110 
the torch which turns this torch off and
off<00:03:29.750> on<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.260> then<00:03:32.040> once<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.760> place<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
off on and then once I place the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.930 
off on and then once I place the
redstone<00:03:33.420> here<00:03:34.070> it'll<00:03:35.070> turn<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.580> redstone

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
redstone here it'll turn this redstone

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.250 
redstone here it'll turn this redstone
into<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.870> which<00:03:37.740> turns<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.280> torch<00:03:38.550> off<00:03:38.760> on

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
into on which turns this torch off on

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.350 
into on which turns this torch off on
off<00:03:40.260> on<00:03:41.030> off<00:03:42.710> but<00:03:43.710> its<00:03:43.830> own<00:03:43.980> right<00:03:44.130> now<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:45.210> then

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
off on off but its own right now so then

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.800 
off on off but its own right now so then
it<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.780> continually<00:03:46.610> flashes<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.940> way<00:03:48.090> so

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
it just continually flashes in a way so

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.510 
it just continually flashes in a way so
that<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.170> Redstone<00:03:49.560> pulses<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.130> let<00:03:50.220> me<00:03:50.340> show

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
that the Redstone pulses so let me show

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:58.280 
that the Redstone pulses so let me show
you<00:03:50.550> out<00:03:50.700> networks<00:03:56.720> okay<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:57.960> if<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.140> need

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
you out networks okay so if you need

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.190 
you out networks okay so if you need
something<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.740> happen<00:03:59.060> continually<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.900> on

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
something to happen continually in a on

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.450 
something to happen continually in a on
off<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:02.520> repeat<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.800> one<00:04:05.100> way<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.280> you

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
off like repeat this is one way that you

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.030 
off like repeat this is one way that you
can<00:04:05.520> do<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.940> you're<00:04:06.660> set<00:04:06.960> up<00:04:06.990> five<00:04:07.440> inverters

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
can do it you're set up five inverters

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.010 
can do it you're set up five inverters
doesn't<00:04:08.700> have<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:09.000> be<00:04:09.090> five<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.570> just<00:04:09.750> has<00:04:09.900> to

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
doesn't have to be five it just has to

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.720 
doesn't have to be five it just has to
be<00:04:10.050> an<00:04:10.200> odd<00:04:10.380> number<00:04:10.710> greater<00:04:11.130> than<00:04:11.340> three

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
be an odd number greater than three

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.020 
be an odd number greater than three
because<00:04:12.600> if<00:04:12.750> it's<00:04:12.930> three<00:04:13.260> then<00:04:13.740> the<00:04:14.610> redstone

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
because if it's three then the redstone

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.080 
because if it's three then the redstone
can't<00:04:15.840> handle<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.410> um<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:17.549> really<00:04:17.609> sure<00:04:17.880> why<00:04:18.030> I

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
can't handle it um not really sure why I

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.599 
can't handle it um not really sure why I
believe<00:04:18.480> it's<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.720> like<00:04:19.170> bug<00:04:19.440> but<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.220> redstone

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
believe it's a like bug but the redstone

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.460 
believe it's a like bug but the redstone
burns<00:04:20.910> out<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.420> it<00:04:22.410> stops<00:04:22.740> pulsating<00:04:24.470> but

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
burns out and it stops pulsating but

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.890 
burns out and it stops pulsating but
then<00:04:25.650> with<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.280> addition<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.790> Peters<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.690> can

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
then with the addition of Peters you can

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.170 
then with the addition of Peters you can
make<00:04:28.580> clocks<00:04:30.020> completely<00:04:31.020> more<00:04:31.350> condensed<00:04:32.180> as

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
make clocks completely more condensed as

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.570 
make clocks completely more condensed as
you<00:04:33.330> see<00:04:33.510> this<00:04:33.690> takes<00:04:33.930> up<00:04:34.110> quite<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.650> large<00:04:35.100> area

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
you see this takes up quite a large area

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.060 
you see this takes up quite a large area
and<00:04:35.820> this<00:04:36.630> is

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
and this is

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.800 
and this is
basically<00:04:38.070> what<00:04:38.190> happens<00:04:38.580> is<00:04:38.759> when<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.240> put

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
basically what happens is when you put

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.340 
basically what happens is when you put
in<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.199> single<00:04:40.560> input<00:04:41.389> like<00:04:42.389> via<00:04:42.630> button<00:04:43.080> or

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
in a single input like via button or

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.189 
in a single input like via button or
pressure<00:04:43.740> plate<00:04:44.240> powers<00:04:45.240> this<00:04:45.389> redstone<00:04:45.720> goes

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
pressure plate powers this redstone goes

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.230 
pressure plate powers this redstone goes
into<00:04:46.500> their<00:04:46.620> theater<00:04:46.949> hours<00:04:47.699> this<00:04:47.880> redstone

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
into their theater hours this redstone

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.090 
into their theater hours this redstone
in<00:04:48.600> this<00:04:48.720> redstone<00:04:49.020> which<00:04:49.380> turns<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.830> door

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
in this redstone which turns the door

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.909 
in this redstone which turns the door
into<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.669> one<00:04:51.300> state<00:04:51.539> that's<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.590> office

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
into the one state that's the office

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.689 
into the one state that's the office
eight<00:04:53.690> facing<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:54.810> way<00:04:54.979> and<00:04:55.979> then<00:04:56.190> it<00:04:56.520> goes

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
eight facing this way and then it goes

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.189 
eight facing this way and then it goes
into<00:04:56.759> this<00:04:57.060> repeater<00:04:57.419> on<00:04:57.770> own<00:04:59.300> but<00:05:00.300> with

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
into this repeater on own but with

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.620 
into this repeater on own but with
repeaters<00:05:01.830> they<00:05:02.280> needs<00:05:02.970> charged<00:05:03.240> after<00:05:03.479> a

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
repeaters they needs charged after a

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.710 
repeaters they needs charged after a
while<00:05:03.810> so<00:05:04.500> then<00:05:04.650> there's<00:05:04.830> an<00:05:04.919> off<00:05:05.039> as<00:05:05.340> well<00:05:05.720> let

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
while so then there's an off as well let

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:15.050 
while so then there's an off as well let
me<00:05:06.810> show<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:14.070> then<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.639> turn<00:05:14.849> it<00:05:14.970> off

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
me show you this and then to turn it off

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.930 
me show you this and then to turn it off
just<00:05:15.270> break<00:05:15.539> some<00:05:15.690> redstone<00:05:16.699> have<00:05:17.699> the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
just break some redstone have the

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.560 
just break some redstone have the
advantages<00:05:18.419> of<00:05:18.479> this<00:05:18.780> again<00:05:19.410> for<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.570> this

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
advantages of this again for the this

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.150 
advantages of this again for the this
size<00:05:21.810> where<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.380> doesn't<00:05:22.530> take<00:05:22.770> up<00:05:22.800> very<00:05:23.039> much

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
size where it doesn't take up very much

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.600 
size where it doesn't take up very much
space<00:05:24.560> but<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:26.370> major<00:05:26.550> downfall<00:05:27.150> of<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.389> is

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
space but the major downfall of this is

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.439 
space but the major downfall of this is
if<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.789> don't<00:05:29.820> have<00:05:30.060> a<00:05:30.120> timed<00:05:30.419> just<00:05:30.750> right<00:05:31.139> um

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
if you don't have a timed just right um

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.240 
if you don't have a timed just right um
occasionally<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.960> entire<00:05:34.259> circo<00:05:34.889> will

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
occasionally the entire circo will

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.480 
occasionally the entire circo will
become<00:05:35.820> charged<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.650> will<00:05:37.770> only<00:05:38.039> apply<00:05:38.400> a

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
become charged and it will only apply a

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.610 
become charged and it will only apply a
constant<00:05:38.759> stream<00:05:39.300> of<00:05:39.479> circuit<00:05:39.870> or<00:05:40.139> about<00:05:40.560> a

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
constant stream of circuit or about a

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.540 
constant stream of circuit or about a
current<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.150> outsourced<00:05:42.960> so<00:05:43.919> you<00:05:44.400> might

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
current to the outsourced so you might

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.800 
current to the outsourced so you might
want<00:05:44.729> to<00:05:44.760> be<00:05:44.849> careful<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.240> make<00:05:45.599> sure<00:05:45.750> you

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
want to be careful that make sure you

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.120 
want to be careful that make sure you
have<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:45.990> time<00:05:46.169> bridge<00:05:46.349> so<00:05:46.590> that<00:05:46.620> there's<00:05:46.889> an<00:05:46.979> on

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
have a time bridge so that there's an on

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.330 
have a time bridge so that there's an on
and<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:47.880> off<00:05:48.000> state<00:05:48.680> this<00:05:49.680> is<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:49.889> little<00:05:50.039> small

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
and in off state this is a little small

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.330 
and in off state this is a little small
after<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.760> while<00:05:50.970> this<00:05:51.960> that<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:52.860> have<00:05:53.039> set<00:05:53.280> up

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
after a while this that I have set up

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.219 
after a while this that I have set up
right<00:05:53.490> here<00:05:53.699> would<00:05:54.000> eventually<00:05:54.419> just<00:05:54.900> become

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
right here would eventually just become

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.469 
right here would eventually just become
completely<00:05:55.680> charged<00:05:56.159> it's<00:05:56.820> just<00:05:57.120> watch<00:05:57.270> out

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
completely charged it's just watch out

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.899 
completely charged it's just watch out
for<00:05:57.659> that<00:05:57.690> but<00:05:58.680> i<00:05:59.159> think<00:05:59.460> i<00:05:59.729> covered

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
don't typically use forms just go ahead

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.480 
don't typically use forms just go ahead
and<00:06:37.139> check<00:06:37.380> it<00:06:37.530> out<00:06:37.650> i<00:06:37.710> think<00:06:38.130> you'll<00:06:38.280> like<00:06:38.340> it

and check it out i think you'll like it
I<00:06:39.020> we<00:06:40.020> talk<00:06:40.229> about<00:06:40.380> everything<00:06:40.590> we<00:06:41.310> have<00:06:41.400> a

I we talk about everything we have a

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.740 
I we talk about everything we have a
whole<00:06:41.580> bunch<00:06:41.699> of<00:06:41.849> active<00:06:42.150> users<00:06:42.449> we're

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
whole bunch of active users we're

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.540 
whole bunch of active users we're
looking<00:06:42.990> to<00:06:43.080> get<00:06:43.169> some<00:06:43.349> more<00:06:43.560> it's<00:06:44.190> growing

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
looking to get some more it's growing

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.029 
looking to get some more it's growing
really<00:06:44.759> fast<00:06:45.289> much<00:06:46.289> faster<00:06:46.320> than<00:06:46.830> we<00:06:46.950> had

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
really fast much faster than we had

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.790 
really fast much faster than we had
anticipated<00:06:47.659> within<00:06:48.659> like<00:06:48.990> three<00:06:49.409> days<00:06:49.560> we

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
anticipated within like three days we

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.660 
anticipated within like three days we
have<00:06:49.919> 70<00:06:50.370> ready

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
have 70 ready
