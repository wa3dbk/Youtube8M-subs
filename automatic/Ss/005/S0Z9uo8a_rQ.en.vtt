then on the the circle part of the
layout<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.390> actually<00:02:12.840> used<00:02:13.500> my<00:02:14.780> grand<00:02:15.780> nest

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.210 
layout I actually used my grand nest
ability<00:02:16.410> circles

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220

I<00:02:17.280> died<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.690> cut<00:02:18.900> out<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.020> largest<00:02:19.560> circle

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
I died and I cut out the largest circle

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.300 
I died and I cut out the largest circle
that<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.130> had<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.750> took<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.380> trim<00:02:22.860> that

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that I had and I took this trim that

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.550 
that I had and I took this trim that
actually<00:02:23.790> used<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.390> look<00:02:24.570> like<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:25.170> just

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
actually used to look like this just

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860 
actually used to look like this just
like<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.710> straight<00:02:26.040> trim<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> did<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.840> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
like a straight trim and what I did is I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.810 
like a straight trim and what I did is I
just<00:02:28.440> continued<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> gather<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
just continued to gather it in the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.030 
just continued to gather it in the
circle<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.390> had<00:02:30.600> cut<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.320> with<00:02:31.800> my<00:02:31.980> die

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
circle that I had cut out with my die

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.530 
circle that I had cut out with my die
and<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.970> used<00:02:33.180> my<00:02:33.390> hot<00:02:33.600> glue<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:35.390> lay<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.510> down

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
and I used my hot glue to lay it down

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.480 
and I used my hot glue to lay it down
onto<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.230> circle<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.190> all<00:02:38.310> hidden

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
onto the circle and then it's all hidden

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.520 
onto the circle and then it's all hidden
back<00:02:38.760> there<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.240> can't<00:02:39.510> see<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> looks

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
back there so you can't see so it looks

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.840 
back there so you can't see so it looks
like<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> lace<00:02:42.480> doily<00:02:43.170> which<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.310> really
