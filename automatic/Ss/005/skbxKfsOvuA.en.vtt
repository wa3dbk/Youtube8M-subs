00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
first we had an Italian guide with us

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.970 
first we had an Italian guide with us
telling<00:00:51.539> us<00:00:51.660> ok<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.199> building<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
telling us ok this building is

telling us ok this building is
Renaissance<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> medieval<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
Renaissance this one is medieval and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.700 
Renaissance this one is medieval and
this<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.850> built<00:00:57.149> only<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:58.050> 100<00:00:58.500> years

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this one was built only like 100 years

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.220 
this one was built only like 100 years
ago<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.250> could<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.600> our<00:01:00.809> research

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
ago so we could really in our research

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
ago so we could really in our research
do<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.100> difference<00:01:02.489> between<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
do that the difference between the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.690 
do that the difference between the
architecture<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.320> doing<00:01:05.070> our<00:01:05.309> research

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
architecture and then doing our research

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
architecture and then doing our research
we<00:01:05.939> could<00:01:06.150> also<00:01:06.299> say<00:01:06.659> ok<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.080> building<00:01:07.619> was

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
we could also say ok this building was

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.780 
we could also say ok this building was
not<00:01:08.100> exactly<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.260> now<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.369> take<00:01:11.610> an

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
not exactly like it is now if I take an

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.050 
not exactly like it is now if I take an
example<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.689> facade<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.670> Duomo

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
example the facade of the of the Duomo

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.260 
example the facade of the of the Duomo
in<00:01:15.900> Florence<00:01:16.439> wasn't<00:01:17.250> built<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> time<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
in Florence wasn't built at the time and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
in Florence wasn't built at the time and
and<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> facade<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.460> if

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and the facade that you can see now if

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420 
and the facade that you can see now if
you<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.409> from<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> 19th<00:01:23.340> century

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you go there is from the 19th century

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.270 
you go there is from the 19th century
just<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.270> gorgeous<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.530> cannot<00:01:25.830> use<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just it's gorgeous but we cannot use it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.789 
just it's gorgeous but we cannot use it
but<00:01:27.270> since<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.689> Assassin's<00:01:28.259> Creed<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> it's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
but since it's Assassin's Creed and it's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.510 
but since it's Assassin's Creed and it's
like<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> work<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.579> fiction<00:01:30.710> we<00:01:31.710> bend<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> rules

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
like a work of fiction we bend the rules

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
like a work of fiction we bend the rules
a<00:01:32.700> little<00:01:32.729> bit<00:01:33.030> about<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.990> make<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.439> know

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
a little bit about that to make you know

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.179 
a little bit about that to make you know
the<00:01:34.680> game<00:01:34.860> looks<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:36.119> good<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.540> possible<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> if

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the game looks as good as possible so if

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
the game looks as good as possible so if
I<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.520> summarize<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.270> story<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.689> Assassin's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
than we did in the first game where it

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.110 
than we did in the first game where it
was<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.350> bit<00:04:23.470> repetitive<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.400> this<00:04:24.940> time

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
was a bit repetitive and this time

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.580 
was a bit repetitive and this time
around<00:04:25.360> it's<00:04:25.630> all<00:04:25.750> about<00:04:25.990> changing<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
around it's all about changing the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.530 
around it's all about changing the
experience<00:04:26.980> changing<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.090> amount<00:04:28.210> of

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
experience changing the amount of

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.320 
experience changing the amount of
missions<00:04:29.170> we're<00:04:29.410> giving<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.980> player

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
missions we're giving to the player

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.510 
missions we're giving to the player
being<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.540> lot<00:04:31.720> more<00:04:31.930> Ally<00:04:32.290> would<00:04:32.440> like<00:04:32.710> than<00:04:33.250> we

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
being a lot more Ally would like than we

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.450 
being a lot more Ally would like than we
were<00:04:33.700> in<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.940> first<00:04:34.210> game<00:04:35.070> changing<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.220> path

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
were in the first game changing the path

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.760 
were in the first game changing the path
the<00:04:36.700> pace<00:04:37.110> surprised<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.290> player<00:04:38.500> with

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the pace surprised the player with

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.340 
the pace surprised the player with
different<00:04:39.160> gameplays<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:40.350> etcetera

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
different gameplays and etcetera

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.070 
different gameplays and etcetera
etcetera<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.250> really<00:04:42.940> more<00:04:43.180> variety<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.900> the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
etcetera so really more variety is the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.640

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
sure the structure is totally different

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.470 
sure the structure is totally different
so<00:04:56.140> we<00:04:56.290> without<00:04:57.160> this<00:04:57.340> like<00:04:57.610> structure<00:04:58.330> that

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
so we without this like structure that

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.630 
so we without this like structure that
was<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.980> little<00:05:00.400> bit<00:05:01.050> constraint<00:05:02.050> us<00:05:02.260> in<00:05:02.620> in<00:05:03.520> a

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
was a little bit constraint us in in a

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.100 
was a little bit constraint us in in a
way<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:03.970> doing<00:05:04.240> mission<00:05:04.600> without<00:05:04.780> this

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
way of doing mission without this

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.540 
way of doing mission without this
constraint<00:05:05.680> we<00:05:06.610> can<00:05:06.910> make<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.390> like<00:05:08.190> much<00:05:09.190> more

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
constraint we can make it like much more
