00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
children so as I just said I had two

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.060 
children so as I just said I had two
children<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:15.030> very<00:00:15.750> quickly<00:00:16.320> after<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
children one very quickly after the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.010 
children one very quickly after the
other<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.460> they're<00:00:17.670> there<00:00:17.970> about<00:00:18.150> 17<00:00:18.630> months

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
other so they're there about 17 months

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.740 
other so they're there about 17 months
in<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.439> difference<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.160> age<00:00:20.630> I've<00:00:21.630> never

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
in that difference in age I've never

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.420 
in that difference in age I've never
really<00:00:22.050> had<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> problem<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.980> my<00:00:23.160> weight

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
really had a problem with my weight

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.779 
really had a problem with my weight
before<00:00:23.720> but<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.930> think<00:00:25.289> as<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> most<00:00:26.400> people<00:00:26.699> that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
before but I think as a most people that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.670 
before but I think as a most people that
have<00:00:26.939> babies<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.599> kind<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.900> not<00:00:28.199> as<00:00:28.320> easy<00:00:28.439> as

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
have babies it's kind of not as easy as

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.389 
have babies it's kind of not as easy as
you<00:00:28.740> think<00:00:29.070> losing<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.849> weight<00:00:31.099> two<00:00:32.099> months

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
you think losing the weight two months

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
you think losing the weight two months
went<00:00:32.550> by<00:00:32.579> three<00:00:33.149> months<00:00:33.510> four<00:00:33.780> months<00:00:33.960> five

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
went by three months four months five

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.639 
went by three months four months five
months<00:00:34.500> six<00:00:34.950> months<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:36.239> still<00:00:36.540> 16<00:00:37.380> pounds

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
heavier than my normal weight so I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.560 
heavier than my normal weight so I

the weight to lose not getting a bit

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.270 
the weight to lose not getting a bit
concerned<00:00:54.809> by<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.680> really

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
concerned by this point because I really

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
concerned by this point because I really
didn't<00:00:56.550> feel<00:00:56.760> what<00:00:57.480> myself<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.379> didn't

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
didn't feel what myself and I didn't

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
didn't feel what myself and I didn't
feel<00:00:58.770> comfortable<00:00:58.980> being<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.789> much<00:01:00.030> over<00:01:00.510> my

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
feel comfortable being this much over my

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.860 
feel comfortable being this much over my
normal<00:01:00.960> weight<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> decided<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.570> point

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
normal weight so I decided at this point

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.119 
normal weight so I decided at this point
to<00:01:04.019> look<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> help<00:01:04.979> because

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to look for a little bit of help because

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.480 
to look for a little bit of help because
I<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.580> quite<00:01:05.760> frankly<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.240> needed<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
I think quite frankly I needed it and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.760 
I think quite frankly I needed it and
anyway<00:01:08.490> i<00:01:08.760> was<00:01:09.210> recommended<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:10.290> i<00:01:10.500> was

of thing I would look for a diet pill
and<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.580> looked<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.000> product<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.540> on

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and when I looked at this product in on

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
and when I looked at this product in on
the<00:01:24.900> internet<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.770> was<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.310> pleased<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the internet and I was really pleased to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
the internet and I was really pleased to
find<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.049> hundred<00:01:28.409> percent

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
find out it was a hundred percent

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.330 
find out it was a hundred percent
natural<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.170> interestingly<00:01:31.170> enough<00:01:32.009> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
natural and interestingly enough it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.929 
natural and interestingly enough it
contained<00:01:33.380> cactus<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.979> contained<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.579> form<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
contained cactus it contained a form of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
contained cactus it contained a form of
cactus<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> fat<00:01:37.259> bone<00:01:37.500> too<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
cactus which is a fat bone too so it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.240 
cactus which is a fat bone too so it
basically<00:01:38.070> any<00:01:39.000> fat<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.990> digest<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.770> takes

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
basically any fat you digest it takes

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
basically any fat you digest it takes
the<00:01:41.430> fat<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> basically<00:01:42.299> takes<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.810> your

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the fat and basically takes out your

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.270 
the fat and basically takes out your
body

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
body

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.980 
body
so<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.640> stops<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.090> absorbing<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.659> think<00:01:44.869> it's

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
so it stops you absorbing I think it's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.020 
so it stops you absorbing I think it's
around<00:01:45.110> twenty<00:01:45.740> eight<00:01:45.860> percent<00:01:45.890> of<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.790> fat

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
around twenty eight percent of the fat

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.649 
around twenty eight percent of the fat
you<00:01:47.390> digest<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.950> also<00:01:49.280> contains<00:01:49.760> seaweed<00:01:50.420> a

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
you digest it also contains seaweed a

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.260 
you digest it also contains seaweed a
seaweed<00:01:51.049> extract<00:01:51.650> which<00:01:52.310> actually<00:01:52.580> blocks

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
seaweed extract which actually blocks

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.140 
seaweed extract which actually blocks
eighty-two<00:01:54.049> percent<00:01:54.080> of<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.250> carbohydrates
