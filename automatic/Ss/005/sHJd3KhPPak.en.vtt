00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.259
 unpacking during the milk strike 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.360
 it is shortly after 18 hours 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.669
 their masters 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.939
 and to start respect percent 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.579
 for these men 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.009
 from the country of man's sun 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.760
 an order placed on Friday afternoon a delivery 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.050
 she on wednesday 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.179
 so 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.479
 when nothing to say 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.479
 so open to starters 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.290
 in a month the month of the lat 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.290
 more of the arm age 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.470
 I will name meters 43 years of war to be broken down near 2 4 and 2 8 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.810
 kilos 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.230
 why a single turbine 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.230
 90 millimeters a year 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.190
 a priori he has the box is there 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.360
 tomorrow that poor 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.720
 double turbine at 1 70 ' 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 I hope we will not have any unpleasant surprises at the opening 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.130
 here is the box is open late 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.560
 so after the trip went well 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.330
 everything looks good to a state 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.940
 all year we fix 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 so let's see in order that what we have in our hands 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.580
 she will support 10 hours 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.750
 for the engine 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750
 few years 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 pettitte doc on the turbine 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.060
 small 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.090
 a small quarter turbine time since 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.560
 but how not to leave it cooler 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.680
 the turbine inc 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.450
 we get to touch the turbine 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.700
 had a suite dollars 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.220
 instead of 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.330
 instead of 46 or 47 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.690
 the turbine then packed well taped 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.439
 a priori 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.439
 the protected internet rotor 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.139
 beisel years 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.139
 residents 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.669
 which implies a major effort 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.669
 we're going to have we'll open all that 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.619
 so then after the dams 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.039
 we find inside the time box 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.419
 of dinghies 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.639
 fibrant 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.639
 with some small details 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.469
 the stabilizer the valaisans have controlled 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.589
 with the elephant 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.969
 already near breakthrough for 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.549
 for the hinges huh 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.549
 both front wings well packaged 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.729
 the bubble was cut 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.729
 pro in my opinion 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 for the German fortress of particular to say 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.369
 polystyrene to a balearic formwork 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:18.999
 we do not have to go 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.049
 I will take the plastic but a priori who expects too much 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.429
 default 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.669
 not found aja 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.669
 art well protected in a bag 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.620
 such as the elements of the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.269
 a team 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.039
 for the creamy milk of Commander 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.039
 platinum I imagine 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.919
 here for 100 euros 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.489
 the output of wind turbines 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.799
 which in principle only 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.409
 good things in hand 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.629
 had to be rectified from what I had seen on the 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.879
 we must thank group 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.299
 and which a priori so 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.350
 fits properly in terms of 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.049
 the diameter 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.499
 sure 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.209
 on the single output of a turbine or 90% millimeters what was not the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.519
 case in the first time the first kits 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.519
 in the fuselage is of course 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.669
 the beautiful the beautiful piece 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.779
 the support is the best 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.779
 with 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.620
 which are already in place before 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.620
 but well on that it does not look too early 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.119
 broke there the canopy was a bit of me asking through 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.680
 that's not it's not very serious 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.860
 for the fuselage strong winds polyester fibers 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.659
 to alain colas who wants even realized 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.979
 the plan to play long 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.059
 relatively discreet there is a fact partly mediamat 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.690
 the example turbodiesel call was planed to be well at the level 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.830
 fiber air% 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.830
 not too bad to achieve 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.409
 ditto our money back 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.389
 with magnets 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.200
 which offers a wine glass door 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.200
 worked well 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.759
 interior 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.759
 with reinforcement 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.249
 relative to the air inlets 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.360
 in the fuselage both at mans 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.639
 not too much to what m quality price ratio I do not think that 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:25.110
 we do not have better what 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.629
 relatively salary 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.439
 in Europe time so still a little support it will be overwritten because 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.699
 this time again 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.619
 and again as a couple of reinforcements 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:38.619
 m 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.270
 interior 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.979
 ap 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.339
 but then for 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:00.339
 we have filled up even better in this kit 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.639
 nausea riffains cutters and specific that allow to adapt 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.449
 so 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:08.279
 and even 40 years 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.369
 you stayed at the real so about laser 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:14.439
 and also that the templates to be able to 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.589
 to work the time of the day 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:20.589
 the traditional banks mandela so 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:24.279
 with the chauvigny flame 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.289
 both companies 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:29.289
 so here are overall even satisfied with 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.300
 satisfied with the crisis 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.850
 coli happened hormone the state everything was well protected in the box 

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:36.379
 gloves 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.379
 the duration of that side 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.540
 financially percent and vein turbines 13 05% 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.710
 to go even further smaller 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.210
 which was with a line already proposed so with the shipping costs in 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.229
 chronopost 

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:55.229
 50 euros 

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.110
 l to say of particular 

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:03.270
 quite satisfied for madiran 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.340
 and% year-on-year 

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.330
 of the job in perspective what 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.819
 go on in the next episode
