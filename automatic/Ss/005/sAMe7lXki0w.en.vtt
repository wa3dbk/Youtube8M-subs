00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
I don't see it like that I think he had

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.480 
I don't see it like that I think he had
a<00:00:08.580> good<00:00:08.700> game<00:00:09.290> not<00:00:10.290> only<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.950> technical

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
a good game not only on the technical

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.610

side<00:00:11.550> but<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.179> fighting<00:00:12.809> side

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
side but on the fighting side

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.730 
side but on the fighting side
he<00:00:14.719> was<00:00:15.719> mobile<00:00:17.240> dangerous<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.539> shown<00:00:19.529> as

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
he was mobile dangerous and shown as

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.790

and<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.669> mental<00:00:33.120> side<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:34.110> were<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and on the mental side we were at the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.340 
and on the mental side we were at the
level<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.640> requested<00:00:36.300> tonight<00:00:36.660> against

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
level that was requested tonight against

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.010 
level that was requested tonight against
a<00:00:37.440> good<00:00:37.649> team<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.540> we<00:00:39.540> couldn't<00:00:39.750> finish<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
a good team but we couldn't finish the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.000 
a good team but we couldn't finish the
game<00:00:40.140> off<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.149> that<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.329> course<00:00:43.010> was

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
game off and that of course was

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790 
game off and that of course was
nervously<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.960> very<00:00:45.960> difficult<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> last

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
nervously a very difficult in the last

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.920 
nervously a very difficult in the last
10<00:00:47.250> minutes<00:00:47.430> when<00:00:47.700> we're<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.239> 10<00:00:48.420> men<00:00:53.930> I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
10 minutes when we're down to 10 men I

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.439 
10 minutes when we're down to 10 men I
haven't<00:00:55.469> seen<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> haven't<00:00:56.579> maybe<00:00:57.270> we

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
haven't seen you know I haven't maybe we

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.389 
haven't seen you know I haven't maybe we
were<00:00:57.600> lucky<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.379> occasion<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.250> very

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
were lucky on one occasion but it's very

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:10.330 
were lucky on one occasion but it's very
but<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.789> think<00:00:59.969> he<00:01:00.059> went<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.510> ball

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.219 

look<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.939> played<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.390> finished<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> two<00:01:12.960> games

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
look we played we finished the two games

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
look we played we finished the two games
with<00:01:13.500> 10<00:01:13.710> men<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.920> feel<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> first<00:01:17.909> sending

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
with 10 men and I feel the first sending

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.020 
with 10 men and I feel the first sending
off<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:19.080> harsh<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.710> tonight<00:01:20.430> sending

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
off was very harsh and tonight sending

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.950 
off was very harsh and tonight sending
off<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.390> very<00:01:21.630> harsh<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:22.080> well<00:01:22.290> because

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
off was very harsh as well because

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
off was very harsh as well because
Debbie<00:01:24.960> she<00:01:25.110> went<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> ball<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.159> he

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
Debbie she went for the ball and he

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.490 
Debbie she went for the ball and he
played<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> ball<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:27.630> no<00:01:27.780> intention

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
played the ball there was no intention

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.069 
played the ball there was no intention
where<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.009> make<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> bad<00:01:29.729> fall<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> stop<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
where to make a bad fall or to stop the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.950 
where to make a bad fall or to stop the
counter-attack<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:32.340> won<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> ball<00:01:32.960> maybe

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.719 
counter-attack and he won the ball maybe
the<00:01:34.229> referee<00:01:34.530> was<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> other<00:01:35.070> side<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the referee was on the other side of the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
the referee was on the other side of the
player<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:37.400> 40<00:01:38.400> made<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> foul<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:40.229> was

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
player and 40 made the foul but it was

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.670 
player and 40 made the foul but it was
different<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.640> dealt<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.680> in

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
different but we dealt with it and in

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
different but we dealt with it and in
the<00:01:43.829> last<00:01:44.009> 10<00:01:44.250> minutes<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.640> course<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.149> no

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the last 10 minutes of course it was no

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.609 
the last 10 minutes of course it was no
obviously<00:01:45.950> very<00:01:46.950> difficult<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:51.320> would<00:01:52.320> have

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
obviously very difficult I would have

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.910 
obviously very difficult I would have
loved<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:54.409> because<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.590> would

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
loved for that for because what would

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
loved for that for because what would
have<00:01:56.100> been<00:01:56.280> bit<00:01:56.880> easier<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.540> he<00:01:57.689> wanted<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
have been bit easier but he wanted to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.090 
have been bit easier but he wanted to
qualify<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.360> we<00:02:00.360> did<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.740> against<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.920> very

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
qualify and we did it against a very

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.160 
qualify and we did it against a very

we<00:02:19.110> kept<00:02:19.350> bar<00:02:19.620> quite<00:02:19.890> tonight<00:02:20.790> he<00:02:21.450> had<00:02:21.570> one

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
we kept bar quite tonight he had one

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.650 
we kept bar quite tonight he had one
chance<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.620> head<00:02:22.820> that<00:02:23.820> was<00:02:24.090> quite<00:02:24.330> very

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
chance on the head that was quite very

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.360 
chance on the head that was quite very
close<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.320> end<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.950> would<00:02:26.160> have

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
close to the end and that would have

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.930 
close to the end and that would have
killed<00:02:26.640> us<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.470> apart<00:02:28.470> from<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.160> felt<00:02:29.430> we

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
killed us but apart from that I felt we

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.100 
killed us but apart from that I felt we
