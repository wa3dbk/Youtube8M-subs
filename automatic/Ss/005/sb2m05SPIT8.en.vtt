00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 will hello to all and good morning 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.700
 the friends his flights if we find ourselves for 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.529
 a brand new video on minecraft 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 but beware it's a match that I 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.570
 have already presented to you we will not redo 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.630
 the presentation we find ourselves survival 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 hunger games fashion by alex mc 929 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.740
 it's a mode that will allow me to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.150
 to train hunger games solo except 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.070
 that this time unlike 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.420
 the presentation episode I'm going 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.830
 modify the settings so the options 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.330
 so the case then we give the account to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.230
 countdown we will put it to 15 seconds 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.270
 because we do not have that to do 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.450
 to wait we will start with 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.370
 items not because otherwise it's not 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.489
 funny 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.780
 the strength of the tribes these amphorae because 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.700
 that you are very strong there are 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.469
 extremely strong there is very weak 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 weak we will not put in normal 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.180
 but strong to start the spawn 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.420
 radius we will put it to three we strike 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 ication we do not care 24 tribe 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.879
 hangars games go it's gone so 15 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.899
 seconds for we do not care about running 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.390
 since in any case I leave 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.689
 pony on a pillar and bah listen I 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.890
 will not have to try to survive 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.890
 what are you going to do 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.460
 so we have to brutal 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.130
 I will put to run 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.049
 there is some grossus I know raw 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.090
 there are no tribes called brutus 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.990
 in the games lengths in the series 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.909
 of books 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.630
 I do not think but in any case to 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.460
 there are some who 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.189
 want my skin - I feel so in 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.329
 the more he is strong while I try 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.979
 to get at least some shows 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.420
 a few things at least a 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.960
 weapon because there it would still be 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.130
 nice to try gold does inspire in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.329
 the more I will have to go through the water 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.130
 so here it is going to have to do 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.490
 extremely careful I risk to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490
 beat up 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.890
 brutus he's there he abandoned 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.069
 so of course we will have to return 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.350
 on the cornucopia doing well 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.760
 be careful that the other stands 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.810
 but gaulle not but I have 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.430
 the feeling of being well away here 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.470
 I managed to get away 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.910
 cornucopia now it's gone 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.530
 I even had cac more here at least 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.130
 I have my metal sword that clearly 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.510
 it's a big advantage for me 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.400
 oh yes so wait because do not have to 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.810
 believe I have any mini theme this message 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.640
 it's just for me to live 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.350
 medal because without the medal in 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.030
 done I can not start the mode and 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.080
 I do not know how his filth to this kraft 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.720
 and I did not want to 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.340
 annoy me with that so I get everything back 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.050
 what I can recover to prevent that 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.730
 the other tribunes we do not recover the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.290
 stuff 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.940
 good anyway just saw that I 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.230
 have left they have not got too much there they have 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.830
 no chance against me that 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.400
 that's for sure what I'm going to do 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.269
 it's eating once in two 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.110
 lanes there and now it's gone 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.269
 so they are strong but but but 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.260
 but I'm going to try to be a lot 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.480
 stronger than fox pathe fox lie it was 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.329
 well it must stop the bitch fox 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.579
 and the dead is not enough 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.690
 powerful for me it's surely done 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.680
 beat up the face then we have what 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:36.310
 we were very very 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.840
 so wait I think no matter the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.099
 name of the tribes we do not care 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.730
 I think we titus hello titus here 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.409
 goodbye titus hop a tribute to non stop 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.819
 stop stop stop the music so that's it 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.969
 the music that will make me lose it is going 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.980
 to be quite dantesque to the 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.049
 trainings for the hunger games for 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.959
 I do not know me they rice pasta by 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.269
 example it can always be nice 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.799
 then to gabiot game but standards there are some 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.139
 names of tribes I did not know 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.310
 absolutely not him he has a big 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.030
 disadvantage is that it is in the water 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.400
 and it's really nice to be able to 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.189
 rely on on the environment for 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.979
 try to disturb a little bit the 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:24.400
 tribes there we will try to be syria a 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:28.990
 mandate in the water trap then 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.030
 amanda then I do not need that I 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.080
 trolling too much now she's 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.060
 in the water I will be able to power 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.800
 was fully typed here more 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.220
 did she have no weapons at all so 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.570
 that's fine because this time that if 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.000
 the time a platform has no weapons of 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.659
 blow me I can totally defend myself 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.360
 finally try to hope to be the 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:59.979
 winner of his first games then 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.080
 we have very hot by here so very 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.820
 chitray finished the time when not exceeding 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.210
 very hot he is very he is rather 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.949
 beefy 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.919
 that's it, except that I'm much more 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:13.810
 hey he's dead he's dead 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.849
 fall like a mass on the floor after 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.409
 that I cut them into pieces 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:22.030
 with my sword then the problem is 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.190
 I do not know yet how many tribes 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.680
 they are alive but not much I 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.780
 think how many living tribes are there 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.860
 yet there are no jets not recovered 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.490
 no i have not got dark yet 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:42.039
 I do not have dark unfortunately then 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:46.419
 not dark or is he the other 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:48.909
 tribe he is there it is there is neither 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.570
 try to eat and who will try to 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:54.419
 tap to chop this has 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.060
 unfortunately it was not the 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:01.389
 was not the last 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.190
 aya brutus yes brutus necessarily when 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.409
 noise to love la la I'm fired 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.900
 two of a sudden it's going to be ugly and there I 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:13.360
 really risk losing both 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.320
 Brechtian pairs of hassles I'm 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.750
 happy because I still managed 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.430
 to have beautiful things I quickly I have 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.500
 paid the cornucopia so from 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.440
 of that moment necessarily it's more 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:27.639
 simple brutus is dead shit 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.610
