00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello everyone, Sasha is with us 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.350
 week ended minifigurok more precisely 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.719
 she broke off I Sasha two minifigurki 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.849
 which I would like to show you which 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.059
 I did but according to some testimonies 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.740
 I did not manage to show them earlier 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.990
 I know what you suggested to do 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 some minifigures but i still 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.180
 I decided not to do them because I didn't 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.160
 I respect your opinion of what it is and because 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.650
 what i'm tied up with mony figures 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.720
 they probably will no longer be any 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.780
 the case is not yet interesting 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 figurines they will not be if I find the coffee pot 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 interesting shapes and then there will be 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.329
 and so sorry but no there will be simple 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.850
 the figures will be big but 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.879
 small will not be because I think 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.370
 that it makes no sense to make a whole 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.680
 a bunch of such square squares 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.149
 figurines how to do the same every 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.010
 Such a view simply does not 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.289
 I wonder if I can do something more 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.719
 original hipath 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.789
 mini figure I more difficult then of course 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.199
 this seems more interesting to me and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.080
 see what's so simple 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.600
 octopus square that's why here today 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.330
 our release, I want to show you in 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 square on you is a rectangular pond though 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.270
 me more Kate that he is ready well yes 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.310
 rectangular and ancient guard here and you 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.920
 you know what 's the matter of a simple guard 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.680
 he stands zelonenky and ancient keeper of the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.900
 I 'll tell you now about every figure 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.790
 it will drag do octopus not 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.180
 glue ended then how bad is it 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.670
 glued together with a glue gun but already a sign 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.329
 clumsy but it's done quite easily i 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.130
 by cut here is the space between it 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.310
 tentacles and also from minutes to wanted 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.009
 see how many legs we have here 45 she 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.950
 came by the way 8 here somehow did not think 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.020
 so I cut the space between my legs 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.149
 just legs were slaughtered and inside 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.969
 his mouth stuck though his mouth of some kind 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.680
 strange in my opinion he beckoned 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.640
 square is not some kind of diamond-shaped pie 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.719
 but still here is such a mini octopus here 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.270
 submersible with a smile 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.940
 and so here is an ancient guardian it is clear that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.110
 ancient guardian and year pictures 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.390
 I liked most here he is 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.910
 he looks like a fish to be honest and some 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.950
 very pale land 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.040
 also pretty pale he is so 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.000
 pale green this one is even paler 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.660
 he is generally yellow or beige and you see 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.730
 that the eye is generally fig print out yes 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.230
 so here it turned out so he 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.080
 very interesting sweep exactly 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.970
 so I took it I think I do not need 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.790
 time terrible disassembly by force 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.240
 very interesting is a video like this 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.790
 would 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.980
 cross something like that in general like this 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.510
 here so here and glued first 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.670
 these are the things inside the course 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.860
 connect that is like inside here 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.330
 here here they are everywhere fixed here 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.720
 not fixed at all 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.790
 Now this little thing on and jumping cleanly 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.410
 because of this did not like this fear 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.230
 Liked his sweep and precisely 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.760
 so I made him like this 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.340
 we got a short not very 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.800
 informative release of the final part 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.270
 minifigures from minecraft of you will be 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.340
 really interesting figures from 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.040
 minecraft and difficult then of course throw 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.510
 I may and will do but for now all the same 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.299
 i say i don't want to make me figures 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.250
 will be simple figurine most likely to all 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.959
