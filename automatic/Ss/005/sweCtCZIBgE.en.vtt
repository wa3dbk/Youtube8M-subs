00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
honestly all that makes it does is it

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.240 
honestly all that makes it does is it
makes<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.660> handling<00:01:17.110> really<00:01:17.440> terrible<00:01:18.190> for

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
makes the handling really terrible for

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.400 
makes the handling really terrible for
the<00:01:18.520> car<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.479> can't<00:01:19.720> really<00:01:19.840> releases

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
the car and you can't really releases
