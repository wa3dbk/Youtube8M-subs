00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
looks like we will need to pick up GPS

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.400 
looks like we will need to pick up GPS
signal<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.150> don't<00:03:57.330> have<00:03:57.480> signal<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:58.140> yet

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
signal we don't have signal just yet

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
signal we don't have signal just yet
because<00:03:58.560> we<00:03:58.740> got<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.920> real<00:03:59.130> cloudy<00:03:59.430> sky<00:03:59.880> it's
