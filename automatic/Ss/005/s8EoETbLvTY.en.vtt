because<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.530> didn't<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.039> right<00:01:08.189> part

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
because they didn't have the right part

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.459 
because they didn't have the right part
so<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:08.969> just<00:01:09.119> switched<00:01:09.359> out<00:01:09.569> a<00:01:09.810> low<00:01:10.049> respect

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
so they just switched out a low respect

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.609

part with the 34:20 and put it on my

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
part with the 34:20 and put it on my
machine<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:14.100> took<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.240> fingerprint

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
machine they took out my fingerprint

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.300 
machine they took out my fingerprint
reader<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.170> check<00:01:16.319> out<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.619> bluetooth<00:01:16.829> card
