 please go 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:28.510
 if the fight is about to start half a goal 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.360
 where they used long shirts where 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.180
 They were the underpants gowns 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.180
 White guy is confident to win 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 here 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.380
 but it happens that you are on top of a

 extra ring and if it was not clear 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.719

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.450

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.400
 as always we reach the summit 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.380
 of the video to which I must give the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.670
 recognition to the narrators that in 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.020
 this time they did it in a way 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.020
 very professional 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.710

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.569

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.290

 the zinc against him for 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.959
 As you can see there are a few hundredths left 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:24.090
 of seconds in the watch the whites 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.090
