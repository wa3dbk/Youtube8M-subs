00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.410
 or always ok from immediately we are going to 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.840
 load the launcher that we have 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.420
 installed on the phone we selected 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.949

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.519
 case selected new to the width and to the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.680
 time to lock the device and 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.420
 unlocking it will change us 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.760
 in this way that there is where we 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.040
 we can now see the notifications and 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.770

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.700
 As I tell you, they believe them quite 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.530
 beautiful 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.970
 we simply slide towards the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.520
 left so that the phone 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.080

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.880
 Screen lock notification if 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.890

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.619
 we can do it without any problem ok 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.150

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.470

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.500
