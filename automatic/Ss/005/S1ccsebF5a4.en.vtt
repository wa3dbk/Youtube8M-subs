00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 well what we had is a case 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.740
 of a person who comes from carcarañá 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.290
 that we receive the query from a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.509
 private effector of the city ​​rosario de 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 a patient who had certain 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.960
 characteristics in his clinical picture that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 they made us suspect the possibility of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.640
 botulism botulism is a disease 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 produced by a bacterium that has the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.670
 characteristic of eliminating a toxin and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.519
 this toxin has like the possibility of 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.859
 paralyze some muscles of the body 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.750
 there is a somewhat induced baby botulism 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.820
 in general by spores or elements that 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.829
 there are in the air or for some food 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.280
 there is a mutism of food when one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.870
 take a meal that can be 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.520
 contaminated and there is a tourism of the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.590
 wounds that sometimes one can 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.149
 hurt and through the woods can 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.649
 enter also this bacteria are 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.660
 patients going to intensive therapy 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.789
 because as the muscles are paralyzed and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.410
 this can be progressing it affects the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.750
 possibility of breathing and needs a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.329
 support of a respirator that passed the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.550
 antitoxin and one takes samples of this 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.559
 patient to try to identify if 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.960
 the cause of this paralysis can be the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.280
 botulism or not 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.780
 samples are analyzed in a laboratory 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.330
 of reference that is the institute 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.640
 malbrán de buenos aires and one has to 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.530
 can find the food involved 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.690
 is in general is a disease that is 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.659
 transmitted by food in food 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.180
 that are closed and where they have not 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.690
 used certain techniques of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.430
 manufacturing or proper techniques 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.490
 let's say of concentrations in principle 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.750
 always one has to try to use 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.729
 safe food and when one says 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.990
 safe food is actually 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.729
 foods they buy have 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.020
 certain elements on the label 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.610
 one can see this where they come from 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.320
 general one recommends preserves 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.720
 that do not go through the elements 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.399
 let's say of proper closing of the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.860
 flasks and this I say because sometimes 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.979
 there is a custom of making elements 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.860
 more home than those produced in 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.110
 determined this let's say laboratories or 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.590
 in certain producers towards great 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.590
 scale
