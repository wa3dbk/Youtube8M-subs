exercise you're gonna feel a lot but

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.209 
exercise you're gonna feel a lot but
when<00:00:38.870> you<00:00:38.929> do<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.170> correctly<00:00:39.289> I<00:00:39.620> feel<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.010> bit<00:00:40.190> of

when you do it correctly I feel a bit of
a<00:00:40.309> burn<00:00:40.489> in<00:00:40.609> the<00:00:40.670> quads<00:00:40.909> this<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.899> fairly

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
a burn in the quads this is a fairly

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.770 
a burn in the quads this is a fairly
small<00:00:42.409> muscle<00:00:43.309> but<00:00:43.730> it's<00:00:43.850> very<00:00:44.120> important<00:00:44.690> for

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
small muscle but it's very important for

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.869 
small muscle but it's very important for
me<00:00:44.899> stability<00:00:45.409> and<00:00:45.649> this<00:00:46.100> is<00:00:46.249> often<00:00:46.429> a<00:00:46.609> muscle

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
me stability and this is often a muscle

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.549 
me stability and this is often a muscle
that's<00:00:46.969> overlooked<00:00:47.510> Atley<00:00:47.929> people<00:00:48.440> don't

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
that's overlooked Atley people don't

that's overlooked Atley people don't
focus<00:00:48.710> on<00:00:49.010> when<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:49.249> comes<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.489> strengthening

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
focus on when it comes to strengthening

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.349 
focus on when it comes to strengthening
okay<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.530> what<00:00:51.979> we<00:00:52.100> do<00:00:52.280> here<00:00:52.309> is<00:00:52.609> we<00:00:52.640> get<00:00:52.909> either

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
okay so what we do here is we get either

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.270 
okay so what we do here is we get either
have<00:00:53.539> some<00:00:53.899> kind<00:00:54.079> of<00:00:54.109> a<00:00:54.170> little<00:00:54.379> box<00:00:54.649> or<00:00:55.010> a

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
have some kind of a little box or a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.250 
have some kind of a little box or a
bench<00:00:56.030> here<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:56.539> want<00:00:56.719> to<00:00:56.780> go<00:00:56.870> too<00:00:57.050> high

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
bench here and you want to go too high

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.590 
bench here and you want to go too high
we<00:00:57.469> first<00:00:57.739> start<00:00:58.010> as<00:00:58.219> we<00:00:58.909> progress<00:00:59.120> with<00:00:59.510> this

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
we first start as we progress with this

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.779 
we first start as we progress with this
exercise<00:00:59.870> we<00:01:00.620> could<00:01:00.800> increase<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.280> height<00:01:01.639> of

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
exercise we could increase the height of

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.729 
exercise we could increase the height of
it<00:01:01.909> but<00:01:02.479> make<00:01:02.659> sure<00:01:02.809> it's<00:01:02.960> not<00:01:03.079> too<00:01:03.319> high<00:01:03.530> when

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
it but make sure it's not too high when

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.140 
it but make sure it's not too high when
you<00:01:03.799> first<00:01:03.979> start<00:01:04.220> off<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.430> exercise

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
you first start off the exercise

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.520 
you first start off the exercise
so<00:01:05.810> whatever<00:01:06.670> muscle<00:01:07.670> we're<00:01:07.790> going<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.090> work

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
so whatever muscle we're going to work

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.530 
so whatever muscle we're going to work
we<00:01:09.530> want<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.830> have<00:01:09.980> that<00:01:10.190> leg<00:01:10.460> on<00:01:10.910> the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
we want you to have that leg on the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.750 
we want you to have that leg on the
platform<00:01:12.050> so<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:13.010> this<00:01:13.100> case<00:01:13.340> we're<00:01:13.580> going<00:01:13.700> to

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
platform so in this case we're going to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.170 
platform so in this case we're going to
be<00:01:13.850> working<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.420> ends<00:01:14.750> right<00:01:14.960> BMO<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.520> look

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
be working the ends right BMO and look

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.850 
be working the ends right BMO and look
in<00:01:17.300> there<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.600> actually<00:01:17.930> place<00:01:18.170> your<00:01:18.200> leg<00:01:18.530> on

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
in there to actually place your leg on

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.360 
in there to actually place your leg on
up<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.880> what<00:01:20.330> we<00:01:20.420> do<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:21.050> we<00:01:21.890> don't<00:01:22.160> know

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
up here and what we do is we don't know

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.430 
up here and what we do is we don't know
whether<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.850> knees<00:01:23.000> coming<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:23.540> now<00:01:23.840> but

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
whether the knees coming for now but

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.170 
whether the knees coming for now but
we'll<00:01:24.590> be<00:01:24.710> on<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:24.920> ball<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.640> foot<00:01:25.880> with

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
we'll be on the ball of the foot with

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.220 
we'll be on the ball of the foot with
the<00:01:26.240> heel<00:01:26.450> off<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.690> ground

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
the heel off the ground

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.880 
the heel off the ground
exactly<00:01:28.100> now<00:01:29.020> we<00:01:30.020> give<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.350> position<00:01:30.680> here

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
exactly now we give this position here

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.710 
exactly now we give this position here
we<00:01:31.130> want<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.400> take<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.820> heel<00:01:32.210> of<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.570> other

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
we want to take the heel of the other

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.570 
we want to take the heel of the other
foot<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.200> move<00:01:33.770> it<00:01:33.890> forward<00:01:34.070> just<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.550> little

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
foot and move it forward just a little

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.240 
foot and move it forward just a little
bit<00:01:34.820> here<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:35.570> we're<00:01:35.780> approximating<00:01:36.230> not<00:01:37.070> by

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
bit here so we're approximating not by

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.250 
bit here so we're approximating not by
them<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:38.060> little<00:01:38.300> bit<00:01:38.450> perfect<00:01:38.990> perfect

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
them just a little bit perfect perfect

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.860 
them just a little bit perfect perfect
so<00:01:40.160> we're<00:01:40.730> going<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:40.880> be<00:01:40.970> across<00:01:41.210> we<00:01:41.630> have<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
so we're going to be across we have the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.770 
so we're going to be across we have the
heel<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.970> foot<00:01:43.970> on<00:01:44.090> one<00:01:44.120> side<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.720> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
heel of the foot on one side and the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.170 
heel of the foot on one side and the
ball<00:01:44.960> from<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.380> other<00:01:45.500> side<00:01:45.800> in<00:01:46.580> general

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
ball from the other side in general

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.480 
ball from the other side in general
proximity<00:01:47.360> now<00:01:48.350> what<00:01:49.040> we<00:01:49.130> do<00:01:49.280> with<00:01:49.400> this

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
proximity now what we do with this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.600 
proximity now what we do with this
exercise<00:01:49.900> what<00:01:50.900> if<00:01:50.990> your<00:01:51.170> leg<00:01:51.470> is<00:01:51.710> down<00:01:52.040> we're

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
exercise what if your leg is down we're
