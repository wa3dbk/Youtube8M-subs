obtain the our image our imaging is when

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.260 
obtain the our image our imaging is when
you<00:02:45.319> use<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.680> microphone<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.670> collect<00:02:47.090> the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
you use the microphone to collect the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.080 
you use the microphone to collect the
sound<00:02:47.630> from<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.110> guitar<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.220> in<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.580> case<00:02:49.819> as

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
sound from the guitar so in this case as

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.150 
sound from the guitar so in this case as
I<00:02:50.240> mentioned<00:02:50.660> we<00:02:50.780> used<00:02:50.990> all<00:02:51.290> vintage<00:02:51.709> guitars

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
I mentioned we used all vintage guitars

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.860 
I mentioned we used all vintage guitars
that's<00:02:52.490> where<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> vintage<00:02:53.209> sound<00:02:53.510> comes

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
that's where the vintage sound comes

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.720 
that's where the vintage sound comes
from<00:02:54.640> there<00:02:55.640> are<00:02:55.970> three<00:02:57.160> pre-selected<00:02:58.160> blends

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
from there are three pre-selected blends

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.290 
from there are three pre-selected blends
in<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.660> ro+<00:03:00.290> system<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.400> blends<00:03:01.730> are<00:03:02.000> between

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
in the ro+ system the blends are between

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.630 
in the ro+ system the blends are between
the<00:03:02.540> ARA<00:03:02.810> image<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:04.130> under<00:03:04.400> saddle

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
the ARA image and the under saddle

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.250 
the ARA image and the under saddle
pickup<00:03:05.120> which<00:03:05.300> comes<00:03:05.570> standard<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.080> each

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
pickup which comes standard in each

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.340 
pickup which comes standard in each
guitar<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:06.830> well<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:08.000> what<00:03:08.239> we<00:03:08.360> have<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.870> when<00:03:09.080> P

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
guitar as well so what we have is when P

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.979 
guitar as well so what we have is when P
is<00:03:09.500> displayed<00:03:10.060> we<00:03:11.060> have<00:03:11.239> just<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.750> under

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
is displayed we have just the under

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.020 
is displayed we have just the under
saddle<00:03:12.200> pickup

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.570 

when<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.150> see<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.360> one<00:03:16.720> that's<00:03:17.380> our<00:03:17.590> first<00:03:20.580> when

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
when you see a one that's our first when

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.170 
when you see a one that's our first when
you<00:03:21.700> see<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.910> two<00:03:22.210> that's<00:03:22.870> our<00:03:23.110> second<00:03:23.530> blend

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
you see a two that's our second blend

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.520 
you see a two that's our second blend
different<00:03:25.180> microphone<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.520> number<00:03:27.520> three

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.030 

third<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:32.630> those<00:03:32.780> are<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.050> pre-selected<00:03:34.010> for

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
third so those are all pre-selected for

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.580 
third so those are all pre-selected for
you<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.850> can't<00:03:35.209> really<00:03:35.450> alter<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.260> other

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you you can't really alter that other

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.190 
you you can't really alter that other
than<00:03:36.950> using<00:03:37.310> what's<00:03:37.670> called<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:38.000> mid<00:03:38.270> scoop<00:03:38.690> if

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
than using what's called a mid scoop if

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.850 
than using what's called a mid scoop if
I<00:03:39.410> do<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.709> that's<00:03:40.640> flat<00:03:41.740> scooping<00:03:42.740> the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
I do it that's flat scooping the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.080 
I do it that's flat scooping the
mid-range<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.520> want<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.880> find

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
mid-range is this so you want to find

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.210 
mid-range is this so you want to find
somewhere<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:47.750> between<00:03:47.870> there<00:03:48.410> but<00:03:48.920> we<00:03:49.040> don't

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
somewhere in between there but we don't

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.340 
somewhere in between there but we don't
really<00:03:49.430> have<00:03:49.550> tone<00:03:50.090> control<00:03:50.600> other<00:03:50.870> than<00:03:51.140> that

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
really have tone control other than that

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.620 
really have tone control other than that
there<00:03:52.340> is<00:03:52.370> another<00:03:52.760> side<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.270> this<00:03:53.390> guitar

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
there is another side of this guitar

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.710 
there is another side of this guitar
it's<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.620> performance<00:03:55.190> side<00:03:55.489> that's<00:03:56.270> where

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
it's the performance side that's where

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.699 
it's the performance side that's where

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
you get to go in and use nine or images

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.650 
you get to go in and use nine or images
that<00:04:00.980> bill<00:04:01.250> actually<00:04:01.610> collected<00:04:02.330> from<00:04:02.450> our

guitar through with the electronics
demonstrating<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.710> electronics<00:06:01.430> but<00:06:02.210> the

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
demonstrating the electronics but the

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.260 
demonstrating the electronics but the
guitar<00:06:03.590> isn't<00:06:03.740> a<00:06:03.889> retro<00:06:04.250> just<00:06:04.490> like<00:06:04.699> all<00:06:04.940> the

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
guitar isn't a retro just like all the

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.879 
guitar isn't a retro just like all the

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
other series of Martin's they have to

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.159 
other series of Martin's they have to
sound<00:06:07.129> great<00:06:07.520> by<00:06:08.000> themselves<00:06:08.659> and<00:06:08.780> then<00:06:09.050> the

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
sound great by themselves and then the

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.860 
sound great by themselves and then the
electronics<00:06:09.740> are<00:06:09.860> added<00:06:10.220> to<00:06:10.400> that<00:06:10.610> so<00:06:11.389> let's

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
electronics are added to that so let's

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.710 
electronics are added to that so let's
just<00:06:12.199> play<00:06:12.440> through<00:06:12.770> a<00:06:13.400> microphone<00:06:14.330> here
