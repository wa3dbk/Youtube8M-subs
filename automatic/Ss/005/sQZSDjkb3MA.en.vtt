00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Match! 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.500
 This is a circus from Call of Duty, he came to the city to us! 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 Gymnasts fly here, swim to the capricious clowns! 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.500
 So go to the server, sit down there, 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.000
 This is a circus from Call of Duty, he came to the city to us! 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.500
 Go look at the statue living there in the corner. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.000
 She will wait for you and ... you are already on the floor. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 She does not learn to shoot and she will come to an end. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 But all she needs in the game is the Kill / Death ratio. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.000
 And here is the terrible Ripper with his blade. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 He will kill anyone at once beautiful and easy. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.200
 He seeps through the fire, stabs the foot with a knife, 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.000
 Then the end is over, and you are a fool. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 This is a circus from Call of Duty, he came to the city to us! 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Gymnasts fly here, swim to the capricious clowns! 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 So go to the server, sit down there, 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 This is a circus from Call of Duty, he came to the city to us! 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.600
 Match all-all-all! 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.000
 Take a look at the funny creatures of all stripes and strange freaks! 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And here is a hidden clown lurking at the pipe. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 You will not notice from him movements and firing. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 He steals up close and beats the best of us, 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And then we just have to cry for an hour. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Baby-yula years ten appear on the scene! 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.500
 It spins faster than the disk drive. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.000
 But be tactful and hold onto your laughter, 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 For shkoloty here is not a game, here the whole life passes! 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.500
 This is a circus from Call of Duty, he came to the city to us! 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.000
 Gymnasts fly here, swim to the capricious clowns! 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 So go to the server, sit down there, 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.266
 This is a circus from Call of Duty, he came to the city to us!
