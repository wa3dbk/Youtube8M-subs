he's<00:03:33.160> also<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.910> some<00:03:34.180> sort<00:03:34.360> of<00:03:34.390> ethnicity<00:03:35.020> it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
he's also of some sort of ethnicity it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.230 
he's also of some sort of ethnicity it
doesn't<00:03:35.920> really<00:03:36.010> explicitly<00:03:36.550> say<00:03:36.910> I'm<00:03:37.120> gonna

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
doesn't really explicitly say I'm gonna

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.030 
doesn't really explicitly say I'm gonna
say<00:03:37.600> african-american<00:03:38.140> but<00:03:38.710> I'm<00:03:38.770> not<00:03:38.860> really

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
say african-american but I'm not really

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.940 
say african-american but I'm not really
sure<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.570> that's<00:03:40.750> really<00:03:41.110> cool<00:03:41.320> as<00:03:41.470> well<00:03:41.650> so

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
sure so that's really cool as well so

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.830 
sure so that's really cool as well so
the<00:03:42.130> author<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.730> throwing<00:03:43.240> in<00:03:43.360> all<00:03:43.420> kinds<00:03:43.780> of

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
the author is throwing in all kinds of

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.870 
the author is throwing in all kinds of
different<00:03:44.140> things<00:03:44.170> there<00:03:44.560> but<00:03:44.590> he<00:03:45.100> Sid<00:03:45.760> is

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
different things there but he Sid is

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.460 
different things there but he Sid is
definitely<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.450> very<00:03:46.510> unique<00:03:46.990> character<00:03:47.170> I've

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
definitely a very unique character I've

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.020 
definitely a very unique character I've
never<00:03:47.650> read<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:47.860> character<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.430> him<00:03:48.459> before

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
never read a character like him before

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.320 
never read a character like him before
and<00:03:49.270> I<00:03:49.750> quite<00:03:50.410> enjoyed<00:03:50.890> reading<00:03:51.670> about<00:03:51.970> him<00:03:52.300> in

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
and I quite enjoyed reading about him in

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.270 
and I quite enjoyed reading about him in
his<00:03:52.570> journey<00:03:52.990> and<00:03:53.290> other<00:03:53.590> characters<00:03:54.070> in<00:03:54.190> this

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
his journey and other characters in this

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.430 
his journey and other characters in this
book<00:03:54.340> are<00:03:54.640> really<00:03:55.060> awesome<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:55.959> they<00:03:56.050> really

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
book are really awesome and they really

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.080 
book are really awesome and they really
developed<00:03:56.800> some<00:03:56.920> great<00:03:57.100> character

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
developed some great character

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.750 
developed some great character
relationships<00:03:58.860> throughout<00:03:59.860> a<00:04:00.220> book<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:00.610> has

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
relationships throughout a book that has

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.490 
relationships throughout a book that has
a<00:04:00.790> lot<00:04:00.910> of<00:04:01.060> action<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.720> it's<00:04:01.870> really<00:04:02.080> focused

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
a lot of action and it's really focused

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.260 
a lot of action and it's really focused
on<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:03.010> dystopian<00:04:03.520> world<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.030> all<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.240> that

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
on the dystopian world and all of that

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.210 
on the dystopian world and all of that
so<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.570> think<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.870> balances<00:04:05.410> really<00:04:05.800> well<00:04:05.980> with

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
so I think it balances really well with

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.520 
so I think it balances really well with
the<00:04:06.370> plot<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:06.880> characters<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.870> think<00:04:08.380> I<00:04:08.440> ended

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
the plot and characters I think I ended

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.680 
the plot and characters I think I ended
up<00:04:08.680> giving<00:04:08.830> this<00:04:08.980> book<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.400> 4<00:04:09.459> out<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.240> 5<00:04:10.390> stars

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
up giving this book a 4 out of 5 stars

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.660 
up giving this book a 4 out of 5 stars
or<00:04:10.900> four<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.230> half<00:04:11.260> I<00:04:11.620> really<00:04:12.400> really

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
or four and a half I really really

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.790 
or four and a half I really really
enjoyed<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.300> had<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> very<00:04:13.900> surprising

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
enjoyed it it had a very surprising

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.900 
enjoyed it it had a very surprising
endings<00:04:15.959> definitely<00:04:17.220> cliffhanger<00:04:18.220> twist<00:04:18.609> at

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
endings definitely cliffhanger twist at

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.360 
endings definitely cliffhanger twist at
the<00:04:18.970> end<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:20.109> that<00:04:20.799> was<00:04:21.010> really<00:04:21.250> surprising

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
the end so that was really surprising

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.120 
the end so that was really surprising
did<00:04:22.120> not<00:04:22.300> expect<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.780> ending<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.260> happen<00:04:23.770> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
did not expect the ending to happen the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.469 
did not expect the ending to happen the
only<00:04:24.280> reason<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.580> couldn't<00:04:24.850> give<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.030> book<00:04:25.210> a

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
only reason I couldn't give this book a

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.560 
only reason I couldn't give this book a
full<00:04:25.840> five<00:04:26.080> stars

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
full five stars

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.250 
full five stars
is<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:27.160> didn't<00:04:28.160> super<00:04:28.940> connect<00:04:29.330> with<00:04:29.540> it<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.810> love

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
is I didn't super connect with it I love

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.230 
is I didn't super connect with it I love
the<00:04:30.500> characters<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.490> really<00:04:31.820> enjoyed<00:04:32.060> the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
the characters and I really enjoyed the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.390 
the characters and I really enjoyed the
plot<00:04:32.480> but<00:04:32.720> for<00:04:32.900> some<00:04:33.110> reason<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:33.650> wasn't<00:04:33.920> just

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
plot but for some reason I wasn't just

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.430 
plot but for some reason I wasn't just
completely<00:04:35.000> drawn<00:04:35.480> in<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:35.810> don't<00:04:36.050> know<00:04:36.200> if<00:04:36.290> it

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
completely drawn in I don't know if it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.650 
completely drawn in I don't know if it
was<00:04:36.530> like<00:04:36.680> my<00:04:37.190> mind<00:04:37.460> stayed<00:04:37.850> at<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.120> moment<00:04:38.480> it

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
was like my mind stayed at the moment it

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
was like my mind stayed at the moment it
took<00:04:38.780> me<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.960> little<00:04:39.080> while<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.290> read<00:04:39.590> it

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
took me a little while to read it

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.050 
took me a little while to read it
because<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:39.980> wasn't<00:04:40.220> really<00:04:40.460> in<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:40.790> dystopian

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
because I wasn't really in the dystopian

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.180 
because I wasn't really in the dystopian
mood<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:42.200> I<00:04:42.260> don't<00:04:42.410> know<00:04:42.530> if<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.830> was<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.160> I

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
mood so I don't know if that was it I

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.350 
mood so I don't know if that was it I
had<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.460> put<00:04:43.640> it<00:04:43.730> down<00:04:43.850> for<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.120> little<00:04:44.210> while

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
had to put it down for a little while

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.090 
had to put it down for a little while
and<00:04:44.690> pick<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:44.840> back<00:04:44.990> up<00:04:45.260> maybe<00:04:45.680> that's<00:04:45.920> why<00:04:46.070> I

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
and pick it back up maybe that's why I

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.250 
and pick it back up maybe that's why I
wasn't<00:04:46.370> super<00:04:46.700> drawn<00:04:47.090> into<00:04:47.420> it<00:04:47.450> I<00:04:47.780> thought<00:04:48.200> it

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
wasn't super drawn into it I thought it

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.860 
wasn't super drawn into it I thought it
was<00:04:48.380> really<00:04:48.470> fun<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:48.800> fast-paced<00:04:49.690> but<00:04:50.690> for

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
was really fun and fast-paced but for

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.630 
was really fun and fast-paced but for
some<00:04:50.990> reason<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.320> wasn't<00:04:51.500> completely<00:04:52.190> drawn<00:04:52.430> in

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
some reason I wasn't completely drawn in

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.430 
some reason I wasn't completely drawn in
although<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.240> did<00:04:53.570> love<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.810> characters<00:04:54.290> in

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
although I did love the characters in

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.770 
although I did love the characters in
the<00:04:54.530> plot<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.950> was<00:04:55.160> so<00:04:55.580> much<00:04:55.820> fun<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:56.420> now<00:04:56.570> let's

but<00:06:47.360> just<00:06:47.540> wasn't<00:06:47.810> completely<00:06:48.650> into<00:06:49.430> it<00:06:49.460> if

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
but just wasn't completely into it if

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.580 
but just wasn't completely into it if
that<00:06:50.000> makes<00:06:50.210> any<00:06:50.360> sense<00:06:50.540> like<00:06:51.020> it<00:06:51.260> was<00:06:51.380> very

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
that makes any sense like it was very

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.010 
that makes any sense like it was very
entertaining<00:06:52.150> but<00:06:53.150> again<00:06:53.420> with<00:06:53.600> this<00:06:53.720> one<00:06:53.780> it

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
entertaining but again with this one it

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.660 
entertaining but again with this one it
took<00:06:54.200> me<00:06:54.380> a<00:06:54.410> little<00:06:54.560> while<00:06:54.710> to<00:06:54.830> read<00:06:55.220> it's<00:06:55.460> only

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
took me a little while to read it's only

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.390 
took me a little while to read it's only
340<00:06:56.600> pages<00:06:57.020> and<00:06:57.410> it<00:06:57.530> is<00:06:57.650> fast<00:06:57.890> paced

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
340 pages and it is fast paced

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.370 
340 pages and it is fast paced
and<00:06:58.490> the<00:06:58.670> writing<00:06:59.000> is<00:06:59.120> easy<00:06:59.240> to<00:06:59.480> read<00:06:59.660> but<00:07:00.170> for

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
and the writing is easy to read but for

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.730 
and the writing is easy to read but for
some<00:07:00.500> reason<00:07:00.830> I<00:07:00.980> wasn't<00:07:01.430> dying<00:07:02.020> to<00:07:03.020> pick<00:07:03.440> it<00:07:03.590> up

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
some reason I wasn't dying to pick it up

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.770 
some reason I wasn't dying to pick it up
whenever<00:07:04.610> I<00:07:04.670> would<00:07:04.820> set<00:07:05.000> it<00:07:05.090> down<00:07:05.120> I<00:07:05.300> wasn't

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
whenever I would set it down I wasn't

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.210 
whenever I would set it down I wasn't
dying<00:07:05.960> to<00:07:06.200> pick<00:07:06.350> it<00:07:06.470> up<00:07:06.560> again<00:07:06.860> although<00:07:07.070> I

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
dying to pick it up again although I

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.530 
dying to pick it up again although I
still<00:07:07.520> really<00:07:07.700> enjoyed<00:07:08.030> it<00:07:08.180> and<00:07:08.270> so<00:07:08.390> really

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.870 
still really enjoyed it and so really
liked<00:07:08.780> it<00:07:08.990> for<00:07:09.470> some<00:07:09.650> reason<00:07:09.680> I<00:07:10.250> wasn't<00:07:10.640> just

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
liked it for some reason I wasn't just

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.180

these books if you are not a dystopian

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.270 
these books if you are not a dystopian
person<00:07:21.410> you<00:07:21.500> probably<00:07:21.770> won't<00:07:21.920> like<00:07:22.010> them

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280 
person you probably won't like them

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.920 
person you probably won't like them
because<00:07:22.430> they<00:07:22.700> are<00:07:22.850> dystopian<00:07:23.450> but<00:07:23.750> they're

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
because they are dystopian but they're

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.020 
because they are dystopian but they're
very<00:07:24.200> strong<00:07:24.740> dystopian<00:07:25.490> it's<00:07:25.730> a<00:07:25.820> little

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.030 
very strong dystopian it's a little

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.570 
very strong dystopian it's a little
darker<00:07:26.540> deals<00:07:27.260> with<00:07:27.410> some<00:07:27.560> sort<00:07:27.770> of<00:07:27.830> science

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
darker deals with some sort of science

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.810 
darker deals with some sort of science
fiction<00:07:28.790> and<00:07:29.540> technology<00:07:30.170> elements<00:07:30.950> and<00:07:31.220> I

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:31.820 
fiction and technology elements and I

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.250 
fiction and technology elements and I
would<00:07:31.970> say<00:07:32.090> the<00:07:32.210> main<00:07:32.390> character<00:07:32.780> Sid<00:07:33.050> is<00:07:33.230> a

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
would say the main character Sid is a

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.870 
would say the main character Sid is a
very<00:07:33.500> unique<00:07:33.860> character<00:07:34.100> that<00:07:34.460> I've<00:07:34.640> never

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
very unique character that I've never

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.030 
very unique character that I've never
read<00:07:35.120> about<00:07:35.330> before<00:07:35.690> in<00:07:35.930> a<00:07:36.020> dystopian<00:07:36.560> world<00:07:36.590> I

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.040 
read about before in a dystopian world I

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.560 
read about before in a dystopian world I
think<00:07:37.280> he<00:07:37.400> definitely<00:07:37.520> gives<00:07:37.910> this<00:07:38.120> story<00:07:38.480> a

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570 
think he definitely gives this story a

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.360 
think he definitely gives this story a
little<00:07:38.870> edge<00:07:39.050> like<00:07:39.590> I<00:07:39.680> said<00:07:39.830> before<00:07:39.950> I'm<00:07:40.340> not

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.370 
little edge like I said before I'm not

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.160 
little edge like I said before I'm not
sure<00:07:40.880> if<00:07:40.970> there's<00:07:41.180> going<00:07:41.360> to<00:07:41.450> be<00:07:41.570> a<00:07:41.660> third<00:07:41.900> book

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.170 
sure if there's going to be a third book

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.830 
sure if there's going to be a third book
the<00:07:42.590> way<00:07:42.710> Guardian<00:07:43.130> ended<00:07:43.490> it<00:07:43.790> could<00:07:44.360> in<00:07:44.600> there

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 
the way Guardian ended it could in there

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.840 
the way Guardian ended it could in there
I<00:07:44.870> would<00:07:45.230> really<00:07:45.470> like<00:07:45.800> a<00:07:46.040> third<00:07:46.370> book<00:07:46.580> because

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:46.850 
I would really like a third book because

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.970 
I would really like a third book because
I<00:07:46.880> felt<00:07:47.180> like<00:07:47.210> it<00:07:47.420> left<00:07:47.660> a<00:07:47.750> lot<00:07:47.930> of<00:07:48.110> questions

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:48.980 
I felt like it left a lot of questions

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.680 
I felt like it left a lot of questions
that<00:07:49.130> would<00:07:49.310> really<00:07:49.580> like<00:07:49.820> answers<00:07:50.330> but<00:07:50.630> I

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:50.690 
that would really like answers but I

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.510 
that would really like answers but I
could<00:07:50.900> see<00:07:51.200> if<00:07:51.500> it<00:07:51.680> ended<00:07:51.980> there<00:07:52.190> and<00:07:52.370> there's

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 
could see if it ended there and there's

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.370 
could see if it ended there and there's
no<00:07:52.670> third<00:07:52.970> book<00:07:53.240> listed<00:07:53.690> on<00:07:53.810> Goodreads<00:07:54.200> I

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:54.380 
no third book listed on Goodreads I

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.690 
no third book listed on Goodreads I
couldn't<00:07:54.680> find<00:07:54.890> a<00:07:55.340> third<00:07:55.880> book<00:07:56.150> anywhere<00:07:57.010> so<00:07:58.010> I

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:58.700 
couldn't find a third book anywhere so I

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.280
