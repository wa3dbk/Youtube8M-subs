00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.809
 good all welcome to solutions 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.200
 online computers in this new video 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.330
 I'll show you how to change the pasta 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.279
 thermal and above how to apply from a 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.920
 correct way as you can see here 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.859
 I already have a processor that removes the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.019
 fan and then the thermal paste is 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.869
 completely dry and on top was not good 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.029
 put because there are areas of the processor 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.579
 where it did not go well and yet in 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.930
 others because it jutted a little, not what 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.510
 first of all what must be done before 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.190
 of applying the new thermal paste is 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.289
 clean this paste then that 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.210
 so we need a little alcohol a 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.199
 cloth to be able to be fabric because 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.879
 if you use paper sometimes you usually stay 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.160
 chips then is that you are interested 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.019
 then also some sticks and os 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.370
 I recommend using sticks of these 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.219
 to get to the areas equal more 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.490
 difficult and as not so thermal paste 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.710
 new so to put you 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.280
 so 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.019
 it would be good to apply a little alcohol 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.019
 on paper 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.260
 and with your finger 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.260
 go removing 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 until 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.060
 you see the society that stops 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.770
 you do not need to remove the processor from 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.950
 socket 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.950
 you do not need to remove it to clean it 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.560
 and good, well, we have the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.550
 processor ready to put you now the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.400
 thermal paste 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.120
 well then once we have already clean 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.310
 the processor and the heatsink 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.530
 it's time to apply the thermal paste 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.420
 the thermal fuse of different forms of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.620
 apply it there are people who apply it in 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.659
 plan 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:43.170
 in an X is valid in a hairline 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.970
 also in the middle is several in this 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.810
 maximum gives especially for processors 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.180
 of web laptops works better and the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.440
 option that I think more people use and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.049
 which I use is to put a drop as a 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.849
 little more chubby in the middle then this 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.450
 when pressing what will do is to spread 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.340
 from towards the sides arriving therefore in 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.310
 round shape practically up to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.300
 corners where we roll up this and 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.080
 we apply 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.080
 a bit of 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.620
 as you can see that drop is what you 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.760
 bye 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.650
 you do not need to throw more this is to throw the 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.690
 fair amount if you fall short wrong 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.420
 because you're not going to refrigerate what you should 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.510
 and if you spend so bad because it's not going 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.990
 to make its effect not then good 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.990
 now it is to apply the heatsink and you are 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.660
 we apply the heatsink 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.540
 and ready and so the thermal paste is changed 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.849
 I hope this video has helped 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.560
 this is how they liked to give to the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.069
 favorites subscribe and see you the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.069
 next video
