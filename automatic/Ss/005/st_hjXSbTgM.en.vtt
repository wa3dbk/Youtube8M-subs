 we pretend to be a promotion of 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.890
 public transport is to get rid of 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.450

 vehicular of the city this impact 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.530
 and other cities where this 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.990
 service is calculated that each car 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.650
 shared can reach illuminate 15 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.650
 to 20 cars 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.049
 circulation what is immediately 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.000
 less emissions less traffic less 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.549
 interest no noises there is a 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.890
 recovery of the public space of the 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.330
 city ​​since the cities are not 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.660
 made for cars are made for 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.170
 my citizens and I feel that sometimes

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.170
 one of the aspects that we like the most 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.890
 show off in cars is that we have a 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.310
 vandalism index of 0.00 actually 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.020
