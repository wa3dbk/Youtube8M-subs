00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:13.290
 the case of the band where the teacher 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.950
 that this one from here really is difficult 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.650
 It's hard to tell who was wrong if 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.320
 the speed of the cyclist was exceeded 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.320
 if you were out of date at last 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:40.019
 happened to remove an attendant who 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.359
 78-year-old man was run over by a 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.359
 tape and then died 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.850
 he plays in front of it was you will 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.950
 freak out if you see hits him and the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.380
 people I do not respect I think he 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:59.829
 are infected are claiming that the 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:03.100
 Stay here to lose out here fÃ¡bio 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.259
 I do not see any problem in copasa being 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.200
 shared with pdf 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.920
 because today it can not penalize the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.680
 the victim or simply the cycle 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.220
 cyprus people finish 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.030
 then a pdf we have to try 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.100
 the region is also on the plane required 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.649
 more of the way it has been 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.990
 implementing in sÃ£o paulo we work 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.649
 very big backs us up a lot 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.390
 finalization pdf 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.920
 these pilasters there I think they 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 can generate some problems 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.200
 People work here, I'm going to take that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 person 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.820
 but neither he nor I expect the research 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.990
 also works with us when a 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.000
 cyclist 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.210
 they do not respect pt 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.690
 this time of a band today they have 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:05.330
 right plays in a team already has happens 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.330
 actually attacked from or from adults 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.330
 presented in August there was abuse in 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
 meeting 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.810
 the costa rica 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.180
 I think it's complicated there. 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.890
 more people like to enjoy the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.440
 people 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.709
 You may now want to go up to the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.910
 the rider's proposals because of one of 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.790
 an isolated case 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.849
 usually you made people victim 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.890
 a case of running over when it is a 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.470
 absurd that there is not that 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.510
 I had this goal unfortunately 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.000
 can be played against its low and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.519
 against very active mobility 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.260
 what is happening today is a 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.910
 matter of revamp the mind is not a 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.280
 The issue of resolving is cutting or 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.410
 erasing the strip by painting the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.130
 white again have to have a bit of 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.130
 respect and respect
