can<00:02:24.019> just<00:02:24.260> slide<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.799> collar<00:02:25.040> down<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.670> little

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
can just slide the collar down a little

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.600 
can just slide the collar down a little
bit<00:02:26.030> here<00:02:26.269> let<00:02:26.420> me<00:02:26.450> get<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.750> around<00:02:27.579> so<00:02:28.579> you

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
bit here let me get this around so you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.420 
bit here let me get this around so you
can<00:02:28.760> slide<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.239> down<00:02:29.540> go<00:02:30.410> ahead<00:02:30.560> insert<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
can slide that down go ahead insert the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.830 
can slide that down go ahead insert the
spacer<00:02:31.639> it<00:02:32.060> just<00:02:32.329> clips<00:02:32.600> right<00:02:32.780> on<00:02:32.959> that

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
spacer it just clips right on that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.550 
spacer it just clips right on that
it<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:35.090> firms<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> suspension<00:02:37.110> really

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
it and firms up the suspension really

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470 
it and firms up the suspension really
quick<00:02:37.890> easy<00:02:38.129> way<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.610> doing<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.120> kind<00:02:39.420> of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
quick easy way of doing it I kind of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.869 
quick easy way of doing it I kind of
like<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:39.840> pretty<00:02:40.170> nice<00:02:40.379> so<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.489> model<00:02:41.730> I

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
like that pretty nice so this model I

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.699 
like that pretty nice so this model I
bought<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.269> model<00:02:42.599> with<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.930> brushed<00:02:43.319> motor

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
bought the model with the brushed motor

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.800 
bought the model with the brushed motor
you<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> over<00:02:45.450> here<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.690> get

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
you can see that over here you can get

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.589 
you can see that over here you can get
the<00:02:49.019> brushless<00:02:49.440> version<00:02:50.010> later<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.120> am<00:02:51.390> going

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
the brushless version later I am going

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.240 
the brushless version later I am going
to<00:02:51.660> upgrade<00:02:51.989> mine<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.530> brushless<00:02:52.739> version

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
to upgrade mine to the brushless version

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.830 
to upgrade mine to the brushless version
but<00:02:53.430> initially<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.060> wanted<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.599> one

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
but initially I just wanted this one

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.520 
but initially I just wanted this one
just<00:02:55.410> get<00:02:55.950> me<00:02:56.069> going<00:02:56.250> cheap<00:02:57.000> fun<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.599> like<00:02:58.440> I

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
just get me going cheap fun and like I

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.020 
just get me going cheap fun and like I
said<00:02:58.590> again<00:02:58.890> later<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.340> will<00:02:59.489> be<00:02:59.700> doing<00:02:59.849> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
said again later I will be doing the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.940 
said again later I will be doing the
brushless<00:03:00.239> conversion<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.080> but<00:03:01.590> for<00:03:01.830> now

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
brushless conversion on it but for now

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.320 
brushless conversion on it but for now
this<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.250> going<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.580> more<00:03:02.790> than<00:03:02.910> enough<00:03:03.030> for

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
this is going to be more than enough for

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.539 
this is going to be more than enough for
what<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.450> need<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.680> have<00:03:04.709> some<00:03:05.010> basic<00:03:05.340> fun

2 hours to charge now you'll notice here
I<00:03:28.739> have<00:03:29.129> this<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.239> original<00:03:30.450> connector

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
I have this is the original connector

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.170 
I have this is the original connector
for<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.680> comes<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.250> battery<00:03:32.549> now<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:32.910> have

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
for that comes on the battery now I have

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.690 
for that comes on the battery now I have
already<00:03:33.329> gone<00:03:33.660> ahead<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.959> changed<00:03:34.500> my

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
already gone ahead and changed my

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.339 
already gone ahead and changed my
batteries<00:03:35.700> over<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> Deans<00:03:36.390> connector<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
batteries over to a Deans connector the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.680 
batteries over to a Deans connector the
reason<00:03:37.650> being<00:03:37.829> when<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.430> do<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.880> light<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
reason being when I do the light the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.289 
reason being when I do the light the
brushless<00:03:39.930> upgrade<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.739> my<00:03:40.859> Sun<00:03:41.519> fire<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.060> new

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
brushless upgrade to my Sun fire the new

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.780 
brushless upgrade to my Sun fire the new
speed<00:03:42.900> controller<00:03:43.319> for<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.650> motor<00:03:43.829> uses<00:03:44.760> a

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
speed controller for the motor uses a

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.819 
speed controller for the motor uses a
Deans<00:03:45.150> connector<00:03:45.440> that<00:03:46.440> was<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> first

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
Deans connector that was the first

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.680 
Deans connector that was the first
reason<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.310> second<00:03:47.639> reason<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.510> a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
reason the second reason is I have a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.809 
reason the second reason is I have a
better<00:03:48.959> charger<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.920> charge<00:03:49.950> my<00:03:50.370> battery<00:03:50.700> with

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
better charger to charge my battery with

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.729 
better charger to charge my battery with
that<00:03:51.120> uses<00:03:51.540> Deans<00:03:51.720> connector<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:52.290> charge<00:03:52.500> with

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
that uses Deans connector to charge with

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.210 
that uses Deans connector to charge with
and<00:03:54.049> this<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.440> Deans<00:03:55.620> connector<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.069> this

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
and this is a Deans connector so this

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.039 
and this is a Deans connector so this
will<00:03:56.310> let<00:03:56.400> me<00:03:56.519> charge<00:03:56.700> my<00:03:56.880> battery<00:03:57.209> pack<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.690> lot

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
will let me charge my battery pack a lot

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.830 
will let me charge my battery pack a lot
quicker<00:03:58.319> than<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.040> stock<00:03:59.250> charger<00:03:59.670> will<00:03:59.840> ok

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
quicker than the stock charger will ok

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.390 
quicker than the stock charger will ok

right on the side and the antenna here
but<00:04:27.510> like<00:04:27.599> I<00:04:27.720> said<00:04:27.960> earlier<00:04:28.560> when<00:04:29.099> you<00:04:29.160> get<00:04:29.370> it

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
but like I said earlier when you get it

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.430 
but like I said earlier when you get it
the<00:04:29.940> antenna<00:04:30.389> is<00:04:30.510> not<00:04:30.690> on<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.080> transmitter

the antenna is not on the transmitter

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.140 
the antenna is not on the transmitter
you<00:04:31.500> just<00:04:31.710> put<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:31.950> in<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.130> top<00:04:32.310> there<00:04:32.550> screw

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
you just put it in the top there screw

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.260 
you just put it in the top there screw
it<00:04:33.240> down<00:04:33.360> you're<00:04:33.750> good<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.020> go<00:04:34.130> and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
it down you're good to go and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.219 
it down you're good to go and
transmitter<00:04:36.270> just<00:04:36.360> runs<00:04:36.599> on<00:04:36.690> eight<00:04:36.900> double-a

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
transmitter just runs on eight double-a

transmitter just runs on eight double-a
batteries<00:04:37.590> this<00:04:37.830> pops<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.430> bottom<00:04:38.700> and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
batteries this pops in the bottom and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.750 
batteries this pops in the bottom and
that's<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:40.039> one<00:04:41.039> other<00:04:41.130> thing<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.460> just<00:04:41.490> want

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
that's that one other thing I just want

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.000 
that's that one other thing I just want
to<00:04:41.820> note<00:04:42.030> about<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.510> in<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.320> instructions<00:04:43.890> it

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
to note about is in the instructions it

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.490 
to note about is in the instructions it
tells<00:04:44.039> you<00:04:44.400> about<00:04:44.520> your<00:04:44.820> esc<00:04:45.330> here<00:04:45.599> that

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
tells you about your esc here that

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.010 
tells you about your esc here that
is<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.620> reset<00:04:47.100> switch<00:04:47.400> on<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.760> well<00:04:48.300> on<00:04:48.600> the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
is a reset switch on it well on the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.410 
is a reset switch on it well on the
newer<00:04:49.200> style<00:04:49.530> receivers<00:04:50.100> there<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.490> no<00:04:50.910> reset

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
newer style receivers there is no reset

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.210 
newer style receivers there is no reset
switch<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:52.170> if<00:04:52.320> you're<00:04:52.470> looking<00:04:52.830> down<00:04:52.860> there

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
switch so if you're looking down there

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.350 
switch so if you're looking down there
and<00:04:53.370> you're<00:04:53.460> not<00:04:53.490> seeing<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:53.940> switch<00:04:54.210> that's

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
and you're not seeing a switch that's

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.550 
and you're not seeing a switch that's
because<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:54.810> got<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.960> newer<00:04:55.140> style<00:04:55.440> receiver

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
because you got a newer style receiver

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.240 
because you got a newer style receiver
and<00:04:56.040> that<00:04:56.700> is<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.030> fact<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.450> way<00:04:57.570> it's<00:04:57.750> made

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
and that is in fact the way it's made

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
and that is in fact the way it's made
now<00:04:59.250> you're<00:04:59.550> going<00:04:59.670> to<00:04:59.730> have<00:04:59.820> to<00:04:59.940> put<00:05:00.150> the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
now you're going to have to put the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.850 
now you're going to have to put the
antenna<00:05:00.630> through<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> antenna<00:05:01.380> tube<00:05:01.650> and

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
antenna through the antenna tube and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.500 
antenna through the antenna tube and
you're<00:05:02.520> going<00:05:02.640> to<00:05:02.700> find<00:05:02.940> out<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.270> it's<00:05:03.420> a

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
you're going to find out that it's a

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.590 
you're going to find out that it's a
royal<00:05:03.900> pain<00:05:04.260> in<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.440> butt<00:05:04.850> so<00:05:05.850> what<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.030> did<00:05:06.390> is

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
royal pain in the butt so what I did is

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.230 
royal pain in the butt so what I did is
because<00:05:07.350> again<00:05:07.680> I'm<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:08.370> when<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.120> get

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
because again I'm you know when you get

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.240 
because again I'm you know when you get
into<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.510> RC<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:10.290> know<00:05:10.440> hobby<00:05:10.770> there<00:05:11.070> you're

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
into the RC you know hobby there you're

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.470 
into the RC you know hobby there you're
going<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.400> be<00:05:11.520> doing<00:05:11.730> some<00:05:11.880> soldering<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:12.390> at

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
going to be doing some soldering so at

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.550 
going to be doing some soldering so at
some<00:05:12.660> point<00:05:12.870> in<00:05:12.930> time<00:05:12.960> you're<00:05:13.260> gonna<00:05:13.320> have

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
some point in time you're gonna have

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.280 
some point in time you're gonna have
some<00:05:13.860> solder<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.640> soldering<00:05:14.790> gun<00:05:15.020> so<00:05:16.020> I<00:05:16.050> use

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
some solder and a soldering gun so I use

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.200 
some solder and a soldering gun so I use
the<00:05:16.530> thin<00:05:16.740> solder<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:17.640> what<00:05:17.730> I<00:05:17.760> do<00:05:17.850> is<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.150> took

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
the thin solder so what I do is I took

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.920 
the thin solder so what I do is I took
my<00:05:18.390> solder<00:05:18.930> roll<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:20.430> stuck<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.970> wire<00:05:21.570> of<00:05:21.810> it

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
my solder roll and I stuck a wire of it

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.420 
my solder roll and I stuck a wire of it
bunch<00:05:22.290> of<00:05:22.410> it<00:05:22.500> down<00:05:22.680> through<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.160> antenna

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
bunch of it down through the antenna

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.490 
bunch of it down through the antenna
tube<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:23.910> took<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.780> really<00:05:24.990> really<00:05:25.260> small

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
tube and took a really really small

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.280 
tube and took a really really small
piece<00:05:25.770> of<00:05:25.800> tape<00:05:26.100> tape<00:05:26.880> my<00:05:27.120> antenna<00:05:27.419> to<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.169> the

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
piece of tape tape my antenna to of the

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.050 
piece of tape tape my antenna to of the
piece<00:05:28.470> of<00:05:28.650> solder<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.160> then<00:05:29.490> just<00:05:29.760> pull

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
piece of solder and then just pull

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.650 
piece of solder and then just pull
solder<00:05:30.660> right<00:05:30.960> back<00:05:31.140> through<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:32.480> there's<00:05:33.480> my

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
solder right back through and there's my

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.460 
solder right back through and there's my
antenna<00:05:34.040> so<00:05:35.040> that<00:05:36.000> like<00:05:36.810> I<00:05:36.840> said<00:05:37.110> might<00:05:37.290> help

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
antenna so that like I said might help

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.490 
antenna so that like I said might help
you<00:05:37.680> because<00:05:38.430> it<00:05:38.700> is<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:38.910> pain<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.380> do<00:05:40.380> it

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
you because it is a pain to do it

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.590 
you because it is a pain to do it
otherwise<00:05:40.800> also<00:05:41.400> because<00:05:41.940> generally<00:05:42.450> going

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
otherwise also because generally going

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.210 
otherwise also because generally going
to<00:05:42.660> be<00:05:42.720> running<00:05:43.020> around<00:05:43.080> in<00:05:43.350> dirt<00:05:43.620> gravel

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
to be running around in dirt gravel

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.980 
to be running around in dirt gravel
grass<00:05:44.790> stuff<00:05:45.180> like<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:45.570> you're<00:05:45.750> gonna<00:05:45.840> get

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
grass stuff like that you're gonna get

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.580 
grass stuff like that you're gonna get
pretty<00:05:46.200> dirty

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
pretty dirty

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.580 
pretty dirty
I<00:05:46.710> might<00:05:47.640> get<00:05:47.910> yourself<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.360> can<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.600> air<00:05:48.990> duster

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
I might get yourself a can of air duster

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.280 
I might get yourself a can of air duster
so<00:05:50.220> that<00:05:50.370> way<00:05:50.570> when<00:05:51.570> you're<00:05:51.720> done<00:05:51.810> running<00:05:52.110> it

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
so that way when you're done running it

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.810 
so that way when you're done running it
you<00:05:52.320> can<00:05:52.530> just<00:05:52.560> go<00:05:52.740> through<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.370> blow<00:05:53.640> out<00:05:53.790> the

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
you can just go through and blow out the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.880 
you can just go through and blow out the
various<00:05:54.419> components<00:05:55.050> there<00:05:55.229> and<00:05:55.410> try<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.650> keep

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
various components there and try to keep

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.880 
various components there and try to keep
everything<00:05:56.190> clean<00:05:57.110> so<00:05:58.110> and<00:05:58.470> you<00:05:58.650> can<00:05:58.740> get

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
everything clean so and you can get

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.430 
everything clean so and you can get
these<00:05:59.070> pretty<00:05:59.700> much<00:05:59.790> everywhere<00:06:00.360> so<00:06:00.720> all<00:06:01.200> the

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
these pretty much everywhere so all the

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.590 
these pretty much everywhere so all the
apartment<00:06:01.830> stores<00:06:02.070> everything<00:06:02.550> so<00:06:02.820> so<00:06:03.300> I'll

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
on your transmitter and got your antenna

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.800 
on your transmitter and got your antenna
tube<00:06:49.380> installed<00:06:49.919> and<00:06:51.410> yeah<00:06:52.410> go<00:06:52.620> have<00:06:52.770> fun
