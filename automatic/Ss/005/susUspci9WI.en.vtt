00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.880
 very good morning if we continue with 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.840
 cooking with viviana we have michelle 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.300
 who says he is an excellent person in 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.029
 do all these jellies are going to 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.960
 show what is the secret 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.419
 definitely michel to have a 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.880
 Perfect gelatin at home more than anything 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.650
 with how he got milk because nothing 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.800
 more because it was good but because it is 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.240
 that we have heard unmold gelatins 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.740
 soft and delicious and what in 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.989
 secret I imagine getting the jelly 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.180
 well pretty truth but there is long as 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.040
 stuck in the container and it's a 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.320
 disaster but when you work with the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.630
 milk does not happen that does not mean that it is in 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.040
 reality the secret and the thirty and 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.440
 several in Latin here because it's not going 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.300
 explaining for example is looking at this the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.960
 first that the artistic gelatin that 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.610
 I love design and I like to do 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.100
 it's something that can be done a lot but 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.460
 more than anything equal injected with milk 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.740
 how rich it looked is here look at this 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.579
 it's taste for scrap 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.820
 horchata how rich we have horchata and what 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:18.570
 typical latin flavor truth that is by 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.430
 here you have coffee with milk and jelly 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 of coffee with milk if instead of throwing 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.479
 shows the coffee that is on the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.700
 coffee maker because more in jello with 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.530
 milk a very good option true because 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 sometimes there is no coffee left and we throw it away 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.580
 the trash exactly but it gives me something 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.520
 richer and look how curious this in 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.179
 elche is here they are toxic or as 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.539
