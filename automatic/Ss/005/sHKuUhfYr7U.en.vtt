00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 she owns pci express 2.0 so the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.989
 latest variant back for possible 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.550
 held 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:51.500
 hdmi dvi d and dvd the dvi and the map 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:55.850

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.850
 So unpack altogether once 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:34.070
 we find the whole nothing that I 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.070
 The other side can also be done 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:55.530

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.610
 cd with the drivers he counts only the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:07.910

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:11.080

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.690
