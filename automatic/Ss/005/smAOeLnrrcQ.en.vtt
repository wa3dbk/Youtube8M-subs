fire<00:03:43.239> goop<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.690> he<00:03:43.750> trails<00:03:44.019> behind<00:03:44.200> him<00:03:44.470> and

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
fire goop that he trails behind him and

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.080 
fire goop that he trails behind him and
then<00:03:44.620> also<00:03:44.769> his<00:03:45.040> M<00:03:45.220> scribbled<00:03:45.609> or<00:03:45.670> fire<00:03:45.850> goop

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
then also his M scribbled or fire goop

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.500 
then also his M scribbled or fire goop
but<00:03:46.900> other<00:03:47.230> than<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.850> it's<00:03:48.850> pretty<00:03:48.970> similar

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
but other than that it's pretty similar

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.080 
but other than that it's pretty similar
it's<00:03:49.930> really<00:03:50.380> just<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.829> same<00:03:51.040> by<00:03:51.459> even<00:03:51.760> cooing

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
it's really just the same by even cooing

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.870 
it's really just the same by even cooing
my<00:03:52.209> ball<00:03:52.389> game<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:54.100> he's<00:03:54.639> not<00:03:54.819> really

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
my ball game so he's not really

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.430 
my ball game so he's not really
challenging<00:03:55.840> especially<00:03:56.170> because<00:03:56.260> there

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
challenging especially because there

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.599 
challenging especially because there
you're<00:03:56.560> squirting<00:03:56.980> water<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.310> clean<00:03:57.489> up

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
you're squirting water to clean up

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.650 
you're squirting water to clean up
agility<00:03:58.060> leaves<00:03:58.269> behind<00:03:58.420> anyway<00:03:58.900> so

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
agility leaves behind anyway so

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.790 
agility leaves behind anyway so
yeah<00:04:00.200> it's<00:04:00.470> not<00:04:00.590> really<00:04:00.800> hard<00:04:01.210> oh<00:04:02.650> wow<00:04:03.650> that

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800

mission seven in every world which is

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.940 
mission seven in every world which is
the<00:04:27.530> required<00:04:27.950> thing<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.310> have<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.460> do<00:04:29.950> this

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
the required thing you have to do this

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.570 
the required thing you have to do this
will<00:04:31.160> happen

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
will happen

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.970 
will happen
Corona<00:04:31.940> mountains<00:04:32.270> going<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.540> open<00:04:32.750> up<00:04:33.140> I'll

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
Corona mountains going to open up I'll

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.400 
Corona mountains going to open up I'll
see<00:04:34.160> shadow<00:04:34.430> Mario<00:04:34.820> running<00:04:35.270> into<00:04:35.600> Corona

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
see shadow Mario running into Corona

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.070 
see shadow Mario running into Corona
Mountain<00:04:36.680> I<00:04:36.740> guess<00:04:36.920> that<00:04:37.790> area<00:04:38.270> was<00:04:38.420> used<00:04:38.450> to

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
Mountain I guess that area was used to

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.450 
Mountain I guess that area was used to
be<00:04:39.140> fenced<00:04:39.320> off<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:39.770> we<00:04:39.860> could<00:04:40.040> actually<00:04:40.160> go

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
be fenced off that we could actually go

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.890 
be fenced off that we could actually go
into<00:04:40.640> Corona<00:04:40.940> Mountain<00:04:41.240> now<00:04:41.390> which<00:04:41.690> is<00:04:41.810> the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
into Corona Mountain now which is the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.260 
into Corona Mountain now which is the
last<00:04:42.080> level<00:04:42.350> and<00:04:43.010> Delfino<00:04:43.790> Plaza<00:04:44.000> will<00:04:44.240> be

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
last level and Delfino Plaza will be

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.600 
last level and Delfino Plaza will be
flooded<00:04:44.780> now<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.530> fina<00:04:45.710> Plaza<00:04:46.010> being<00:04:46.280> flooded

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
flooded now the fina Plaza being flooded

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.820 
flooded now the fina Plaza being flooded
is<00:04:47.540> actually<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.110> route<00:04:48.290> of<00:04:48.380> quite<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.620> few

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
is actually the route of quite a few

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.570 
is actually the route of quite a few
glitches<00:04:50.290> now<00:04:51.290> probably<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.100> most<00:04:52.250> famous

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
glitches now probably the most famous

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.790 
glitches now probably the most famous
glitch<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.150> all<00:04:53.350> this<00:04:54.350> is<00:04:54.470> something<00:04:54.680> that

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
glitch of all this is something that

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.650 
glitch of all this is something that
just<00:04:54.890> about<00:04:55.070> everybody<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.550> think<00:04:55.760> knows<00:04:55.940> is

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
just about everybody I think knows is

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.210 
just about everybody I think knows is
the<00:04:56.870> fact<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.380> can<00:04:57.560> try<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.830> surface

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
the fact that you can try to surface

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.260 
the fact that you can try to surface
underneath<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:58.730> log

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.370 

it's<00:05:01.599> not<00:05:01.750> hard<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.080> do<00:05:02.199> it's<00:05:02.440> not<00:05:02.620> hard

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
it's not hard to do it's not hard

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.610 
it's not hard to do it's not hard
whoa<00:05:03.950> that<00:05:04.610> was<00:05:04.640> weird<00:05:05.630> okay<00:05:06.290> that<00:05:06.470> wasn't

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
whoa that was weird okay that wasn't

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.070 
whoa that was weird okay that wasn't
what<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.800> was<00:05:06.950> trying<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.160> do<00:05:07.310> but<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.610> was<00:05:07.700> cool

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
what I was trying to do but it was cool

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.540 
what I was trying to do but it was cool
just<00:05:09.080> try<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.260> surface<00:05:09.560> underneath<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.950> log<00:05:10.190> and

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
just try to surface underneath a log and

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.530 
just try to surface underneath a log and
then<00:05:10.670> eventually<00:05:10.880> it<00:05:11.600> should<00:05:13.150> come<00:05:14.150> on<00:05:14.300> why<00:05:14.480> is

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
then eventually it should come on why is

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.650 
then eventually it should come on why is
it<00:05:14.720> gonna<00:05:14.900> do<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.200> now<00:05:15.910> why<00:05:16.910> is<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.180> not<00:05:17.390> going

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
it gonna do it now why is it not going

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.020 
it gonna do it now why is it not going
to<00:05:17.750> do<00:05:17.840> with<00:05:17.960> him<00:05:18.140> why<00:05:18.650> isn't<00:05:18.800> oh<00:05:19.130> well<00:05:19.610> there's

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.090 
to do with him why isn't oh well there's
a<00:05:20.120> Khandala<00:05:20.660> going<00:05:20.930> through<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.230> roads<00:05:21.440> well

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
a Khandala going through the roads well

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.980 
a Khandala going through the roads well
long<00:05:22.370> story<00:05:22.400> short<00:05:22.790> if<00:05:23.300> you<00:05:23.480> try<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.690> surface

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
long story short if you try to surface

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.800 
long story short if you try to surface
under<00:05:24.170> an<00:05:24.260> object<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.740> do<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:24.980> just<00:05:25.550> right<00:05:25.810> you

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
under an object and do it just right you

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.870 
under an object and do it just right you
will<00:05:26.990> actually<00:05:27.230> get<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.740> point<00:05:27.890> where<00:05:28.190> you

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
will actually get to the point where you

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.350 
will actually get to the point where you
will<00:05:29.090> basically<00:05:30.280> get<00:05:31.280> stuck<00:05:31.580> underwater<00:05:31.850> and

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
will basically get stuck underwater and

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.850 
will basically get stuck underwater and
it<00:05:32.450> will<00:05:32.570> think<00:05:32.810> that<00:05:32.990> there's<00:05:33.290> no<00:05:33.470> water<00:05:33.650> at

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
it will think that there's no water at

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.960 
it will think that there's no water at
all<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.220> you're<00:05:34.310> just<00:05:34.340> walking<00:05:34.640> on<00:05:34.880> the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970
