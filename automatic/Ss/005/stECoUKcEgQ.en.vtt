00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 saw teeth in our 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.790
 good HDTVs 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.010
 friends today we will talk about these 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.380
 imperfections that occur in tv's 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.509
 hd and are these annoying teeth that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 appear at the edges of the games and 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.310
 Today we 'll talk about that good these 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.830
 televisions come like this and it's something that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.230
 can solve since this only happens 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 when we use them in a ps3 console 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.170
 or xbox 360 if you have a led that at the same 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 time is monitor place it in your 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.730
 computer and you'll see that it looks perfect and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.410
 no saw teeth the only bad thing 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.360
 of all this is that these annoying 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.190
 saw teeth can only be 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 decrease perhaps by a large percentage 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.930
 but almost never disappear completely 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.719
 has much to do also the brand of 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.239
 your led TV and now we will see how 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.670
 solve it fuck three simple ways 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.010
 to decrease this problem first the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 sharpness half is the we go down to what 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.640
 minimum do not worry 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.859
 you will see that everything is blurred is there 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 where you have to start increasing it 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.699
 until it looks nice to your eyes 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.159
 but also seeing that they disappear 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.260
 these teeth may not disappear from the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.870
 everything but must 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.170
 to be better later we will see with 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.120
 more detail this second distance you should 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.460
 put you on television twice 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.170
 the width of the screen at least but 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.050
 at least or otherwise keep scoring 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.940
 teeth and imperfections several what 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.620
 recommended by the norm that I do not even 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.660
 agreement what it was called is that the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.700
 distance should be twice and 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.860
 average the width of your screen by 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.490
 example I have a 22 inch led 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.160
 which measures 55 centimeters and I play at 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.410
 almost one and a half meters and if you're like me 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.870
 who likes to play like he's in 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.060
 PC almost glued his eyes to the screen 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.610
 you will have to buy a screen 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.920
 smaller something like 19 inches 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.479
 as a maximum otherwise you should 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240
 place you at the distance that you 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.490
 I recommend you should already notice a great 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.080
 difference and if you're not happy 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.600
 I will give away a pack with patterns of 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.880
 Calibration of HD TVs and these 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.340
 patterns are down here and they're all 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.530
 in full hd in the description of the video and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.479
 If you do not know how to use them I leave you here 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.520
 arribita a link where I explain how 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.500
 use them to make your screen stay 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.570
 I hope I have helped you 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.120
 and if it was so do not forget to give me a 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.250
