myself to one every other day because I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.270 
myself to one every other day because I
imagine<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.110> quite<00:01:46.320> unhealthy<00:01:46.619> drinking<00:01:47.159> it

helps<00:01:47.520> me<00:01:47.640> focus<00:01:47.790> though<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.509> obviously<00:01:48.930> it's

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
helps me focus though now obviously it's

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.539 
helps me focus though now obviously it's
an<00:01:49.170> energy<00:01:49.500> drink<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> placebo

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
an energy drink but I think the placebo

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.100 
an energy drink but I think the placebo
effect<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.939> involved<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.479> well<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
effect is involved as well because the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.300 
effect is involved as well because the
taste<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.770> knowing<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.100> I'm

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
taste of it and knowing that I'm

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
taste of it and knowing that I'm
drinking<00:01:53.490> an<00:01:53.729> energy<00:01:54.060> drink<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.570> gives

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
drinking an energy drink it just gives

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.660 
drinking an energy drink it just gives
me<00:01:55.200> extra<00:01:55.530> energy<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.070> suddenly<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.640> just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
me extra energy and suddenly it just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.730 
me extra energy and suddenly it just
puts<00:01:57.090> me<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.390> mindset<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.960> focusing<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
puts me in the mindset of focusing and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.560 
puts me in the mindset of focusing and
working<00:01:59.430> hard<00:01:59.700> even<00:01:59.909> though<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.240> aware<00:02:00.509> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
working hard even though I'm aware that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.510 
working hard even though I'm aware that
it's<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.229> placebo<00:02:01.380> effect<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.310> could

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's just a placebo effect and I could

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.359 
it's just a placebo effect and I could
just<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.790> drinking<00:02:03.149> flavored<00:02:03.540> water<00:02:04.040> it<00:02:05.040> works

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
just be drinking flavored water it works

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.700 
just be drinking flavored water it works
so<00:02:05.880> why<00:02:06.060> not<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.479> try<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> find<00:02:07.110> ways<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.320> help<00:02:07.649> me

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
so why not I try to find ways to help me

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.380 
so why not I try to find ways to help me
be<00:02:07.829> more<00:02:07.860> productive<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.610> work<00:02:08.759> better<00:02:09.000> but

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
be more productive and work better but

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.650 
be more productive and work better but
without<00:02:09.690> relying<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.530> too<00:02:10.739> much<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.250> don't

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
without relying on it too much I don't

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.630 
without relying on it too much I don't
rely<00:02:11.990> on<00:02:12.020> energy<00:02:12.530> drinks<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.980> stay<00:02:13.190> awake<00:02:13.430> I

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
rely on energy drinks to stay awake I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.190 
rely on energy drinks to stay awake I
don't<00:02:13.820> want<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.030> rely<00:02:14.300> on<00:02:14.330> caffeine<00:02:14.960> in<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
don't want to rely on caffeine in the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.140 
don't want to rely on caffeine in the
morning<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.650> get<00:02:15.800> me<00:02:15.950> up<00:02:16.040> queens<00:02:16.820> really

morning to get me up queens really

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.940 
morning to get me up queens really
should<00:02:17.330> clean<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.870> outside<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> windows

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
should clean the outside of the windows

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.500 
should clean the outside of the windows
better<00:02:19.250> that's<00:02:19.520> all<00:02:19.670> on<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.850> other<00:02:20.030> side<00:02:20.270> that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
better that's all on the other side that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.450 
better that's all on the other side that
is<00:02:20.750> awful<00:02:21.200> when<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> Sun<00:02:21.620> shines<00:02:21.890> through<00:02:22.070> you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
is awful when the Sun shines through you

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.430 
is awful when the Sun shines through you
can<00:02:22.700> really<00:02:23.000> see<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:23.300> still<00:02:23.720> working<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.350> my

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
can really see it still working on my

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.010 
can really see it still working on my
dissertation<00:02:24.650> got<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.760> Wednesday<00:02:26.570> meeting

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
dissertation got the Wednesday meeting

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.610 
dissertation got the Wednesday meeting
in<00:02:27.730> about<00:02:28.730> half<00:02:29.480> an<00:02:29.630> hour<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.230> formulas

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
in about half an hour then the formulas

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.840 
in about half an hour then the formulas
straight<00:02:30.860> after<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.460> should<00:02:31.670> probably

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
straight after so I should probably

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.390 
straight after so I should probably
start<00:02:32.300> getting<00:02:32.510> ready<00:02:32.810> for<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.200> now<00:02:33.470> it

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
start getting ready for that now it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.250 
start getting ready for that now it
happens<00:02:34.820> straight<00:02:35.150> after<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.600> meeting<00:02:35.960> so<00:02:36.200> I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
happens straight after the meeting so I

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.950 
happens straight after the meeting so I
just<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.590> change<00:02:36.890> now<00:02:38.200> otherwise<00:02:39.200> our<00:02:39.410> my<00:02:39.740> time

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
just a change now otherwise our my time

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.480 
just a change now otherwise our my time
like<00:02:41.960> I<00:02:42.080> said<00:02:42.290> before<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.770> can<00:02:42.800> technically

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
like I said before you can technically

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.250 
like I said before you can technically
wear<00:02:43.730> anything<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:44.420> want<00:02:44.720> as<00:02:44.900> long<00:02:45.020> as<00:02:45.140> you've
