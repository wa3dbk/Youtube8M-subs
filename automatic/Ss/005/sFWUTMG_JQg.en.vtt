or<00:01:28.920> probably<00:01:29.430> longer<00:01:29.640> than<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
or probably longer than that now that I

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
or probably longer than that now that I
think<00:01:30.390> about<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.049> course<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.950> predates

pilot<00:01:49.680> minifigure<00:01:50.250> folds<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.829> like<00:01:52.829> so

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
pilot minifigure folds up just like so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.969 
pilot minifigure folds up just like so
pops<00:01:54.420> right<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.799> put

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
pops right in there and then you can put

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.990 
pops right in there and then you can put
the<00:01:56.159> top<00:01:56.310> right<00:01:57.180> back<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:58.159> on<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.670> side<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> the

the top right back on on the side of the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.330 
the top right back on on the side of the
aircraft<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:00.899> are<00:02:00.990> windows

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
aircraft you can see there are windows

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.580 
aircraft you can see there are windows
into<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.369> sort<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> cockpit<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.990> well<00:02:04.500> as

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
into the sort of cockpit as well as

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.649 
into the sort of cockpit as well as
these<00:02:04.799> lights<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.340> which<00:02:05.490> maybe<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:06.479> going

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
these lights here which maybe I'm going

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.819 
these lights here which maybe I'm going
to<00:02:06.719> call<00:02:06.899> them<00:02:07.020> headlights<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.680> look

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
to call them headlights but they look

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.139 
to call them headlights but they look
like<00:02:07.860> some<00:02:08.160> sort<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.429> visual<00:02:08.610> lights<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
like some sort of visual lights so that

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.559 
like some sort of visual lights so that
the<00:02:09.270> pilot<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.569> see<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:11.310> also<00:02:11.459> has<00:02:11.580> landing

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
the pilot can see it also has landing

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.050 
the pilot can see it also has landing
gear<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
gear that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.060 
gear that
you<00:02:14.450> know<00:02:14.570> function<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.260> wheels<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:15.800> does<00:02:15.950> not

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
you know function as wheels but does not

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.860 
you know function as wheels but does not
stow<00:02:16.430> into<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.850> aircraft<00:02:17.270> although<00:02:17.570> they've

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
stow into the aircraft although they've

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.270 
stow into the aircraft although they've
made<00:02:18.050> some<00:02:18.260> design<00:02:18.410> elements<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:18.980> make<00:02:19.190> it

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
made some design elements that make it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.390 
made some design elements that make it
look<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.730> folded<00:02:20.060> out<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.620> singular

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
look like it folded out it is a singular

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.430 
look like it folded out it is a singular
wheel<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.000> front<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.330> then<00:02:23.660> dual<00:02:23.900> wheels

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
wheel on the front and then dual wheels

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.370 
wheel on the front and then dual wheels
on<00:02:24.740> either<00:02:24.920> side<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> back<00:02:25.960> then<00:02:26.960> towards

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
on either side of the back then towards

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.110 
on either side of the back then towards
the<00:02:27.470> tail<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.250> get<00:02:28.370> these<00:02:28.550> sort<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.850> stubby

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
the tail you get these sort of stubby

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.450 
the tail you get these sort of stubby
little<00:02:29.330> tail<00:02:29.810> fins<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.890> think<00:02:31.160> they<00:02:31.250> could<00:02:31.370> have

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
little tail fins I think they could have

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.100 
little tail fins I think they could have
been<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.580> bit<00:02:31.760> bigger<00:02:31.940> but<00:02:32.270> they<00:02:32.390> come<00:02:32.540> with<00:02:32.570> red

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
been a bit bigger but they come with red

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.230 
been a bit bigger but they come with red
guidance<00:02:33.470> lights<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> back<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.340> then<00:02:35.210> you

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
guidance lights on the back and then you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.510 
guidance lights on the back and then you
get<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.200> rear<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.650> cargo<00:02:37.220> bay<00:02:37.370> that

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
get in the rear a cargo bay that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.520 
get in the rear a cargo bay that
actually<00:02:37.880> opens<00:02:38.240> up<00:02:38.360> what<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.140> can<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.470> you

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
actually opens up what you can do is you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.810 
actually opens up what you can do is you
can<00:02:39.620> taking<00:02:39.920> canisters<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.520> come<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:40.760> a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
can taking canisters that come with a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.750 
can taking canisters that come with a
set<00:02:41.030> put<00:02:41.960> them<00:02:42.080> right<00:02:42.230> inside<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.370> close<00:02:43.610> it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
set put them right inside and close it

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.800

up<00:02:47.830> then<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:48.950> course<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.370> other<00:02:49.810> major

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
up then of course the other major

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.930 
up then of course the other major
feature<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.440> set<00:02:51.740> is<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.310> air<00:02:52.640> strip

you<00:03:04.640> also<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:05.090> three<00:03:05.330> canisters<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.840> come

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
you also get three canisters that come

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.350 
you also get three canisters that come
to<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.230> set<00:03:06.440> one<00:03:06.920> gray<00:03:07.160> one<00:03:07.490> red<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.910> one<00:03:07.970> blue

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
and they all together can fit inside the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.970 
and they all together can fit inside the
aircraft<00:03:11.510> if<00:03:12.020> you<00:03:12.140> stack<00:03:12.380> these<00:03:12.530> two<00:03:12.709> on<00:03:12.800> top

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
aircraft if you stack these two on top

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.310

of<00:03:13.130> each<00:03:13.250> other<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.700> then<00:03:14.570> get<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:14.930> sort<00:03:15.230> of

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
of each other you then get this sort of

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.620 
of each other you then get this sort of
fuel<00:03:15.830> can<00:03:16.100> here<00:03:16.370> which<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:16.670> probably<00:03:17.150> used<00:03:17.420> for

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
fuel can here which is probably used for

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.120 
fuel can here which is probably used for
filling<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.080> aircraft<00:03:18.500> it's<00:03:18.800> got<00:03:19.010> the

pieces used to make the wind turbine
they're<00:03:39.709> sort<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.040> two<00:03:40.340> by<00:03:40.550> two<00:03:40.610> by<00:03:40.910> five<00:03:41.350> sort

they're sort of two by two by five sort
of<00:03:42.410> straw<00:03:42.680> elements<00:03:43.130> here<00:03:43.370> but<00:03:43.880> they're<00:03:44.030> using

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
of straw elements here but they're using

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.940 
of straw elements here but they're using
a<00:03:44.360> unique<00:03:44.690> combination<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.470> don't<00:03:45.680> see<00:03:45.890> in

a ton of sets and I think these are some

a radio dial so you can tell this set
was<00:04:02.090> designed<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.780> 90s<00:04:04.030> then<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.150> course

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
was designed in the 90s then of course

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.170 
was designed in the 90s then of course
on<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.750> building<00:04:06.140> itself<00:04:06.440> they<00:04:07.160> use<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.640> lot<00:04:07.970> of

the outback presumably the desert so

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.060 
the outback presumably the desert so
it's<00:04:17.570> getting<00:04:17.720> beat<00:04:17.989> on<00:04:18.140> by<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.410> Sun<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.010> the

it's getting beat on by the Sun and the

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.490 
it's getting beat on by the Sun and the
land<00:04:19.280> it's<00:04:19.519> kind<00:04:19.729> of<00:04:19.790> falling<00:04:20.090> apart<00:04:20.500> get

land it's kind of falling apart get

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.290 
land it's kind of falling apart get
these<00:04:21.680> opening<00:04:22.130> windows<00:04:22.460> here

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.090 

which<00:04:26.300> are<00:04:26.450> nice<00:04:26.690> sort<00:04:27.200> of<00:04:27.230> green<00:04:27.500> lattice<00:04:27.980> a

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
which are nice sort of green lattice a

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.250 
which are nice sort of green lattice a
color<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.550> don't<00:04:28.790> see<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> lot<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:30.110> look

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
color that I don't see a lot you look

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.620 
color that I don't see a lot you look
inside<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.740> carport<00:04:31.340> here<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:32.270> get<00:04:32.390> some

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
inside the carport here you get some

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.690 
inside the carport here you get some
sort<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.870> radio<00:04:33.320> here<00:04:33.710> probably<00:04:34.070> used<00:04:34.490> for

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
sort of radio here probably used for

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.100 
sort of radio here probably used for
communicating<00:04:35.210> with<00:04:35.330> other<00:04:35.510> vehicles<00:04:35.750> or

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
communicating with other vehicles or

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.500 
communicating with other vehicles or
planes<00:04:36.350> in<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.590> area<00:04:36.890> I<00:04:37.100> believe<00:04:37.820> this<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.270> one

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
planes in the area I believe this is one

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.670 
planes in the area I believe this is one
of<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.660> radios<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.140> trucker<00:04:39.440> would

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
of the radios that a trucker would

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.940 
of the radios that a trucker would
typically<00:04:39.950> use<00:04:40.930> if<00:04:41.930> we<00:04:42.080> turn<00:04:42.290> around<00:04:42.560> all<00:04:42.740> the

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
typically use if we turn around all the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.520 
typically use if we turn around all the
way<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:44.360> of<00:04:44.510> course<00:04:44.720> get<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:45.230> sort<00:04:45.470> of

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
way you of course get this sort of

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.920 
way you of course get this sort of
coffee<00:04:45.920> cup<00:04:46.250> here<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.360> believe<00:04:47.630> there<00:04:47.840> is

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
coffee cup here and I believe there is

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.690 
coffee cup here and I believe there is
some<00:04:48.080> sort<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.350> flag<00:04:48.560> or<00:04:48.740> something<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:49.160> goes

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
some sort of flag or something that goes

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.600 
some sort of flag or something that goes
there<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.060> don't<00:04:50.330> know<00:04:50.510> where<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:50.870> went

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
there I don't know where that went

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.800 
there I don't know where that went
of<00:04:52.610> course<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.940> inside<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.360> pretty<00:04:53.540> simple

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
of course the inside is pretty simple

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.620 
of course the inside is pretty simple
nothing<00:04:54.080> really<00:04:54.350> special<00:04:54.680> about<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.640> then

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
nothing really special about it and then

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.390 
nothing really special about it and then
of<00:04:56.720> course<00:04:56.960> on<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.200> top<00:04:57.470> you<00:04:57.740> get<00:04:57.890> these<00:04:58.100> large

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
of course on the top you get these large

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.370 
of course on the top you get these large
sort<00:04:58.790> of<00:04:58.910> slanted<00:04:59.360> elements<00:04:59.750> here<00:04:59.960> that<00:05:00.260> has

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
sort of slanted elements here that has

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.240 
sort of slanted elements here that has
little<00:05:00.680> shingle<00:05:01.190> details<00:05:01.550> in<00:05:01.730> it<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:03.440> is

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
little shingle details in it and that is

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.540 
little shingle details in it and that is
the<00:05:04.430> entirety<00:05:04.790> of<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.300> outback<00:05:05.630> airstrip<00:05:06.200> and

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
the entirety of the outback airstrip and

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.060 
the entirety of the outback airstrip and
this<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:08.240> I<00:05:09.080> know<00:05:09.140> I<00:05:09.290> made<00:05:09.590> some<00:05:09.620> sort<00:05:10.010> of

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
this and I know I made some sort of

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.130 
this and I know I made some sort of
things<00:05:10.220> similar<00:05:10.520> before<00:05:10.730> but<00:05:11.510> this<00:05:11.690> is<00:05:11.900> one<00:05:12.110> of

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
things similar before but this is one of

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.500 
things similar before but this is one of
my<00:05:12.380> favorite<00:05:13.130> sets<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.580> all<00:05:13.760> time<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.360> the

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
my favorite sets of all time and the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.600 
my favorite sets of all time and the
reason<00:05:14.690> being<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.410> back<00:05:15.980> when<00:05:16.130> it<00:05:16.220> came<00:05:16.340> out<00:05:16.490> in

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
reason being is back when it came out in

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.020 
reason being is back when it came out in
the<00:05:16.700> 1990s<00:05:17.060> because<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:17.840> was<00:05:17.960> born<00:05:18.200> in<00:05:18.530> 1993<00:05:19.220> so

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030
