00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.359
 inhibit wall and products were two 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.070
 that is, they were rehn park and ata schmidt 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.840
 this is the most famous saying wall is 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 what everyone knows when 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.109

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.270
 I think it's really really 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.180
 fantastic however a word book come 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.190
 talk about kart carter this girl who 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.649

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.750
 twin sister brand she would have are 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.180
 been together for life 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.010
 practically inseparable but in college 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.300
 take cdu don't stay in the room with the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.980
 sister just to learn new 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.309
 people which is completely right 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.170
 but cat goes into the ball because he doesn't want to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.580
 share the room with nobody else 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 he doesn't want to make friends because she is 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.630
 very shy and just want to stay 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.670
 on computer and write fan fiction on 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.119
 simon and base which are two characters of 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.850
 a fantasy book that she madly loves 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.150
 let's say it's a version of me in the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.060
 2009 when we harry potter papers 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.869
 really very closed it is hard to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.030
 to reconcile with his partner of 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.430
 reagan room that a girl a little in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.320
 meat with dyed red hair that does not 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.750
 does nothing but go to tests and who brings i 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.970
 guys in cause for which you go there go it is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.220
 a very tall blond boy who 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.689
 really cute sweet that smiles 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.689
 always everyone and that is practically a 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.340
 great boy and therefore begins 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.810
 the college kata adventure of how 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.360
 relates to other people from 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.950
 as it does not to be precise of the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.540
 fan fiction writing courses that 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.090
 follows of his meetings of his 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.180
 chatter together and with rega and all 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.130
 what happens in here 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.800
 obviously I don't want to spoil you 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.300
 therefore I cannot speak profusely 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.190
 but in the book I can tell you that the star is 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.810
 beautiful that characters are 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.510
 beautiful that anyway you can 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.300
 relate a lot especially for 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.220
 me at least a little go there a little cat too 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.140
 a little reagan to which their behaviors 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.350
 they are so natural they seem 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.600
 really serious people that is 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.420
 difficult sometimes writes in a book 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.550
 characters that can be related to many 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.740
 sometimes there are perfect girls or boys 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.140
 perfect here is not true they are not there 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.690
 beautiful they are not perfect today have 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.910
 a thousand flaws that are noticeable 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.380
 marked a lot so it's in things 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.570
 to read more as I read this 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.580
 book the nice thing is that between a 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.950
 chapter and the next are inserted 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.230
 pieces of history of this gemmati 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.930
 lesbians the base salmon author that is 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.250
 the book of which ca writes fan fiction 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.690
 and then there are also pieces of 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.910
 science fiction written cat 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.100
 so it's really interesting to be able to 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.380
 read both history and fan fiction 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.550
 is the book from which they are drawn 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.260
 this book is a very big one 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.120
 really good character really one 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.310
 character development that's a lot 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.000
 important for stand alone or i 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.400
 books that have only one teaching that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.200
 will be 21 you can do because I am one 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.959
 only that many a year 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.350
 times it falls development of the books stand 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.080
 halo 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.010
 there is not so much in this yes and it is so 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.989
 too much and it's beautiful but it's enough 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.790
 words to describe the bd re moro is 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.310
 but this is really fantastic 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.610
 and finally there is the book on a fender 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.500
 a book about a girl sclera on a 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.270
 book the girl who loves to read the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.420
 protagonist who is not perfect also 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.440
 full of defects than a social worm 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.140
 that suffers from anxiety that is finally there 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.840
 a character where many of us and many 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.560
 of you I suppose I can relate to 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.110
 serious and I loved it oh my god 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.130
 characters like I said are so there 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.670
 so we succeed in King lazio 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.650
 so that one cannot fail to become attached 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.360
 not even the children are fond of each other 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.920
 characters of sanremo raised that they are 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.750
 those of the fan fiction ie a thing 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.060
 unbelievable then at the moment is this 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.150
 book read in English some small 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.070
 cue on the language then this book 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.610
 it is really written in a simple way 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.540
 because anyway the guys that are 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.500
 represented in this book have 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.570
 around 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.390
 the 18 and 21 years therefore the language does not 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.390
 it's very pretentious but there are some 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.370
 moments when words are a bit in 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.340
 meat goes for example when ca writes 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.710
 fan fiction there are a lot of words 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.710
 who probably has a level 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.990
 medium to low English will not know why 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.610
 when you write there are a lot of 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.100
 for example English ways of saying 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.420
 to watch there is to look fixed to look with 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.910
 the wide open mouth look at those 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.820
 a lot of frowning eyebrows e 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.250
 this writings practically everyone though 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.800
 according to me with a bit of attention a little 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.840
 of ricciardi side perhaps he has anyway 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.670
 the application of English can be read 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.590
 quietly here if you want to read in 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.420
 English absolutely believe because 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.160
 the most important thing in this 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.290
 book unleashed on me was the urge 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.240
 to write as soon as you finish reading it 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.310
 I ran to the computer to write 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.620
 something of my own a story and I think that 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.170
 both the most beautiful reaction and a book 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.050
 can let a book leave you with 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.030
 the bitter taste can leave you happy 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.980
 can let you sad can leave you 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.630
 nostalgic and then there are those books that 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.520
 make you want to write like 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.800
 those already ndrina or then rainbow roel 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.390
 so thank you so much and if 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.250
 some of you read the proof of it 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.530
 same please write to me why 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.360
 so I don't feel like the only goat in the world 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.110
 who wants to write after reading a 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.120
 rainbow book 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.620
 I hope he enjoyed the review 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.340
 clearly I couldn't do much 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:53.690
 depth because I didn't want to pull it out 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.880
 spoiler so I hope he sees comito 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.390
 loses in the book that is now we are high 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.390
 Hello
