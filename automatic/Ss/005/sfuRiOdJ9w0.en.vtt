very<00:00:29.580> very<00:00:29.880> vague<00:00:30.210> hence<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.109> how<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
very very vague hence as to how to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.450 
very very vague hence as to how to
proceed<00:00:33.320> there<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.440> only<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.890> way<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> proceed

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
proceed there is only one way to proceed

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.940 
proceed there is only one way to proceed
to<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> Faust<00:00:36.480> trial<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.260> that's<00:00:37.590> through<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
to a Faust trial and that's through the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.030 
to a Faust trial and that's through the
corridor<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> being<00:00:39.170> which<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.890> see

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
corridor of being which as you can see

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.420 
corridor of being which as you can see
it's<00:00:42.000> clearly<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.660> poisonous<00:00:43.350> corridor<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's clearly a poisonous corridor and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.770 
it's clearly a poisonous corridor and
sure<00:00:45.420> enough<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:46.620> end<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:46.950> getting<00:00:47.160> rot<00:00:47.780> but

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
sure enough we end up getting rot but

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
sure enough we end up getting rot but
don't<00:00:49.140> fret<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:49.440> by<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> end<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
don't fret because by the end of this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.660 
don't fret because by the end of this
trial<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:52.230> cured<00:00:52.770> ourselves<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.489> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
trial we will have cured ourselves of it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.869 
trial we will have cured ourselves of it
so<00:00:54.120> don't<00:00:54.239> worry<00:00:54.420> too<00:00:54.570> much<00:00:54.719> about<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
so don't worry too much about it

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
so don't worry too much about it
our<00:00:56.879> first<00:00:57.300> puzzle<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> chamber<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
our first puzzle is on the chamber of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
our first puzzle is on the chamber of
buttons<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.359> trial<00:01:00.600> statue<00:01:00.989> here

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
buttons which the trial statue here

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.100 
buttons which the trial statue here
gives<00:01:02.010> us<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> very<00:01:02.430> vague<00:01:02.760> hem<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.329> something

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
gives us a very vague hem of something

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.580 
gives us a very vague hem of something
to<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.530> balance<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> weights<00:01:06.200> also<00:01:07.200> be

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to do with balance and weights also be

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.020 
to do with balance and weights also be
careful<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.340> because<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:08.970> see

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
careful here because as you can see

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.480 
careful here because as you can see
there's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.540> couple<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> mains<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.189> here

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
there's a couple of mains that up here

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.920 
there's a couple of mains that up here
obviously<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.420> got<00:01:12.600> high<00:01:12.720> enough

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
obviously I've got high enough

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
obviously I've got high enough
perception<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> notice<00:01:14.040> them<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.460> yeah<00:01:14.909> just

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
perception to notice them but yeah just

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.950 
perception to notice them but yeah just
walk<00:01:15.680> carefully<00:01:16.680> around<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.780> move

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
walk carefully around them so as we move

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.899 
walk carefully around them so as we move
further<00:01:19.200> into<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> room<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
further into the room we can see that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.789 
further into the room we can see that
our<00:01:21.030> path<00:01:21.299> there's<00:01:21.659> no<00:01:21.810> blocked<00:01:22.140> by<00:01:22.439> four

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
our path there's no blocked by four

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
our path there's no blocked by four
force<00:01:23.220> fields<00:01:23.790> which<00:01:24.570> should<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.869> obvious<00:01:25.200> we

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
force fields which should be obvious we

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.920 
force fields which should be obvious we
need<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.710> rid<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.570> by

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
need to get rid of and we can do this by

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.410 
need to get rid of and we can do this by
using<00:01:27.990> these<00:01:28.619> panels<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> floor

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
using these panels here on the floor

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.260 
using these panels here on the floor
there<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.380> four<00:01:31.740> pressure<00:01:32.070> plates<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.759> total

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
there are four pressure plates in total

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
there are four pressure plates in total
and<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.110> may<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.259> already<00:01:34.530> guessed<00:01:34.770> they

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and as you may have already guessed they

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.850 
and as you may have already guessed they
all<00:01:35.460> need<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> particular<00:01:36.600> weight<00:01:36.930> upon<00:01:37.590> them

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
all need a particular weight upon them

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.700 
all need a particular weight upon them
we'll<00:01:38.820> start<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> smallest<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.020> here

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
we'll start with the smallest one here

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.910 
we'll start with the smallest one here
which<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.610> needs<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.479> 1<00:01:42.899> kilogram<00:01:43.200> weight

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
which actually needs a 1 kilogram weight

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.420 
which actually needs a 1 kilogram weight
on<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.570> obviously<00:01:46.530> every<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> tune<00:01:47.189> weighs<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
on it so obviously every a tune weighs a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.359 
on it so obviously every a tune weighs a
certain<00:01:48.060> amount<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.470> candles<00:01:49.950> here

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
certain amount and the candles here

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.850 
certain amount and the candles here
which<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.450> cut<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.020> drag<00:01:52.380> into<00:01:52.710> your

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
which you can just cut in drag into your

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.310 
which you can just cut in drag into your
inventory<00:01:53.659> weighs<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:55.110> kilogram

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
inventory weighs one kilogram

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.070 
inventory weighs one kilogram
so<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:57.010> can<00:01:57.190> just<00:01:57.400> put<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.790> up<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.750> Napoli

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
so we can just put that up on Napoli

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.260 
so we can just put that up on Napoli
about<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.670> know<00:02:00.790> you've<00:02:00.970> got<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
about and you know you've got the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.570 
about and you know you've got the
correct<00:02:01.540> way<00:02:01.840> upon<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.440> plate<00:02:02.710> as<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.370> comes

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
correct way upon the plate as it comes

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.010 
correct way upon the plate as it comes
up<00:02:03.760> click<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.780> also<00:02:05.260> makes<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.650> click<00:02:05.890> noise

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.760 

their<00:02:10.620> next<00:02:11.040> panel<00:02:11.460> here<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.750> 2<00:02:13.020> kilogram

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
their next panel here as a 2 kilogram

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
their next panel here as a 2 kilogram
panel<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.970> might<00:02:15.120> be<00:02:15.240> thinking<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.810> need

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
panel and you might be thinking you need

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.230 
panel and you might be thinking you need
something<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.860> was<00:02:17.040> specifically<00:02:17.880> 2

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
something that was specifically 2

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.440 
something that was specifically 2
kilograms<00:02:18.900> well<00:02:19.710> what<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.210> just

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
kilograms well what you can do is just

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.900 
kilograms well what you can do is just
go<00:02:21.630> back<00:02:21.840> down<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.620> candles<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.340> we

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
go back down here to the candles as we

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.690 
go back down here to the candles as we
know<00:02:24.090> they<00:02:24.270> weigh<00:02:24.450> one<00:02:24.900> kilogram<00:02:24.930> each<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.920> we

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
know they weigh one kilogram each and we

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.900 
know they weigh one kilogram each and we
can<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:27.120> stack<00:02:27.540> those<00:02:28.230> candles<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.130> so

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
can just stack those candles on so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.500 
can just stack those candles on so
obviously<00:02:30.300> I'll<00:02:30.930> take<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:31.500> candles<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
obviously I'll take two candles and that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.150 
obviously I'll take two candles and that
should<00:02:33.780> work<00:02:38.990> there<00:02:39.990> next<00:02:40.500> panel<00:02:40.920> down<00:02:41.100> here

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
should work there next panel down here

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.530 
should work there next panel down here
as<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.870> 5<00:02:42.870> kilogram<00:02:43.290> panel<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.340> luckily<00:02:45.300> for<00:02:45.480> us

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
as a 5 kilogram panel and luckily for us

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.040 
as a 5 kilogram panel and luckily for us
those<00:02:46.080> RVs<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:48.000> weighs<00:02:48.750> exactly

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
those RVs just here which weighs exactly

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.990 
those RVs just here which weighs exactly
five<00:02:49.410> kilograms<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.790> just<00:02:50.970> pop<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.300> on

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.780 

the<00:02:58.600> final<00:02:59.140> panel<00:02:59.350> we<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.800> here<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the final panel we have here is the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.590 
the final panel we have here is the
largest<00:03:01.300> panel<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:03.580> one<00:03:03.850> needs<00:03:04.090> seven

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
largest panel and this one needs seven

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.410 
largest panel and this one needs seven
point<00:03:04.870> five<00:03:05.200> kilograms<00:03:06.060> specifically<00:03:07.060> yes

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
point five kilograms specifically yes

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.640 
point five kilograms specifically yes
it's<00:03:07.690> quite<00:03:07.890> tricky<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.220> one<00:03:09.930> what<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:10.960> do<00:03:11.140> as

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
it's quite tricky this one what I do as

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.880 
it's quite tricky this one what I do as
has<00:03:12.190> been<00:03:12.880> all<00:03:13.060> advised<00:03:13.660> weighs<00:03:14.470> five

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
has been all advised weighs five

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.010 
has been all advised weighs five
kilograms<00:03:15.750> we<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.900> actually<00:03:17.340> use<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.790> VARs

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
kilograms we can actually use the VARs

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.190 
kilograms we can actually use the VARs
as<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.080> container<00:03:20.740> obviously<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:22.810> have

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
as a container obviously and I have

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.960 
as a container obviously and I have
spare<00:03:23.620> books<00:03:23.890> but<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.310> can<00:03:24.460> use<00:03:24.610> anything

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
spare books but you can use anything

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.480 
spare books but you can use anything
here<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.510> make<00:03:25.690> up<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.080> 2.5<00:03:26.800> kilogram

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
here to make up the 2.5 kilogram

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.480 
here to make up the 2.5 kilogram
deference<00:03:28.260> those<00:03:29.260> things<00:03:29.530> also<00:03:29.860> those<00:03:30.250> books

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
deference those things also those books

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.420 
deference those things also those books
lying<00:03:30.730> around<00:03:30.910> here<00:03:31.390> but<00:03:32.020> what<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.400> just

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
lying around here but what I do is just

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.840 
lying around here but what I do is just
shove<00:03:34.090> four<00:03:34.480> books<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.930> here<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:36.250> make<00:03:36.459> up<00:03:36.700> the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
shove four books and here to make up the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.710 
shove four books and here to make up the
difference<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:38.770> will<00:03:38.980> no<00:03:39.220> we<00:03:39.580> seven<00:03:40.510> point

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
difference and it will no we seven point

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.810 
difference and it will no we seven point
five<00:03:40.900> kilograms<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:42.130> can<00:03:42.310> check<00:03:42.550> that

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
five kilograms we can check that

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.730 
five kilograms we can check that
obviously<00:03:43.270> by<00:03:43.450> Pitman<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:43.959> your<00:03:44.110> inventory

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
obviously by Pitman and your inventory

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.740 
obviously by Pitman and your inventory
again<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.610> can<00:03:45.760> see<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.060> specific<00:03:46.600> way

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
again and you can see this specific way

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.050 
again and you can see this specific way
and<00:03:46.990> you<00:03:47.650> just<00:03:47.830> put<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.160> on<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.490> panel<00:03:48.880> that

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
and you just put that on the panel that

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.840 
and you just put that on the panel that
will<00:03:49.090> click<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.650> make<00:03:50.830> your<00:03:51.010> way<00:03:51.190> to

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
will click and you can make your way to

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:01.610 
will click and you can make your way to
the<00:03:51.970> next<00:03:52.330> test

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.009 

we<00:04:02.160> are<00:04:02.280> greeted<00:04:02.670> by<00:04:02.700> another<00:04:03.180> trial<00:04:03.629> stature

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
we are greeted by another trial stature

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.740 
we are greeted by another trial stature
which<00:04:04.560> again<00:04:05.040> gives<00:04:05.370> us<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.640> very<00:04:06.000> very<00:04:06.420> vague

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
which again gives us a very very vague

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.830 
which again gives us a very very vague
hint<00:04:07.200> but<00:04:08.010> all<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:09.150> need<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.420> do<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:09.780> next

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
hint but all you need to do in this next

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.619 
hint but all you need to do in this next
room<00:04:10.349> and<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.650> has<00:04:10.769> very<00:04:11.069> sample<00:04:11.580> as<00:04:11.730> however

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
room and it has very sample as however

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.039 
room and it has very sample as however
we<00:04:12.840> look<00:04:13.410> around<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:15.090> when<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.390> first<00:04:15.569> enter

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
we look around so when you first enter

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.170 
we look around so when you first enter
it<00:04:16.229> you<00:04:16.650> see<00:04:17.160> these<00:04:17.340> levels<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:18.060> you're

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
it you see these levels and you're

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.930 
it you see these levels and you're
thinking<00:04:18.329> okay<00:04:18.900> digest<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.100> trial<00:04:20.519> in<00:04:20.699> and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
thinking okay digest is a trial in and

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.390 
thinking okay digest is a trial in and
I'll<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.180> keep<00:04:21.359> pressing<00:04:21.720> which<00:04:22.530> every<00:04:23.250> time

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
I'll just keep pressing which every time

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.290 
I'll just keep pressing which every time
you<00:04:23.520> do<00:04:23.669> make<00:04:23.880> an<00:04:24.030> ADA<00:04:25.130> demon<00:04:26.130> or<00:04:26.580> not<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
you do make an ADA demon or not you

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.270 
you do make an ADA demon or not you
something<00:04:28.080> appears<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.650> need<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.979> fate

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
something appears that you need to fate

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.340 
something appears that you need to fate
so<00:04:29.940> if<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.120> want<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.330> wee<00:04:30.479> fate<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.930> guess<00:04:31.199> you

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
so if you want a wee fate I guess you
