 Marvel had already anticipated that 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.480
 More morals would have their own series in 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.850
 the traditional universe and that peter 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.220
 would be his mentor that left the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.100
 uncertainty if that would be his new role 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.920
 and if it would stay that way but when it 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.470

 Peter has become a kind of icon 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.079

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.750

 originality but with an air of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.880
 freshness, it should be said that this is not all 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.239

 that that's all the changes are still in 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.930
 the marvel comics after the event if 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.510

 being a man although we can already 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.760
 expect anything my marvel 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.570

 scot rank villains is a is convicted 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.750
 and maybe it was not as reformed as 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.300
 it was thought although there might be a 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.050
 surprise out there the point is that what 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.110
 we will see on the other side the series of agents 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.770

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.120
 the tendency of influence 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.670
 cinematographic in the comics 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.169

 that yes we did not see it coming the x-men were 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.419
 they maintain despite what they said 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.669
 some rumors but things do not go 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.150
 good for them in the series 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.090
 extraordinary ex men storm will take the 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.460

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.639
 importance as cyclops have 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.560
 disappeared and apparently things do not 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.949
 they go well between mutants and 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.560
 inhuman this team will have between 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:08.069
 other characters with the young James Gray 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.400

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.930
 many stories to choose from but 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.690
 what do you think? 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.270
