00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
see how many holes there are in there

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139 
see how many holes there are in there
and<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.100> comes<00:01:50.369> out<00:01:50.520> too<00:01:50.640> fast<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.090> you

and it just comes out too fast and you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.190 
and it just comes out too fast and you
don't<00:01:51.299> want<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.540> much<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.930> your<00:01:52.049> hair

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.720 
you my fingers and then just rub it into
the<00:02:10.259> roots<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.619> my<00:02:10.739> hair<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.520> start

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
the roots of my hair and you can start

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.840 
the roots of my hair and you can start
to<00:02:11.910> see<00:02:12.060> in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
to see in

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.210 
to see in
what<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.630> doing<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:14.350> pretty<00:02:14.590> crazy<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
what this is doing it's pretty crazy and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.530 
what this is doing it's pretty crazy and
then<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.610> just<00:02:15.820> put<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> little<00:02:16.150> bit<00:02:16.300> through<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
then I just put a little bit through the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.570 
then I just put a little bit through the
lanes<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.770> if<00:02:17.860> you're<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.520> a

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
lanes so if you're going for like a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.160 
lanes so if you're going for like a
messy<00:02:18.940> hair<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.480> can't<00:02:19.690> even<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:19.930> leave

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
messy hair so you can't even just leave

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.420 
messy hair so you can't even just leave
it<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.410> this<00:02:20.440> obviously<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.070> see<00:02:21.100> how

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
it like this obviously you can see how

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.060 
it like this obviously you can see how
much<00:02:21.580> more<00:02:21.760> volume<00:02:21.910> I've<00:02:22.240> got<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.510> my<00:02:22.630> hand<00:02:22.660> out

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
I've been dragged through a hedge

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.110 
I've been dragged through a hedge
backwards<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.130> what<00:02:30.340> I'm<00:02:30.430> gonna<00:02:30.550> do<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.940> just

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
backwards so what I'm gonna do is just

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.170 
backwards so what I'm gonna do is just
brush<00:02:31.330> through<00:02:31.540> my<00:02:31.630> hair<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.030> goes

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
brush through my hair so that it goes

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.750 
brush through my hair so that it goes
back<00:02:34.480> nice<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.960> sleek<00:02:35.140> again

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.610 

and<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.420> can<00:02:43.540> see<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.870> pretty<00:02:44.200> much<00:02:44.319> just

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
and you can see that pretty much just

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.380 
and you can see that pretty much just
takes<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:44.950> back<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.129> how<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.459> was<00:02:45.489> before<00:02:45.760> but

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
takes it back to how it was before but

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.789 
takes it back to how it was before but

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
more volume wise than it was in the
