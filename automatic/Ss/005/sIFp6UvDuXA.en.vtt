00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 dear friends lovers athletes 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.500
 go rollerblading on the bike 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.510
 lovers jogging 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.559
 work out want to show you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.710
 your favorite backpack show his chips 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.380
 its advantages are the only backpack and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.689
 sporting which i was i can only 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.460
 just started rolling the role in order 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.109
 to transport them rollers 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.970
 and in principle, this backpack is just 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.740
 unique so I immediately fell in love 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.230
 a flea that i have a good friend 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.780
 who works in a sports store 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 goods and which are professional and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.550
 versed in good sporting things 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.550
 sorted me on the other backpacks and I 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.000
 it's very easy to give you some personal advice 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 the result if you are not familiar with this 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.280
 let's say a firm and so look firm 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.530
 doctor backpack cross i'm 18 to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.989
 so his first advantage is that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.820
 he is very light this backpack just 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.890
 incredibly light thanks to its 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.070
 thin in material but nonetheless 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.110
 plans and very durable despite the fact that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.540
 material is very thin as I just 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.780
 it dragged already sent the first videos 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.659
 themselves have a very large weight two 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.670
 video you here on the front under this one 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.009
 Here are the front rollers and more plus 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.340
 forever things yes here's a water bottle 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.680
 half liter here that is where weight 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.049
 deserved it never broke it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.610
 there are tightly sewn 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.860
 strong thread does not mean look 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.210
 the second advantage is its front 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.670
 panel folds down 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.100
 and under it you put me in a separate 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.280
 videos showed their roller clips 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.899
 skates poke this way 1 2 and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.970
 further close either here in your hectic 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.650
 member 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.490
 let's say if you're on a bike to tate 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:03.310
 headgear up 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.310
 ok let's go yes now i will fasten 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.280
 went further means noticed friends 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.890
 the next question is on top of the latch 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.960
 some kind of latch you understood something 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 there are two snakes don't you dare to works 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.150
 reverse on what 's the other side 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.880
 that is, you can start that one that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:35.930
 in the other direction here and snaps 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:41.120
 further plus it's a settling snake there 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:45.020
 carbine carbine for keys further on 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.720
 the big state is waiting for everyone and so 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.230
 it is clear that it is as big as 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.590
 church 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.570
 right here inside one sense big 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.400
 compartment 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.700
 he still has a small side pocket 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.010
 on the snake module code what else I wanted 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.550
 note this as if all this is something 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.519
 everywhere practically this backpack has 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.130
 such are the individual edges 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:14.239
 ventilation they are made see from such 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.670
 mesh inside porous goes foam 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.800
 such ribs it allows you to create 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.739
 here are the same complaints about which 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.750
 air is constantly wicked 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.140
 thanks to this one here is the grid trial and here 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.630
 porous foam rubber dice which 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.790
 year that is, the backpack does not give you 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.890
 possible to sweat when it is snug 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.430
 you to the back no matter how active you are 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.940

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.750
 blown seen rushes and he does not 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.260
 effect of some kind of fur coat you wore on 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.770
 back 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.100

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.340
 Deniska himself side pockets there on 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.510
 gum you can put let's say 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.020
 water bottle 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.150
 here there are specially or kidneys to 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.910
 run a tube of water over all 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.030
 a bottle of water from her tubules beat 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.400
 missed here this tube secured 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.650
 and so she does not hang out and continue to drink 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.959

 movable ribs and clips which 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.760
 regulated in their own way 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:41.040

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:44.310

 I adjust this latch 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.820
 and snap the backpack underneath that is in 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.540
