Japan, who are you? A documentary series by David-Minh TRA

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.780
Day 1 -     Capsule Hotel in Tokyo

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.440
I have just arrived to my capsule hotel,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.040
I 'm really tired, but I really want to show you

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.800
a little bit the place where I am...

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.860
This is the first time I sleep in a capsule hotel !

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.740
Look :

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.660
for now, I think the place is pretty funny!

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.660
I feel like ... you know when you are a cosmonaut,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.040
you sleep in a kind of capsule in the rocket ...

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.580
well, here is a little similar !

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.500
I am going to show you my room ...

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.880
I will not make too much noise ...

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.300
Capsule hotels are typical Japanese hotels,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.460
which have the particularity to fully optimize

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.740
the occupying space , and whose rooms are therefore limited

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.780
to a single cabin bed

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.980
The cabins of these hotels are built by a tube,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.460
usually made of plastic or fiberglass,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.540
and have an average area of ​​2 meters to 1,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.200
to a height of 1m25 .

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.260
And are often equipped with a TV, which is about the only activity

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.680
other than reading, sleeping or surfing on the internet .

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.840
In my cap , I try not to make too much noise,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.460
because there's people sleeping ...

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380
I can not do several things at once,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.680
because here I am ...

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.840
simultaneously responding on Facebook, and also

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.200
shooting video ...

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.360
I show you , there's a safe,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.260
a TV, and also a phone!

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.380
And about aeration, I am going to answer you, I found it

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.140
I do not know how it works but ...

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520
there's a vent pipe with a fan,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.200
that's it, I know how to turn on airing !!!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.240
it's super easy, look!

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.900
There's just this little button to press !

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.880
There you go !

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.700
And now I can fart in peace !!!

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.980
Capsule Hotels are "substitute" Hotels

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.880
The typical customer is indeed Japanese salaryman ,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.320
looking for a place to sleep after drinking too much with colleagues after work ,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.240
or people who missed their last train

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.300
to go home ...

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.700
First you must take off your shoes,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.520
and take the slippers.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.940
Well, it's time for me to go to sleep ...

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.980
I think we have a very busy day tomorrow!

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.820
The capsules are superimposed in groups of two ,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.620
and aligned along a corridor.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.000
The hotel size is variable and can offer fifty ,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.240
to over 700 caps !

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.200
Bye Bye !

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.800
Day 2      public bath : Sento

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.780
In the morning I wake up after a good night's sleep,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.560
and I begin by donning my yukata provided by the hotel .

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.780
I also discover ... life in a capsule hotel ,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.860
by discovering my neighbors ,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.800
and I prepare to take my first Japanese bathhouse

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.040
called Sento .

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.620
There are many places like this around the country .

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.060
In Japan , the bath is an art.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.120
As usual, there is a whole ritual associated with this activity.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.320
Before entering the bath , you need to wash your body.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.380
Feel free to rub hard!

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.100
to be continued...

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.100
