00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
same stitch where we did our two

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.529 
same stitch where we did our two
stitches

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.630 
neaten it off and we want to put because
we're<00:00:53.989> working<00:00:54.170> on<00:00:54.500> an<00:00:54.680> edge<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:55.399> not

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
we're working on an edge and it's not

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.660 
we're working on an edge and it's not
like<00:00:56.239> working<00:00:56.930> into<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.199> North<00:00:57.409> stitch

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.980 

sometimes<00:01:01.670> it's<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:01.969> bit<00:01:02.180> of<00:01:02.299> trial<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:02.750> error

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:04.990 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:15.190 

so<00:01:05.990> we're<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:06.140> working<00:01:10.149> into<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:14.050> into<00:01:15.050> the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
so we're just working into the into the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:27.390 
so we're just working into the into the
edge<00:01:15.350> there<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.830> our<00:01:15.979> stitches

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.030 

and<00:01:27.940> as<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.270> go<00:01:28.450> along<00:01:30.480> if<00:01:31.480> it<00:01:31.780> starts<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.290> curl

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
and as you go along if it starts to curl

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.630 
and as you go along if it starts to curl
up<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.490> sides<00:01:34.740> you'll<00:01:35.740> know<00:01:35.950> you<00:01:36.010> haven't<00:01:36.370> put

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
up the sides you'll know you haven't put

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.900 
up the sides you'll know you haven't put
enough<00:01:36.670> stitches<00:01:37.150> in<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.400> making

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
enough stitches in because it is making

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.170 
enough stitches in because it is making
it<00:01:40.030> too<00:01:40.270> tight<00:01:40.800> and<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:42.340> won't<00:01:42.580> lay<00:01:42.790> flat<00:01:45.180> so

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
it too tight and it won't lay flat so

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.700 
it too tight and it won't lay flat so
that's<00:01:46.330> kind<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.870> a<00:01:47.020> bit<00:01:47.290> of<00:01:48.840> hitting<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:52.710> you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
that's kind of a bit of hitting this you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.120 
that's kind of a bit of hitting this you
just<00:01:53.890> want<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.250> grab<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.720> stitches<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:59.560> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
just want to grab the stitches on the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:12.170 
just want to grab the stitches on the
edge

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.280 

so<00:02:12.810> I'm<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.079> working<00:02:13.319> along<00:02:14.689> I'm<00:02:15.689> trying<00:02:16.079> not

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
so I'm just working along I'm trying not

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
so I'm just working along I'm trying not
to<00:02:17.689> pull<00:02:18.689> off<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> big<00:02:19.140> loop<00:02:19.439> so<00:02:19.769> we<00:02:19.799> don't<00:02:20.129> want

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to pull off a big loop so we don't want

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.039 
to pull off a big loop so we don't want
it<00:02:20.400> work<00:02:20.579> into<00:02:21.030> there<00:02:21.299> because<00:02:21.480> then<00:02:21.780> that'll

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
it work into there because then that'll

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.750 
it work into there because then that'll
make<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.439> big<00:02:22.680> gap<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.180> I'm<00:02:24.299> just<00:02:24.599> sort<00:02:24.840> of

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.270 

working<00:02:30.290> trying<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.439> work<00:02:33.769> into<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.890> chains

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
working trying to work into the chains

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:45.530 
working trying to work into the chains
that<00:02:35.519> are<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.349> side<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:44.540> there

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
that are on the on the side there there

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.930 
that are on the on the side there there
is<00:02:45.690> an<00:02:45.870> exact<00:02:46.230> method<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.859> do<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.069> if<00:02:47.489> anybody

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
sort of always just guessed where to go

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.550

Nick to me and it's not crinkly up and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.559 
Nick to me and it's not crinkly up and
it's<00:03:01.680> lying<00:03:02.099> flat<00:03:02.810> which<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.840> good<00:03:04.230> news

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:16.979 

nearly<00:03:09.569> up<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.810> my<00:03:10.230> corner

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.559 

so<00:03:17.560> up<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.579> first<00:03:18.879> stitch<00:03:20.790> on<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.030> top<00:03:22.299> row

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
so up to the first stitch on the top row

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:30.380 
so up to the first stitch on the top row
and<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:25.780> just<00:03:25.959> want<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.379> work<00:03:27.510> three<00:03:28.510> single

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
and we just want to work three single

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.429 
and we just want to work three single
crochets<00:03:31.390> into<00:03:31.859> each<00:03:32.859> corner<00:03:34.139> because<00:03:35.139> we're

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
crochets into each corner because we're

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.740 
crochets into each corner because we're
wanting<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:37.469> border<00:03:38.469> to<00:03:38.650> go<00:03:38.829> around<00:03:39.219> the<00:03:40.150> corner

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
wanting a border to go around the corner

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.379 
wanting a border to go around the corner
that<00:03:41.200> makes<00:03:41.409> sense<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:42.489> don't<00:03:42.670> want<00:03:42.969> it<00:03:43.090> to

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
that makes sense you don't want it to

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.750 
that makes sense you don't want it to
scrunch<00:03:43.870> off<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.319> corner<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:44.980> make<00:03:45.219> it<00:03:45.459> curl

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
scrunch off the corner and make it curl

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.289 
scrunch off the corner and make it curl
over<00:03:46.030> like<00:03:46.659> so<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.950> want<00:03:48.129> it<00:03:48.189> to<00:03:48.340> lay<00:03:48.519> flat<00:03:48.909> so

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
over like so you want it to lay flat so

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.530 
over like so you want it to lay flat so
by<00:03:49.450> putting<00:03:49.689> in<00:03:49.900> those<00:03:50.079> three<00:03:50.560> stitches<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
by putting in those three stitches that

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.599 
by putting in those three stitches that
is<00:03:52.720> gonna<00:03:52.959> make<00:03:53.169> that<00:03:53.500> lay<00:03:54.329> flat<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.340> when<00:03:57.489> we

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
is gonna make that lay flat and when we
