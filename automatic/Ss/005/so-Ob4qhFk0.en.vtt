arms higher how to get that backflip

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.880 
arms higher how to get that backflip
coming<00:00:15.420> way<00:00:15.540> off<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.809> ground<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.320> here's<00:00:16.770> how

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
coming way off the ground so here's how

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.130 
coming way off the ground so here's how
we're<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.779> really

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
we're going to do it so this is a really

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.420 
we're going to do it so this is a really
low<00:00:19.350> back<00:00:19.650> flip<00:00:21.410> now<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.470> don't<00:00:22.680> want<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.010> throw

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
low back flip now we don't want to throw

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.859 
low back flip now we don't want to throw
these<00:00:23.580> types<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.970> back<00:00:24.150> rooms<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.570> several

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
these types of back rooms for several

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.390 
these types of back rooms for several
reasons<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.439> obviously<00:00:25.980> big<00:00:26.130> safety

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
reasons one obviously big safety

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.820 
reasons one obviously big safety
concerns<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.180> had<00:00:28.050> being<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.410> close<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
concerns I had being so close to the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.380 
concerns I had being so close to the
ground<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.369> other<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.000> actually

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
ground the other one is it actually

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
ground the other one is it actually
pretty<00:00:30.900> much<00:00:31.050> hurts<00:00:31.410> your<00:00:31.619> calves<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.219> heels

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
pretty much hurts your calves and heels

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
pretty much hurts your calves and heels
to<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> point<00:00:33.270> where<00:00:33.510> sometimes<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.649> get<00:00:34.770> shin

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to a point where sometimes you get shin

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.250 
to a point where sometimes you get shin
splints<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:36.360> we're<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.079> we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
splints so what we're going to do is we

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.200 
splints so what we're going to do is we
want<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.469> try<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:38.100> our<00:00:38.309> axis<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.059> rotation

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
want to try to get our axis of rotation

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.810 
want to try to get our axis of rotation
higher<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> mean<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> point

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
higher what I mean by that is the point

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.479 
higher what I mean by that is the point
that<00:00:42.000> we're<00:00:42.239> doing<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> back<00:00:42.690> clip<00:00:42.989> over<00:00:43.489> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that we're doing the back clip over so

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.979 
that we're doing the back clip over so
you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.149> doing<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> low<00:00:45.719> back

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you can see what I'm doing the low back

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.100 
you can see what I'm doing the low back
clip<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.940> my<00:00:47.940> axis<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> rotation<00:00:48.570> is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
clip here that my axis of rotation is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.950 
clip here that my axis of rotation is
very<00:00:49.140> low<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> ground<00:00:50.690> now<00:00:51.690> I'm<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
very low to the ground now I'm going to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.900 
very low to the ground now I'm going to
do<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.170> normal<00:00:52.230> back<00:00:52.680> clip<00:00:55.489> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.820> in

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
do my normal back clip you can see in

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
do my normal back clip you can see in
this<00:00:57.030> case<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.300> my<00:00:57.600> axis<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.170> rotation<00:00:58.260> is

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
this case that my axis of rotation is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.500 
this case that my axis of rotation is
much<00:00:58.980> higher<00:00:59.219> off<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.460> ground

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
much higher off the ground

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.930 
much higher off the ground
now<00:01:02.320> here's<00:01:02.530> how<00:01:02.650> to<00:01:02.710> do<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:03.070> normally<00:01:03.760> when

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
now here's how to do that normally when

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.670 
now here's how to do that normally when
we<00:01:04.030> learn<00:01:04.210> backflip<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:04.900> think<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.170> lot<00:01:05.350> of<00:01:05.470> times

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
we learn backflip I think a lot of times

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.530 
we learn backflip I think a lot of times
people<00:01:05.950> confuse<00:01:06.190> it<00:01:06.670> for<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.910> setup<00:01:07.210> for<00:01:07.360> back

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
people confuse it for the setup for back

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.990 
people confuse it for the setup for back
handspring<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.410> that<00:01:08.890> they<00:01:09.010> squat<00:01:09.430> really

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
handspring and that they squat really

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.430 
handspring and that they squat really
low<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:12.280> bring<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.670> hands<00:01:12.880> back<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.570> then

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
low they bring the hands back and then

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.690 
low they bring the hands back and then
when<00:01:14.590> they<00:01:14.680> launch<00:01:14.920> themselves<00:01:15.160> they're

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
when they launch themselves they're

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.670 
when they launch themselves they're
still<00:01:15.970> over<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.360> ground<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:17.290> notice<00:01:17.560> that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
still over the ground you notice that

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.530 
still over the ground you notice that
when<00:01:17.830> I<00:01:17.860> do<00:01:18.100> my<00:01:18.130> backflip<00:01:18.820> I'm<00:01:19.060> not<00:01:19.270> sure<00:01:19.420> how

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
when I do my backflip I'm not sure how

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.390 
when I do my backflip I'm not sure how
bending<00:01:19.930> my<00:01:20.080> knees<00:01:20.260> very<00:01:20.560> much<00:01:20.770> I'm<00:01:20.979> using<00:01:21.220> my

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
bending my knees very much I'm using my

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.850 
bending my knees very much I'm using my
fast<00:01:21.729> twitch<00:01:22.090> muscles<00:01:22.570> so<00:01:23.320> when<00:01:23.440> I<00:01:23.500> talk<00:01:23.650> about

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
fast twitch muscles so when I talk about

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.320 
fast twitch muscles so when I talk about
fast<00:01:24.100> twitch<00:01:24.400> muscles<00:01:24.850> I'm<00:01:24.940> talking<00:01:25.180> about

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
fast twitch muscles I'm talking about

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.000 
fast twitch muscles I'm talking about
the<00:01:25.420> muscles<00:01:25.570> you<00:01:25.810> use<00:01:25.960> when<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:26.410> see<00:01:26.979> a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
the muscles you use when you see a

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.290 
the muscles you use when you see a
basketball<00:01:27.550> hoop<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:27.910> you're<00:01:28.030> trying<00:01:28.270> to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
basketball hoop and you're trying to

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.120 
basketball hoop and you're trying to
touch<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.720> rim<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.380> don't<00:01:29.560> necessarily<00:01:29.680> want

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
touch the rim you don't necessarily want

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.450 
touch the rim you don't necessarily want
to<00:01:30.340> run<00:01:30.550> up<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:31.030> squat<00:01:31.930> really<00:01:32.380> flow<00:01:32.590> try<00:01:33.400> to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
to run up to it squat really flow try to

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.550 
to run up to it squat really flow try to
load<00:01:33.670> yourself<00:01:33.790> up<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.330> jump<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:35.110> actually

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
load yourself up and jump that actually

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.380 
load yourself up and jump that actually
detracts<00:01:36.100> from<00:01:36.130> your<00:01:36.550> height<00:01:36.850> what<00:01:37.119> you<00:01:37.210> want

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.920 
detracts from your height what you want
to<00:01:37.479> do<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.869> really<00:01:38.080> come<00:01:38.770> up<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.750> using<00:01:40.750> the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
to do is really come up to it using the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.150 
to do is really come up to it using the
bathroom<00:01:41.110> muscle<00:01:41.680> means<00:01:41.890> you're<00:01:41.979> going<00:01:42.100> to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
bathroom muscle means you're going to

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.240 
bathroom muscle means you're going to
bounce<00:01:42.340> off<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.729> toes<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:47.619> opposed<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.009> doing

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
bounce off the toes as opposed to doing

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.340 
bounce off the toes as opposed to doing
this<00:01:48.430> oh<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:51.180> when<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.270> see<00:01:52.450> back<00:01:52.690> up<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.080> lot<00:01:53.259> of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
this oh so when I see back up a lot of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.540 
this oh so when I see back up a lot of
times<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.680> see<00:01:53.830> people<00:01:54.100> trying<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.399> do<00:01:54.520> a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
times I see people trying to do a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.580 
times I see people trying to do a
backflip<00:01:55.030> from<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:58.420> opposed<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.259> this<00:02:01.590> we

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
backflip from this as opposed to this we

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.380 
backflip from this as opposed to this we
want<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.950> keep<00:02:03.040> our<00:02:03.369> chest<00:02:03.700> as<00:02:04.030> high<00:02:04.330> as

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
want to keep our chest as high as

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.330 
want to keep our chest as high as
possible<00:02:05.080> because<00:02:05.530> what<00:02:05.800> essentially<00:02:06.130> we're

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
possible because what essentially we're

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.380 
possible because what essentially we're
going<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:06.580> doing<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:07.060> we're<00:02:07.149> going<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.300> be

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
going to be doing is we're going to be

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.389 
going to be doing is we're going to be
rotating<00:02:07.600> around<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.170> shoulders<00:02:08.590> if<00:02:09.220> we

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
rotating around the shoulders if we

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.000 
rotating around the shoulders if we
start<00:02:09.729> jumping<00:02:10.210> from<00:02:10.330> this<00:02:10.479> position<00:02:11.020> we're

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
start jumping from this position we're

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.860 
start jumping from this position we're
only<00:02:12.130> going<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.400> be<00:02:12.520> jumping<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.210> rotating

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
only going to be jumping and rotating

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.530 
only going to be jumping and rotating
around<00:02:13.990> this<00:02:14.440> height<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.980> air<00:02:15.540> what

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
around this height in the air what

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.350 
around this height in the air what
happens<00:02:16.840> when<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.200> start<00:02:17.650> from<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.010> position

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
happens when we start from this position

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.180 
happens when we start from this position
we<00:02:19.360> automatically<00:02:19.990> get<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.230> much<00:02:20.440> higher<00:02:20.650> axis

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
we automatically get a much higher axis

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.970 
we automatically get a much higher axis
of<00:02:21.340> rotation<00:02:21.810> since<00:02:22.810> we're<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.470> concept

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
of rotation since we're on the concept

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.260 
of rotation since we're on the concept
of<00:02:24.040> height<00:02:24.250> now<00:02:24.550> we're<00:02:24.700> going<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.880> work<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.150> our

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
of height now we're going to work on our

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.150 
of height now we're going to work on our
arms<00:02:25.660> lots<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.440> times<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.680> see<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> people

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
arms lots of times I see the people

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160 
arms lots of times I see the people
doing<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.940> backflips<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.750> are<00:02:28.900> doing<00:02:29.050> them

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
doing the backflips that are doing them

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.120 
doing the backflips that are doing them
low<00:02:29.350> they<00:02:30.160> go<00:02:31.020> or<00:02:32.020> do<00:02:32.410> something<00:02:32.860> with<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
low they go or do something with the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.420 
low they go or do something with the
arms

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
arms

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.790 
arms
but<00:02:35.030> what<00:02:35.180> happens<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.230> more<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.530> try<00:02:36.740> to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
but what happens is the more you try to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.100 
but what happens is the more you try to
set<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.580> your<00:02:37.700> basses<00:02:38.030> turn<00:02:38.270> more<00:02:39.020> you

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
set this is your basses turn more you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.540 
set this is your basses turn more you
try<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.320> set<00:02:39.650> your<00:02:39.860> arms<00:02:40.160> in<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.370> air<00:02:40.490> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
try to set your arms in the air and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.550 
try to set your arms in the air and
throw<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.000> arms<00:02:41.180> up<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.110> how<00:02:42.260> you're<00:02:42.440> going

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
throw the arms up the how you're going

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.230 
throw the arms up the how you're going
to<00:02:42.650> get<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.670> there's<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.880> difference<00:02:44.180> between

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
to get so there's a difference between

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
to get so there's a difference between
doing<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.750> doing<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:52.720> okay<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:53.780> when<00:02:54.170> I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
doing this and doing this okay so when I

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.870 
doing this and doing this okay so when I
throw<00:02:54.530> myself<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.130> arrow<00:02:55.250> make<00:02:55.610> sure<00:02:55.760> I'm

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
throw myself up the arrow make sure I'm

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.940 
throw myself up the arrow make sure I'm
getting<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.180> very<00:02:56.360> good<00:02:56.660> stretch<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:57.830> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
getting a very good stretch with the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.670 
getting a very good stretch with the
arms<00:02:58.220> with<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.400> biceps<00:02:58.850> by<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.030> ears<00:02:59.680> lastly

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
arms with the biceps by the ears lastly

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.620 
arms with the biceps by the ears lastly
your<00:03:00.830> tuck<00:03:01.070> speed<00:03:01.430> if<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.120> find<00:03:02.330> yourself

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
your tuck speed if you find yourself

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.940 
your tuck speed if you find yourself
landing<00:03:02.930> on<00:03:02.990> your<00:03:03.080> knees<00:03:03.260> hands<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.800> knees

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
landing on your knees hands and knees

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.710 
landing on your knees hands and knees
it's<00:03:04.670> most<00:03:04.910> likely<00:03:05.030> because<00:03:05.480> you're<00:03:05.600> not

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
it's most likely because you're not

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.870 
it's most likely because you're not
rotating<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.410> fast<00:03:06.650> enough<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.580> can<00:03:07.700> see

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
rotating you fast enough you can see

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.490 
rotating you fast enough you can see
even<00:03:08.300> if<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.510> take<00:03:08.660> off<00:03:08.870> from<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.110> ground<00:03:09.140> at<00:03:09.440> a

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
even if I take off from the ground at a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.380 
even if I take off from the ground at a
very<00:03:09.710> low<00:03:09.890> height<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.400> still<00:03:11.030> make<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.270> all

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
very low height and still make it all

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.950 
very low height and still make it all
the<00:03:11.420> way<00:03:11.540> around<00:03:11.980> because<00:03:13.210> my<00:03:14.210> tuck<00:03:14.510> speed<00:03:14.810> is

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
the way around because my tuck speed is

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.500 
the way around because my tuck speed is
passed<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.880> there's<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.910> difference<00:03:17.210> between<00:03:17.480> a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
passed so there's a difference between a

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:26.380 
passed so there's a difference between a
fast<00:03:17.780> tuck<00:03:18.080> speed<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:21.560> slow<00:03:21.830> top<00:03:22.130> speed<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
fast tuck speed and a slow top speed the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.330 
fast tuck speed and a slow top speed the
difference<00:03:26.750> between<00:03:26.870> these<00:03:27.170> two<00:03:27.440> can<00:03:28.070> often

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
difference between these two can often

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.980 
difference between these two can often
show<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.640> what<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.180> need<00:03:29.210> to<00:03:29.420> do<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.840> get<00:03:29.960> a

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
show you what you need to do to get a

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.290 
show you what you need to do to get a
nice<00:03:30.230> high<00:03:30.590> backflip<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.340> land<00:03:31.460> it<00:03:32.150> with

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
nice high backflip and land it with

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.630 
nice high backflip and land it with
plenty<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.540> time<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.780> spare

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
plenty of time to spare

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.890 
plenty of time to spare
what<00:03:34.640> do<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.760> start<00:03:34.940> focusing<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.690> height

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
what do you start focusing on the height

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.360 
what do you start focusing on the height
of<00:03:36.110> your<00:03:36.170> backflip<00:03:36.800> you<00:03:36.830> start<00:03:37.160> realizing

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370
