00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.190
 So people welcome today 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.520
 it's about a pocket knife and that around 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.289
 the victorinox farmer from the vox series 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.539
 as already said that is that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.820
 Farmer model and it is a bit sharp 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.810
 knife I have already if many 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.720
 viewed videos 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.590
 and what can i say the easter bunny as 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.570
 brought me over 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.020
 again thanks to the easter bunny look 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 Let's have a look at what it has to offer 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.640
 clearly once the big blade is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.090
 a bit bigger than that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.329
 or that has more breadth than 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.120
 like the example of your system if 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:09.240
 one sees that she has one 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:15.060
 a bit more high of pharmexx and then 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.670
 it has a place where you like me him 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.950
 a lot of video already seen but great 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.270
 Driving style can only arrive though 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 on the left then it has a very sharp 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.579
 sail his classics as standard 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.979
 with every victorinox knife then the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.079
 usual suspects the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 bottle opener with cross invites to cable 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:51.570
 from insulators, so to speak, the usual 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:55.020
 suspect and then here once 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:01.710
 can opener again with slit 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:04.430
 screwdriver and smooth back so 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.849
 the spring is not interrupted 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.430
 further it still has a ring to where 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.069
 I've made such an issue here 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.739
 but is nothing special and the 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:22.250
 handle shells are as I said from this 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:24.920
 alex series are made of anodised aluminum 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.750
 planet because here is a small crew 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:35.069
 plate as you could as in my case 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:36.959
 brings whether or what write yes the dimensions 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.959
 I do not have it in my head right now 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.250
 insert it here and then 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.060
 or below in the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.620
 Description of the pressure said 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.500
 top team eater for the daily 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.300
 use and it really makes something so 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.819
 From the optical I find very beautiful ghana 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.659
 criticism is still somehow 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.530
 from that 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.819
 If you have this, it is this 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.769
 you could see 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:13.050
 maybe not so much 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.200
 polished very clean but that's good 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.550
 really moaning at a high level 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.879
 otherwise I like the knife right 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.560
 Well 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.000
 had been in use quite a few 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.730
 things always cut quickly 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.480
 move and you always have a sharp one 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.769
 sound ready 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.970
 I am most grateful for the 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.239
 see you and see you next time 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.239
 and bye
