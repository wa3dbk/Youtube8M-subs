00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.559
 I did it with this color palette that

 makeup with these palettes because I 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.760
 I know that maybe many of you do not 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.040
 they have the possibility of in their cities 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.520
 find the makeup they sell 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.730
 most commonly here in the USA and well me 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.490
 I know that maybe in some places it 's very 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.890
 easy to find this brand and apart 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.190

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.790

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.500
 pigmented the shadows and all that clear 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.170
 that not all the products of any 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.470
 brand are good but especially me 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.210
 I saw these pallets and decided to buy them 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.790
 I bought the truth that with a little bit of 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.490
 scared because they did not know how they were going to 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.820
 leave for that reason just buy two because 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.800
 There were quite a few different colors 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.540
 this maybe then buy the others to see 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.600
 how are they doing because they are pretty 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.810
 economic costs cost me four 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.170
 dollars in kmart if they want 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.090

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.090
 do 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.190
 many of you tell me that I do not 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.009

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.120

 subscribe bye 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:57.540
 good girls I will start by placing a 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.820
 white jumbo over all my mobile eyelid 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.140
 blurring it very well to taps 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.000
 not to sweep the color too much nor 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:21.310
 expand it too 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:23.520
 and now take this bronzer like a 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.440
 transition color 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.970
 and I'm going to put it in my account 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.970
 blurring it very well 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.280
 Retouch the white color 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.280
 about my body from a mobile 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:06.989
 and now take this green color and I'm going 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.590
 to place taps on all my 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.590
 eyelid mobile 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.530
 leaving a little bit free of the corner 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.530
 external of my adult part 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.479
 now I will take the mixture of this green 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.310
 dark and black and I'll go 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.979
 placing in my outer corner 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.680
 blurring the color between green and what 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.500
 I'm putting so it does not look 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.170
 too marked a line 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.200
 and I'm going to try to mix those 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:57.050
 two colors so they do not look black 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.050
 but it looks like a darker green 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.740
 if necessary blurs with my color of 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.740
 transition 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.150
 Y 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.150
 Y 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.900
 again I'm going to take the mixture of 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.389
 colors of green and black and I'm going to 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.070
 place it on my lower lashes 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:43.870
 discriminating how well do not forget 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.870
 to connect with the top 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.050
 now I will take the mixture of this green with 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.180
 a little bit of white to lower a 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.490
 little green color and look like a 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.420
 green light and I'm going to light up my 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.000
 tear 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.670
 i 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.160
 now I will take a clear shadow but 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.500
 this time mate and I will illuminate the 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.010
 little bone of my eyebrows and a little towards 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.010
 the lacrimal 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.120
 again retouched my transition color 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:30.990
 because he has lost a little 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.440
 I'm going to delineate my color water line 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.440
 black 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:43.110
 I'm going to outline my mobile eyelid and I'm going to 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.479
 put several layers of mask and I'll 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.470
 place false eyelashes and now 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.470
 I come back with you
