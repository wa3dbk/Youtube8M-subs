00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.920
 at 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 I made mollah stickers that 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.810
 now appears in this screen bah 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.340
 I know they are cool 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.560
 here I did it in five minutes or 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.570
 pledge that it was what fucking amputees 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.789
 or fucking I come back disguised finally 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.099
 here I made these little stickers 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.300
 if you want to regain 1 well you 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.670
 have on my facebook page 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.920
 helped in principle only to a photo with 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.120
 Marc and contest stickers you enough 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.910
 to go in the comments space is 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.750
 to put a comment I participate and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.550
 it will make you participate 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.430
 I find it logical in the country 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.430
 almost falling overboard 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.130
 here 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.530
 more target mediapart 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.960
 and I would say one or two winners 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.390
 that's it but after you tell yourself 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.950
 surely how I get if I do not win 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.330
 because yes there is not everyone 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.290
 who will win it will seem obvious 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.290
 because making stickers at a cost 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.290
 and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.490
 and that's a big blow actually at 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.079
 start me if I could have made one 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340
 just for me that's what I wanted 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.079
 make 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.119
 except that if you want a sticker that me 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.650
 went back to 20 euros a single man alone 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.830
 stickers it's still quite expensive 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.450
 and the more you buy - you finally pay little 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.850
 the price of the stickers per unit decreases 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.040
 So there I suddenly I took I 39 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 believe and the little heart it comes back to me a 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.190
 little more than one euro 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.860
 our stickers 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.220
 so it only makes sense that I took 35 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.590
 layers I got for 40 more than 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.880
 40 euros with shipping costs so in 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.960
 big I can not all of you all 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.170
 offer because here I still 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.730
 pay 40 euros out of my pocket so the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.920
 stickers I will sell them to the unit 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.210
 for those who are interested I force you 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.980
 not so we do not say 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.060
 goodbye archery all because I 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.520
 I'm not profitable I'm fighting them 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.170
 balls ie the sticker I 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.100
 think I'll sell it at 2.50 and there 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.280
 you tell yourself but wait it's a 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.350
 little earlier 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.230
 it's a little more than a euro the sticker 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.330
 if you sell 50 years and because there is 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.330
 the price of 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.440
 envelop him and turn off that it's 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.770
 something that he did not take in 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.040
 account and that's about 70 cents 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.830
 of their price of a loan so here it is 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.360
 not given either what what makes that 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.680
 here I am saleswoman 50 the 6 cards 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.010
 on the other hand if you launch yourself 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.690
 two and I can make them to you at 4 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.580
 euros both so if you want a 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.450
 stickers what are they going to do these come 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.170
 to talk to me by mp on facebook and to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.360
 from there 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.920
 I give you the link on order in 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.130
 same time together you give me your 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.180
 address and just like that there is no 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.500
 no problem 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.330
 here I hope I did very well 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.610
 Explain 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.610
