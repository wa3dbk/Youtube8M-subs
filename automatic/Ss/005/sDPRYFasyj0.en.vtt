round here 2005 Ford 18 in 2012
21<00:02:13.469> it<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:15.060> looks<00:02:15.239> like<00:02:15.299> this<00:02:15.599> is<00:02:15.689> a<00:02:15.719> bit<00:02:15.930> of

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
21 it so it looks like this is a bit of

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.649 
21 it so it looks like this is a bit of
a<00:02:16.049> strong<00:02:16.290> track<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.890> Chevrolet<00:02:17.430> and

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
a strong track for Chevrolet and

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.640 
a strong track for Chevrolet and
definitely<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.750> track<00:02:19.109> where<00:02:19.290> Hendrick

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
definitely a track where Hendrick

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.649 
definitely a track where Hendrick
Motorsports<00:02:20.189> do<00:02:20.400> pretty<00:02:20.609> well<00:02:20.819> Jeff<00:02:21.299> Gordon

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
Motorsports do pretty well Jeff Gordon

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.780 
Motorsports do pretty well Jeff Gordon
Jimmie<00:02:21.989> Johnson<00:02:22.409> Mark<00:02:22.680> Martin<00:02:23.159> and<00:02:23.340> Jeff

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.849 
Jimmie Johnson Mark Martin and Jeff
Gordon<00:02:24.390> again<00:02:24.659> they<00:02:25.109> everyone<00:02:25.500> around<00:02:25.680> this

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
Gordon again they everyone around this

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.949 
Gordon again they everyone around this
track<00:02:26.069> four<00:02:26.459> out<00:02:26.939> of<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.269> eight<00:02:27.299> races<00:02:27.810> have

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959

track four out of the eight races have
been<00:02:28.019> one<00:02:28.260> round<00:02:28.469> he<00:02:28.650> already<00:02:28.829> have<00:02:29.069> been<00:02:29.219> won

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430

by<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:30.090> Hendrick<00:02:30.450> Motorsports<00:02:31.109> team<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:31.920> it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
by the Hendrick Motorsports team so it

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
by the Hendrick Motorsports team so it
looks<00:02:32.159> like<00:02:32.219> they're<00:02:32.489> gonna<00:02:32.579> be<00:02:32.760> strong

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
looks like they're gonna be strong

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.729 
looks like they're gonna be strong
around<00:02:33.269> here<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.659> it<00:02:34.139> also<00:02:34.260> looks<00:02:34.560> like

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
around here and it also looks like

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.199 
around here and it also looks like
Chevrolet<00:02:35.189> gonna<00:02:35.430> be<00:02:35.519> strong<00:02:35.819> around<00:02:36.030> here

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
Chevrolet gonna be strong around here

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.959 
Chevrolet gonna be strong around here
but<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.349> can't<00:02:37.680> take<00:02:37.889> too<00:02:38.129> much<00:02:38.159> from<00:02:38.819> the

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
but you can't take too much from the

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.000 
but you can't take too much from the
past<00:02:39.239> for<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.079> this<00:02:40.349> year<00:02:40.620> really<00:02:40.829> in

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
past for this this year really in

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.309 
past for this this year really in
general<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.909> we've<00:02:42.239> seen<00:02:42.629> that

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
general because we've seen that

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.710 
general because we've seen that
obviously<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.519> new<00:02:44.700> gen-6<00:02:44.939> car<00:02:45.120> wrecks

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
obviously this new gen-6 car wrecks

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.869 
obviously this new gen-6 car wrecks
quite<00:02:46.139> a<00:02:46.169> bit<00:02:46.319> differently<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.340> cars<00:02:47.669> that

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
quite a bit differently to the cars that

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.580 
quite a bit differently to the cars that
we've<00:02:47.970> had<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.510> loss<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.989> eight<00:02:49.230> nine

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
we've had in the loss of eight nine

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.800 
we've had in the loss of eight nine
years<00:02:49.919> and<00:02:50.189> it's<00:02:50.819> very<00:02:51.030> very<00:02:51.209> different<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
years and it's very very different and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.470 
years and it's very very different and
it's<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.680> lot<00:02:52.859> harder<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.669> control<00:02:53.879> what<00:02:54.389> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it's a lot harder to control what the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.849 
it's a lot harder to control what the
drivers<00:02:54.780> I'm<00:02:54.870> saying<00:02:55.139> it's<00:02:55.260> hard<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> bump

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
drivers I'm saying it's hard to bump

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.470 
drivers I'm saying it's hard to bump
draft<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:56.400> around<00:02:56.879> this<00:02:56.970> track<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.329> think

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
draft and around this track and I think

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.970 
draft and around this track and I think
I'm<00:02:57.540> gonna<00:02:57.629> be<00:02:57.810> seeing<00:02:58.019> much<00:02:58.169> bump<00:02:58.500> drafting

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
I'm gonna be seeing much bump drafting

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.220 
I'm gonna be seeing much bump drafting
but<00:02:59.969> I<00:03:00.000> do<00:03:00.150> think<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:00.659> going<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.810> be<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> pretty

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
but I do think it's going to be a pretty

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.199 
but I do think it's going to be a pretty
interesting<00:03:01.560> race<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.250> hope<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.879> gonna<00:03:02.969> be<00:03:03.120> an

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
interesting race I hope it's gonna be an

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.059 
interesting race I hope it's gonna be an
interesting<00:03:03.299> race<00:03:03.870> because<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.799> know<00:03:04.919> it's

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
interesting race because you know it's

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.179 
interesting race because you know it's
quite<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> nice<00:03:05.459> track<00:03:05.790> here<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.859> yes<00:03:07.859> so<00:03:08.159> I

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
quite a nice track here and yes so I

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.289 
quite a nice track here and yes so I
think<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.549> gonna<00:03:08.669> be<00:03:08.730> an<00:03:08.819> interesting<00:03:08.849> race

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
think it's gonna be an interesting race

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.119 
think it's gonna be an interesting race

Earnhardt<00:03:57.090> jr.<00:03:57.509> and<00:03:57.659> I<00:03:58.409> think<00:03:58.590> that's<00:03:58.709> noisy

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
Earnhardt jr. and I think that's noisy

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.740 
Earnhardt jr. and I think that's noisy
because<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.669> mean<00:03:59.970> he's<00:04:00.090> been<00:04:00.239> quite<00:04:00.479> unlucky

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
because I mean he's been quite unlucky

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.780 
because I mean he's been quite unlucky
with<00:04:01.079> not<00:04:01.709> getting<00:04:01.829> as<00:04:01.979> many<00:04:02.099> wins<00:04:02.340> as<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.579> think

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
with not getting as many wins as I think

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.509 
with not getting as many wins as I think
a<00:04:02.939> lot<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.239> people<00:04:03.329> think<00:04:03.599> he<00:04:03.750> should<00:04:03.959> all<00:04:04.519> you

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
a lot of people think he should all you

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.089 
a lot of people think he should all you
know<00:04:05.639> but<00:04:06.120> we'll<00:04:06.239> see<00:04:06.449> maybe<00:04:06.829> 2013<00:04:07.829> will<00:04:08.009> be

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099
