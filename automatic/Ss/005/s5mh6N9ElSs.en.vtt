00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
to mix on the wet paper

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.490 
to mix on the wet paper
I'll<00:02:41.549> keep<00:02:42.060> sweeping<00:02:42.660> at<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> lower<00:02:43.079> edge<00:02:43.290> of

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
I'll keep sweeping at the lower edge of

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.410 
I'll keep sweeping at the lower edge of
the<00:02:43.560> paint<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:44.010> prevent<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.549> from<00:02:44.579> drying<00:02:44.910> and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the paint to prevent it from drying and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.670

forming<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.049> hard<00:02:46.290> edge

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.160 

then<00:02:50.579> I'll<00:02:50.819> blend<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.329> bottom<00:02:51.719> pane<00:02:51.930> edge

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
then I'll blend the bottom pane edge

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.550 
then I'll blend the bottom pane edge
into<00:02:52.439> the<00:02:52.530> pre<00:02:52.920> wet<00:02:53.159> area<00:02:53.519> below<00:02:54.319> while<00:02:55.319> the

into the pre wet area below while the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.649 
into the pre wet area below while the
paint<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:55.950> still<00:02:56.219> wet<00:02:56.280> I'll<00:02:56.819> add<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.180> some<00:02:57.390> rich

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
paint is still wet I'll add in some rich

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.640 
paint is still wet I'll add in some rich
horizontal<00:02:58.349> stripes<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.859> Prince<00:02:59.129> Sienna<00:03:00.650> then

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
horizontal stripes of Prince Sienna then

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.679 
horizontal stripes of Prince Sienna then
I'll<00:03:01.829> reread<00:03:02.189> the<00:03:02.400> area<00:03:02.640> below<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.180> rocks<00:03:03.420> to

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
I'll reread the area below the rocks to

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.089 
I'll reread the area below the rocks to
again<00:03:04.049> prevent<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.890> hard<00:03:05.340> edge<00:03:05.549> from<00:03:05.819> forming

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
again prevent a hard edge from forming

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.530 
again prevent a hard edge from forming
with<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.129> rigger<00:03:08.519> brush<00:03:08.849> loaded<00:03:09.239> with

with a rigger brush loaded with
ultramarine<00:03:09.900> blue<00:03:10.109> I'll<00:03:10.620> work<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.219> even<00:03:11.549> finer

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
ultramarine blue I'll work in even finer

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.750 
ultramarine blue I'll work in even finer
horizontal<00:03:12.689> stripes

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
horizontal stripes

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:26.089 
horizontal stripes
then<00:03:14.760> I'll<00:03:15.060> thoroughly<00:03:15.719> dry<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.049> all<00:03:24.859> once<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
then I'll thoroughly dry it all once the

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.979 
then I'll thoroughly dry it all once the
rock<00:03:26.310> colors<00:03:26.819> are<00:03:27.060> bone-dry

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
rock colors are bone-dry

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.530 
rock colors are bone-dry
I'll<00:03:28.379> mask<00:03:29.040> out<00:03:29.340> their<00:03:29.700> lighter<00:03:30.120> values<00:03:32.540> once

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
I'll mask out their lighter values once

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.709 
I'll mask out their lighter values once
again<00:03:33.989> I'll<00:03:34.260> use<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.590> masking<00:03:35.250> pick<00:03:35.719> liquid

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:36.719 
again I'll use a masking pick liquid

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.849 
again I'll use a masking pick liquid
mask<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.849> disposable<00:03:38.849> paintbrush<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.859> some
