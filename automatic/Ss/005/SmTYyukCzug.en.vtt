00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.529
 already started 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:28.670
 and already the base is 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.670
 square 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.619

 already one is that athens already had done 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.649
 for based on the song that you want to remix and ar 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.759
 we are not going to look for a song 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.799
 doe 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.409
 two 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.529
 according to the outline and the song 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.529

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.740
 they went to SMEs worse 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.210
 3 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.879
 same way they have to be a club of four times 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.879
 By the way, it xliza in the export of goods under 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.020

 a strait in the months 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:30.249
 and in this part 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:34.059
 as the first part I said of peace and intimate the three activated 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.610
