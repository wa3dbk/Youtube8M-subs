this is what I like to show you because
the<00:00:59.970> container<00:01:00.330> comes<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> place<00:01:01.980> where

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
the container comes in the place where

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.000 
the container comes in the place where
normally<00:01:02.580> they<00:01:02.700> would<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:03.060> change<00:01:03.360> now<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:04.650> can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
normally they would go change now I can

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.490 
normally they would go change now I can
put<00:01:05.280> peloton<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.440> we<00:01:07.440> can<00:01:07.680> start<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> fire

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
put peloton and we can start the fire

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
put peloton and we can start the fire
this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:11.010> time<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.150> it's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this is the first time so it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.810 
this is the first time so it's
experiment<00:01:13.220> let's<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> look<00:01:14.700> what

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
experiment let's take a look what

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:43.190 
experiment let's take a look what
happened<00:01:38.360> little<00:01:39.360> cap<00:01:40.670> under<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.200> basket

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
happened little cap under the basket

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.480 
happened little cap under the basket
where<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.250> ask<00:01:44.430> air<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.240> come<00:01:45.420> in

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.109 

just<00:01:50.210> try<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:50.990> start<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.799> parents<00:01:52.189> they

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
just try to start the parents they

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.510 
just try to start the parents they
taught<00:01:53.360> me<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.659> is<00:01:53.869> very<00:01:53.960> difficult<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.280> start

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
taught me it is very difficult to start

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.230 
taught me it is very difficult to start
pellets<00:01:56.560> but<00:01:57.560> once<00:01:57.890> they<00:01:58.100> burned<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.580> have<00:01:58.759> a

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
pellets but once they burned you have a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.289 
pellets but once they burned you have a
very<00:01:59.630> good<00:01:59.840> fire<00:02:00.490> it's<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.640> first<00:02:01.880> time<00:02:02.060> I'm

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
very good fire it's the first time I'm

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:14.820 
very good fire it's the first time I'm
doing<00:02:02.330> this<00:02:02.780> with<00:02:03.049> this<00:02:04.810> design<00:02:06.970> so

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.230 

the<00:02:15.340> fire<00:02:15.550> starts<00:02:15.940> going<00:02:17.670> nobody<00:02:18.670> they<00:02:19.030> use

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
the fire starts going nobody they use

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:29.570 
the fire starts going nobody they use
them<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:19.780> barbecue<00:02:20.560> or<00:02:20.680> something<00:02:21.160> like<00:02:21.310> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.850 

let's<00:02:30.580> wait<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.820> minute<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.410> little<00:02:32.740> bit

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
let's wait a minute it's a little bit

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.330 
let's wait a minute it's a little bit
difficult<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.430> see<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.530> after<00:02:35.530> about<00:02:35.740> 30

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
difficult to see but after about 30

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.570 
difficult to see but after about 30
seconds<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:38.020> see<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.320> between<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.550> two

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
seconds you can see it between the two

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.320 
seconds you can see it between the two
pipes<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:41.710> container<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.970> mean

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
pipes that the container and the mean

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.430 
pipes that the container and the mean
pipe<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.930> pellets<00:02:47.290> are<00:02:47.440> already<00:02:47.890> burned

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
pipe the pellets are already burned

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.060 
pipe the pellets are already burned
Direction<00:02:50.440> chimney<00:02:52.170> let's<00:02:53.170> go<00:02:53.380> down<00:02:53.590> what

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
Direction chimney let's go down what

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.420 
Direction chimney let's go down what
happens<00:02:54.430> here<00:02:54.760> oh<00:02:54.940> yeah<00:02:59.040> it's<00:03:00.040> okay

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
happens here oh yeah it's okay

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:08.100 
happens here oh yeah it's okay
I<00:03:03.750> think<00:03:04.750> they<00:03:04.900> will<00:03:05.080> have<00:03:05.230> fun<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.540> fire<00:03:07.780> in

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
I think they will have fun the fire in

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.770 
I think they will have fun the fire in
five<00:03:08.830> minutes<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.460> don't<00:03:09.940> know<00:03:10.120> if<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.390> can<00:03:10.570> see

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780
