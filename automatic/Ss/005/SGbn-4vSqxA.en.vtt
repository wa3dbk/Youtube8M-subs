okay i guess the 10 ones out of this

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.189 
okay i guess the 10 ones out of this
case<00:04:02.909> i<00:04:03.090> thought<00:04:03.269> this<00:04:03.329> is<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.659> patch<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.139> the

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
case i thought this is the patch and the

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.809 
case i thought this is the patch and the
Jeter<00:04:04.439> number<00:04:04.500> 22<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.219> everything<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.639> don't

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
Jeter number 22 and everything I don't

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:06.770
