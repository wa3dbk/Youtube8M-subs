00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.060
 two 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.010
 as the 43th group of air forces its 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.560
 main mission is what is the struggle of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 fires forest measurements as the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.330
 unit is approximately 160 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.250
 people divided between personnel of 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.489
 flight and ground personnel so 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 say it we expand and make bases 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.650
 independent so to speak depends 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 of the base that is specifically takes 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.250
 12 aircraft three aircraft will depend 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.890
 needs this in the campaign 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.570
 currently from the base of madrid is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.820
 it is in torrejón de ardoz to work the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.980
 resonator we move to galicia us 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.909
 we go to zaragoza we move too 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.250
 albacete málaga in pollença salamanca and 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.379
 badajoz the fact of putting the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 detachments has the objective that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.979
 We are in less than an hour from the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.979
 call anywhere in Spain 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.740
 with finish 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 Y 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.550
 the average fire extinction and 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.120
 We have 14 models like this one that 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.030
 you have here back is the 215 turbo and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.590
 then we have 4 415 is every day 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.190
 there is an extinction flight in some 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.490
 of the 43 groups not looking for it they give us 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.230
 the exit towards a fire gives us some 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.940
 coordinates give us the name of the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.070
 fire municipality director of extinction 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.620
 a data series no more aircraft than 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.300
 are we arrived when the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.880
 fire has caught some certain 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.770
 not interested and we observe the area not what 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.330
 we look in our letters we have 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.850
 a guide to reservoirs and loading areas 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.680
 these planes charge in total for 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.360
 deposit has two reservoirs and each 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.860
 approximately three thousand liters at 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.330
 do the load we do it very 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.760
 quickly on water surface 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.140
 both rivers reservoirs and sea because the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.340
 point that we have a distance 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.040
 soon a mile and a half to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.560
 operate we would load in approximately 12 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.370
 seconds we would have the butt deposits 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.370
 of water 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.550
 sometimes it depends on the 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.010
 fire and what the director tells us 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.420
 description sometimes after they have 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.450
 who are with foam ask us if 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.950
 we have and if we have injected 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.720
 foam this what it does is that low 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.010
 temperatures increases the effectiveness but 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.810
 It is useful for other types of fires 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.130
 that's always the environment the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.709
 minister and again has a director 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.150
 of extinction and that only is also 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.590
 specialized is not very fired up 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.630
 Montes specialized in the subject of 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.090
 forest fires and has many 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.890
 knowledge and they are what they tell us 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.599
 we merely transport the water 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.340
 of the surface can be charged to 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.870
 throw it after man our work 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.519
 it's not nice when we go out is that 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.230
 something is called and people are going through it 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.570
 handy especially when we accept 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.400
 difficult or good in cases that we have 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.500
 been fires where maybe the best 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.229
 Unfortunately, something has happened. 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.780
 caught people and so on logically 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.639
 it's not a job we enter it's a job 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.950
 gratifying that no but when we fly 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.950
 it's bad that we are not training 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.680
 as taken out in a fire and does not leave a 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.810
 fire that may be more or less 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.520
 away from our our base so 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.110
 say it where we spend the night 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.490
 many times it happens to us that we have 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.460
 that overnight in other places then 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.810
 always the suitcase is one more 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.810
 Well, we're not going to fly
