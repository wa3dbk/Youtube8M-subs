at the moment I have removed the innards

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.490 
at the moment I have removed the innards
of<00:00:59.470> that<00:01:00.190> indexing<00:01:00.790> valve<00:01:01.110> this<00:01:02.110> is<00:01:02.290> what<00:01:02.470> I

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
of that indexing valve this is what I

of that indexing valve this is what I
pulled<00:01:02.800> out<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:04.120> a<00:01:04.270> spring<00:01:04.690> stem<00:01:05.190> so<00:01:06.190> now<00:01:06.490> all

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
pulled out it's a spring stem so now all

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.990 
pulled out it's a spring stem so now all
of<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.760> beds<00:01:10.000> are<00:01:10.330> getting<00:01:10.660> a<00:01:10.750> flow<00:01:12.000> they're

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
of the beds are getting a flow they're

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.030 
of the beds are getting a flow they're
all<00:01:13.270> running<00:01:13.780> constant<00:01:14.530> flood<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:17.229> I<00:01:17.470> turned

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
all running constant flood see I turned

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.140 
all running constant flood see I turned
the<00:01:18.490> standpipe<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:19.630> if<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.770> can<00:01:20.920> see<00:01:21.190> that<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
the standpipe so if you can see that the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.450 
the standpipe so if you can see that the
holes<00:01:22.390> are<00:01:22.570> at<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.810> top<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.530> not<00:01:23.740> has<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.010> flood

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
holes are at the top so not has to flood

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.400 
holes are at the top so not has to flood
all<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.760> way<00:01:24.910> and<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.840> stays<00:01:26.229> flooded<00:01:31.410> because

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
all the way and it stays flooded because

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.980 
all the way and it stays flooded because
I<00:01:32.770> have<00:01:33.009> all<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.399> beds<00:01:33.610> flooded<00:01:34.300> I<00:01:34.509> had<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.899> add

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
I have all the beds flooded I had to add

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.550 
I have all the beds flooded I had to add
a<00:01:35.020> bunch<00:01:35.290> of<00:01:35.500> water<00:01:40.920> they're<00:01:41.920> not<00:01:42.100> eaten<00:01:42.490> yet<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
a bunch of water they're not eaten yet I

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.550 
a bunch of water they're not eaten yet I
put<00:01:44.979> four<00:01:45.460> fish<00:01:45.910> from<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.540> big<00:01:46.840> system<00:01:47.380> in

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
put four fish from the big system in

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.969 
put four fish from the big system in
here<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.270> last<00:01:52.780> night<00:01:53.050> I<00:01:53.110> checked<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.740> see<00:01:53.950> if

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
here and last night I checked to see if

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.570 
here and last night I checked to see if
they<00:01:54.190> would<00:01:54.310> eat<00:01:54.490> but<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.880> didn't

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.430 

and<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.700> often<00:02:02.030> takes<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.420> few<00:02:02.600> days<00:02:02.660> for<00:02:02.840> fish

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
and it often takes a few days for fish

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.620 
and it often takes a few days for fish
to<00:02:03.710> start<00:02:04.040> eating<00:02:04.160> again<00:02:04.430> after<00:02:04.970> disturbing

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
to start eating again after disturbing

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.040 
to start eating again after disturbing
them<00:02:06.820> though<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.940> guys<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.360> big<00:02:08.570> tank<00:02:08.869> are

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
them though the guys in the big tank are

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.050 
them though the guys in the big tank are
still<00:02:09.320> quite<00:02:09.530> hungry<00:02:09.800> even<00:02:10.250> after<00:02:11.050> netting
