00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it's weird because this whole body

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.119 
it's weird because this whole body
sculpt<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.809> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.230> molded<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
sculpt here is kind of like molded in a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.990 
sculpt here is kind of like molded in a
set<00:00:47.460> position<00:00:48.200> which<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.309> depends<00:00:50.700> on

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
set position which is it just depends on

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
set position which is it just depends on
what<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
what you like and what you don't like I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.130 
what you like and what you don't like I
personally<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> figure<00:00:54.510> as<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> whole

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
personally I like the figure as a whole

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410 
personally I like the figure as a whole
but<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.579> aspect<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
but I just don't like this aspect of it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.260 
but I just don't like this aspect of it
where<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:58.410> got<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.760> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> see

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
where they got this you can kind of see

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.630 
where they got this you can kind of see
how<00:01:00.420> he's<00:01:00.570> just<00:01:00.780> molded<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:02.129> angle<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
how he's just molded at an angle a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.950 
how he's just molded at an angle a
little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.300> through<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
little bit right through here and you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.649 
little bit right through here and you
can<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.199> us<00:01:04.320> twisted<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.920> there's<00:01:05.100> no<00:01:05.659> waist

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
can see us twisted and there's no waist

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.190 
can see us twisted and there's no waist
or<00:01:07.020> hip<00:01:07.770> articulation<00:01:08.720> nothing<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.840> here

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
or hip articulation nothing in here

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.280 
or hip articulation nothing in here
which<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:11.040> should<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.250> been<00:01:11.990> it's<00:01:12.990> more

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
which there should have been it's more

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.719 
which there should have been it's more
like<00:01:15.500> he's<00:01:16.500> meant<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.340> being<00:01:17.580> like

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
like he's meant to just being like

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.840 
like he's meant to just being like
almost<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.180> one<00:01:18.330> step<00:01:18.689> position<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
almost in one step position so it it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.190 
almost in one step position so it it
makes<00:01:21.119> no<00:01:21.330> sense<00:01:21.570> why<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.840> put<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.110> this

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
makes no sense why they put all this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.710 
makes no sense why they put all this
extra<00:01:22.590> articulation<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.180> down

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720

extra articulation and you know down
here<00:01:24.990> from<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> waist<00:01:25.380> down<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
here from the waist down like all the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.800 
here from the waist down like all the
knees<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.790> everything<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.689> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
knees and everything like you see it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.670 
knees and everything like you see it
bends<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> spins<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.979> mid<00:01:29.159> thigh<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680

bends and spins here at mid thigh and
it's<00:01:31.680> kind<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.400> confusing<00:01:32.790> me<00:01:32.850> a

and it also comes with the separate hand
right<00:02:06.930> here<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.320> comes<00:02:07.530> off

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
right here this comes off

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.510 
right here this comes off
and<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:11.080> originally<00:02:11.590> was<00:02:11.620> in<00:02:11.920> there<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:12.460> you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
and this originally was in there so you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.450 
and this originally was in there so you
can<00:02:12.670> actually<00:02:12.850> put<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.360> spear<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.220> hand

where<00:03:42.970> there's<00:03:43.060> little<00:03:43.269> holes<00:03:43.480> here<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.739> here

where there's little holes here and here

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.860 
where there's little holes here and here
for<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.130> stand<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:45.790> if<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.030> had<00:03:46.209> an<00:03:46.329> extra<00:03:46.390> stand

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
for a stand so if you had an extra stand

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.220 
for a stand so if you had an extra stand
or<00:03:47.079> you<00:03:47.140> picked<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:47.620> up<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.750> should<00:03:49.900> do<00:03:50.019> so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
or you picked one up you should do so

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.840 
or you picked one up you should do so
because<00:03:50.410> this<00:03:50.590> figure<00:03:50.920> would<00:03:51.040> probably<00:03:51.610> end

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
because this figure would probably end

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.180 
because this figure would probably end
up<00:03:52.030> tipping<00:03:52.570> over<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.840> little<00:03:53.079> bit<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.440> think

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
up tipping over a little bit I think

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.650 
up tipping over a little bit I think
over<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.670> little<00:03:54.820> bit<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.090> time<00:03:55.269> because<00:03:55.570> he

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
over a little bit of time because he

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.390 
over a little bit of time because he
says<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.900> kind<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.230> top-heavy<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:57.010> can<00:03:57.130> see<00:03:57.310> how

says I kind of top-heavy you can see how

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.039 
says I kind of top-heavy you can see how
he<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:57.519> once<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.000> got<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> Bart<00:03:58.690> with<00:03:58.840> them<00:03:58.959> or

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
bit of articulation they can move up up

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.000 
bit of articulation they can move up up
down<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:56.210> can<00:04:56.360> move<00:04:56.510> them<00:04:56.600> but<00:04:57.230> they<00:04:57.830> came

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
down you can move them but they came

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.230 
down you can move them but they came
separate<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.550> had<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:58.730> plug<00:04:58.880> them<00:04:59.090> in

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
separate so you had to plug them in

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.000 
separate so you had to plug them in
there<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.780> of<00:05:00.140> course<00:05:00.170> he<00:05:00.410> got<00:05:00.500> his<00:05:00.620> backpack

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
there and of course he got his backpack

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.760 
there and of course he got his backpack
there<00:05:01.310> which<00:05:01.730> is<00:05:01.880> like<00:05:01.910> his<00:05:02.180> energy<00:05:03.080> pack<00:05:03.500> or

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
there which is like his energy pack or

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.010 
there which is like his energy pack or
I'm<00:05:04.250> guessing<00:05:04.580> that's<00:05:04.670> what<00:05:04.850> it<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.630> then

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
I'm guessing that's what it is and then

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.590 
I'm guessing that's what it is and then
