to get augmented reality and they say

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
to get augmented reality and they say
that<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.510> equivalent<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.610> were

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that it's equivalent to if you were

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.930

even<00:00:42.270> possibly<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.649> equivalent<00:00:44.010> of

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
even possibly it's the equivalent of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.139 
even possibly it's the equivalent of
watching<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.110> 240<00:00:46.110> inch<00:00:46.379> high-definition<00:00:47.149> TV

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
from 10 feet away and so there is a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
from 10 feet away and so there is a
pretty<00:00:52.410> lengthy<00:00:52.770> article<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> goes<00:00:53.850> through

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
pretty lengthy article that goes through

what<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.020> again<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.920> lot<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> crazy

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
what is going on so again a lot of crazy

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
what is going on so again a lot of crazy
stuff<00:01:36.720> happening<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> things

stuff happening and you know the things

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.090 
stuff happening and you know the things
that<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:38.880> about<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.689> how<00:01:40.229> crazy<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that I think about is how crazy this

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
that I think about is how crazy this
technology<00:01:41.670> could<00:01:41.880> actually<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.600> going

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
technology could actually get going

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.429 
technology could actually get going
forward<00:01:43.799> from<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.340> because<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.659> all

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
forward from here because you know all

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.380 
forward from here because you know all
you<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.340> take<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.909> things<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you have to do is take the things that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.420 
you have to do is take the things that
are<00:01:48.479> already<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.740> available<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
are already out there and available and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.389 
are already out there and available and
just<00:01:51.030> mix<00:01:51.420> them<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.799> happens<00:01:53.189> when<00:01:53.340> we

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
just mix them up so what happens when we

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.670 
just mix them up so what happens when we
get<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> internet<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
get the internet and we can now have the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.310 
get the internet and we can now have the
Internet<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.399> our<00:01:56.790> contact<00:01:57.299> lenses<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.930> we

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
Internet in our contact lenses and we

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.020 
Internet in our contact lenses and we
don't<00:01:58.590> need<00:01:58.710> an<00:01:58.860> extra<00:01:59.100> pair<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.430> glasses<00:01:59.670> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
don't need an extra pair of glasses and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.209 
don't need an extra pair of glasses and
so<00:02:00.180> people<00:02:00.360> don't<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.200> we're<00:02:01.829> wearing

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
so people don't know if we're wearing

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.060 
so people don't know if we're wearing
these<00:02:02.520> contact<00:02:03.030> lenses<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.799> you

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
these contact lenses or not and then you

lush<00:02:20.160> dogs<00:02:20.550> that's<00:02:21.360> how<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.660> happens<00:02:22.440> in

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
lush dogs that's how that happens in

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.010 
lush dogs that's how that happens in
that<00:02:22.740> game<00:02:23.160> they<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.940> contact<00:02:24.510> lenses<00:02:24.870> that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
that game they have contact lenses that

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.650 
that game they have contact lenses that
are<00:02:25.080> able<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.560> give<00:02:25.770> them<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:27.330> data

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
are able to give them this this data

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.960 
are able to give them this this data
then<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> already<00:02:29.010> out<00:02:29.220> there<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.670> already

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
then is already out there and is already

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.270 
then is already out there and is already
being<00:02:30.390> implemented<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
being implemented and it's just going to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.700 
being implemented and it's just going to
get<00:02:32.430> smaller<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.180> smaller<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.050> more<00:02:34.470> a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
get smaller and smaller and more a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.600 
get smaller and smaller and more a
harder<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.730> detect<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.650> then<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:38.010> has<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> lot

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
harder to detect and then that has a lot

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.820 
harder to detect and then that has a lot
of<00:02:38.790> implications<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.810> lot<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.290> things<00:02:40.560> and

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
of implications for a lot of things and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.180 
of implications for a lot of things and
it's<00:02:41.220> both<00:02:41.490> wild<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.870> think<00:02:43.170> very<00:02:43.380> scary<00:02:43.950> at

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
it's both wild and I think very scary at

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.820 
it's both wild and I think very scary at
the<00:02:44.250> same<00:02:45.000> time<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.960> post<00:02:46.230> below<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.500> want<00:02:46.770> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
the same time so post below I want to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.130 
the same time so post below I want to
know<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.610> any<00:02:48.090> technology<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.990> you

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
forward to seeing where this technology

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.610 
forward to seeing where this technology
goes<00:02:53.790> Internet<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.840> your<00:02:54.870> eyes<00:02:55.200> does<00:02:55.470> that

or do you think this should be something
