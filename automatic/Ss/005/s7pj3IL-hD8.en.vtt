00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
Libya by nato-led rebel forces I think

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.999 
Libya by nato-led rebel forces I think
that<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.330> idea<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.960> he<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.500> beholden

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that the idea that he would be beholden

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.490 
that the idea that he would be beholden
to<00:01:29.040> these<00:01:29.280> types<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:30.299> agreements<00:01:31.140> would

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
to these types of these agreements would

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.380 
to these types of these agreements would
be<00:01:31.680> off<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.430> table<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.939> point<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
be off the table at this point and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.359 
be off the table at this point and
certainly<00:01:33.689> he<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.320> quoted<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.829> saying<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
certainly he was quoted as saying in

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
certainly he was quoted as saying in
early<00:01:35.700> July<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.329> he<00:01:36.479> would<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.869> willing<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
early July that he would be willing to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
early July that he would be willing to
strike<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.680> at<00:01:37.799> Europe<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.250> Tripoli<00:01:38.670> was

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
strike out at Europe if Tripoli was

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.130 
strike out at Europe if Tripoli was
attacked<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.960> fair

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
attacked so I think it's a fair

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
attacked so I think it's a fair
assumption<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.860> say<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
assumption to say that if there is that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
assumption to say that if there is that
capability<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.600> he<00:01:42.780> would<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.049> looking<00:01:43.290> at

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
capability that he would be looking at

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
capability that he would be looking at
that<00:01:43.710> option<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.340> point<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.729> any<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.570> any

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
that option at this point at any at any

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590 
that option at this point at any at any
rate<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> alternative<00:01:47.329> rebel<00:01:48.329> control

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
rate but the alternative rebel control

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.460 
rate but the alternative rebel control
of<00:01:49.079> chemical<00:01:49.560> weapons<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.159> arguably<00:01:51.060> worse

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
of chemical weapons is arguably worse

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.080 
of chemical weapons is arguably worse
according<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> many<00:01:52.829> some<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> rebel
