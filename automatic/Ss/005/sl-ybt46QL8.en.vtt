your flight in the aerial and back down

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.690 
your flight in the aerial and back down
inside<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.520> inside<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:21.000> centrifuge<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.700> and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
inside of inside the centrifuge and and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.070 
inside of inside the centrifuge and and
again<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.510> another<00:02:24.720> really

unique way to move around the map and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.320 
unique way to move around the map and
and<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:28.410> know<00:02:28.440> everything<00:02:29.430> about<00:02:29.550> zombies

also little secret to be found so maybe

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.010 
also little secret to be found so maybe
these<00:02:34.110> Landers<00:02:34.500> also<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:34.980> something<00:02:35.190> else

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
these Landers also do something else

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.900 
these Landers also do something else
you<00:02:36.800> back<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.280> face<00:02:38.890> hellhounds<00:02:39.890> have<00:02:40.790> been
