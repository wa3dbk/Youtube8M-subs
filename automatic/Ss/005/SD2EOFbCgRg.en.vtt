00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.850
 welcome everyone to the pages 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.410
 video magazine hayden and should today we 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.230
 talk to you about 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.559
 overtraining myth is yarile 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.719
 reality how sad it is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.539
 state overtraining 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.480
 there is not to tell you guys 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.080
 with a huge beard on the internet or else 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 anybody 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.990
 This is all besontovy Ponto cheeks on for 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.890
 virtually because our body can 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.649
 perfect any quality 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.239
 athletic we know 5 up fast costello 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.520
 dexterity but recovery processes 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.120
 they don't train at all that you don't do 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.160
 and so when we train with you 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.289
 getting stronger stronger and faster 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.829
 the recovery process we need 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.210
 lengthen why is it because if you 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.710
 think with the growth of physical qualities he 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.659
 load increases and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.850
 the body gets tired every time more and more 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.100
 like when you first started 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.119
 engage you were catching up there five 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.979
 ten times a year you pull up 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.770
 already ten times hanging on yourself yet 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.100
 kilogram 15 natural organism 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.250
 gets more than a huge load but 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 recover him 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.880
 happen if you continue 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.930
 rest in equal intervals 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.510
 rested a year ago but it's all inside he 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.740
 and what is needed in order to prevent 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.270
 overtraining the most important thing is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.050
 balance to fit your diet 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.320
 power supply 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.550
 or rather adjust your workouts from 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.140
 own nutritional abilities 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.720
 to balance it needs both in quality 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.190
 so by quantity 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.700
 naturally protein fats carbohydrates need 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.840
 drink 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.390
 at least one and a half to two liters of pure water 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.250
 it does not count chuyev coffee 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.860
 soup borscht and another very important factor 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.140
 This conduct training with different 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.220
 intensity 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.920
 cyclic training I advise you to break 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.459
 your workout cycles not by a month 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.860
 training on the strength of the month to weight each 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.970
 training should be different for example 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.840
 if we take a muscle group such as 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.150
 chest muscles 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.150
 if you train them by 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.160
 Mondays, the first Monday will be 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.060
 pure force 45 approach to 35 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.370
 reps 3-5 minutes of rest between 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.709
 approaches 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.400
 next training will be easy you 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:01.150
 take percent at 7060 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.600
 from working weight previous monday 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.400
 when you trained wore make 45 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.860
 approach cuff 10 times with a stock somewhere 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.350
 3-5 reps the next workout will be 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.410
 pure mass set on and when you will 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.900
 do two or three sets with no more minutes 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.660
 between sets of 8-12 reps 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.670
 the next workout is easy that is what 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.240
 we end up with a heavy 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.210
 easy training kachkovskoy and easy and 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.090
 repeating the cycle we do everything through easy 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.510
 the body cannot constantly constantly 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.760
 plow and go uphill naturally it's me 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.450
 I say everything for those who do not use 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.790
 hormones from the outside to train on its 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.820
 what else is called 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.880
 if you get sick don't listen too anyone 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.540
 rest it will be sickness and better for 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.180
 You are not standing with the temperature kept at 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.800
 first harm yourself secondly infect 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.070
 surrounding and remember better a little bit not 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.170
 train than perry to train 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.030
 state of overtraining severe 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.850
 overtraining is very scary 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.790
 condition close to serious illness 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:22.890
 flu when you have it all 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.800
 when the skin is impossible to touch it 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.570
 very very poor condition 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.570
 discarding us achieving our goals 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.290
 gaining muscle mass and strength 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:37.050
 far, far back so gradually 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:42.030
 climb the stairs do not force 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:44.790
 better longer but better 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.210
 don't listen to anyone around us always 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.660
 always beats 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.690
 such a number of all knowledgeable jocks or 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.810
 security officials but for some reason they are every three 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.110
 months, the maximum change in 20 years 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.940
 workouts i have so many people already around 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.190
 saw myself who started with me 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.220
 train just levi again started 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.750
 continued to listen to no one 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.539
 listen only to your body and 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.210
 your body knows your needs when 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.030
 you need to train if you are looking 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.400
 reasons to force for which not to tear 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.400
 this is not normal for training should 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.900
 pull you must tear from the desire to go 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.090
 to train this means you 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.240
 recovered the same with nutrition 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.130
 eat what you want don't listen what 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.470
 can eat pork beef 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.940
 need to eat what you need if we all 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:40.750
 consist of dna's own molecules and 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.389
 only this dictates what we need to eat 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:48.400
 have our needs through flavoring 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:50.349
 needs are expressed in the world therefore 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.009
 guys just listen to yourself 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:57.039
 learn training and nutrition methods 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.820
 champions but skip it all 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.050
 prism 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.990
 no one can teach you better than you 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:10.030
 what you need for your body and 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:12.400
 Remember that the teacher is not the one who likes 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.060
 and that teacher 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.810
 from whom you learn life is the best 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.090
