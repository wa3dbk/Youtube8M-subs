 the south of France 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.850
 When I started 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 it also becomes very good-looking that has remained in the memories of 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.610
 beekeepers because it's been a year 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.230
 very profitable for beekeeping 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.230
 especially at the level of Iranian media reproduction 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.830
 and then the man there is a decade that 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.500
 the day now shocks you from year to year by creating 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440
 colonies and 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.340
 the operators as best as possible

 prisoner of the mermaid rosemary honey waiting to be harvested 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.430
 let's see how it is acquired that the author has at his extraction 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.280
 when they have recovered the nectar the foragers do not return to the hive 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.650
 and drop it in the coming years 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.700
 before being hit by a thin layer of wax the nectar will lose only 80% 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.770
 of its content in our and will give honey 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.020
 with his knife at intercultures 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 the beekeeper retires the sir who restrains lamielle 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.280
 the method is artisanal and delicate 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.909
 the frames are then left between the mechanics of the centrifuge 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.760
 in the hive the workers build the cells slightly inclined 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.929
 to the top 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:23.649
 so the cniel the problem alas the analyst did not fall 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.340
 in the centrifuge the frame is placed vertically the force 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.339
 centrifuge only has to do its job 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.149
 she 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.959
 mine will remain after four to five days in the match of fear he 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.959
 will come out straight 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:08.039
 the work of the beekeeper does not consist only after colt the honey he 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.609
 also brings together the necessary conditions to sap to put the 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.529
 hive 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.549
 it is better to screw up the tunic that we were monk said fortnight 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.119
 of beekeepers it is provided with our protections that we leave to the 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.039
 meeting hives and its inhabitants of saint-louis 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:28.279
 the hell moire imposes on the colony to go to the bottom of the hive they beat 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:32.859
 wings to ventilate the smoke so their habitat m hennessy beekeepers 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.859
 do its job 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 so we'll have to add a subcontractor floor 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:44.839
 it 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.799
 this is called eurosystem 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.009
 as the day before 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.919
 it's all about getting home 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.239
 she will slow down the floors 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.279
 successive 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.419
 that we harvest rare and that's the part that come back to the beekeeper 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.509
 it works 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.509
 how does it react when you come 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.049
 2 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.339
 ppda trust 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:11.549
 one of the accidents 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.529
 but still we take a body 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:15.469
 old oars 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.559
 some of their booty 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.609
 but we can also take so that we have no problem but for 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.409
 hundred because even react 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.559
 sometimes with a little aggression what is normal it is as if you 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.219
 coming 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:31.389
 a woman with beautiful provisions does the same 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.389
 pat lafontaine 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.389
 in general it happens 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.020
 it's a big problem 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.330
 to harvest honey agrees but the farmer must be as 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.500
 know how bees work to raise them in good 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.500
 health and hope to get the famous nectar 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:55.120
 in our time on a fall of 6 15% performance 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.659
 we are obliged to 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.860
 surveying constantly so as to always have the flock of young people with 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:04.680
 vigorous 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.830
 who will give and insure a colony is very strong and it is through these 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.229
 settlements 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.559
 very strong that we get to have good productions and good 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.089
 honey harvests 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:18.770
 the resident of cologny fortassin will defend especially best against 

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:23.339
 external aggression the bee and beekeepers were resisted in front of a 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:24.720
 formidable threat 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.319
 the treatments are agricultural 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.479
 in tow of large losses of bee colonies from 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.719
 Field crop areas in regions 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.719
 he meets opens large areas of rapeseed 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:41.529
 of sunflower and its terraces are crops that are very often 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.949
 treated with phytosanitary products 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.219
 but also it's deadly for bees 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.029
 we in our region 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.629
 we are still a little sheltered from all that 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.169
 we realize that it is the beekeepers from the site who say it 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.689
 that harvests are therefore becoming weaker 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:02.169
 hence the interest of having for colonies more and more vigorous and 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.430
 performing 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.770
 the flowers that diminishes 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.860
 a small lozenge the floral species life 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.319
 the floral varieties that are becoming increasingly rare 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.710
 all that has made the bees are more and more stressed Tuesday final 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:18.669
 we must learn true bad care about preserving 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:23.299
 the bee because four today if there was more culture going on 

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.699
 ask whether to assure them bees 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.719
 lafleur is the basis of the diet of the manip this is 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.759
 the flower that will produce the nectar 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.199
 but percent and the day before by his pollination work not on them 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.199
 the renewal of the floral species 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.740
 the site more pay more flowers more flowers more fruits more than 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.439
 vegetables and bigger thing in the end 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.569
 the man endangering the bank and its environment 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.449
 but that's not all since the 80's Ace beekeepers 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:58.120
 to face a parasite is inevitable in the profession the destructive Var 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:03.139
 it was my career that is present in all the colonies today 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:09.069
 but we can not not treat our colonies against word because if our 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:11.809
 savings are doomed to a murid 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:15.389
 it was my career that thrives on immolating it, that is, within the 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:16.909
 Eve 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:18.309

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:20.830
 the city has already weakened 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.750
 the bees on top of that they come inoculate them the virus we have bees 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.749
 but probably already profiled 

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:32.459
 who will not be able to innate purpose and communal water normal size 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:37.650
 to preserve the bees is to preserve the environment that shared with us 

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:39.279
 take pleasure 

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:42.599
 the beekeeper established him to understand them 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:46.199
 he has to learn the methods of breeding and more respectful for the 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.179
 sect 

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:52.039
 passion and knowledge are the keys to beekeeping that's how we 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:56.120
 can continue to enjoy the products of the hive but also 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.130
 of nature
