00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.070 
what does that mean air pressure is
going<00:00:58.130> down<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:58.550> this<00:00:58.820> does<00:00:59.270> this<00:00:59.450> have<00:00:59.720> the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
going down is this does this have the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.040 
going down is this does this have the
capacity<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.770> pull<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.370> my<00:01:01.610> hand<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.900> this

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:43.550 

now<00:03:34.780> you're<00:03:34.930> done<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.290> very<00:03:41.530> weird<00:03:41.950> feeling

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
this is a garbage bag that's true I

00:03:48.459 --> 00:04:14.670 
this is a garbage bag that's true I
guess<00:03:48.640> so

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.420 

yeah<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.040> I<00:04:16.130> was<00:04:16.220> funnier<00:04:16.730> though<00:04:21.430> alright

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
yeah and I was funnier though alright

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:31.490 
yeah and I was funnier though alright
here<00:04:22.670> we<00:04:22.700> go

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.150 

really<00:04:32.070> difficult<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.730> do<00:04:33.170> so<00:04:34.170> weird<00:04:34.770> feeling

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
really difficult to do so weird feeling

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.480 
really difficult to do so weird feeling
isn't<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.810> okay<00:04:36.810> so<00:04:37.710> weird<00:04:37.950> feeling<00:04:38.370> is

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
isn't it okay so weird feeling is

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.890 
isn't it okay so weird feeling is
because<00:04:38.790> really<00:04:39.120> what's<00:04:39.330> happening<00:04:39.720> we're

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
because really what's happening we're

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.780 
because really what's happening we're
removing<00:04:41.900> air<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:43.500> molecules<00:04:44.100> bears<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.670> then

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
removing air in molecules bears so then

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.250 
removing air in molecules bears so then
the<00:04:44.910> air<00:04:45.030> pressure<00:04:45.210> outside<00:04:45.450> much<00:04:45.990> greater

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
the air pressure outside much greater

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.530 
the air pressure outside much greater
pushing<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:47.130> it's<00:04:47.610> really<00:04:47.940> tough<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.210> push

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
pushing it in it's really tough to push

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.140 
pushing it in it's really tough to push
against<00:04:48.930> because<00:04:49.140> usually<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:50.100> have<00:04:50.220> 14.7

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
against because usually you have 14.7

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.970 
against because usually you have 14.7
pushing<00:04:51.480> on<00:04:51.570> both<00:04:51.780> sides<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.350> then<00:04:52.500> it's<00:04:52.650> okay

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
pushing on both sides so then it's okay

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.300 
pushing on both sides so then it's okay
this<00:04:53.610> way<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:53.910> just<00:04:54.000> have<00:04:54.300> 14.7<00:04:55.200> pushing<00:04:55.620> in

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
this way you just have 14.7 pushing in

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:31.200 
this way you just have 14.7 pushing in
nothing<00:04:57.150> out<00:04:57.360> one<00:04:58.110> more<00:04:58.290> person

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:51.360 

ready

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.690 

it<00:05:51.520> does<00:05:51.699> cause<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:51.970> case<00:05:52.270> at<00:05:52.449> the<00:05:52.510> game
