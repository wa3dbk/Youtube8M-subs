hey guys what's up I'm Daniel F I'm

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.150 
hey guys what's up I'm Daniel F I'm
racing<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.449> formula<00:00:03.810> e<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.140> we<00:00:04.200> are<00:00:04.440> right<00:00:05.040> in

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
racing the formula e and we are right in

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.099 
racing the formula e and we are right in
front<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.759> pit<00:00:06.180> garage<00:00:06.509> where<00:00:06.899> I'm<00:00:06.960> gonna

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
front of my pit garage where I'm gonna

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.839 
front of my pit garage where I'm gonna
show<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.379> around<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.770> bit<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.220> show<00:00:08.790> you

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
show you around a bit and show you

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.790 
show you around a bit and show you
what's<00:00:09.030> happening<00:00:09.389> inside<00:00:09.690> let's<00:00:10.080> go<00:00:15.800> so

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
what's happening inside let's go so

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.470 
what's happening inside let's go so
obviously<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.430> where<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.730> got<00:00:17.880> our<00:00:17.910> cars

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
obviously this is where we got our cars

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.010 
obviously this is where we got our cars
based

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
based

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.519 
based
every<00:00:19.650> driver<00:00:19.890> has<00:00:20.130> two<00:00:20.340> cars<00:00:20.810> these<00:00:21.810> are<00:00:21.869> mine

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
every driver has two cars these are mine

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.439 
every driver has two cars these are mine
these<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.220> Lucas's<00:00:23.640> cars<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> other<00:00:24.119> side

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
these are Lucas's cars on the other side

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.750 
these are Lucas's cars on the other side
the<00:00:25.260> mechanics<00:00:25.710> right<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.039> checking

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the mechanics right now checking

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.349 
the mechanics right now checking
everything<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.480> make<00:00:27.599> sure<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.470> working<00:00:29.359> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
everything to make sure it's working and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.910 
everything to make sure it's working and
circuits<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.320> getting<00:00:31.830> very

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
circuits like this it's getting very

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.950 
circuits like this it's getting very
very<00:00:32.160> hard<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.520> mean<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.730> got<00:00:32.880> 35<00:00:33.329> degrees<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
very hard I mean we got 35 degrees and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.600 
very hard I mean we got 35 degrees and
in<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.590> under<00:00:34.890> where<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.430> aren't

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
in there we got under where we aren't

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.119 
in there we got under where we aren't
used<00:00:35.969> we're<00:00:36.390> really<00:00:36.690> sweating<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> lot<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:38.070> is

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
used we're really sweating a lot this is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.229 
used we're really sweating a lot this is
the<00:00:38.309> steering<00:00:38.550> wheel<00:00:38.730> where<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.090> all

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the steering wheel where we have all

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.180 
the steering wheel where we have all
those<00:00:39.390> settings<00:00:39.629> talk<00:00:40.410> map<00:00:40.680> which<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.040> like

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
those settings talk map which is like

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.860 
those settings talk map which is like
the<00:00:41.309> power<00:00:41.460> output<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the power output that we got we got a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.799 
the power output that we got we got a
pedal<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.879> region

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
pedal here that we can like region

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
pedal here that we can like region
without<00:00:46.020> pressing<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> brakes<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.340> all

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
without pressing the brakes this is all

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.770 
without pressing the brakes this is all
the<00:00:47.640> stuff<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> need<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.420> get<00:00:48.539> used<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the stuff that you need to get used to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
the stuff that you need to get used to
when<00:00:48.989> you're<00:00:49.079> racing<00:00:49.200> formula<00:00:49.649> we've<00:00:49.879> enough

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
when you're racing formula we've enough

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.779 
when you're racing formula we've enough
with<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> let<00:00:51.449> me<00:00:51.539> show<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.750> something<00:00:52.079> else

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
with that let me show you something else

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.100 
with that let me show you something else
obviously<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.910> got<00:00:53.940> our<00:00:54.180> sponsors<00:00:54.719> displayed

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
obviously we got our sponsors displayed

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
obviously we got our sponsors displayed
very<00:00:55.379> important<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.640> wouldn't<00:00:56.850> be

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
very important you know we wouldn't be

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.130 
very important you know we wouldn't be
here<00:00:57.059> without<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.870> where<00:00:58.020> we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
here without them this is where we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.510 
here without them this is where we
normally<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> debrief<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
normally have the debrief with the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.220 
normally have the debrief with the
engineer<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> driver<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.780> got<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
engineer as a driver and we got all the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.689 
engineer as a driver and we got all the
info<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.559> need<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> screen<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.370> got<00:01:02.520> live

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
info we need on the screen we got live

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
info we need on the screen we got live
TV<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.480> got<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> ranking<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.769> got<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> track<00:01:05.250> map

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
TV we got the ranking we got a track map

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
TV we got the ranking we got a track map
with<00:01:05.670> GPS<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> laptop<00:01:06.900> setup<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.409> we

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
with GPS all the laptop setup so we

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.200 
with GPS all the laptop setup so we
check<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> data<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.220> analyze<00:01:08.580> everything<00:01:08.880> we

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
check the data we analyze everything we

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.520 
check the data we analyze everything we
see<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.049> also<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
see where we are this is also where the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.350 
see where we are this is also where the
engineers<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.040> while<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.700> racing<00:01:12.060> so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
engineers are while we are racing so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.940 
engineers are while we are racing so
that's<00:01:12.659> where<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> magic<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.350> happening<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that's where the magic is happening and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
that's where the magic is happening and
hopefully<00:01:14.430> good<00:01:14.880> decisions<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.479> being<00:01:15.900> made

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
hopefully good decisions are being made

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.170 
hopefully good decisions are being made
you<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.430> busy<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:17.790> all

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
to disturb them let's go the other way

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.719 
to disturb them let's go the other way
here<00:01:22.549> we<00:01:22.670> are<00:01:22.700> at<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.939> back<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.119> all<00:01:23.360> get<00:01:23.540> rich
