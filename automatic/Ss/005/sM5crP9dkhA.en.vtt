00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Fried Rice

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.400
So what do we need?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.240
1 cup of rice

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.383
Or 2

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.154
It doesn't really matter

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.100
3 eggs

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.440
Soy sauce

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.920
And ginger

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.000
1 onion

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.960
Let's start with the rice

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.780
Turn the heat on high

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.174
Oil

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.140
(There's going to be plenty of oil so dont put too much)

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.020
Cup of rice=2 glasses of water

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.180
Brown rice= 4 glasses of water

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.760
Mix it

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.660
And now the catch

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.660
Once you start smelling a fried smell (smell of popcorn), add the water

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.360
Okay stop

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.540
Wait for the water to boil

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.720
Lower the heat to a simmer

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.360
And cover the pot

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760
We'll be back to the rice in 15minutes

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.720
It's still not time to rest!

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.300
Cut the edges of the onion

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.580
And then in half

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.920
Peel the skin

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.480
And dice it into cubes

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.320
See that the pieces are thick? No worries! There's a solution

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.460
Keep cutting them untill it'll be thin enough for your taste

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.520
Fry the onion

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.280
In a few minutes the onion will be fried

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.920
(Or in less then a second ifyou have an editing program)

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.040
Let's continue 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.960
Break 3 eggs

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.915
A spoon of milk

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460
Really?! Yep

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.400
Mix it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.780
Tilt the bowl to the side

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.594
Butter the pan

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.220
And make a scrambled egg

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.860
Okay cool

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.620
Back to the rice

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.920
Ready!

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.620
Yours is burned?

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.920
You didn't put enough oil

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.180
Or you left it on the heat for too lng

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.560
Its okay! Throw away the burned part

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.740
Oil for Frying the rice

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.540
Add the onion

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.480
And the scrambled egg

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.140
Soy sauce

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.400
(Put plenty)

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.920
And the ginger

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.600
Fried rice!

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.000
But Gal, What happen if there're lots of leftovers. What am I supposed to do with it?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.880
Save them in boxes and eat them later!

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.740
You saved money for ice cream in Anita

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.260

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.300
