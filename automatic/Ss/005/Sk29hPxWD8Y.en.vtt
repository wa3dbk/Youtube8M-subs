00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
top tier montage with a song and I was

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.050 
top tier montage with a song and I was
like<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.280> making<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.580> big<00:01:20.670> montage<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
like if I was making a big montage I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
like if I was making a big montage I
would<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.420> saved<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.080> told<00:01:22.409> nobody

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
would have saved this and told nobody

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.499 
would have saved this and told nobody
about<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:23.939> making<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> big<00:01:24.360> one

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
about it but I'm not making a big one

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.670 
about it but I'm not making a big one
obviously<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.229> thought<00:01:25.350> I'd<00:01:25.500> put<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
obviously I just thought I'd put a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.230 
obviously I just thought I'd put a
little<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.979> together<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.340> my<00:01:26.400> channel<00:01:26.790> some

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
little one together on my channel some

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.060

to let it click in my head that I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.539 
to let it click in my head that I
haven't<00:01:56.850> missed<00:01:57.119> yet<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.780> don't<00:01:57.899> know

to myself I could go for this 100%

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.010 
to myself I could go for this 100%
accuracy<00:02:04.560> nuclear<00:02:05.189> because<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.390> don't<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:06.930> if

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
accuracy nuclear because I don't know if

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.240 
accuracy nuclear because I don't know if

why did I shoot through the barrels why

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
did I even attempt that shot it was such

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.130 
did I even attempt that shot it was such
a<00:02:46.410> dumb<00:02:46.709> shot<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.250> challenge<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.600> went<00:02:48.930> for

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
a dumb shot to challenge and I went for

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.590 
a dumb shot to challenge and I went for
it<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.350> I'm<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.580> annoying<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.120> if<00:02:51.209> maybe<00:02:51.450> if

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
it and I'm so annoying like if maybe if

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600 
it and I'm so annoying like if maybe if
I<00:02:51.690> had<00:02:51.810> FMJ<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.590> would<00:02:52.980> have<00:02:53.069> at<00:02:53.250> least<00:02:53.280> hit

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
I had FMJ on it would have at least hit

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.199 
I had FMJ on it would have at least hit
marked<00:02:53.910> him<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.340> went<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.760> went<00:02:56.940> for

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
marked him but I went for it I went for

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.640 
marked him but I went for it I went for
it<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.450> was<00:02:57.569> on<00:02:57.660> 20<00:02:58.080> what<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.260> think<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.560> was

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
it and I was on 20 what I think that was

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.949 
it and I was on 20 what I think that was
her<00:02:58.769> 21st<00:02:59.160> kill<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.790> what<00:03:00.569> makes<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.870> even

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
her 21st kill and what makes it even

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.140 
her 21st kill and what makes it even
worse<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.160> keep<00:03:02.370> going<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.090> don't

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
worse is that I keep going and I don't

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.470 
worse is that I keep going and I don't
miss<00:03:03.450> another<00:03:03.600> shot<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.350> get<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.799> nuclear

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
miss another shot and I get the nuclear

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.090 
miss another shot and I get the nuclear
with<00:03:06.480> only<00:03:06.660> missing<00:03:06.959> one<00:03:06.989> shot<00:03:07.350> which<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.830> I

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
with only missing one shot which is I

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.240 
with only missing one shot which is I
don't<00:03:08.640> know<00:03:08.730> if<00:03:08.850> that's<00:03:09.030> worse<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:10.440> think<00:03:10.830> I

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
don't know if that's worse I think I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.530 
don't know if that's worse I think I
would<00:03:11.430> have<00:03:11.519> probably<00:03:11.730> preferred<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.390> miss

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
would have probably preferred to miss

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.479 
would have probably preferred to miss
more<00:03:12.750> shots<00:03:13.019> after<00:03:13.410> but<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.950> idea<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.340> that

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
more shots after but the idea that that

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.360 
more shots after but the idea that that
one<00:03:14.730> shot<00:03:15.090> has<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:16.109> changed<00:03:16.650> everything<00:03:16.799> it

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
one shot has just changed everything it

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.530 
one shot has just changed everything it
changed<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.730> all<00:03:17.880> because<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.269> could<00:03:18.420> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
changed it all because that could I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.180 
changed it all because that could I
don't<00:03:18.720> know<00:03:18.780> if<00:03:18.900> anyone's<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.320> before<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:20.070> I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
don't know if anyone's it before like I

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.009 
don't know if anyone's it before like I
