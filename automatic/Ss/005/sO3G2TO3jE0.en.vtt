toxic factory but never cleaned up the
chemicals<00:01:14.270> uh<00:01:15.010> you<00:01:16.010> had<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.370> chance<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:17.000> take

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
chemicals uh you had the chance to take

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.600 
chemicals uh you had the chance to take
care<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:17.720> toxic<00:01:18.020> mess<00:01:18.440> for<00:01:18.680> years<00:01:19.160> but

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
care of that toxic mess for years but

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.530 
care of that toxic mess for years but
did<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:20.170> know<00:01:21.170> no<00:01:22.160> human<00:01:22.760> ever<00:01:22.910> lifted<00:01:23.450> a

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
did you know no human ever lifted a

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.859 
did you know no human ever lifted a
finger<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:23.930> make<00:01:24.320> things<00:01:24.710> right

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
finger to make things right

now<00:01:26.200> it's<00:01:26.799> our<00:01:27.130> time<00:01:28.149> yeah<00:01:28.359> we've<00:01:29.109> joined

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
now it's our time yeah we've joined

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.649 
now it's our time yeah we've joined
forces<00:01:29.530> with<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.189> bugs<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.670> rock<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.390> take

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
forces with the bugs and rock to take

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.410 
forces with the bugs and rock to take
your<00:01:31.869> humans<00:01:32.320> out<00:01:32.590> we<00:01:33.579> never<00:01:33.789> knew<00:01:34.090> just<00:01:34.329> how

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
your humans out we never knew just how

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.899 
your humans out we never knew just how
bad<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.719> pollution<00:01:35.289> was<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:36.310> brought<00:01:36.700> this

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
bad the pollution was you brought this

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.160 
bad the pollution was you brought this
upon<00:01:36.969> yourselves

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.050 

think<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.320> how<00:01:42.470> harmful<00:01:42.890> toxins<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.790> sludge

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
think of how harmful toxins and sludge

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.480 
think of how harmful toxins and sludge
are<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.140> then<00:01:45.560> imagine<00:01:45.799> how<00:01:46.220> would<00:01:46.460> it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
are to you and then imagine how would it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.180 
are to you and then imagine how would it
feel<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.090> be<00:01:47.210> made<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:47.840> no<00:01:48.590> we're<00:01:49.009> gonna

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
feel to be made of it no we're gonna

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.670 
feel to be made of it no we're gonna
finish<00:01:49.460> what<00:01:49.759> mankind<00:01:50.030> foolishly<00:01:50.930> Storme

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
finish what mankind foolishly Storme

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.070 
finish what mankind foolishly Storme
what's<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.090> destruction<00:01:53.810> of<00:01:53.900> your

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
what's that the destruction of your

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.590 
what's that the destruction of your
environment<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.369> create<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.790> toxic<00:01:56.180> world

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
environment you create a toxic world

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.040 
environment you create a toxic world
we'll<00:01:57.200> just<00:01:57.500> speed<00:01:57.740> up<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:58.009> process<00:01:59.050> humans

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
we'll just speed up the process humans

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.219 
we'll just speed up the process humans
are<00:02:00.200> much<00:02:00.409> weaker<00:02:00.800> than<00:02:01.190> I<00:02:01.369> expected<00:02:02.000> no<00:02:02.780> it's

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
are much weaker than I expected no it's

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.930 
are much weaker than I expected no it's
not<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.799> these<00:02:03.950> silly<00:02:04.220> humans<00:02:04.670> are<00:02:04.820> much

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
not that these silly humans are much

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.240 
not that these silly humans are much
weaker<00:02:05.509> it's<00:02:05.720> just<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.440> weird<00:02:06.770> much

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
weaker it's just that weird much

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.270 
weaker it's just that weird much
stronger<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.300> more<00:02:09.080> pollution<00:02:09.560> everyday

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
stronger and more pollution everyday

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.060 
stronger and more pollution everyday
