00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
and I think it was from there that the

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.190 
and I think it was from there that the
history<00:06:35.610> of<00:06:35.640> the<00:06:35.790> club<00:06:35.940> has<00:06:36.150> developed<00:06:36.630> and<00:06:36.810> I

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
history of the club has developed and I

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.660 
history of the club has developed and I
know<00:06:37.260> that's<00:06:37.500> quite<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.770> poignant<00:06:38.310> thing<00:06:38.520> and

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
know that's quite a poignant thing and

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.220 
know that's quite a poignant thing and
