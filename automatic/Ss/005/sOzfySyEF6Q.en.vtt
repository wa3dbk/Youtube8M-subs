push<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:07.049> they<00:01:07.170> essentially

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
push on them and then they essentially

push on them and then they essentially
have<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:08.010> special<00:01:08.220> summon<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.060> they

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

off so rocha makes it so your opponent
really<00:01:13.950> can't<00:01:14.159> OGK<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.140> unless<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.320> know

obviously if they have dark hole then

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
obviously if they have dark hole then
utopia<00:01:18.509> isn't<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.110> much<00:01:19.170> different

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
where's Roach they basically have to use

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.569 
where's Roach they basically have to use
multiple<00:01:36.689> cards<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.229> obviously<00:01:37.579> agents

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
multiple cards you know obviously agents

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.270 
multiple cards you know obviously agents
they<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.119> hyperion<00:01:39.810> utopia<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:41.189> know

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
they can go hyperion utopia but you know

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.100 
they can go hyperion utopia but you know
you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.610> detach<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.329> Roach<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:42.930> like

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you can detach for Roach and then like

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.389 
you can detach for Roach and then like
if<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.590> Christy<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.130> detach

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
if they go for Christy you just detach

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.340 
if they go for Christy you just detach
again<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.049> another

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
again like and if they get another

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.100 
again like and if they get another
hyperion<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.759> they've<00:01:48.270> obviously<00:01:48.570> have

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
hyperion out then they've obviously have

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.859 
hyperion out then they've obviously have
many<00:01:49.920> many<00:01:50.070> answers<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.240> can't<00:01:51.720> just

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
many many answers and you can't just

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.440 
many many answers and you can't just
stick<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> roach<00:01:52.409> anyways<00:01:53.090> but<00:01:54.090> roaches

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
stick with the roach anyways but roaches

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.060 
stick with the roach anyways but roaches
just<00:01:54.630> overall<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.079> good<00:01:55.229> against<00:01:55.439> agents<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
just overall to good against agents and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.730 
just overall to good against agents and
when<00:01:56.759> with<00:01:57.329> format<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.840> basically<00:01:58.200> plants<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
when with format of basically plants and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520 
when with format of basically plants and
agents<00:01:59.100> making<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> top<00:02:00.390> list<00:02:00.689> Roach<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
agents making the top list Roach is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.289 
agents making the top list Roach is
definitely<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:01.920> good<00:02:02.310> against<00:02:03.119> both<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
definitely very good against both of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.190 
definitely very good against both of
those<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:05.390> plants<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.049> they're

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
those as plants you can like if they're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.270 
those as plants you can like if they're
running<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.469> thunder<00:02:07.680> hand<00:02:07.890> they<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:07.979> summon

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
running a thunder hand they can summon

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.369 
running a thunder hand they can summon
Thunder<00:02:08.550> King<00:02:08.849> point<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.330> point<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:10.259> our

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
Thunder King point for point but our

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.170 
Thunder King point for point but our
Roach<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.800> too<00:02:10.979> good<00:02:11.190> obviously<00:02:11.940> these<00:02:12.120> are

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
Roach is too good obviously these are

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.340 
Roach is too good obviously these are
the<00:02:12.360> best<00:02:12.599> also

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the best also

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.780 
the best also
oh just<00:02:13.740> because<00:02:13.830> their<00:02:14.100> lights<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.580> darks

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
oh just because their lights and darks

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.270 
oh just because their lights and darks
and<00:02:15.060> obviously<00:02:15.540> lying<00:02:16.260> dark<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.740> pretty<00:02:17.100> much

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
and obviously lying dark are pretty much

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.900 
and obviously lying dark are pretty much
how<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.550> format<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.090> ran<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.280> Roach<00:02:20.550> just

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
how the format is ran and so Roach just

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.760 
how the format is ran and so Roach just
overall<00:02:21.480> too<00:02:21.660> good<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.560> get<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.710> chance

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
overall too good so if you get a chance

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.090 
overall too good so if you get a chance
to<00:02:23.510> put<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.630> both<00:02:24.900> that's<00:02:25.200> great<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:25.980> you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
to put in both that's great but if you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.340 
to put in both that's great but if you
do<00:02:26.370> have<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.970> choice<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.510> putting<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.050> i

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
do have the choice of putting one in i

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.140 
do have the choice of putting one in i
would<00:02:28.770> suggest<00:02:28.920> putting<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.460> roch<00:02:29.700> just

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
would suggest putting in roch just

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.720 
would suggest putting in roch just
because<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:31.620> forces<00:02:32.190> your<00:02:32.310> plan<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.610> use

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
because it forces your plan to use

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.340 
because it forces your plan to use
multiple<00:02:33.090> cards<00:02:33.390> whereas<00:02:33.630> utopia<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.200> kind

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
multiple cards whereas utopia just kind

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.380 
multiple cards whereas utopia just kind
