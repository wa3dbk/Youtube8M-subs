he's<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> small<00:02:25.250> fish<00:02:25.549> and<00:02:26.180> he<00:02:26.239> got<00:02:26.420> into<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
he's a small fish and he got into the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.479 
he's a small fish and he got into the
transducer<00:02:27.410> line<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.769> was<00:02:27.860> gonna<00:02:28.010> say<00:02:28.190> if<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.340> get

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
transducer line I was gonna say if I get

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.550 
transducer line I was gonna say if I get
a<00:02:28.519> big<00:02:28.730> perch<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.239> what<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.930> would<00:02:30.140> do<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.410> I'd

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
a big perch on what I would do is I'd

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.530 
a big perch on what I would do is I'd
pull<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.830> transducer<00:02:31.430> line<00:02:31.610> out<00:02:31.790> because<00:02:32.480> I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
pull the transducer line out because I

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.750 
pull the transducer line out because I
don't<00:02:32.660> want<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.709> big<00:02:34.010> fish<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.370> catch<00:02:34.579> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
don't want a the big fish to catch the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.039 
don't want a the big fish to catch the
hooks<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.180> because<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.540> lures<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:35.900> we're

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
hooks on it because the lures that we're

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.530 
hooks on it because the lures that we're
using<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.950> can<00:02:37.130> see<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.610> two<00:02:37.880> single<00:02:38.329> hooks

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
using you can see have two single hooks

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.199 
using you can see have two single hooks
one<00:02:38.840> at<00:02:38.959> each<00:02:39.079> end<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:40.220> very<00:02:40.250> small<00:02:40.760> treble

one at each end and a very small treble

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.880 
one at each end and a very small treble
hook<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:42.019> even<00:02:42.290> though<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.440> can't<00:02:42.739> eat<00:02:42.860> that

like a pretty decent fish just reeling

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.960 
like a pretty decent fish just reeling
him<00:03:05.660> slow<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.230> key<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:07.160> know<00:03:07.310> when<00:03:07.820> you're

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
him slow the key you know when you're

him slow the key you know when you're
ice<00:03:08.090> fishing<00:03:08.120> because<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.900> hole<00:03:09.110> isn't<00:03:09.410> huge

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
ice fishing because the hole isn't huge

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.280 
ice fishing because the hole isn't huge
is<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.790> slow<00:03:11.090> down<00:03:11.360> when<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:11.780> get<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.140> ice

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
is to slow down when you get to the ice

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.500 
is to slow down when you get to the ice
edge<00:03:12.650> because<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.670> don't<00:03:13.849> want<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.209> hooks

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
edge because you don't want the hooks

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.240 
edge because you don't want the hooks
see<00:03:14.930> in<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.140> case<00:03:15.379> this<00:03:15.590> guy's<00:03:15.830> hooked<00:03:16.099> on

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
see in this case this guy's hooked on

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.040 
see in this case this guy's hooked on
the<00:03:16.340> front<00:03:16.610> hook<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:17.330> hook<00:03:17.660> right<00:03:17.870> here

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
the front hook this hook right here

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.620 
the front hook this hook right here
could<00:03:18.260> potentially<00:03:18.770> catch<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.190> ice<00:03:19.310> on

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
could potentially catch the ice on

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.690 
could potentially catch the ice on
way<00:03:19.780> up<00:03:19.960> so<00:03:20.590> what<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:20.890> want<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.130> do<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.370> slow

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
way up so what you want to do is slow

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.450 
way up so what you want to do is slow
down<00:03:21.870> then<00:03:22.870> make<00:03:23.080> sure<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.280> hooks

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
down then make sure that the hooks

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.580 
down then make sure that the hooks
aren't<00:03:24.820> going<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.000> get<00:03:25.090> caught<00:03:25.300> on<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.480> ice<00:03:25.720> so

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
aren't going to get caught on the ice so

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.290 
aren't going to get caught on the ice so
what<00:03:26.710> I<00:03:26.740> want<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.040> do<00:03:27.190> here<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.490> very<00:03:27.520> carefully

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.660 
you'll notice that the line here is blue
and<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.840> line<00:03:56.050> over<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:56.920> right<00:03:57.370> is

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
and that the line over to the right is

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.760 
and that the line over to the right is
clear<00:03:58.180> with<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> very<00:03:58.840> small<00:03:59.230> barrel<00:03:59.590> swivel

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
clear with a very small barrel swivel

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.220 
clear with a very small barrel swivel
okay<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:00.970> I've<00:04:01.210> got<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.390> swivel<00:04:01.810> on<00:04:01.930> there<00:04:02.080> for

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
okay so I've got a swivel on there for

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.140 
okay so I've got a swivel on there for
two<00:04:02.380> reasons<00:04:02.800> one<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.520> make<00:04:03.670> my<00:04:03.850> connection

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
two reasons one to make my connection

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.380 
two reasons one to make my connection
because<00:04:04.990> this<00:04:05.170> line<00:04:05.470> here<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.100> titanium<00:04:06.850> ice

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
because this line here is a titanium ice

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.540 
because this line here is a titanium ice
braid<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.800> it's<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.100> one<00:04:09.220> that's<00:04:09.340> eight

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
braid and it's the one that's eight

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.230 
braid and it's the one that's eight
pound<00:04:09.820> test<00:04:10.050> 1.5<00:04:11.050> monofilament<00:04:12.000> pound<00:04:13.000> test

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
pound test 1.5 monofilament pound test

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.120 
pound test 1.5 monofilament pound test
diameter<00:04:13.810> then<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:14.440> have<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.650> piece<00:04:14.950> of

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
diameter then I have a piece of

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.699 
diameter then I have a piece of
fluorocarbon<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.720> goes<00:04:16.930> right<00:04:17.140> down<00:04:17.380> to

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
fluorocarbon and that goes right down to

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.580 
fluorocarbon and that goes right down to
my<00:04:17.890> lure<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.760> I've<00:04:18.880> got<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.450> locking<00:04:20.140> snap

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
my lure and I've got that locking snap

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.620 
my lure and I've got that locking snap
that<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:20.920> like<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.370> use<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.820> can<00:04:22.030> quick<00:04:22.270> change

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
that I like to use so I can quick change

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.860 
that I like to use so I can quick change
okay<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:23.920> here's<00:04:24.670> what<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> lines<00:04:25.270> look<00:04:25.570> like

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
okay so here's what the lines look like

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.410 
okay so here's what the lines look like
when<00:04:26.560> you're<00:04:26.680> getting<00:04:27.070> them<00:04:27.280> okay<00:04:27.730> very

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
when you're getting them okay very

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.440 
when you're getting them okay very
important<00:04:29.080> this<00:04:29.920> is<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.270> the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
important this is the this is the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.260 
important this is the this is the
invisible<00:04:32.110> light<00:04:32.580> leader<00:04:33.580> material<00:04:33.790> right

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
invisible light leader material right

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.680 
invisible light leader material right
here

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
here

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.720 
here
it's<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.960> fluorocarbon<00:04:35.710> see<00:04:36.340> right<00:04:36.490> here<00:04:36.640> it

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
it's the fluorocarbon see right here it

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.500 
it's the fluorocarbon see right here it
says<00:04:36.760> eight<00:04:37.060> pound<00:04:37.330> test<00:04:39.330> fluorocarbon<00:04:40.330> and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
says eight pound test fluorocarbon and

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.230 
says eight pound test fluorocarbon and
it's<00:04:40.960> virtually<00:04:41.410> invisible<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.820> nice<00:04:42.970> thing

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
it's virtually invisible the nice thing

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.090 
it's virtually invisible the nice thing
about<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:44.050> particular<00:04:44.290> brand<00:04:44.980> of

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
about this particular brand of

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.590 
about this particular brand of
fluorocarbon<00:04:45.790> is<00:04:45.910> that<00:04:46.060> if<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.240> look<00:04:46.360> at<00:04:46.480> the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
fluorocarbon is that if you look at the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.630 
fluorocarbon is that if you look at the
back<00:04:46.780> look<00:04:46.810> at<00:04:47.290> they<00:04:47.800> give<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.130> all<00:04:48.370> the

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
back look at they give you all the

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.080 
back look at they give you all the
different<00:04:48.790> knots<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.900> Uni<00:04:50.260> not<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:51.730> Rapala

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
different knots the Uni not the Rapala

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.810 
different knots the Uni not the Rapala
not<00:04:52.390> all<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:53.110> them<00:04:53.260> how<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.440> tie<00:04:53.740> them<00:04:54.010> because

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
not all of them how to tie them because

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.220 
not all of them how to tie them because
some<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.240> these<00:04:55.420> are<00:04:55.570> very<00:04:55.630> important<00:04:56.140> for

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
some of these are very important for

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.600 
some of these are very important for
connecting<00:04:56.620> two<00:04:56.800> pieces<00:04:57.130> of<00:04:57.160> line<00:04:57.400> together

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
connecting two pieces of line together

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.040 
connecting two pieces of line together
and<00:04:57.970> look<00:04:58.090> they<00:04:58.180> even<00:04:58.240> show<00:04:58.540> you<00:04:58.600> here<00:04:58.870> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
and look they even show you here the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.220 
and look they even show you here the
actual<00:04:59.410> swivel<00:04:59.800> you<00:04:59.920> see<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.700> make<00:05:00.850> one<00:05:01.690> line

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
actual swivel you see to make one line

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.930 
actual swivel you see to make one line
not<00:05:02.260> there<00:05:02.920> and<00:05:03.160> then<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.400> other<00:05:03.430> one<00:05:03.700> on<00:05:03.820> the

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
not there and then the other one on the

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.970 
not there and then the other one on the
other<00:05:04.030> side<00:05:04.150> okay<00:05:04.810> now<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.410> line<00:05:05.740> that<00:05:05.890> I'm

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
other side okay now the line that I'm

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.460 
other side okay now the line that I'm
using<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.310> ice<00:05:06.460> line<00:05:06.790> is<00:05:07.030> right<00:05:07.240> here<00:05:07.630> okay<00:05:08.260> so

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
using the ice line is right here okay so

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.640 
using the ice line is right here okay so
it's<00:05:09.070> called<00:05:09.280> an<00:05:09.430> ice<00:05:09.670> braid<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.480> if<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:11.500> look

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
it's called an ice braid and if you look

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.200 
it's called an ice braid and if you look
down<00:05:11.800> here<00:05:11.860> where<00:05:12.160> my<00:05:12.280> thumb<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.790> see<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.030> says

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
down here where my thumb is see it says

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.820 
down here where my thumb is see it says
eight<00:05:13.390> pound<00:05:13.660> test<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.290> then<00:05:14.980> 1.5<00:05:15.940> mono

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
eight pound test and then 1.5 mono

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.370 
eight pound test and then 1.5 mono
diameter<00:05:17.830> okay<00:05:18.460> so<00:05:18.730> it's<00:05:19.030> extremely<00:05:19.270> thin<00:05:19.870> the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
diameter okay so it's extremely thin the

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.660 
diameter okay so it's extremely thin the
nice<00:05:20.560> thing<00:05:20.770> about<00:05:20.860> using<00:05:21.130> this<00:05:21.370> combination

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
nice thing about using this combination

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.030 
nice thing about using this combination
is<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.300> with<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.780> eight<00:05:22.930> pound<00:05:23.260> test<00:05:23.590> the

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
is that with the eight pound test the

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.670 
is that with the eight pound test the
titanium<00:05:24.640> braid<00:05:24.970> in<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.210> ice<00:05:25.390> braid<00:05:25.780> it's

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
titanium braid in the ice braid it's

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.710 
titanium braid in the ice braid it's
heavy<00:05:27.100> enough<00:05:27.430> that<00:05:27.700> you<00:05:28.030> can<00:05:28.210> fish<00:05:28.390> in<00:05:28.540> deep

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
heavy enough that you can fish in deep

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.510 
heavy enough that you can fish in deep
water<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.320> use<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.470> for<00:05:29.620> whitefish<00:05:30.160> and<00:05:30.190> lake

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
water and use it for whitefish and lake

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.060 
water and use it for whitefish and lake
trout<00:05:30.760> up<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.180> fifteen<00:05:31.600> sixteen<00:05:32.110> pounds

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
trout up to fifteen sixteen pounds

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.130 
trout up to fifteen sixteen pounds
with<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.580> eight<00:05:33.820> pound<00:05:34.150> test<00:05:34.450> fluorocarbon

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
with the eight pound test fluorocarbon

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.980 
with the eight pound test fluorocarbon
or<00:05:35.500> you<00:05:36.190> can<00:05:36.370> use<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.670> same<00:05:36.940> line<00:05:37.360> outfit<00:05:37.810> and

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
or you can use the same line outfit and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.320 
or you can use the same line outfit and
go<00:05:38.440> for<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.770> smaller<00:05:39.130> fish<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:39.970> I<00:05:40.000> don't<00:05:40.210> have

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
go for the smaller fish so I don't have

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.840 
go for the smaller fish so I don't have
to<00:05:40.450> really<00:05:40.600> change<00:05:40.960> rods<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:42.070> technology<00:05:42.730> is

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
to really change rods the technology is
