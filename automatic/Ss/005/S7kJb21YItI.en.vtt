00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
roll it up in this tight formation and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.679 
roll it up in this tight formation and
let<00:01:28.189> it<00:01:28.310> cure<00:01:28.549> for<00:01:28.759> three<00:01:28.939> weeks<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:29.450> this<00:01:29.600> is

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
let it cure for three weeks so this is
