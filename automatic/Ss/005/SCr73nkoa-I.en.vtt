down again in anticipation of sleep so

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
down again in anticipation of sleep so
the<00:00:52.440> sleep/wake<00:00:52.860> cycle<00:00:53.399> changes<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.239> blood

show<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> near<00:00:57.719> 24-hour<00:00:58.590> oscillation<00:00:58.820> but<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
show a near 24-hour oscillation but it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.930 
show a near 24-hour oscillation but it
wouldn't<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.390> exactly<00:01:01.170> 24<00:01:01.620> hours<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.730> what

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
wouldn't be exactly 24 hours and so what

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
wouldn't be exactly 24 hours and so what
needs<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.270> happen<00:01:03.390> every<00:01:03.960> day<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.619> this

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
needs to happen every day is that this

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.399 
needs to happen every day is that this
slightly<00:01:05.339> drifting<00:01:06.030> clock<00:01:06.360> needs<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> be

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
slightly drifting clock needs to be

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.100 
slightly drifting clock needs to be
adjusted<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.490> environmental<00:01:09.090> time<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.750> the

adjusted to environmental time and the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
adjusted to environmental time and the
most<00:01:10.320> important<00:01:11.010> signal<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> clock

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
most important signal that the clock

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.719 
most important signal that the clock
needs<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.260> exposure<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> light-dark

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
needs is exposure to the light-dark

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.499 
needs is exposure to the light-dark
cycle<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.439> light-dark<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.610> detected<00:01:18.420> in

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
cycle and that light-dark is detected in

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.499 
cycle and that light-dark is detected in
mammals<00:01:18.930> such<00:01:19.320> as<00:01:19.380> ourselves<00:01:19.700> by<00:01:20.700> like

mammals such as ourselves by like
detecting<00:01:22.049> cells<00:01:22.350> within<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> eye<00:01:23.689> it's

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
detecting cells within the eye it's

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
detecting cells within the eye it's
critically<00:01:25.140> important<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.250> body<00:01:26.700> clock

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
critically important that the body clock

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
critically important that the body clock
is<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.509> adjusted<00:01:28.200> every<00:01:28.500> day<00:01:28.650> by<00:01:28.860> the

is is adjusted every day by the
light-dark<00:01:29.159> cycle<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> didn't<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
light-dark cycle if you didn't get that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.140 
light-dark cycle if you didn't get that
daily<00:01:31.110> adjustment<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:32.040> internal<00:01:32.880> time

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
daily adjustment then internal time

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.530 
daily adjustment then internal time
would<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:34.579> abnormally<00:01:35.579> synchronized<00:01:36.150> with

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
would be abnormally synchronized with

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.940 
would be abnormally synchronized with
the<00:01:36.630> external<00:01:36.930> world<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.439> perhaps<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.770> best

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the external world and perhaps the best

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850 
the external world and perhaps the best
example<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.759> jet<00:01:39.060> lag<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:40.229> knew

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
example of that is jet lag so we knew

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.649 
example of that is jet lag so we knew
that<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.220> photoreceptors<00:01:41.970> were<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that these photoreceptors were in the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.469 
that these photoreceptors were in the
eye<00:01:42.799> because<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.299> prevented<00:01:45.299> light

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
eye because if you prevented light

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.289 
eye because if you prevented light
getting<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> eye<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.310> body<00:01:48.000> clock

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
getting to the eye then the body clock

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
getting to the eye then the body clock
no<00:01:49.229> longer<00:01:49.530> responded<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.100> light<00:01:50.280> so

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
no longer responded to light so

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
no longer responded to light so
something<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> eye<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.049> big<00:01:52.200> problem<00:01:52.619> was

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
something in the eye the big problem was

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.560 
something in the eye the big problem was
is<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.149> difficult<00:01:54.299> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
is that it was very difficult to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
is that it was very difficult to
understand<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> classical<00:01:55.799> visual

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
understand how the classical visual

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.830 
understand how the classical visual
cells<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> eye

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
cells of the eye

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.830 
cells of the eye
could<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.520> detecting<00:01:59.520> overall<00:02:00.149> brightness<00:02:00.689> of

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
could be detecting overall brightness of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.300 
could be detecting overall brightness of
in<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> environment<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:01.770> vision<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> work

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
in the environment for vision to work

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.950 
in the environment for vision to work
the<00:02:03.149> visual<00:02:03.810> cells<00:02:04.049> grab<00:02:04.979> light<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:06.149> send<00:02:06.810> us

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the visual cells grab light they send us

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.359 
the visual cells grab light they send us
that<00:02:06.990> information<00:02:07.350> off<00:02:07.829> into<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> brain<00:02:08.340> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that information off into the brain and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.190 
that information off into the brain and
then<00:02:08.640> essentially<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.209> stop<00:02:09.450> working<00:02:09.599> so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
then essentially they stop working so

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.979 
then essentially they stop working so
you<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> series<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> sharp<00:02:11.519> images<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
you have a series of sharp images and it

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.059 
you have a series of sharp images and it
was<00:02:13.080> very<00:02:13.200> difficult<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.590> understand<00:02:13.980> how

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
was very difficult to understand how

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.940 
was very difficult to understand how
that<00:02:14.819> image<00:02:15.150> detection<00:02:15.870> system<00:02:16.319> could<00:02:16.799> also

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
that image detection system could also

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.729 
that image detection system could also
get<00:02:17.879> an<00:02:18.510> appreciation<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.349> overall

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
get an appreciation of the overall

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.890 
get an appreciation of the overall
amount<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.190> brightness<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.910> hence<00:02:21.420> time<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
amount of brightness and hence time of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.520 
amount of brightness and hence time of
day<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:23.040> there<00:02:23.190> was<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> big<00:02:23.459> puzzle<00:02:23.959> we<00:02:24.959> started

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
day so there was a big puzzle we started

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.089 
day so there was a big puzzle we started
using<00:02:25.830> mice<00:02:26.549> in<00:02:27.060> which<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:28.319> rods<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.830> cones

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
using mice in which the rods and cones

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.160 
using mice in which the rods and cones
had<00:02:30.030> largely<00:02:30.690> degenerated<00:02:31.560> as<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.190> result<00:02:32.670> of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
had largely degenerated as a result of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.140 
had largely degenerated as a result of
inherited<00:02:34.170> retinal<00:02:34.530> diseases<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.700> these<00:02:35.880> mice

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
inherited retinal diseases so these mice

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
inherited retinal diseases so these mice
had<00:02:37.079> lost<00:02:37.260> most<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.560> their<00:02:37.680> rods<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.040> cones

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
had lost most of their rods and cones

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.370 
had lost most of their rods and cones
they<00:02:38.519> were<00:02:38.579> visually<00:02:39.000> blind<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.989> we<00:02:40.110> wanted

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
they were visually blind and we wanted

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.319 
they were visually blind and we wanted
to<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.680> whether<00:02:41.099> they<00:02:41.370> could<00:02:41.549> still<00:02:41.849> regulate

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
to see whether they could still regulate

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.970 
to see whether they could still regulate
their<00:02:42.629> body<00:02:42.750> clocks<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.379> what<00:02:43.829> was

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
their body clocks and what was

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.339 
their body clocks and what was
absolutely<00:02:44.670> extraordinary<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.870> these

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
absolutely extraordinary is that these

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.500 
absolutely extraordinary is that these
visually<00:02:46.829> blind<00:02:47.040> mice<00:02:47.280> were<00:02:48.060> able<00:02:48.420> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
visually blind mice were able to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.000 
visually blind mice were able to
regulate<00:02:48.750> their<00:02:49.049> body<00:02:49.290> clock<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
regulate their body clock to the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.800 
regulate their body clock to the
light-dark<00:02:50.190> cycle<00:02:50.819> perfectly<00:02:51.239> normally<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
light-dark cycle perfectly normally the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.420 
light-dark cycle perfectly normally the
last<00:02:52.019> would<00:02:52.200> get<00:02:52.410> up<00:02:52.560> running<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.340> running

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
last would get up running it's running

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.400 
last would get up running it's running
wheel<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.150> then<00:02:54.569> go<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.750> bed<00:02:54.840> at<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.200> same

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
wheel and then go to bed at the same

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.190 
wheel and then go to bed at the same
time<00:02:55.680> day<00:02:56.220> after<00:02:56.519> day<00:02:56.670> after<00:02:56.790> day<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.110> we

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
time day after day after day and so we

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.229 
time day after day after day and so we
thought<00:02:58.349> my<00:02:58.530> goodness<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.129> something<00:02:59.670> really

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
thought my goodness is something really

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.910 
thought my goodness is something really
interesting<00:03:00.450> going<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:01.019> here<00:03:01.290> there<00:03:01.560> had<00:03:01.889> to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
interesting going on here there had to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.970 
interesting going on here there had to
be<00:03:02.160> another<00:03:02.760> class<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.420> light-sensitive<00:03:04.350> cell

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
be another class of light-sensitive cell

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.309 
be another class of light-sensitive cell
within<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.880> eye<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> big<00:03:06.870> question<00:03:07.230> of

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
within the eye and the big question of

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.319 
within the eye and the big question of
course<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.829> well<00:03:08.340> if<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.549> not<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.850> rods<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
course is well if it's not the rods and

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.360 
course is well if it's not the rods and
cones<00:03:09.420> then<00:03:10.109> which<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> cells<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
cones then which of the cells of the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.780 
cones then which of the cells of the
inner<00:03:11.579> Aetna<00:03:12.000> could<00:03:12.389> it<00:03:12.510> possibly<00:03:12.660> be

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
inner Aetna could it possibly be

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.180 
inner Aetna could it possibly be
eventually<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:16.049> light-sensitive<00:03:16.470> molecule

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
eventually the light-sensitive molecule

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.280 
eventually the light-sensitive molecule
was<00:03:17.400> found<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.239> was<00:03:18.359> called<00:03:18.569> melanopsin

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
was found and it was called melanopsin

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.629 
was found and it was called melanopsin
or<00:03:19.920> OPN<00:03:20.549> for<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.780> gene<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.769> located<00:03:22.859> on

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
or OPN for and that gene is located on

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.080 
or OPN for and that gene is located on
chromosome<00:03:23.970> 10<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.980> think<00:03:25.980> knowledge<00:03:26.760> about

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
chromosome 10 I think knowledge about

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.360 
chromosome 10 I think knowledge about
this<00:03:27.269> new<00:03:27.419> system<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:28.410> very<00:03:28.799> important

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
this new system is really very important

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.849 
this new system is really very important
if<00:03:29.849> you<00:03:30.000> think<00:03:30.180> about<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.569> we<00:03:31.079> we<00:03:31.500> know<00:03:31.680> that

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
if you think about it we we know that

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.500 
if you think about it we we know that
there's<00:03:32.069> about<00:03:32.370> 40<00:03:32.940> million<00:03:33.120> people

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
there's about 40 million people

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.890 
there's about 40 million people
worldwide<00:03:33.840> who<00:03:34.349> have<00:03:34.590> no<00:03:34.859> sense<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.549> visual

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
a sensitivity at all now understanding

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.660 
a sensitivity at all now understanding
that<00:03:40.049> there's<00:03:40.230> another<00:03:40.620> light<00:03:40.920> sensor<00:03:41.430> within

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
that there's another light sensor within

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.289 
that there's another light sensor within
the<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.140> could<00:03:43.140> hugely<00:03:44.000> improve<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> quality

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
the I could hugely improve the quality

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.600 
the I could hugely improve the quality
of<00:03:45.510> life<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.860> sense<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.159> well-being<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
of life and the sense of well-being of

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.780 
of life and the sense of well-being of
those<00:03:47.730> individuals<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.629> at<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> moment<00:03:49.790> very

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
those individuals and at the moment very

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.780 
those individuals and at the moment very
little<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.360> is<00:03:51.599> discussed<00:03:52.049> about<00:03:52.319> those<00:03:52.500> cells

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
little is is discussed about those cells

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.849 
little is is discussed about those cells
so<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.060> fact<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.510> melanopsin<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.530> turning

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
so the fact that melanopsin is turning

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.069 
so the fact that melanopsin is turning
up<00:03:55.950> in<00:03:56.040> chromosome<00:03:56.519> 10<00:03:56.790> makes<00:03:57.329> chromosome<00:03:57.810> 10
