00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.240
 video i am the felix of youtube 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.610
 Kanal Felix wants to build in this video 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.460
 I follow you the iphone bag miami 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.460
 to introduce a little more detail how fun 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.150
 no matter in which color or for which 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.070
 iphone your the marianne bag 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.140
 she buys very minimalist in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.119
 wrapped in a black paper too 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
 you in the bag is still there 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.119
 a foam part that one 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.189
 of course, take out too 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.290
 space for the iphone to create a different 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.300
 as with most funds, that remains 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.520
 miami model is not constantly on the device 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.899
 installed but works so that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.910
 Always use the iphone before using it 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.190
 retrieve and after using again 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.809
 so it's natural too 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 only logical that the actual 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.760
 insert super easy you put 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.250
 iphone folds into the top of the bag 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 The magnet closed up and that 's it 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.719
 You will also be very positive about it 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 the bag is particularly well fitting 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 Device is sitting on one side 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.449
 the iphone so not easy 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.309
 unintentionally while it is on the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.560
 other side but not difficult 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.150
 to deliberately get it out again 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.400
 but also has a lot to do with that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.409
 ingenious design of the strap system too 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.299
 Just pull on the ribbon and do it 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.580
 already the smartphone almost rises 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.409
 very magical out of the bag 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
 chic is also the integrated elastic band 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.220
 which ensures that the tab after the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.540
 remove the iphones back into the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.890
 bag slipped back and not 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.650
 somehow free in the area around 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.110
 generally flies just like 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.060
 this bag was designed that way 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.799
 design is quite simple and simple 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.200
 kept minimalist and fits therefore 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.000
 so great to the iphones are to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.579
 example, the entire front and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 everybody knew completely empty on the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.299
 backside can be found on a cover 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.040
 logo but also something very nice 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.750
 namely 2 1 drawers for 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.399
 credit card identity card 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.140
 license or just a few 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.689
 Banknotes can always be handy 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.430
 can hate the change for people and 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.290
 Anyway, everything seems to shine or card 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.030
 even paying that can mean that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.890
 you just complete your purse 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.360
 home leave a thing at the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.549
 but do not completely cave in this way 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.409
 Of course, if you want 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.569
 you can also taste the volume 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.400
 still press if the iphone is still 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.730
 located in the envelope and because of the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.440
 headphone access 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.049
 can be accessible if you have the iphone 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.060
 the bag is in the other direction 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.629
 not really enjoying music 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.459
 ways 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.830
 the most beautiful effect of the minimalist 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.750
 designs is but that it contributes 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.209
 that a completely different aspect of the bag 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.430
 can shine absolutely and that is that 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.349
 material because exactly like all 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.330
 home bags will also be there 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.340
 the miami model in genuine leather 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.690
 Handwork sewn together by 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.239
 do not just get the bags 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.459
 quite noble flair but also one 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.620
 quite a pleasant smell and because 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.629
 genuine leather, of course not on production line 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.879
 artificially manufactured material but 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.920
 just a natural product is any looks 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.510
 pocket a little bit different 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.250
 This will get you absolutely 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.079
 individual product with own 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.549
 character of the time if that 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.400
 leather also some traces of use 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.290
 gets really strong also stands out 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.819
 in the production quality of the bag 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.859
 There's not really anything to moan about 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.840
 All seams are very clean 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.819
 Transitions are well sealed and nothing 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.040
 dissolves or falls apart though 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.480
 Basically, you buy an iphone 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.849
 wrap around his smartphone 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.739
 protect damage and that's exactly what 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.230
 is the point of the miami model 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.760
 in my opinion the strongest shines 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.430
 the envelope is not only thicker 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.470
 sturdier but also softer than eg that 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.959
 all model of cover but you 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.819
 also includes the iphone from all sides 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.470
 in the end that means yours 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.419
 gets really good in the bag 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.950
 shelter or fall is protected 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.690
 and you do not have to be afraid that 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.519
 you run against a table edge and 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.739
 then your display is broken or something 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.389
 to take is the flannel material that 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.579
 the inside of the bag embellishing 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.410
 a little bit further than 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.060
 by the ashes you can by that you can 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.160
 be sure that your iphone 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.169
 when constantly inserting and again 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.030
 pull out no scratches gets 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.859
 Finally, of course, it still turns 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.200
 the question for whom are now the 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.150
 Maria with ash the right one 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.160
 first strength at the maria with ash 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.769
 the same as in almost all carr 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.599
 bags also that the noble material and 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.459
 just that the donkey design so if 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.799
 you like that, you are definitely 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.370
 ever with the cover me pretty much 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.709
 right 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.380
 Second, it is still the case 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.430
 really for all iphones with 4 inches 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.970
 display available 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.190
 so is iphone 5 iphone 5 and iphone 5 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.990
 first completely covered so invents 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.949
 Definitely the right model for 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.770
 your iphone 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.210
 if you have the latest iphone and 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.820
 third, and that is my opinion 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.070
 the greatest strength of the thing protects 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.080
 the miami bag is amazing so if 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.280
 your iphone falls down in the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.570
 miami bag then that is 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.460
 Probably something 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.130
 definitely happens a lot 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.720
 less if you have this bag on it 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.220
 have and that is definitely pure 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.990
 or if you are with your legs 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.669
 against it runs or so and let it 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.960
 just fine that because of the protection so 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.270
 right in there if you have one 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.340
 really good protection is looking for yours 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.380
 iphone but also pretty noble 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.270
 then you're up at the miami bag 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.550
 every case right if the way the 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.050
 The maker of these regions can yes 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.870
 again on my youtube channel 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.789
