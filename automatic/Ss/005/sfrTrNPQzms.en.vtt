00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hiya folks is next from a transformer

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.289 
hiya folks is next from a transformer
prime<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:03.990> route<00:00:04.259> calm<00:00:04.830> um<00:00:05.549> so<00:00:05.910> today<00:00:06.000> we're

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
prime in route calm um so today we're

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.209 
prime in route calm um so today we're
going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.480> route<00:00:07.170> our<00:00:07.849> transformer<00:00:08.849> prime

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
going to route our transformer prime

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.980 
going to route our transformer prime
this<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.610> new<00:00:11.820> way<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.030> doing<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.780> guess

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
this is the new way of doing it I guess

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.160 
this is the new way of doing it I guess
for<00:00:13.710> those<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.580> 4<00:00:14.910> point<00:00:15.240> if<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
for those of you on the 4 point if it

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.870 
for those of you on the 4 point if it
says<00:00:16.379> four<00:00:16.650> point<00:00:16.949> nine<00:00:17.160> point<00:00:17.430> four<00:00:17.699> point

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
says four point nine point four point

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.920 
says four point nine point four point
two<00:00:18.090> point<00:00:18.330> eleven<00:00:18.779> or<00:00:19.380> later<00:00:20.180> or<00:00:21.180> billa<00:00:21.630> up

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
two point eleven or later or billa up

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.570 
two point eleven or later or billa up
the<00:00:22.230> four<00:00:22.500> should<00:00:22.769> work<00:00:22.980> too<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.340> should<00:00:23.490> work

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the four should work too it should work

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.359 
the four should work too it should work
on<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:24.029> ICS<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.890> an<00:00:26.010> updated

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
on all ICS but this is an updated

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.720 
on all ICS but this is an updated
version<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.449> work<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.289> know<00:00:28.730> your

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
version of so work you know your

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
version of so work you know your
transformer<00:00:30.630> prime<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.740> don't<00:00:31.980> have

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
transformer prime so if you don't have

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.700 
transformer prime so if you don't have
it<00:00:32.340> updated<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.500> try<00:00:34.500> updating<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
it updated to that try updating it go to

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.440 
it updated to that try updating it go to
about<00:00:37.710> tablet<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.879> system<00:00:39.239> firmware

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
about tablet and do system firmware

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.200 
about tablet and do system firmware
upgrade<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.140> you're<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.890> later<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:42.059> can

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
upgrade so you're there or later you can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
upgrade so you're there or later you can
try<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> build<00:00:43.079> before<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:44.040> this

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
try on the build before to on this

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
try on the build before to on this
should<00:00:44.430> work<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> doesn't<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.960> try<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
should work if it doesn't you can try to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.680 
should work if it doesn't you can try to
update<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.120> next<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.510> you're<00:00:48.570> gonna

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
update there and next what you're gonna

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.430 
update there and next what you're gonna
do<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.260> uh<00:00:49.489> developer<00:00:50.489> options<00:00:50.969> make<00:00:51.780> sure<00:00:51.809> USB

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
do is uh developer options make sure USB

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
do is uh developer options make sure USB
debugging<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.190> checked<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.180> like

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
debugging is checked on like that like

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.830 
debugging is checked on like that like
that<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.550> you're<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:56.940> connect<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that and then you're gonna connect it to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.740 
that and then you're gonna connect it to
your<00:00:58.050> Windows<00:00:58.559> Mac<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.340> Linux

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750

I've<00:01:01.020> only<00:01:01.230> I've<00:01:02.190> only<00:01:02.789> tested<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.780> Windows

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I've only I've only tested on my Windows

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.050 
I've only I've only tested on my Windows
and<00:01:04.559> my<00:01:04.830> Linux<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.369> far<00:01:06.950> but<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.670> should<00:01:08.909> work

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and my Linux so far but they should work

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.149 
and my Linux so far but they should work
on<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.450> too

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
on that too

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.140 
on that too
I<00:01:11.930> don't<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> Mac<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.979> copied<00:01:14.490> an<00:01:14.790> older

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
I don't have a Mac so I copied an older

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
I don't have a Mac so I copied an older
version<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.659> ADB<00:01:16.229> Mac<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.250> might<00:01:17.400> need<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
version of ADB Mac you might need a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
version of ADB Mac you might need a
newer<00:01:18.360> version<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.960> Mac's<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:19.979> download

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
newer version for Mac's just go download

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.840 
newer version for Mac's just go download
off<00:01:20.580> Android<00:01:21.150> SDK<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.610> copy

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
off Android SDK and then you can copy

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
off Android SDK and then you can copy
over<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> adb<00:01:24.750> file<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.070> DV<00:01:26.369> -<00:01:26.549> Linux<00:01:27.200> or<00:01:28.200> adb

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
- Mac file for that and then we're gonna

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.539 
- Mac file for that and then we're gonna
go<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> our<00:01:32.909> computer<00:01:33.210> real<00:01:33.509> quick<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:35.280> next

is<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:19.000> forget<00:03:20.000> again<00:03:20.209> here<00:03:20.510> ago<00:03:22.720> which<00:03:23.720> is

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
is the forget again here ago which is

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.219 
is the forget again here ago which is
these<00:03:24.109> nine<00:03:24.620> point<00:03:24.979> four<00:03:25.280> point<00:03:25.489> 2.11<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.810> this

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:27.229 
these nine point four point 2.11 so this

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:28.599 
these nine point four point 2.11 so this
works<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.650> all<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:27.979> newer<00:03:28.189> ones
