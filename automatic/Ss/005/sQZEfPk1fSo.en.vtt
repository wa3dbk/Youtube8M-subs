so<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> had<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> compensate<00:01:30.270> by<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so I kind of had to compensate by that I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.510 
so I kind of had to compensate by that I
can't<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.619> rush<00:01:31.860> around<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.369> crazy

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
can't just rush around like crazy

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.249 
can't just rush around like crazy
because<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.060> has<00:01:33.180> minus<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.659> fire<00:01:33.900> right<00:01:34.049> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
because it has minus one fire right now

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.590 
because it has minus one fire right now
if<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.590> run<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.040> more<00:01:35.310> than<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.460> person

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
if we run up on more than one person

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.640 
if we run up on more than one person
someone<00:01:36.600> likely<00:01:36.840> gonna<00:01:37.079> take<00:01:37.290> me<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.470> because

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
someone likely gonna take me out because

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.560 
someone likely gonna take me out because
it<00:01:37.829> has<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> store<00:01:38.369> fiery<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> had<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it has a store fiery so I kind of had to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.420 
it has a store fiery so I kind of had to
play<00:01:39.750> slow<00:01:40.020> pick<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> choose<00:01:40.860> my<00:01:40.979> gun<00:01:41.159> fights

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
play slow pick and choose my gun fights

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.490 
play slow pick and choose my gun fights
and<00:01:41.670> hopefully<00:01:42.570> don't<00:01:42.840> run<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.170> more<00:01:43.350> than

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and hopefully don't run into more than

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.590 
and hopefully don't run into more than
one<00:01:43.530> person<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.460> can't<00:01:45.240> Chuck<00:01:45.479> my

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
one person but if I do I can't Chuck my

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.030 
one person but if I do I can't Chuck my
shots<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> make<00:01:46.290> sure<00:01:46.350> my<00:01:46.500> shots<00:01:46.829> are

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
shots I have to make sure my shots are

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.310 
shots I have to make sure my shots are
on<00:01:47.610> point<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:48.899> only<00:01:48.990> running<00:01:49.170> one

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
on point and I was only running one

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.740 
on point and I was only running one
attachment<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.790> extended<00:01:51.329> mag<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
attachment and that was extended mag and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.130 
attachment and that was extended mag and
this<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> after<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.770> vow<00:01:52.979> got<00:01:53.250> patched<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.909> i

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
this is after the vow got patched so i

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.740 
this is after the vow got patched so i
added<00:01:55.140> Rico<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> lower<00:01:56.640> 48<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.299> feel

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
added Rico but with the lower 48 I feel

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
added Rico but with the lower 48 I feel
like<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.350> doesn't<00:01:58.590> matter<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.219> me<00:01:59.250> so

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
like that really doesn't matter to me so

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.249 
like that really doesn't matter to me so
i<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.909> using<00:02:00.090> extended<00:02:00.630> mag<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:00.990> i<00:02:01.079> felt

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
i was using extended mag because i felt

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.719 
i was using extended mag because i felt
like<00:02:01.290> i<00:02:01.469> needed<00:02:01.500> points<00:02:01.920> elsewhere<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
like i needed points elsewhere in the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.459 
like i needed points elsewhere in the
perks<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.390> perks<00:02:03.600> might<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.140> guess

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
perks the perks might have you I guess

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.330 
perks the perks might have you I guess
scratching<00:02:04.890> your<00:02:04.950> head<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.189> bit

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
scratching your head a little bit

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.649 
scratching your head a little bit
because<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.670> don't<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.479> too

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
because you don't really see this too

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.300 
because you don't really see this too
much<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.079> running<00:02:07.409> low<00:02:07.649> profile<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
much I was running low profile and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.460 
much I was running low profile and
danger<00:02:09.209> close<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.869> might<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.050> thinking<00:02:10.170> why

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
danger close you might be thinking why

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.780 
danger close you might be thinking why
are<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.679> running<00:02:10.800> danger<00:02:11.190> close<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.580> gives

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
are you running danger close that gives

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
are you running danger close that gives
you<00:02:11.940> extra<00:02:12.540> dose<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.080> damage<00:02:13.379> actually

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you extra dose of damage actually

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.900 
you extra dose of damage actually
that's<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.100> it's<00:02:14.220> called<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.700> running

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
that's what it's called I was running

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.000 
that's what it's called I was running
low<00:02:15.000> profile<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:15.840> case<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.260> enemies<00:02:16.740> got

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
low profile just in case the enemies got

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.430 
low profile just in case the enemies got
a<00:02:17.310> UAV<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.850> didn't<00:02:18.270> expect<00:02:18.630> them<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.990> but<00:02:19.230> some

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
a UAV I didn't expect them to but some

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.110 
a UAV I didn't expect them to but some
of<00:02:19.530> them<00:02:19.620> actually<00:02:19.830> ended<00:02:20.310> up<00:02:20.400> getting<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.850> UAV

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
of them actually ended up getting a UAV

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
of them actually ended up getting a UAV
actually<00:02:21.960> think<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.380> enemies<00:02:22.680> got<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
actually think one of the enemies got a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.980 
actually think one of the enemies got a
paladin<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.610> that's<00:02:24.240> kind<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.420> crazy<00:02:24.630> how<00:02:24.960> I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
paladin so that's kind of crazy how I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.240 
paladin so that's kind of crazy how I
got<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.260> many<00:02:25.470> kills<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.830> actually<00:02:26.070> ended

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
got this many kills and actually ended

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.460 
got this many kills and actually ended
up<00:02:26.310> getting<00:02:26.580> those<00:02:26.760> scorestreaks<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
up getting those scorestreaks but the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.320 
up getting those scorestreaks but the
main<00:02:28.830> reason<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.370> actually<00:02:29.520> using<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> UAV

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
main reason I was actually using the UAV

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.270 
main reason I was actually using the UAV
was<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.410> case<00:02:31.440> anybody<00:02:31.950> was<00:02:32.040> using

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
was so that in case anybody was using

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.650 
was so that in case anybody was using
threat<00:02:32.550> detection<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.090> wouldn't<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.420> seen

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
threat detection I wouldn't be seen

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.210 
threat detection I wouldn't be seen
through<00:02:33.870> walls<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.350> don't<00:02:34.680> really<00:02:34.770> care<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.070> I'm

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
through walls I don't really care if I'm

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.860 
through walls I don't really care if I'm
on<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> mini-map<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:36.180> if<00:02:36.240> somebody<00:02:36.420> sees<00:02:36.720> me

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
on the mini-map but if somebody sees me

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.090 
on the mini-map but if somebody sees me
through<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> wall<00:02:37.350> they're<00:02:37.620> definitely<00:02:37.830> gonna

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
through a wall they're definitely gonna

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.010 
through a wall they're definitely gonna
kill<00:02:38.400> me<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.700> danger<00:02:39.300> close<00:02:39.510> i<00:02:39.690> think<00:02:39.900> is

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
kill me and danger close i think is

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.750 
kill me and danger close i think is
really<00:02:40.230> what<00:02:40.500> kind<00:02:40.710> of<00:02:40.860> makes<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.250> class<00:02:41.550> in

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
really what kind of makes this class in

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.580 
really what kind of makes this class in

was using the streaker classic within
this<00:02:54.090> gameplay<00:02:54.330> pretty<00:02:54.690> much<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.350> exact<00:02:55.650> same

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
this gameplay pretty much the exact same

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.910 
this gameplay pretty much the exact same
one<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.490> i<00:02:56.550> was<00:02:56.670> using<00:02:56.820> Danger<00:02:57.390> Close<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.620> in

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
one and i was using Danger Close so in

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.470 
one and i was using Danger Close so in
case<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.310> know<00:02:59.550> my<00:02:59.700> bombing<00:03:00.030> around<00:03:00.150> maybe

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
case you know my bombing around maybe

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480 
case you know my bombing around maybe
got<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.750> hitmarker<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.440> somebody<00:03:01.800> danger

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
got a hitmarker on somebody danger

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.100 
got a hitmarker on somebody danger
closest<00:03:02.820> pretty<00:03:03.000> much<00:03:03.090> going<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.360> ensure<00:03:03.810> that

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
closest pretty much going to ensure that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.810 
closest pretty much going to ensure that
I<00:03:04.320> got<00:03:04.500> no-hit<00:03:04.740> Marcus<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.400> bombing<00:03:05.580> run

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
I got no-hit Marcus with the bombing run

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.670 
I got no-hit Marcus with the bombing run
and<00:03:06.000> would<00:03:06.540> ensure<00:03:06.959> me<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.200> get<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.440> max

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and would ensure me to get the max

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.199 
and would ensure me to get the max
amount<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:08.010> kills<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.340> could<00:03:08.580> with<00:03:08.760> my<00:03:08.790> squirt

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
amount of kills I could with my squirt

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.360 
amount of kills I could with my squirt
streaks<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.690> wasn't<00:03:10.110> running<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.530> pert<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.070> I

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
streaks I wasn't running a pert to I

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.100 
streaks I wasn't running a pert to I
always<00:03:11.730> run<00:03:11.850> bond<00:03:12.090> on<00:03:12.240> my<00:03:12.390> classes<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:12.959> this

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
always run bond on my classes but this

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.810 
always run bond on my classes but this
time<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.500> decided<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.310> needed<00:03:14.340> points

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
time I decided that I needed points

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.880 
time I decided that I needed points
elsewhere<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.750> didn't<00:03:16.140> run<00:03:16.260> blondey<00:03:16.680> and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
elsewhere so I didn't run blondey and

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.550 
elsewhere so I didn't run blondey and
then<00:03:17.340> purge<00:03:17.700> 3<00:03:18.000> i<00:03:18.209> was<00:03:18.540> using<00:03:18.720> toughness<00:03:19.410> and

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
then purge 3 i was using toughness and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.560 
then purge 3 i was using toughness and
scavenger<00:03:20.310> even<00:03:20.580> with<00:03:20.700> any<00:03:21.000> type<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.300> gameplay

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
scavenger even with any type of gameplay

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.210 
scavenger even with any type of gameplay
you<00:03:21.780> pretty<00:03:22.050> much<00:03:22.080> have<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.440> run<00:03:22.769> toughness

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
you pretty much have to run toughness

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.250 
you pretty much have to run toughness
and<00:03:23.370> scavenger<00:03:23.820> definitely<00:03:24.330> scavenger<00:03:24.870> you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
and scavenger definitely scavenger you

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.500 
and scavenger definitely scavenger you
can<00:03:25.530> get<00:03:25.739> away<00:03:25.830> without<00:03:26.489> toughness<00:03:27.030> sometimes

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
can get away without toughness sometimes

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.410 
can get away without toughness sometimes
but<00:03:28.080> i<00:03:28.260> think<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:28.920> i<00:03:29.280> needed<00:03:29.610> toughness<00:03:30.060> at

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
but i think that i needed toughness at

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.910 
but i think that i needed toughness at
least<00:03:30.600> i<00:03:30.660> thought<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.080> i<00:03:31.140> did<00:03:31.350> i'm<00:03:31.530> pretty

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
least i thought that i did i'm pretty

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.199 
least i thought that i did i'm pretty
sure<00:03:32.070> i<00:03:32.100> did<00:03:32.280> because<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:32.670> was<00:03:32.790> sometimes<00:03:33.120> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
sure i did because there was sometimes I

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.300 
sure i did because there was sometimes I
got<00:03:33.360> into<00:03:33.510> sticky<00:03:33.750> situation<00:03:34.380> now<00:03:34.800> ran<00:03:35.040> into

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
got into sticky situation now ran into

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.580 
got into sticky situation now ran into
more<00:03:35.519> than<00:03:35.640> one<00:03:35.670> guy<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.300> my<00:03:36.750> gun<00:03:37.019> flinched<00:03:37.440> up

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
more than one guy and my gun flinched up

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.840 
more than one guy and my gun flinched up
but<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.769> was<00:03:37.890> able<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.130> take<00:03:38.250> them<00:03:38.400> out<00:03:38.580> and

do make this class you guys don't know

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.090 
do make this class you guys don't know
how<00:04:18.330> many<00:04:18.660> kill<00:04:19.260> streaks<00:04:19.470> like<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.680> just

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
how many kill streaks like I just

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.770 
how many kill streaks like I just
because<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:21.000> know<00:04:21.090> i<00:04:21.120> was<00:04:21.390> getting<00:04:21.630> five

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
because you know i was getting five

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.510 
because you know i was getting five
extra<00:04:22.169> points<00:04:22.200> per<00:04:22.560> kill<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:23.010> my<00:04:23.160> enemies

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
extra points per kill that my enemies

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.279 
extra points per kill that my enemies
were<00:04:23.669> getting<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.390> warbird<00:04:24.750> i<00:04:24.900> was<00:04:25.080> using

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
were getting the warbird i was using

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.290 
were getting the warbird i was using
extra<00:04:25.890> time<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.400> defender<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:26.940> don't

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
extra time and defender you don't

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.689 
extra time and defender you don't
we<00:04:27.330> use<00:04:27.539> the<00:04:27.690> warbird<00:04:28.139> manually<00:04:28.860> because<00:04:29.400> it's

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
we use the warbird manually because it's

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.700 
we use the warbird manually because it's
gonna<00:04:29.849> overheat<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.750> won't<00:04:30.960> get<00:04:31.169> as<00:04:31.409> many

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
gonna overheat and you won't get as many

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.860 
gonna overheat and you won't get as many
kills<00:04:32.009> as<00:04:32.129> you<00:04:32.310> would<00:04:32.789> potentially<00:04:33.120> if<00:04:33.720> you

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
kills as you would potentially if you

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.809 
kills as you would potentially if you
were<00:04:33.990> using<00:04:34.139> aggressor<00:04:34.860> or<00:04:34.889> defender<00:04:35.610> so<00:04:35.729> you

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
were using aggressor or defender so you

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.040 
were using aggressor or defender so you
definitely<00:04:35.970> want<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.300> run<00:04:36.449> either<00:04:36.690> one<00:04:37.020> of

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
definitely want to run either one of

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.869 
definitely want to run either one of
those<00:04:37.229> I<00:04:37.470> like<00:04:37.919> defender<00:04:38.310> because<00:04:38.550> I'm<00:04:38.699> always

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
those I like defender because I'm always

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.850 
those I like defender because I'm always
near<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.659> enemy<00:04:39.930> spawn<00:04:40.229> I<00:04:40.440> wouldn't<00:04:40.740> say<00:04:40.830> that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
near the enemy spawn I wouldn't say that

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.129 
near the enemy spawn I wouldn't say that
I'm<00:04:41.009> always<00:04:41.250> like<00:04:41.909> directly<00:04:42.419> on<00:04:42.659> it<00:04:42.870> but<00:04:43.020> I'm

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
I'm always like directly on it but I'm

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.450 
I'm always like directly on it but I'm
near<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:43.830> going<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:43.979> be<00:04:44.069> able<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.340> get

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
near it so it's going to be able to get

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.100 
near it so it's going to be able to get
more<00:04:44.580> than<00:04:44.729> one<00:04:44.879> person<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.389> actually<00:04:45.870> think

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
more than one person I actually think

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.080 
more than one person I actually think
that<00:04:46.199> these<00:04:46.379> warbirds<00:04:46.830> got<00:04:47.069> me<00:04:47.220> 10<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.729> 11

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
that these warbirds got me 10 to 11

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.149 
that these warbirds got me 10 to 11
kills<00:04:48.300> each<00:04:48.539> time<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.289> it<00:04:49.620> is<00:04:49.710> actually<00:04:49.889> two

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
kills each time and it is actually two

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.770 
kills each time and it is actually two
warbirds<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.729> didn't<00:04:51.030> even<00:04:51.180> get<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.300> call<00:04:51.539> in

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
warbirds that didn't even get to call in

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.350 
warbirds that didn't even get to call in
because<00:04:51.930> one<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.530> them<00:04:52.770> got<00:04:53.490> overlaps<00:04:54.000> because

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
because one of them got overlaps because

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.089 
because one of them got overlaps because
my<00:04:54.509> teammate<00:04:54.900> called<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.169> warbird<00:04:55.470> in<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:55.830> the

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
my teammate called a warbird in and the

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.740 
my teammate called a warbird in and the
other<00:04:56.310> one<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.699> wasn't<00:04:56.909> paying<00:04:57.150> attention<00:04:57.300> and

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
other one I wasn't paying attention and

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.540 
other one I wasn't paying attention and
I<00:04:57.840> overlapped<00:04:58.289> it<00:04:58.470> myself<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.069> there's

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
I overlapped it myself so there's

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.279 
I overlapped it myself so there's
potentially<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.330> know<00:05:00.360> 22<00:05:00.870> kills<00:05:01.110> that

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
potentially you know 22 kills that

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.930 
potentially you know 22 kills that
didn't<00:05:01.680> get<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.039> it<00:05:02.370> could<00:05:02.699> have<00:05:02.789> possibly

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
didn't get so it could have possibly

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.290 
didn't get so it could have possibly
been<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.509> know<00:05:03.629> a<00:05:03.659> 200<00:05:04.229> 200<00:05:04.590> plus<00:05:04.770> fail<00:05:05.430> I'm

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
been you know a 200 200 plus fail I'm

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.909 
been you know a 200 200 plus fail I'm
gonna<00:05:06.599> say<00:05:06.719> that<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:06.960> was<00:05:07.139> but<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.469> possibly

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
gonna say that it was but it possibly

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.589 
gonna say that it was but it possibly
could<00:05:08.129> have<00:05:08.190> been<00:05:08.370> another<00:05:08.879> bombing<00:05:09.210> run<00:05:09.360> I

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
could have been another bombing run I

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.510 
could have been another bombing run I
was<00:05:09.810> only<00:05:09.990> using<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:10.500> Plain<00:05:10.949> Jane<00:05:11.219> there<00:05:11.400> was

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
was only using the Plain Jane there was

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.850 
was only using the Plain Jane there was
nothing<00:05:11.819> on<00:05:11.969> it<00:05:12.000> 725<00:05:12.930> points<00:05:13.289> I<00:05:13.379> felt<00:05:13.800> like

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
nothing on it 725 points I felt like

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.770 
nothing on it 725 points I felt like
that<00:05:14.069> was<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.280> good<00:05:14.819> enough<00:05:15.120> version<00:05:15.629> of<00:05:15.690> the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
that was a good enough version of the

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.480 
that was a good enough version of the
bombing<00:05:15.960> run<00:05:16.229> to<00:05:16.650> be<00:05:16.740> able<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:16.949> get<00:05:17.069> me<00:05:17.190> what<00:05:17.460> I

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
bombing run to be able to get me what I

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.520 
bombing run to be able to get me what I
wanted<00:05:17.969> and<00:05:18.120> on<00:05:18.449> the<00:05:18.539> aerial<00:05:18.900> assault<00:05:19.169> drum<00:05:19.379> i

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
wanted and on the aerial assault drum i

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.369 
wanted and on the aerial assault drum i
was<00:05:19.770> using<00:05:19.979> AI<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:21.030> rockets<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:21.810> if<00:05:22.050> i<00:05:22.139> had<00:05:22.259> to

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
was using AI and rockets and if i had to

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:23.869 
was using AI and rockets and if i had to
go<00:05:22.469> back<00:05:22.650> I<00:05:22.830> probably<00:05:23.039> would<00:05:23.280> take<00:05:23.490> this<00:05:23.610> off

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 
go back I probably would take this off

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.969 
go back I probably would take this off
and<00:05:24.090> throw<00:05:24.240> blonde<00:05:24.539> on<00:05:24.900> because<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.800> enemy

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
and throw blonde on because the enemy

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.709 
and throw blonde on because the enemy
did<00:05:26.280> get<00:05:26.430> a<00:05:26.460> paladin<00:05:26.940> which<00:05:27.180> killed<00:05:27.569> me<00:05:27.690> a

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
did get a paladin which killed me a

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.480 
did get a paladin which killed me a
couple<00:05:27.990> times<00:05:28.199> and<00:05:28.530> if<00:05:28.949> I<00:05:29.039> feel<00:05:29.159> like<00:05:29.250> I<00:05:29.370> had

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
couple times and if I feel like I had

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.040 
couple times and if I feel like I had
blind<00:05:29.759> eye<00:05:29.940> on<00:05:29.969> it<00:05:30.419> definitely<00:05:30.780> wouldn't<00:05:30.900> be

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
blind eye on it definitely wouldn't be

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.719 
blind eye on it definitely wouldn't be
able<00:05:31.139> to<00:05:31.319> take<00:05:31.440> me<00:05:31.560> out<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:31.919> that<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:32.639> know

have thrown another attachment it just
really<00:05:36.330> all<00:05:36.509> depends<00:05:36.870> on<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.169> map<00:05:37.500> but<00:05:37.740> I

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
really all depends on the map but I

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:38.779 
really all depends on the map but I
think<00:05:38.099> if<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.250> could<00:05:38.370> go<00:05:38.490> back<00:05:38.520> I<00:05:38.669> would

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
think if I could go back I would

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.309 
think if I could go back I would
definitely<00:05:38.969> take<00:05:39.210> aerial<00:05:39.479> assault<00:05:39.870> drone<00:05:40.080> off

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
definitely take aerial assault drone off

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:41.659 
definitely take aerial assault drone off
but<00:05:40.740> now<00:05:40.860> i'm<00:05:40.949> going<00:05:41.099> to<00:05:41.159> give<00:05:41.279> you<00:05:41.310> guys<00:05:41.490> a

but now i'm going to give you guys a

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.219 
but now i'm going to give you guys a
couple<00:05:41.789> tips<00:05:42.090> to<00:05:42.300> ensure<00:05:42.389> you<00:05:42.750> step<00:05:42.960> ii<00:05:43.050> gamma

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
couple tips to ensure you step ii gamma

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.019 
couple tips to ensure you step ii gamma
to<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.590> next<00:05:43.889> level<00:05:44.219> and<00:05:44.340> hopefully<00:05:44.789> drop

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
to the next level and hopefully drop

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.820 
to the next level and hopefully drop
just<00:05:45.300> as<00:05:45.389> many<00:05:45.539> kills<00:05:45.810> as<00:05:46.110> i<00:05:46.139> did<00:05:46.469> with<00:05:46.590> in<00:05:46.710> this

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
just as many kills as i did with in this

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.950 
just as many kills as i did with in this
gameplay<00:05:47.009> or<00:05:47.190> possibly<00:05:47.669> some<00:05:48.000> more<00:05:48.240> as<00:05:48.419> you

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
gameplay or possibly some more as you

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.200 
gameplay or possibly some more as you
got<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.229> have<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.590> good<00:05:49.889> start<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.580> can't<00:05:50.819> run

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
got to have a good start you can't run

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.790 
got to have a good start you can't run
out<00:05:51.389> there<00:05:51.569> and<00:05:51.630> dial<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.229> know<00:05:52.289> five<00:05:52.500> or<00:05:52.529> six

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
out there and dial you know five or six

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.529 
out there and dial you know five or six
times<00:05:52.860> because<00:05:53.430> you're<00:05:53.940> you're<00:05:54.210> not<00:05:54.240> going<00:05:54.479> to

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
times because you're you're not going to

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.360 
times because you're you're not going to
have<00:05:54.630> any<00:05:54.870> momentum<00:05:55.440> definitely<00:05:55.919> you<00:05:56.159> had<00:05:56.279> to

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
have any momentum definitely you had to

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.950 
have any momentum definitely you had to
have<00:05:56.400> momentum<00:05:56.849> while<00:05:57.090> going<00:05:57.330> for<00:05:57.539> a<00:05:57.599> gameplay

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
have momentum while going for a gameplay

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.689 
have momentum while going for a gameplay
like<00:05:58.139> this<00:05:58.349> it's<00:05:58.770> not<00:05:58.979> kind<00:05:59.129> of<00:05:59.219> like<00:05:59.310> a<00:05:59.340> DNA

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
like this it's not kind of like a DNA

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.640 
like this it's not kind of like a DNA
bomb<00:05:59.909> or<00:06:00.090> you<00:06:00.180> can<00:06:00.300> just<00:06:00.389> die<00:06:00.599> down<00:06:01.199> and<00:06:01.440> get

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
bomb or you can just die down and get

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.290 
bomb or you can just die down and get
you<00:06:01.770> know<00:06:01.860> 30<00:06:02.069> gun<00:06:02.250> kills<00:06:02.520> you<00:06:02.909> kind<00:06:03.090> of<00:06:03.150> have

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
you know 30 gun kills you kind of have

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.909 
you know 30 gun kills you kind of have
to<00:06:03.330> do<00:06:03.569> good<00:06:03.779> throughout<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.259> whole<00:06:04.379> game<00:06:04.409> and

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
to do good throughout the whole game and

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.439 
to do good throughout the whole game and
there<00:06:05.490> was<00:06:05.550> a<00:06:05.669> couple<00:06:05.789> times<00:06:05.969> within<00:06:06.270> the

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
there was a couple times within the

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.180 
there was a couple times within the
middle<00:06:06.659> of<00:06:06.719> the<00:06:06.779> gameplay<00:06:07.229> where<00:06:07.469> I<00:06:07.529> died<00:06:07.949> but

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
middle of the gameplay where I died but

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.290 
middle of the gameplay where I died but
I<00:06:08.219> cut<00:06:08.400> those<00:06:08.550> parts<00:06:08.819> out<00:06:08.969> because<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.270> was

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
I cut those parts out because it was

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.580 
I cut those parts out because it was
kind<00:06:09.539> of<00:06:09.569> boring<00:06:09.810> so<00:06:10.050> I<00:06:10.110> didn't<00:06:10.259> want<00:06:10.379> to<00:06:10.440> show

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
kind of boring so I didn't want to show

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.200 
kind of boring so I didn't want to show
it<00:06:10.620> but<00:06:11.069> I<00:06:11.159> died<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.370> couple<00:06:11.610> times<00:06:11.819> for<00:06:12.029> the

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
it but I died a couple times for the

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.700 
it but I died a couple times for the
gameplay<00:06:12.479> you<00:06:12.539> know<00:06:12.690> I<00:06:12.719> died<00:06:12.900> seven<00:06:13.500> times

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
gameplay you know I died seven times

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.230 
gameplay you know I died seven times
within<00:06:14.009> the<00:06:14.159> gameplay<00:06:14.520> and<00:06:15.029> at<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.210> very

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
within the gameplay and at the very

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.240 
within the gameplay and at the very
beginning<00:06:15.449> I<00:06:15.870> went<00:06:16.139> on<00:06:16.229> a<00:06:16.259> 29<00:06:16.770> kill<00:06:17.039> streak

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
beginning I went on a 29 kill streak

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.369 
beginning I went on a 29 kill streak
like<00:06:17.490> a<00:06:17.520> minute<00:06:17.969> in<00:06:18.060> 10<00:06:18.479> minute<00:06:18.810> 20<00:06:19.080> seconds

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:19.379 
like a minute in 10 minute 20 seconds

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.749 
like a minute in 10 minute 20 seconds
within<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.740> game<00:06:19.889> you<00:06:20.009> guys<00:06:20.099> saw<00:06:20.340> that<00:06:20.370> and

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
within the game you guys saw that and

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.459 
within the game you guys saw that and
then<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.120> died<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.690> that<00:06:22.050> could<00:06:22.259> potentially

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
then I died and that could potentially

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.379 
then I died and that could potentially
just<00:06:22.889> ruined<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.520> whole<00:06:23.669> game<00:06:23.909> play<00:06:24.090> because

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
just ruined the whole game play because

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:25.730 
just ruined the whole game play because
a<00:06:24.419> pretty<00:06:24.900> much<00:06:25.050> would<00:06:25.229> have<00:06:25.289> killed<00:06:25.529> my

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
a pretty much would have killed my

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.619 
a pretty much would have killed my
momentum<00:06:26.069> I<00:06:26.370> doubted<00:06:26.789> I<00:06:26.969> think<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.210> couple<00:06:27.240> off

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:27.629 
momentum I doubted I think a couple off

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.510 
momentum I doubted I think a couple off
of<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:27.840> UAV<00:06:28.229> or<00:06:28.469> I'm<00:06:28.529> out<00:06:28.620> I<00:06:28.650> got<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:28.979> baby<00:06:29.340> I

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
of the UAV or I'm out I got the baby I

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.040 
of the UAV or I'm out I got the baby I
can't<00:06:29.940> remember<00:06:30.120> but<00:06:30.360> I<00:06:30.419> died<00:06:30.629> a<00:06:30.659> couple<00:06:30.840> off

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
can't remember but I died a couple off

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.510 
can't remember but I died a couple off
of<00:06:31.199> a<00:06:31.379> streaks<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:31.919> that<00:06:32.310> could<00:06:32.430> have

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
of a streaks and that could have

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.100 
of a streaks and that could have
potentially<00:06:32.639> ruined<00:06:32.969> the<00:06:33.449> gameplay<00:06:33.810> you<00:06:33.960> kind

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
potentially ruined the gameplay you kind

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.360 
potentially ruined the gameplay you kind
of<00:06:34.139> have<00:06:34.259> to<00:06:34.289> play<00:06:34.500> smart<00:06:34.560> while<00:06:35.099> trying<00:06:35.310> to

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
of have to play smart while trying to

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.529 
of have to play smart while trying to
get<00:06:35.490> a<00:06:35.520> game<00:06:35.699> played<00:06:35.880> like<00:06:36.000> this<00:06:36.149> because<00:06:36.330> like

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
get a game played like this because like

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.540 
get a game played like this because like
I<00:06:36.630> said<00:06:36.690> you<00:06:37.440> have<00:06:37.680> to<00:06:37.860> pretty<00:06:38.190> much<00:06:38.310> stay

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
I said you have to pretty much stay

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.339 
I said you have to pretty much stay
alive<00:06:38.849> the<00:06:39.029> whole<00:06:39.060> time<00:06:39.240> if<00:06:39.839> you<00:06:39.960> keep<00:06:40.080> dying

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
alive the whole time if you keep dying

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.090 
alive the whole time if you keep dying
off<00:06:40.560> streaks<00:06:40.860> and

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
off streaks and

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.740 
off streaks and
on<00:06:41.160> off<00:06:41.370> streaks<00:06:41.670> you're<00:06:42.210> not<00:06:42.360> going<00:06:42.600> to<00:06:42.660> get

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
on off streaks you're not going to get

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.540 
on off streaks you're not going to get
those<00:06:42.960> up<00:06:43.200> those<00:06:43.710> potentially<00:06:44.220> you<00:06:44.310> know<00:06:44.340> the

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
those up those potentially you know the

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.340 
those up those potentially you know the
warbirds<00:06:44.910> like<00:06:45.090> I<00:06:45.180> said<00:06:45.360> they<00:06:45.780> got<00:06:45.900> me<00:06:46.020> 10<00:06:46.200> to

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
warbirds like I said they got me 10 to
