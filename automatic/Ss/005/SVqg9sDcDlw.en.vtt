00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.410 
but i think that you know without
translating<00:01:01.379> less<00:01:01.890> total<00:01:02.219> yards<00:01:02.730> will

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
translating less total yards will

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.299 
translating less total yards will

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
accumulate in more total touchdowns i

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.179 
accumulate in more total touchdowns i
think<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.519> gonna<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:05.880> red<00:01:06.180> zone<00:01:06.360> back<00:01:07.189> you

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189

red zone back obviously he's gonna be a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.649 
red zone back obviously he's gonna be a
three-down<00:01:11.280> back<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.180> it'll<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.390> more

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
an offense is gonna move the ball down

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
an offense is gonna move the ball down
the<00:01:20.310> field<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> they're<00:01:20.759> gonna<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.000> Eddie

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the field and they're gonna have Eddie

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
the field and they're gonna have Eddie
Lacy<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> pay<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> ball<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.369> know

Lacy to pay on the ball in and you know

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.039 
Lacy to pay on the ball in and you know
finish<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> drawers<00:01:24.030> off<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.840> think<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
finish the drawers off so I think it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.420 
finish the drawers off so I think it
could<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:25.680> valuable<00:01:26.040> running<00:01:26.189> back

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
could be very very valuable running back

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.429 
could be very very valuable running back
could<00:01:26.610> even<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.909> more<00:01:27.119> receptions<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
could even see more receptions out of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.770 
could even see more receptions out of
the<00:01:28.500> backfield<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.159> may<00:01:29.310> say<00:01:29.549> maybe<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.659> not

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the backfield you may say maybe it's not

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
the backfield you may say maybe it's not
