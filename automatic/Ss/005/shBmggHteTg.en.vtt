 Volleyball players will evaporate at violent 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.149
 MN current storm of systems plan finance area 4 98% b Bleckede already 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.259
 were percent 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.390
 Paris 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.900
 Cook from 4

 and have thought will turn to look forward and look what you n the OSO like that 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.120
 can do only over stairs photo very many functions and one 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.750
 I was more than half of that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.149
 for everyday becomes 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.410
 that's the procedure North Bridge 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.600
 around 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.580
 benefited from higher tact to the Sparda Ciolos should and also the 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.750
 l3-cache and what rolls one follows him 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.510
 in addition to the core tact also spoil 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.039
 including so the more you overclock the CPU all the more 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.270
 Hear valuable as you hire here 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.489
 so that one has the same percent the tension then 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.530
 everything more appealing is charged solely by wanted and cutlery ec2 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.680
 So in the background already lit the tongue then there would be eleven percentage points 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.810
 would Sion 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.490
 the front pages she opened on the branch of Munich 2 x 4 on 8 89 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.330
 with Stamer day 3com a 7 gigahertz 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.030
 to area by fences less to reason follows Â»and the multiplier 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 18 com on 5 so all standard 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.680
 The titles jumped as follows over 1 2 times 3 volts or systems must 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.249
 overclocked percent covers core day enters percent 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 the rushed 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.910
 Watch events right away 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.080
 So that Maxx gt 5 80 then performs in Colle Sunrise for it card there 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.670
 a new tool not GPU Tweak 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.870
 and percent 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.870
 this allows the change of the speaker Hermanns at this box office 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.920
 that is for kickers, they are center for the feature because you can click through 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.920
 I hope 2 settle 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.640
 The last few percent from the graphics card squeeze Saturday's rules 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.560
 he takes care of this memory card, among other things 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.289
 Change timings 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.289
 it's on the edge here 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.289
 Click on this vigorous one as proven 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.529
 let me open first 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.589
 so it was good started our sport 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.989
 the current session us that even the Asus matrix with default settings 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.849
 So 860 11 percent 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.849
 and then he said in 2004 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.120
 that's it running 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.120
 So at the age of 18 that's that's what it is now 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.719
 and if this graphic had the same time a maximum overclock 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.049
 I speak merit Faust
