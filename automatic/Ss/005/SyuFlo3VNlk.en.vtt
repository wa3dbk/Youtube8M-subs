it's really sweet very very cool

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.260 
it's really sweet very very cool
anyway<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:52.860> hit<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:54.059> tricky

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
anyway let's hit this it's really tricky

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.170 
anyway let's hit this it's really tricky
this<00:00:54.600> track<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.079> tough<00:00:55.940> there's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> way

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this track is pretty tough there's a way

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
this track is pretty tough there's a way
to<00:00:57.210> hit<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.320> did<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.559> that's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
to hit it and the way not did it that's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
to hit it and the way not did it that's
for<00:00:59.160> sure<00:00:59.370> sounds<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.059> sounds<00:01:00.090> dumb<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.570> this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
for sure sounds it sounds dumb but this

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740 
for sure sounds it sounds dumb but this
is<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> worst<00:01:01.680> rhythm<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.340> hit<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
is the worst rhythm you can hit here the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.939 
is the worst rhythm you can hit here the
reason<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.080> hit<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.710> hard<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
reason I hit it is because it's hard to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.770 
reason I hit it is because it's hard to
do<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:06.030> off<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> start

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
do get the right one off the start

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.859 
do get the right one off the start
that's<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.260> kind<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.619> nitpick<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.869> but

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that's one kind of nitpick I have but

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
that's one kind of nitpick I have but
possibly<00:01:10.680> intentional<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.460> sure<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> can

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
possibly intentional I'm sure you can

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.539 
possibly intentional I'm sure you can
hit<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.960> tricky<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
hit it but it's really tricky this is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.710 
hit it but it's really tricky this is
kind<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> neat<00:01:14.970> section<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.630> this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
kind of a neat section here but this

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.440 
kind of a neat section here but this
plot<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.500> hard<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.369> downside<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
plot is hard to actually downside and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.090 
plot is hard to actually downside and
let<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.630> hit<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.049> perfect<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.979> this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
let you hit it just perfect and this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.010 
let you hit it just perfect and this
corners<00:01:20.430> got<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> weird<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.210> slope<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.930> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
corners got a weird up slope to it so it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.270 
corners got a weird up slope to it so it
makes<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.320> where<00:01:22.439> right<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.250> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
makes it where right here you can see I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
makes it where right here you can see I
didn't<00:01:23.610> clear<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> usually<00:01:24.900> I've<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
didn't clear it usually I've got it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.450 
didn't clear it usually I've got it
figured<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> guess<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
figured out now but I guess that was a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
figured out now but I guess that was a
good<00:01:26.670> representation<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> small

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
good representation this is a small

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.380 
good representation this is a small
triple<00:01:29.070> easy<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> over<00:01:29.579> jump<00:01:29.820> same<00:01:30.150> here

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
triple easy to over jump same here

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
triple easy to over jump same here
middle<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.869> even<00:01:31.049> worse<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> gotta

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
middle one is even worse so you gotta

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.890 
middle one is even worse so you gotta
make<00:01:32.970> sure<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.210> hit<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.570> slopes

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
make sure you hit the down slopes

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.330 
make sure you hit the down slopes
otherwise<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.829> yourself<00:01:34.890> into

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
otherwise you can get yourself into

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.610 
otherwise you can get yourself into
trouble<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.880> quickly

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
trouble very quickly

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.320 
trouble very quickly
easy<00:01:38.620> to<00:01:38.830> want<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.159> scrub<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:39.940> right<00:01:40.150> there

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
easy to want to scrub that right there

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.500 
easy to want to scrub that right there
but<00:01:40.570> that's<00:01:40.690> always<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.049> mistake

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
but that's always a mistake

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.080 
but that's always a mistake

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
every lap if you don't hit it you can

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.810 
every lap if you don't hit it you can
get<00:02:02.409> yourself<00:02:02.500> into<00:02:02.830> trouble<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.430> it's<00:02:03.580> one<00:02:03.729> of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
get yourself into trouble so it's one of

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.070 
get yourself into trouble so it's one of
those<00:02:04.170> looks<00:02:05.170> like<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.820> ruined<00:02:06.820> my<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.780> rhythm

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
those looks like I ruined my that rhythm

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.600 
those looks like I ruined my that rhythm
there<00:02:08.229> by<00:02:08.380> trying<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.739> scrub<00:02:09.220> something<00:02:09.580> I

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
there by trying to scrub something I

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.000 
there by trying to scrub something I
shouldn't<00:02:09.880> have<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:11.500> you'll<00:02:11.620> see<00:02:11.800> here

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
shouldn't have but so you'll see here

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.640 
shouldn't have but so you'll see here
you<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.130> triple<00:02:12.610> jump<00:02:13.600> into<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.110> corner<00:02:14.470> get

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
you can triple jump into the corner get

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.140 
you can triple jump into the corner get
a<00:02:14.680> little<00:02:14.950> bit<00:02:15.070> better<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.489> drive<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.790> can

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
a little bit better of a drive you can

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.290 
a little bit better of a drive you can
see<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.450> kind<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.380> almost<00:02:17.470> cleared<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.300> should

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
see I kind of almost cleared it I should

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.580 
see I kind of almost cleared it I should
be<00:02:19.330> doing<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.630> little<00:02:19.750> bit<00:02:19.930> better<00:02:19.959> there<00:02:20.380> but

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
be doing a little bit better there but

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.180 
be doing a little bit better there but
that's<00:02:20.739> that's<00:02:21.250> just<00:02:21.280> how<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.610> goes<00:02:21.640> again<00:02:23.190> you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that's that's just how it goes again you

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.160 
that's that's just how it goes again you
can<00:02:24.340> scrub<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.000> middle<00:02:25.330> triple<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.989> it

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
can scrub this middle triple and it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.250 
can scrub this middle triple and it
saves<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.769> little<00:02:27.220> bit<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.459> time<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:29.110> kind

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
saves you a little bit of time it's kind

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.110 
saves you a little bit of time it's kind
of<00:02:29.290> tricky<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.590> get<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.800> right<00:02:29.950> speed<00:02:30.280> anyway

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
of tricky to get the right speed anyway

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.240 
of tricky to get the right speed anyway
that<00:02:31.300> was<00:02:31.390> already<00:02:31.510> two<00:02:31.720> laps<00:02:31.959> let's<00:02:32.830> see<00:02:33.040> if<00:02:33.130> I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
that was already two laps let's see if I

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.680 
that was already two laps let's see if I
can<00:02:33.400> hit<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.580> little<00:02:33.850> bit<00:02:34.060> better<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.510> lap

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
can hit a little bit better of a lap

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.930 
can hit a little bit better of a lap
here<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.260> can<00:02:35.380> throw<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> really<00:02:36.160> hard<00:02:36.400> scrub

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
here you can throw a really hard scrub

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.350 
here you can throw a really hard scrub
right<00:02:37.239> here<00:02:38.160> whoops<00:02:39.160> get<00:02:39.519> on<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.730> brakes<00:02:39.970> nice

right here whoops get on the brakes nice
the<00:02:40.600> inside<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.760> usually<00:02:42.760> try<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.940> roll<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.150> a

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
the inside I usually try to roll it a

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.610 
the inside I usually try to roll it a
little<00:02:43.420> slower<00:02:43.720> there<00:02:43.989> see<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.380> can<00:02:44.530> hit

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
little slower there see if I can hit

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.449 
little slower there see if I can hit
this<00:02:44.769> again<00:02:44.829> see<00:02:45.579> it's<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.790> weird<00:02:46.180> shape<00:02:46.600> there

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459
