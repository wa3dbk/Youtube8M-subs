00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
even sure why that's there but I guess

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.420 
even sure why that's there but I guess
some<00:01:32.180> people<00:01:32.510> want<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:32.990> do<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.230> that<00:01:33.410> way<00:01:33.620> hide

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.440 
how many items are in the cart it's not
going<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.530> display<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:48.950> message<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.790> I

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
going to display that message and I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.120 
going to display that message and I
think<00:01:50.690> it's<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:50.930> good<00:01:51.050> idea<00:01:51.230> to<00:01:51.500> have<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.830> off<00:01:51.920> by

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
think it's a good idea to have it off by

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.830 
think it's a good idea to have it off by
default<00:01:52.490> because<00:01:52.700> really<00:01:53.270> unless<00:01:53.600> you've<00:01:53.810> got

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
default because really unless you've got

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.830 
default because really unless you've got
a<00:01:54.020> gigantic<00:01:54.770> heart<00:01:55.340> filled<00:01:55.850> with<00:01:56.000> dozens<00:01:56.480> and
