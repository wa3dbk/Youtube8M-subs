00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.829
 Let's start with where they are located 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.840
 again we take for the landmark city 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.500
 Calpheon although by the way it is quite far 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.640
 from us water scorpion and here we are on top 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.739
 we have some city 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.789
 it is by chance not the same we are mining 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.500
 called not on the right side above us 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.660
 no no good but in general there is some 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.149
 town's landmark for you that is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.059
 Calpheon some small town 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.820
 and to the left of it and down are my 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.470
 here are bushes and here are such moby ki in 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.270
 the forest is still alive to us of these Indians 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.689
 both a few things i'm gonna get them 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.520
 here are a couple of these pebbles in general 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.240
 Vova kills he not sleep on photo poke there 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.000
 for 100 pieces we get weapons and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.090
 weapons exactly to your class ie if 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.670
 you are a giant ax if you are an archer there 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.549
 onion and so on another one there and here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.960
 now here these pebbles rise 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.549
 on video and show and what he showed 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.049
 There were 200 hours but 10 methods 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.729
 pennies on 201 and it turns out the weapon is 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.530
 better than what is allowed at the moment 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.909
 which I have which I brought on 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 previous videos can look at 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.750
 same tribe iroquois but same 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.130
 giant barbarian hockey and here I am 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.079
 knocked axes which which is pretty 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 not bad to be only 100 items 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.250
 i can get much better by 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.920
 initial damage and final damage 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.659
 so turn on the record again when 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.430
 let's run the compass which we will pass and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.430
 already show the weapon itself so here we are near 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.890
 nps and he is in the city kalfeon i 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.250
 here the truth is really stupid 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.880
 In Calpheon, we are trying to 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.380
 return to 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.470
 the city who does not remember the right button 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.810
 click on this which you need to pass 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.900
 here you are indicated the auto path as well 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.240
 denoted nps so press p 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.470
 interaction we have 200 items to give 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.330
 I'll show you right away that I have three 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.560
 loose amber checks nothing more 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.970
 there are no them now 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.300
 exchange for weapons 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.790
 here is the bottom quest indicated that that pieces 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.310
 we can not exchange for something bam once 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.170
 exchanged for something and in our amber as 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.890
 I said there were three gulls left 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.570
 2 and axes appeared with damage 1324 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.080
 Of course all weapons from additional 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.140
 stats 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.570
 but this is a weapon but even higher 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.520
 on initial ron and of course we are than mine 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.150
 axes which I have now plus those 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.580
 if you take the initial damage and now I will 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.650
 I will show that there is still worth a move like 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.990
 Once this prompted me to Vova who with 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.610
 us on the video that I will now be sharing 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.280
 shadows again axes yes yes yes that is 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.780
 and not like you used to be the opinion that you can 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.340
 drop only weapons on your class ok 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.350
 this is a drop in etsa for everything you can swing 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.880
 swing the barbarians and knock the shield over 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.680
 you don't understand him here 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.040
 exchange 100 percent for your class 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.960
 you press p again 100 items 1 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.960
 once we exchanged everything for something 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.490
 go in inventory and me the second such 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.480
 axes 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:33.120
 mitino that is equally cook 10 you 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.020
 add at this point may or 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.510
 honestly say yes for example, see yes 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.120
 dude say you assigned somewhere such 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.510
 same axes examples when you for accuracy 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.510
 start sharpening your weapon part very much 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.900
 very quickly falls for example at me 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.900
 Now add metabo bs 12 to see 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.910
 because so far not found 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.959
 example today so looked a few 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.680
 hours on these indians 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.070
 I get you 600 and how many drowned him 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.370
 remains due to these axes which 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.720
 traded its strength by 60 per se 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.460
 completely tower their axes 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.870
 but I'll add this moment here too 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.970
 look I today also pulled hatchets 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.030

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.420
 five strengths that is . I went nowhere 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.370
 lost five strength now I have 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.260
 there are no such axes now 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.120
 will have to buy somewhere at auction or 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.400
 beat giant drive a second 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.830

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.180
 two pairs they here we stuffed these two pairs 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.260
 very, very quickly stuffed like a warehouse 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.480
