00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
can really see why don't you know it
that's<00:01:50.399> some<00:01:50.790> evidence<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.420> he's<00:01:51.810> got<00:01:52.079> some

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that's some evidence that he's got some

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.410 
that's some evidence that he's got some
decreased<00:01:52.680> cardiac<00:01:52.979> output<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.000> right

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
decreased cardiac output going on right

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.889 
decreased cardiac output going on right
so<00:01:55.170> also<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.799> saw<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.219> he<00:01:56.430> had<00:01:56.899> capillary

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
so also I saw that he had capillary

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.660 
so also I saw that he had capillary
refill<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.439> was<00:01:58.530> greater<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:58.890> three<00:01:59.280> seconds

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
refill it was greater than three seconds

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.370 
refill it was greater than three seconds
so<00:02:00.500> when<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.560> go<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> create<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.210> container<00:02:03.869> or

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
so when I go to create the container or

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.499 
so when I go to create the container or
the<00:02:04.409> nursing<00:02:05.100> diagnosis<00:02:05.820> statement<00:02:06.329> what<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the nursing diagnosis statement what I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.589 
the nursing diagnosis statement what I
have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> say<00:02:08.599> here's

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
have to do is I have to say here's

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.930 
have to do is I have to say here's
what's<00:02:09.810> wrong

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
what's wrong

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.870 
what's wrong
here's<00:02:11.180> why<00:02:11.750> it's<00:02:11.990> wrong<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.680> here's<00:02:13.670> my

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
here's why it's wrong and here's my

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.390 
here's why it's wrong and here's my
evidence<00:02:14.540> as<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.870> why<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.500> wrong<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.190> put

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
evidence as to why it's wrong and I put

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.100 
evidence as to why it's wrong and I put
those<00:02:16.490> all<00:02:16.910> in<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.270> statement<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.810> once<00:02:17.930> I've

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
those all in one statement and once I've

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.650 
those all in one statement and once I've
done<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.770> have<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.250> really<00:02:19.970> good<00:02:20.360> direction

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
done that I have a really good direction

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.470 
done that I have a really good direction
to<00:02:21.380> follow<00:02:21.680> with<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.190> rest<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.550> my<00:02:22.760> care<00:02:23.090> right

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
to follow with the rest of my care right

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.870 
to follow with the rest of my care right
all<00:02:24.440> right<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.770> don't<00:02:25.250> stress<00:02:25.460> about<00:02:25.670> this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
all right so don't stress about this

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.700 
all right so don't stress about this

here's<00:02:31.310> what's<00:02:31.520> wrong<00:02:32.680> related<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:34.000> here's

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
here's what's wrong related to here's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.670 
here's what's wrong related to here's
why<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.630> wrong<00:02:35.900> as<00:02:36.970> evidenced<00:02:37.970> by<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:39.380> hard

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
why it's wrong as evidenced by the hard

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.280 
why it's wrong as evidenced by the hard
proof<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.370> what's<00:02:40.640> wrong<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.210> for<00:02:41.960> every

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
proof of what's wrong and for every

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.590 
proof of what's wrong and for every
single<00:02:42.560> thing<00:02:42.710> that<00:02:43.070> you've<00:02:43.370> decided<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.360> play

single thing that you've decided to play

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.910 
single thing that you've decided to play
and<00:02:44.810> care<00:02:45.020> for<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.440> day

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
and care for that day

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.530 
and care for that day
you're<00:02:46.280> gonna<00:02:46.460> write<00:02:46.760> underneath<00:02:47.300> each

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
you're gonna write underneath each

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.900 
you're gonna write underneath each
column<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.620> data<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.100> corresponds<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.730> it

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
column the data that corresponds to it

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.380 
column the data that corresponds to it
okay

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
okay

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.420 
okay
so<00:02:50.840> let's<00:02:51.050> look<00:02:51.200> at<00:02:51.320> my<00:02:51.470> patient<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.280> guys

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
so let's look at my patient and you guys

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.720 
so let's look at my patient and you guys
will<00:02:52.610> see<00:02:52.640> how<00:02:52.880> super<00:02:53.480> simple<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.290> okay

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
will see how super simple this is okay

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.710 
will see how super simple this is okay
so<00:02:56.080> here's<00:02:57.080> what's<00:02:57.350> wrong<00:02:57.970> decreased<00:02:58.970> cardiac

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
so here's what's wrong decreased cardiac

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
so here's what's wrong decreased cardiac
output<00:03:01.360> related<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:04.300> myocardial

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
output related to myocardial

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.640 
output related to myocardial
inefficiency<00:03:06.740> here's<00:03:07.550> what's<00:03:08.150> wrong<00:03:08.900> why

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
inefficiency here's what's wrong why

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.949 
inefficiency here's what's wrong why
it's<00:03:09.860> wrong<00:03:10.070> excuse<00:03:10.520> me<00:03:10.700> as<00:03:11.380> evidence<00:03:12.380> by

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
it's wrong excuse me as evidence by

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.850 
it's wrong excuse me as evidence by
shortness<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.080> breath<00:03:16.570> polypharmacy

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860

irregular<00:03:21.200> heart<00:03:21.470> rate<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.950> my<00:03:22.520> patient

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
irregular heart rate and my patient

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.320 
irregular heart rate and my patient
statement<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.600> he<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:24.650> tired<00:03:25.330> here

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
statement that he is just so tired here

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.620 
statement that he is just so tired here
is<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.990> hard<00:03:27.230> proof<00:03:27.620> why<00:03:28.070> it's<00:03:28.430> wrong<00:03:28.630> let's

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
is the hard proof why it's wrong let's

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.030 
is the hard proof why it's wrong let's
see<00:03:29.750> how<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.020> all<00:03:30.050> sounds<00:03:30.500> really<00:03:30.860> run

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
see how that all sounds really run

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.400 
see how that all sounds really run
together<00:03:31.190> all<00:03:31.580> right
