00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
weeks after which i still think is a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.310 
weeks after which i still think is a
pretty<00:01:29.460> safe<00:01:29.880> window<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.960> something<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
pretty safe window for something that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
pretty safe window for something that
now<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.369> party<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.790> question<00:01:33.030> we're

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.880 
now as to the party your question we're
asking<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> studios<00:01:34.710> might

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
asking do you think the studios might

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
asking do you think the studios might
stop<00:01:35.189> bringing<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.790> exclusive<00:01:36.360> stuff

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
because it gets leaked online no I think

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.730 
because it gets leaked online no I think
the<00:01:39.030> studios<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.689> mind<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> leaking<00:01:40.350> online

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the studios don't mind it leaking online

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.859 
the studios don't mind it leaking online
to<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.340> honest<00:01:41.729> I'm<00:01:41.970> more<00:01:42.030> concerned<00:01:42.570> about

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to be honest I'm more concerned about

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.740 
to be honest I'm more concerned about
folks<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.860> who<00:01:44.670> are<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.630> I

folks like you who are the like I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.179 
folks like you who are the like I
haven't<00:01:45.930> stepped<00:01:46.170> foot<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.530> Hall<00:01:46.680> H<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.009> five

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
haven't stepped foot in Hall H in five

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.580 
haven't stepped foot in Hall H in five
years<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.509> probably<00:01:48.720> never<00:01:48.990> will<00:01:49.320> again

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
years and I probably never will again

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.069 
years and I probably never will again
but<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.250> folks<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.090> folks<00:01:51.990> like

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
but for folks like you and folks like

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.010 
but for folks like you and folks like
and<00:01:52.560> who<00:01:53.070> will<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.000> sleep<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> be

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
dedicated to get in there see it I think

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.090 
dedicated to get in there see it I think
it's<00:01:57.390> important<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.140> protect<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it's important that they protect that

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490 
it's important that they protect that
material<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.570> least<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.960> couple<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.290> weeks

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
material for at least a couple of weeks

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.920 
material for at least a couple of weeks
so<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.430> are<00:02:02.640> sleeping<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.750> can

so that you are sleeping out so you can

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.830 
so that you are sleeping out so you can
truly<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.070> first<00:02:05.759> people<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
truly be the first people to see it and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.559 
truly be the first people to see it and
for<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> number<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:08.009> weeks<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.940> only<00:02:09.390> people

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
for a number of weeks the only people

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.540 
for a number of weeks the only people
who<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:09.929> seen<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.860> some<00:02:11.099> point<00:02:11.129> it's

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
who have seen it but at some point it's

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.040 
who have seen it but at some point it's
got<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.819> become<00:02:11.910> fair<00:02:12.300> game<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.780> got<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> be
