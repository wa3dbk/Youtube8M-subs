pieces<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.300> whatnot<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:53.989> this<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.649> actually

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
pieces and whatnot so this is actually

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.680 
pieces and whatnot so this is actually
turned<00:01:55.160> into<00:01:55.310> quite<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.849> powerful<00:01:56.390> tool<00:01:56.630> to

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
turned into quite a powerful tool to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.050 
turned into quite a powerful tool to
allow<00:01:57.349> players<00:01:57.619> within<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.190> matter<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.459> minutes

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
allow players within a matter of minutes

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.249 
allow players within a matter of minutes
create<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.300> toy<00:01:59.539> box<00:01:59.780> that<00:02:00.020> they<00:02:00.110> can

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
create a toy box that they can

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.809 
create a toy box that they can
completely<00:02:00.709> edit<00:02:01.069> on<00:02:01.190> their<00:02:01.340> own<00:02:01.489> however

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
completely edit on their own however

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.820 
completely edit on their own however
they<00:02:02.060> want<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.989> what<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.259> guys<00:02:03.440> are<00:02:03.619> seeing

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
they want to so what you guys are seeing

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.320 
they want to so what you guys are seeing
right<00:02:04.009> here<00:02:04.069> is<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.369> little<00:02:04.759> bit<00:02:04.849> of<00:02:04.940> our<00:02:05.060> power

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
right here is a little bit of our power

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.119 
right here is a little bit of our power
user<00:02:05.660> mode<00:02:05.959> it<00:02:06.200> actually<00:02:06.470> allows<00:02:06.679> players<00:02:06.950> to

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
user mode it actually allows players to

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.790 
user mode it actually allows players to
define<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:08.030> volume<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.750> then<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> computer

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
define a volume and then the computer

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.339 
define a volume and then the computer
will<00:02:09.950> begin<00:02:10.250> Auto<00:02:10.819> creating<00:02:11.480> or<00:02:11.660> procedurally

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
will begin Auto creating or procedurally

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.960 
will begin Auto creating or procedurally
generating<00:02:12.980> terrain<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.760> play<00:02:13.940> in

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
generating terrain for you to play in

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.800 
generating terrain for you to play in
and<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.630> case<00:02:14.840> here<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.440> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and the case here it's a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.320 
and the case here it's a
escaped<00:02:16.140> but<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.530> also<00:02:16.950> generate<00:02:17.670> landscaping

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
escaped but it also generate landscaping

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.540 
escaped but it also generate landscaping
decorations<00:02:18.989> such<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.650> mailboxes<00:02:20.310> and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
decorations such as mailboxes and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.100 
decorations such as mailboxes and
streetlights<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.120> things<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.569> in

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
streetlights and things like that in

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.140 
streetlights and things like that in
this<00:02:22.590> example<00:02:22.980> you're<00:02:23.340> actually<00:02:23.640> seeing<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
this example you're actually seeing a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.720 
this example you're actually seeing a
racetrack<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:25.050> even<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.470> castle<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.520> case

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
racetrack or even a castle in the case

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.190 
racetrack or even a castle in the case
of<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.970> racetrack<00:02:27.239> it'll<00:02:27.810> build<00:02:27.989> that

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
of a racetrack it'll build that

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.870 
of a racetrack it'll build that
racetrack<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.980> complete<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.489> circuit

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
racetrack and complete the circuit

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.570 
racetrack and complete the circuit
they'll<00:02:30.270> even<00:02:30.510> put<00:02:30.690> AI<00:02:31.290> splines<00:02:32.069> on<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
they'll even put AI splines on the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.220 
they'll even put AI splines on the
racetrack<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.450> when<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.690> go<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:33.870> put

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
racetrack so that when you go and put

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.960 
racetrack so that when you go and put
down<00:02:34.410> enemy<00:02:34.830> racers<00:02:35.280> they'll<00:02:35.730> actually

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
down enemy racers they'll actually

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.990 
down enemy racers they'll actually
follow<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:37.200> correct<00:02:37.470> flow<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.519> racetrack

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
follow the correct flow of the racetrack

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.600 
follow the correct flow of the racetrack
itself<00:02:39.650> now<00:02:40.650> something<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.160> was<00:02:41.280> kind<00:02:41.489> of

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
itself now something that was kind of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.979 
itself now something that was kind of
fun<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.940> we're<00:02:42.090> toying<00:02:42.330> with<00:02:42.450> right<00:02:42.780> now<00:02:42.810> and

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
fun that we're toying with right now and

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.600 
fun that we're toying with right now and
I'd<00:02:43.319> mentioned<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.830> Evan<00:02:44.130> when<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.400> were<00:02:44.459> doing

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
I'd mentioned to Evan when we were doing

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.729 
I'd mentioned to Evan when we were doing
the<00:02:44.880> interview<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.569> procedural<00:02:46.319> generation

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the interview is procedural generation

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.259 
the interview is procedural generation
of<00:02:47.010> gameplay<00:02:47.400> components<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.180> that's

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
of gameplay components and that's

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.850 
of gameplay components and that's
something<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.630> we're<00:02:48.900> very<00:02:48.930> interested<00:02:49.470> in

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
something that we're very interested in

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.309 
something that we're very interested in
with<00:02:50.489> infinity<00:02:50.970> moving<00:02:51.269> forward<00:02:51.780> we<00:02:52.110> will

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
with infinity moving forward we will

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.590 
with infinity moving forward we will
have<00:02:52.500> one<00:02:52.860> brush<00:02:53.370> as<00:02:53.670> we<00:02:53.819> call<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.180> inside<00:02:54.569> of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
have one brush as we call it inside of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.720 
have one brush as we call it inside of
infinity<00:02:55.170> 2.0<00:02:55.739> which<00:02:56.010> will<00:02:56.190> generate

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
infinity 2.0 which will generate

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.610 
infinity 2.0 which will generate
platforming<00:02:57.569> elements<00:02:57.720> for<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.470> play

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
platforming elements for you to play

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.229 
platforming elements for you to play
with<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.160> that's<00:02:59.280> real<00:02:59.489> fun<00:02:59.700> because<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.090> can

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
with so that's real fun because you can

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.610 
with so that's real fun because you can
actually<00:03:00.390> go<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.930> can<00:03:01.080> create<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.349> tree

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
actually go and you can create a tree

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.470 
actually go and you can create a tree
house<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.069> then<00:03:02.190> use<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.430> auto<00:03:02.880> creator<00:03:03.299> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
house and then use that auto creator to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.300 
house and then use that auto creator to
create<00:03:03.510> platforming<00:03:04.349> challenges<00:03:04.380> inside<00:03:05.130> of

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
create platforming challenges inside of

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.670 
create platforming challenges inside of
there<00:03:05.519> so<00:03:05.819> as<00:03:06.150> Infinity<00:03:06.720> involves<00:03:07.170> over<00:03:07.380> time

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
there so as Infinity involves over time

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
there so as Infinity involves over time
we're<00:03:07.920> looking<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.250> more<00:03:09.180> ways<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.450> we<00:03:09.750> can

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
we're looking for more ways that we can

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.720 
we're looking for more ways that we can
generate<00:03:10.049> gameplay<00:03:10.769> content<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.580> create

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
generate gameplay content to create

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.120 
generate gameplay content to create
unlimited<00:03:12.200> replayability<00:03:13.200> for<00:03:13.769> our<00:03:13.860> players
