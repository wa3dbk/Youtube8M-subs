00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.029
 what 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.119
 t 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.800
 elio the years fail I hope you 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.360
 go well guys today this robot 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.130
 second set of my series it would be 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.030
 some surfaces the three steps I 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.590
 will introduce you today 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.080
 will go into the pulse campaign ya 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.699
 twice then directly with the 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.559
 first interest will happen in the 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.239
 mission 5 the show after maths on 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.770
 will see in a half-opened locker that there is 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.680
 stuck on the wall with small tubes 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.190
 at the foot of the scriptures so he writes to 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.080
 vigousse a day to day 3 of the half prepares 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.080
 in November and are today less 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.399
 that its equivalent I do not know more 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.090
 to see his voice granny look strange 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.740
 writing it's true that's it 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.180
 it's quite strange and me what you 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.259
 do you think it's not a measure 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.420
 in comment here I do not know 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.050
 more connected directly with the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.550
 second historic 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.649
 so here it is here it's not really 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.360
 an easter egg is a little trick fun a 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.470
 little bonus actually that's it it's 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.979
 something that does not require us 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.780
 necessarily 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.229
 so I'm telling you that the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.759
 done in recruits me I did the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.250
 rookie campaign can find motion 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.210
 of things I was not asked so we 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.470
 asks to do the training at 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.550
 training or ronaldo have not me 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.990
 asked to do the training 30 good 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.819
 this is the little one selling 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.020
 to a little bonus trick and we did not 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.940
 asked tell me what they did the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.890
 veteran mission this is a level more 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.140
 harder either if you were asked to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.340
 do enough to the golden drones according to 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.500
 the panel and not that little bonus 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.729
 to situate realize it will happen I 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.099
 precise I wanted to say in 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.380
 the show 2 so the atlas mission and 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.020
 so that's after it's done 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.160
 ronaldo drones training are governed 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.860
 hashed in the little shed as I 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.929
 went here you'll have little 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.030
 good drug training his share nothing 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.630
 no more nothing that brings nothing to 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.340
 the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.470
 to your missions after you can very 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.360
 continue well continue the campaign 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.040
 Here is just a small little mbao 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.260
 bonus is that do it you do it 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.730
 see that it will not have as I 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.080
 you say you 're ready you can 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.310
 continue your mission quietly 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.410
 so we finish with the third easter 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.940
 egg is the most important gift 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.780
 will go into mission 3 mission 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.110
 traffic so after having been after 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.120
 shot by the crew crochard the soul 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.920
 or big 4 4 who is chasing you here 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.020
 so it will be in the building of which I 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.190
 I went back this is the place where there is the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.570
 intelligence so I show you to 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.030
 the screen here is where there are the screens of 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.590
 team intelligence and knows that one has to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.240
 so get back the a40 that seems to me in 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.360
 all the campaign for small pc whose 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.670
 to recover here is a simple room for 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.070
 you nothing me it's android super it's 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.020
 so on the ground floor we stayed from 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.090
 this house you will have managed to gather 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.430
 three pictures fire to several several 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.260
 several frames but you will especially 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.380
 three pictures three very posters 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.220
 important because it will represent everything 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.410
 simply the map 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.180
 atlas throat so that's it for those who 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.470
 do not recognize to be sent to the screen I 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.110
 you put some appearances of the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.890
 map in parallel the sweet potato so 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.069
 a tablecloth that is downloadable 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.150
 on area are not that I had thanks to 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.280
 do not seem to me that looting 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.990
 not to say nonsense and so here 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.380
 you can see that this is exactly the 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.090
 same thing 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.490
 to something close here are some 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.850
 cars a few things that have moved to 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.650
 apart from one thing that is not very 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.840
 important what are the people see 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.730
 the logic you tell me we follow and 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.690
 pictures there are people that we 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.000
 not find in the match what is 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.130
 logic on his weird little preface 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.020
 and that's who they are surely 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.040
 badly to those who built the bridge this 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.020
 that we build this dam 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.360
 so those who know the same place 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.930
 if you can see it's a dam of water 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.650
 only those people who have 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.269
 build the dam 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.370
 so here I do not know anymore by 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.930
 report to that I show how you 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.130
 see that it looked from amap atlas 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.380
 true throat that's exactly the same 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.600
 and this is a little trick this fun thing 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.010
 to very nice gentleman savoie I you 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.400
 showed the last so here is the 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.739
 latest 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.829
 the last last post ya so there is 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:23.360
 a lot of people out on this 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.919
 photo there will notice here are who are 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.030
 a lot especially that these people do not 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.070
 not see them no I looked at them 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.140
 price heads we do not see in the 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.220
 mays here we picture how these 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.260
 characters do not appear on the 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.479
 map these a few pictures of people on 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.890
 the hand but not pass anyone there he 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.600
 there is a person who assures his helmet 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.620
 a crown here we are I do not know 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.520
 more afraid bourassa maybe a 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.380
 important person 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.740
