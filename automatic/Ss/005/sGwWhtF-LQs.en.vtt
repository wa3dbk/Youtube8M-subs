00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

now<00:00:00.120> everybody<00:00:00.630> knows<00:00:00.900> that<00:00:01.140> rally<00:00:01.380> cars<00:00:01.709> go

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
now everybody knows that rally cars go

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.910 
now everybody knows that rally cars go
fast<00:00:02.460> very<00:00:03.120> fast<00:00:03.480> but<00:00:03.990> it's<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.500> brakes<00:00:04.770> that

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
fast very fast but it's the brakes that

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
fast very fast but it's the brakes that
slow<00:00:05.310> them<00:00:05.520> down

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
slow them down

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.750 
slow them down
and<00:00:06.029> do<00:00:06.629> they<00:00:06.810> take<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> hammering<00:00:07.830> with<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
and do they take a hammering with the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.940 
and do they take a hammering with the
ultra<00:00:09.120> grippy<00:00:09.420> asphalt<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.990> Catalunya<00:00:10.440> coming

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
ultra grippy asphalt of Catalunya coming

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.480 
ultra grippy asphalt of Catalunya coming
up<00:00:11.070> car<00:00:11.429> control<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.059> high<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.509> agenda

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
up car control is high on the agenda

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.730 
up car control is high on the agenda
from<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> standard<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> rally<00:00:15.929> cap<00:00:16.230> on

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
from a standard can to a rally cap on

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.130 
from a standard can to a rally cap on
gravel<00:00:17.400> rally<00:00:17.910> car<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.630> brake<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.990> very

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
gravel rally car the brake is very

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.170 
gravel rally car the brake is very
similar<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.500> stand<00:00:19.800> again<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.609> Desai's<00:00:20.970> is

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
similar to stand again the Desai's is

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.609 
similar to stand again the Desai's is
very<00:00:21.359> similar<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.020> one<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.470> here

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
very similar like the one we have here

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.269 
very similar like the one we have here
and<00:00:23.150> that's<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.330> gravel<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.590> break<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
and that's a gravel from break and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.849 
and that's a gravel from break and
that's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.060> gravel<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.510> caliper<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.740> we

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that's a gravel from caliper and when we

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.529 
that's a gravel from caliper and when we
see<00:00:29.039> now<00:00:29.220> later<00:00:29.519> when<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:29.910> see<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> big<00:00:30.330> ones

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
see now later when we see the big ones

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.089 
see now later when we see the big ones
from<00:00:30.810> tarmac<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.380> will<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> difference

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
from tarmac we will see the difference

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.549 
from tarmac we will see the difference
obviously<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.180> tarmac<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.140> much<00:00:34.380> more

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
obviously on tarmac that is much more

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.110 
obviously on tarmac that is much more
deep<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> road<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.520> need<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> stop<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
deep on the road so you need to stop the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
deep on the road so you need to stop the
car<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.840> need<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> use<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> brakes<00:00:37.440> more

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
car and you need to use the brakes more

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.560 
car and you need to use the brakes more
like<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.219> Spain<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.730> example<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.180> use<00:00:39.329> much

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
like in Spain for example you use much

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.819 
like in Spain for example you use much
more<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> brakes<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.440> use<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
more the brakes then you will use in a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.250 
more the brakes then you will use in a
gravel<00:00:41.219> event<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.640> Mexican<00:00:42.090> that's<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
gravel event like Mexican that's the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.990 
gravel event like Mexican that's the
size<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.649> tarmac<00:00:46.649> disc<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.700> we're<00:00:47.879> going

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
size of the tarmac disc that we're going

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.970 
size of the tarmac disc that we're going
to<00:00:48.210> use<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.079> plane<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> compare

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
to use in this plane so if you compare

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.010 
to use in this plane so if you compare
with<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> other<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:51.329> much<00:00:51.449> bigger<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
with the other one it's much bigger and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.720 
with the other one it's much bigger and
of<00:00:52.350> course<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> same<00:00:52.829> goes<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> caliper

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
of course the same goes with the caliper

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.299 
of course the same goes with the caliper
the<00:00:54.690> calipers<00:00:55.140> much<00:00:55.320> bigger<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.710> well<00:00:55.860> that

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the calipers much bigger as well that

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
the calipers much bigger as well that
you<00:00:56.430> cannot<00:00:56.640> compare<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> standard

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you cannot compare this to a standard

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
you cannot compare this to a standard
care<00:00:57.899> at<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:58.739> made<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> steel<00:00:59.219> both

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
care at all they are made of steel both

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.520 
care at all they are made of steel both
of<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.090> same<00:01:00.510> material<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.170> both<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.410> them

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
of them same material for both of them

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
of them same material for both of them
but<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> put<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
but and if you put in you know here you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.080 
but and if you put in you know here you
can<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:03.989> clearly<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.369> make<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> shot<00:01:05.820> here

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
can see clearly if you make a shot here

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.370 
can see clearly if you make a shot here
you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:06.900> clearly<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> difference

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you can see clearly the difference

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.890 
you can see clearly the difference
between<00:01:07.860> gravel<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.670> tarmac<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.689> quite

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
between gravel and tarmac it's quite

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.810 
between gravel and tarmac it's quite
obvious<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:11.010> plane<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.400> particularly

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
obvious in this plane is particularly

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
obvious in this plane is particularly
but<00:01:12.720> because<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> permit<00:01:13.560> event<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
but because it's a permit event and you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
but because it's a permit event and you
have<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.460> deep<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.030> higher<00:01:15.270> speed

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
have more deep and you have higher speed

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.570 
have more deep and you have higher speed
so<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> stop<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> car<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.460> with

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so you want to stop the car and with

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.280 
so you want to stop the car and with
these<00:01:17.640> leaks<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.150> needed<00:01:18.630> someone<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
these leaks you needed someone that to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.600 
these leaks you needed someone that to
help<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> bigger<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
help you and the bigger you have it the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.429 
help you and the bigger you have it the
better<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.900> know<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.080> put<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
better with it you know you put the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.520 
better with it you know you put the
parts<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.479> then<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> put<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> disc<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
parts here and then you put the disc and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.130 
parts here and then you put the disc and
then<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> course<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.600> parts<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
then of course the parts with the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.499 
then of course the parts with the
pressure<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.820> put<00:01:30.000> pressure<00:01:30.329> on

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
pressure that you put it put pressure on

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.810 
pressure that you put it put pressure on
the<00:01:30.600> pad<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.020> gets<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.920> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the pad and gets to this

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.700 
the pad and gets to this
so<00:01:33.820> taking<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.329> closer<00:01:34.600> look<00:01:34.869> inside<00:01:35.109> the<00:01:35.500> brake

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
so taking a closer look inside the brake

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.459 
so taking a closer look inside the brake
assembly<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:36.640> WRC<00:01:37.090> caliper<00:01:37.719> has<00:01:37.869> four<00:01:38.170> clamps

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
assembly the WRC caliper has four clamps

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.740 
assembly the WRC caliper has four clamps
called<00:01:38.890> pots<00:01:39.219> that<00:01:39.490> under-braking<00:01:40.210> apply<00:01:40.719> a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
called pots that under-braking apply a

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.660 
called pots that under-braking apply a
pressure<00:01:41.079> to<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.409> brake<00:01:41.590> pads<00:01:41.860> which<00:01:42.250> in<00:01:42.429> turn

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
pressure to the brake pads which in turn

damper painless if it breaks very rarely

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.630 
damper painless if it breaks very rarely
you<00:02:07.989> will<00:02:08.019> have<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> big<00:02:08.470> accident<00:02:08.739> if<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.429> brake

you will have a big accident if a brake

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.819 
you will have a big accident if a brake
fails<00:02:09.940> or<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.479> steering<00:02:10.690> brakes<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.680> can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
fails or the steering brakes you can

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.990 
fails or the steering brakes you can
have<00:02:11.980> an<00:02:12.069> accident<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.579> can<00:02:12.730> get<00:02:12.849> injured
