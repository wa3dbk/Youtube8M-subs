to that ethically grated zucchini I have

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
to that ethically grated zucchini I have
used<00:00:59.730> Sukeena<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.600> high<00:01:00.870> fiber<00:01:01.199> content

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
used Sukeena for as high fiber content

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.410

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
the best judge to know the amount of

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.960 
the best judge to know the amount of
water<00:01:42.930> used<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.530> making<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> batter<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
water used in making the batter of a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.600 
water used in making the batter of a
pancake<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.680> amount<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.310> water

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
pancake because the amount of water

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
pancake because the amount of water
varies<00:01:48.180> depending<00:01:48.720> upon<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.260> quality<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
varies depending upon the quality of the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.789 
varies depending upon the quality of the
rice<00:01:50.340> flour<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.970> Basin<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:52.439> would<00:01:52.619> require

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
rice flour and Basin this would require

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.320 
rice flour and Basin this would require
some<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.490> water

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.730 

check<00:01:57.330> out<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.659> consistency<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.710> batter

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
check out the consistency of the batter

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.670 
check out the consistency of the batter
is<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> would<00:01:59.880> say<00:02:00.150> this<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.110> perfect

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
is what I would say this is the perfect

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
is what I would say this is the perfect
consistency<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.520> should<00:02:02.580> not<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.240> too<00:02:03.450> watery

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
consistency it should not be too watery

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.560 
consistency it should not be too watery
and<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.530> too<00:02:04.770> thick<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.490> batter<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.000> ready<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and not too thick the batter is ready so

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.050 
and not too thick the batter is ready so
let's<00:02:06.780> begin<00:02:06.990> making<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.560> pancakes<00:02:07.820> for<00:02:08.820> that
