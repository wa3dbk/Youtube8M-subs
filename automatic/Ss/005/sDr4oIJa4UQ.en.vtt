00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 all right 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.380
 the training let's say they gave us 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.870
 means that we have to make 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.420
 understand to the guys that this is a 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.680
 a state tool that really 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.110
 can transform lives 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.000
 and transmit them or what is the same 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.510
 They can transform the lives of people 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.510
 in neighborhoods 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.539
 how 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.730
 more than anything we were seeing about the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.990
 solidary economy that is achievable 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.640
 tool of those little ones 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.530
 entrepreneurs and those who want 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.530
 start your own enterprise 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.719
 and a little to put the accent is also 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.179
 in the role that we have young people 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.179
 this as transformation actors 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.260
 we go cake because we even went through the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.330
 contrite neighborhood we already talked to the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.850
 destination where the drivers 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.860
 actively participate and the end is 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.880
 reach every neighbor until the last 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.880
 corner of the neighborhood 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.139
 we dedicated in a garden I wanted to leave 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.340
 the neighborhood boys to share 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.340
 between the whole family the nothing 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.470
 I am my own enterprise 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.520
 to put a bakery but I just 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.430
 could programmers with a friend who 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.520
 it just has the same we have the same and 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.090
 we share the same time in bakery 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.090
 we have knowledge 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.160
 thanks to the chapel that I am putting together 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.830
 a radio had 22 we are improving 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.990
 day to day everything to administer through everything 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.670
 what I learned to this treatment to translate it 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.830
 at work is that doing more radio 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.480

 interesting to enter all this the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.410
 true that I did not have the knowledge of 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.410
 nothing was simply one more grip 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.360
 it is the state of the nationalized state 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.570
 present in the neighborhood and good is a 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.080
