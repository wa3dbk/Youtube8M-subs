00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.660
 no longer weigh megabyte occupy kb if you do not 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.220

 fg so I do not know if it 's that if they came to 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.099
 take in the cfc what would happen is that no 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.769
 they would open the counting would go and 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.750
 you will have to close it will be 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.760
 would the black screen itself so 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.190
 everything would have to close and get him out 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.379
 the fgy put the one of paula that you 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.629
 it always comes so good we're going to 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.790
 try it what you have to do to 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.370
 put it is open the file the notebook 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.930
 Agatha notes 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.670
 they open it what they have to do is 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.239
 copy this everything that says here what 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.980
 copy once this has been copied not 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.930
 we minimize and have to go to the folder 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.750
 where you have installed the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.220
 counter strike 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.130
 Basically it 's wayward socks file 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.220
 prevention program be with the d 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.830
 enter the counter strike or valve 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.110
 once they are inside the counter 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.630
 strike or valve what you have to do is 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.220
 go to the strike folder if you 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.890
 they have the counter in Spanish 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.230
 surely cs strike will appear 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.690
 spanish as I have it in Spanish 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.770
 I have to put the cvg in the folder that 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.420
 says cc strike 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.430
 spanish but if you do not have it in 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.880
 Spanish has to put the folder 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.670
 the rule always bring 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.230
 we put that try 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.810
 once they are inside the of the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.240
 folder will notice that there is a folder 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.180
 that is a note blues that says trust 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.070
 and the type is an efe files that you 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.680
 open this this curtain file of 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.840
 notes open it and what you have to do 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.150
 is to erase what appears here what 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.730
 erase and paste the fg that copied that 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.740
 It would be good if you copy it now 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.440
 that I copied it they close it they put 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.630
 save and ready is already set our 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.160
 ff 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.010
 Now I'm going to do the other procedure 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.600
 If you do not have it in Spanish what 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.630
 have to do is put it in the folder 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.310
 good strike is the same is the same 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.950
 procedure decentrates the folder 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.170
 acs strike and look for the folder that says 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.590
 config and the file type is a 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:27.040
 good cfg file is the same you what 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.900
 open they erase what is here and put the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.710
 cfg all this procedure you have to 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.770
 do it in both 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.810
 only if you have control in 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.830
 Spanish you put it in 63 which is Paris if 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.870
 it's not in spanish what you put in 60 and ready 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.750
 well once all this has been put 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.380
 we have it in our counter strike 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.380
 let's see how it works 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.040
 good once inside electro 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.530
 counter-strike automatically we are 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.310
 will open the console once we are 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.620
 open the console you will notice what it says 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.770
 afghanistan or good the name of the fg 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.900
 that means that our trust is 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.700
 activated good let's create a game 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.700
 let's see how we got the record 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.560
 well we are already within our 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.280
 server as you will notice the changes now 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.750
 we pay once 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.700
