00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
and hot i'm going to start taking

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.520 
and hot i'm going to start taking
strands<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.010> how<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.069> curl<00:03:35.609> it<00:03:36.409> we're<00:03:37.409> just

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
strands and how you curl it we're just

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.750 
strands and how you curl it we're just
going<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:38.359> pull<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.840> kind<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.889> twist<00:03:41.280> it

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.800 

I<00:03:43.819> think<00:03:43.970> that

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
I think that

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.300 
I think that
you<00:03:46.200> want<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.440> make<00:03:46.560> sure<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.830> have<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> tight

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
you want to make sure you have a tight

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.970 
you want to make sure you have a tight
ponytail<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:48.090> because<00:03:48.569> it<00:03:49.050> will<00:03:49.260> pull<00:03:49.680> your

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
ponytail in because it will pull your

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.460 
ponytail in because it will pull your
ponytail<00:03:50.569> when<00:03:51.569> you're<00:03:51.690> putting<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.200> much

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
ponytail when you're putting this much

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.880 
ponytail when you're putting this much
pressure<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:53.069> your<00:03:53.400> hair<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.620> we're<00:03:55.860> just

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890
