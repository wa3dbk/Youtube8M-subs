but<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.770> wish<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.009> grab<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.400> this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
but I really wish you grab it like this

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.819 
but I really wish you grab it like this
because<00:01:35.939> it'd<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:36.869> better<00:01:37.320> zombies

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
because it'd be just better zombies

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.520 
because it'd be just better zombies
instead<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.310> fog<00:01:38.579> don't<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.509> they<00:01:39.750> got<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> big

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
instead of fog don't see they got a big

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.810 
instead of fog don't see they got a big
pile<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.829> smoke<00:01:41.159> they're<00:01:41.400> coming<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.729> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
pile of smoke they're coming out of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.260 
pile of smoke they're coming out of
nowhere

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
nowhere

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.700 
nowhere
you've<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> bridge<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.439> normally

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you've got the bridge at normally

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
you've got the bridge at normally
cracked<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.220> half<00:01:44.250> which<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> hasn't<00:01:45.390> cracked

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
cracked in half which it hasn't cracked

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
cracked in half which it hasn't cracked
in<00:01:45.899> half<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.710> gameplay<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.640> yet<00:01:47.850> anyway

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
in half in this gameplay not yet anyway

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.260 
in half in this gameplay not yet anyway
and<00:01:48.450> then<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.590> around<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.460> down<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and then you go around here down to the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.240 
and then you go around here down to the
bus<00:01:51.479> depot<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.530> brilliant

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
bus depot and it's brilliant

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
bus depot and it's brilliant
see<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> bus<00:01:53.790> depot<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.299> no<00:01:54.450> fog<00:01:54.750> around<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
see a bus depot with no fog around it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
see a bus depot with no fog around it
it's<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.829> pretty<00:01:56.189> cool<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.299> should

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it's just pretty cool they really should

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's just pretty cool they really should
think<00:01:57.780> about<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.290> black<00:01:58.560> ops<00:01:58.770> 3<00:01:58.860> doing<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.729> no

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
think about for black ops 3 doing a no

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.480 
think about for black ops 3 doing a no
fog<00:02:00.329> transit<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.320> who<00:02:01.890> would<00:02:02.159> not<00:02:02.340> want

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
fog transit because who would not want

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.130 
fog transit because who would not want
to<00:02:02.579> play<00:02:02.729> transit<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.329> no<00:02:03.450> fog<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.869> mean<00:02:04.020> look

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
to play transit with no fog I mean look

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.620 
to play transit with no fog I mean look
at<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.619> much<00:02:05.340> better<00:02:05.579> than<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> one

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
at this it's much better than the one

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.320 
at this it's much better than the one
with<00:02:06.780> fog<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.320> mean<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.179> pretty

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
with fog I mean this it this is pretty

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.809 
with fog I mean this it this is pretty
good<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.200> everything<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
good you can see everything and the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.500 
good you can see everything and the
colors<00:02:12.180> even<00:02:12.480> work<00:02:12.750> better

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
colors even work better

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.050 
colors even work better
about<00:02:13.750> Foulke<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.799> pretty<00:02:15.159> cool<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.610> mean

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
about Foulke so it's pretty cool I mean

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.220 
about Foulke so it's pretty cool I mean
now<00:02:16.180> you're<00:02:16.299> going<00:02:16.510> through<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.780> tunnel<00:02:17.080> and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
now you're going through a tunnel and

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.100 
now you're going through a tunnel and
you<00:02:17.409> would<00:02:17.620> part<00:02:18.040> well<00:02:18.489> there<00:02:18.909> is<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> part<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
you would part well there is a part of a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110 
you would part well there is a part of a
jet<00:02:20.680> engine<00:02:20.829> down<00:02:21.220> here<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.790> find

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
jet engine down here so you can find

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.399 
jet engine down here so you can find
that<00:02:22.180> as<00:02:22.299> well<00:02:22.480> just<00:02:22.959> remember<00:02:23.230> when<00:02:23.319> you're

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
that as well just remember when you're

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.470 
that as well just remember when you're
in<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.590> bus<00:02:23.799> don't<00:02:24.159> get<00:02:24.370> hit<00:02:24.549> by<00:02:24.579> that<00:02:24.879> sign<00:02:25.150> and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
in a bus don't get hit by that sign and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.140 
in a bus don't get hit by that sign and
try<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.409> to<00:02:26.500> get<00:02:26.590> hit<00:02:26.829> by<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.129> pole<00:02:27.370> because

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
try not to get hit by that pole because

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.750 
try not to get hit by that pole because
you<00:02:28.629> fall<00:02:28.900> off<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.340> sometimes<00:02:30.340> there's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
you fall off and sometimes there's

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.100 
you fall off and sometimes there's
always<00:02:30.970> different<00:02:31.329> parts<00:02:31.750> here

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
always different parts here

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.199 
always different parts here
I<00:02:32.140> didn't<00:02:32.560> realize<00:02:32.829> but<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.519> actual<00:02:34.000> tunnel

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
I didn't realize but this actual tunnel

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.210 
I didn't realize but this actual tunnel
there<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.720> bomb<00:02:35.019> shelter<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.500> here<00:02:35.799> you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
there is a bomb shelter in here you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.550 
there is a bomb shelter in here you
can't<00:02:36.459> use<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.909> but<00:02:37.090> yeah<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.379> where

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
can't use it but yeah so this is where

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.349 
can't use it but yeah so this is where
that<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.799> bust<00:02:39.069> turned<00:02:39.609> off<00:02:39.819> when<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.150> says

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359

I've moved it to some other location
you<00:02:51.819> know<00:02:51.879> promise<00:02:52.150> with<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.540> map<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:52.959> that

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
you know promise with this map but that

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.800 
you know promise with this map but that
you<00:02:53.170> cannot<00:02:53.530> walk<00:02:54.340> around<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.970> when<00:02:55.659> you're

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
you cannot walk around it when you're

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.330 
you cannot walk around it when you're
playing<00:02:55.840> because<00:02:56.139> there<00:02:56.379> is<00:02:56.470> lava<00:02:56.739> pools<00:02:57.129> each

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
burned there's a little shortcut to get

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.509 
burned there's a little shortcut to get
to<00:03:01.629> town<00:03:02.019> if<00:03:02.319> you're<00:03:02.799> wondering<00:03:03.190> where<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.400> is

you're gonna try and walk across it I
would<00:03:21.040> suggest<00:03:21.609> having<00:03:21.970> juggernaut<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:22.810> you

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
would suggest having juggernaut so you

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.750 
would suggest having juggernaut so you
can<00:03:23.049> actually<00:03:23.169> get<00:03:23.440> across<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.160> then<00:03:24.549> for<00:03:24.730> our

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
can actually get across and then for our

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.849 
can actually get across and then for our
