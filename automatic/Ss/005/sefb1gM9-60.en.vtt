00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.280 
was it just you had the time to reflect
so<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.270> thought<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:14.020> are<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.170> little

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290

so you thought what are the little
things<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:14.860> can<00:02:15.040> update<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.720> had<00:02:17.010> we

talk about things and one of them

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.890 
talk about things and one of them
definitely<00:02:29.680> was<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.250> menu<00:02:30.700> design<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.720> we

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
definitely was the menu design that we

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.610 
definitely was the menu design that we
went<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.230> every<00:02:32.500> single<00:02:33.459> table<00:02:34.620> particularly

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
went to every single table particularly

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.460 
went to every single table particularly
upstairs<00:02:36.070> in<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> cat<00:02:36.580> set<00:02:36.820> all<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:38.080> people

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
upstairs in the cat set all the people

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.880 
upstairs in the cat set all the people
the<00:02:38.950> host<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.790> bussers<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.989> Baylor's<00:02:41.380> we

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
the host the bussers the Baylor's we

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.350 
the host the bussers the Baylor's we
looked<00:02:42.190> at<00:02:42.310> each<00:02:42.489> table<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.260> said<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.800> this

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
looked at each table and said is this

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.330 
looked at each table and said is this
really<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:47.080> way<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:47.620> want<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.160> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
really the way that we want to have it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.840 
really the way that we want to have it
be

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
be

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.920 
be
should<00:02:50.510> me<00:02:51.340> make<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.610> table<00:02:53.000> for<00:02:53.360> three<00:02:53.390> or

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
should me make this a table for three or

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.080 
should me make this a table for three or
should<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.319> keep<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.830> table<00:02:55.220> for<00:02:55.400> two

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
should we keep it a table for two

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.160 
should we keep it a table for two
and<00:02:56.240> I<00:02:57.080> think<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.620> came<00:02:57.920> up<00:02:58.250> with<00:02:58.760> ideas<00:02:59.390> that

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
and I think we came up with ideas that

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.640 
and I think we came up with ideas that
none<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.650> us<00:03:01.120> would<00:03:02.120> have<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.200> it

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
none of us would have in that and it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.030 
none of us would have in that and it
really<00:03:04.310> brought<00:03:05.000> us<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.870> place<00:03:06.319> of<00:03:06.650> making

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
really brought us to a place of making

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.860 
really brought us to a place of making
benches<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.880> putting<00:03:08.300> people<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.750> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
benches and putting people in the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.760 
benches and putting people in the
corners

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770
