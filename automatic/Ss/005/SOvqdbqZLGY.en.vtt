00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
circle of this CD so that we can put at

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.650 
circle of this CD so that we can put at
the<00:01:36.180> top<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.460> water<00:01:38.460> bottle<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:39.420> nozzle

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
the top of that water bottle the nozzle

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.700 
the top of that water bottle the nozzle
on<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:41.510> now<00:01:42.510> once<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:42.990> enough<00:01:43.230> hot<00:01:43.470> glue

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
on here now once you get enough hot glue

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.540 
on here now once you get enough hot glue
just<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.090> let's<00:01:46.080> see<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:47.070> I'll<00:01:47.340> go

just like that let's see now I'll go
start<00:01:48.530> sticking<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.770> putting<00:01:50.070> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
start sticking and putting this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.690 
start sticking and putting this
attaching<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.780> nozzle<00:01:52.230> right<00:01:52.440> onto<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.490> city

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700

and you want to hold it down for a
couple<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.380> seconds<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.990> these<00:01:57.990> sticks

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
couple of seconds just so these sticks

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.190 
couple of seconds just so these sticks

next<00:02:58.860> step<00:02:59.099> we're<00:02:59.610> going<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.760> take<00:02:59.939> this<00:03:00.150> road

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
next step we're going to take this road

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.960 
next step we're going to take this road
and<00:03:01.280> we<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.730> put<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.209> right<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
and we are going to put it right on the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.509 
and we are going to put it right on the
top<00:03:06.329> of<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:08.120> nozzle<00:03:10.099> you<00:03:11.099> want<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> make<00:03:11.489> sure

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
top of this nozzle you want to make sure

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.309 
top of this nozzle you want to make sure
it's<00:03:11.790> stretched<00:03:12.150> out<00:03:12.420> quite<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> bit<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.290> that

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
it's stretched out quite a bit so that

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.349 
it's stretched out quite a bit so that
we<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.709> let<00:03:13.860> some<00:03:14.099> air<00:03:14.340> that's<00:03:15.030> through<00:03:15.390> it

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
we can let some air that's through it

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.929 
we can let some air that's through it
and<00:03:18.359> we're<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.349> going<00:03:19.439> to<00:03:19.590> put<00:03:19.859> just<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.760> make

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:20.939 
and we're just going to put just to make

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.789 
and we're just going to put just to make
sure<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.269> none<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.690> air<00:03:21.810> escape<00:03:22.620> from

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
sure that none of the air escape from

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.780 
sure that none of the air escape from
the<00:03:22.950> bottom<00:03:23.250> where<00:03:23.310> he's<00:03:23.459> going<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.640> put<00:03:23.760> a

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the bottom where he's going to put a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.369 
the bottom where he's going to put a
little<00:03:24.060> bit<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.359> tape<00:03:25.579> around<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:31.200> wait

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
little bit of tape around it but wait

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.710 
little bit of tape around it but wait
here<00:03:31.560> hold<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:32.069> just<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.430> second<00:03:32.760> how<00:03:33.239> does<00:03:33.599> this

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
here hold on just a second how does this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.180 
here hold on just a second how does this
work<00:03:33.959> I'm<00:03:34.230> really<00:03:34.560> not<00:03:34.739> going<00:03:34.889> this<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.159> going

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
work I'm really not going this is going

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.589 
work I'm really not going this is going
to<00:03:35.370> work<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.819> all<00:03:36.180> right<00:03:36.329> what<00:03:36.480> you

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
to work like this all right what you

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.030 
to work like this all right what you
gave<00:03:36.750> your<00:03:36.959> home<00:03:37.079> number<00:03:37.379> craft<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:37.769> once<00:03:37.950> you

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
gave your home number craft so once you

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.649 
gave your home number craft so once you
follow<00:03:38.190> my<00:03:38.430> lead<00:03:38.609> now<00:03:39.090> I'm<00:03:39.150> going<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.359> blow<00:03:39.450> air

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
follow my lead now I'm going to blow air

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:50.509 
follow my lead now I'm going to blow air
into<00:03:39.810> this<00:03:39.989> ability<00:03:48.079> now<00:03:49.340> essentially<00:03:50.340> what<00:03:50.489> i

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
into this ability now essentially what i

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.210 
into this ability now essentially what i
just<00:03:50.609> did<00:03:50.909> is<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.299> twat<00:03:51.540> along<00:03:51.870> here<00:03:52.139> i'm<00:03:52.829> also

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
just did is a twat along here i'm also

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.460 
just did is a twat along here i'm also
building<00:03:53.760> up<00:03:53.910> pressure<00:03:54.150> now<00:03:54.900> there's<00:03:55.260> all

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
building up pressure now there's all

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.319 
building up pressure now there's all
this<00:03:55.680> pressure<00:03:55.889> in<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.310> balloon<00:03:56.699> so<00:03:57.150> when<00:03:57.299> I

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
this pressure in this balloon so when I

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.470 
this pressure in this balloon so when I
let<00:03:57.660> go<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.560> pressure<00:03:58.859> air<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.879> actually

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
let go the pressure air is actually

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.449 
let go the pressure air is actually
coming<00:04:00.780> down<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:01.470> creates<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.859> cushion

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
coming down that it creates a cushion

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.240 
coming down that it creates a cushion
under<00:04:03.120> that's<00:04:03.329> ed<00:04:03.540> allowing<00:04:04.349> it<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.470> cover

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
under that's ed allowing it to cover

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.730 
under that's ed allowing it to cover
just<00:04:05.900> like<00:04:06.900> that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
just like that

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.040 
just like that
is<00:04:08.520> really<00:04:08.850> cool<00:04:09.000> now<00:04:09.480> if<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:09.690> want<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.900> see

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
is really cool now if you want to see

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.320 
is really cool now if you want to see
more<00:04:10.260> cool<00:04:10.470> stuff<00:04:10.680> Alex<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.700> have<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> lot<00:04:12.300> of

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
more cool stuff Alex we have a lot of

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.480 
more cool stuff Alex we have a lot of
cool<00:04:12.750> experiment<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.440> back<00:04:13.650> inside<00:04:14.010> tech<00:04:14.280> so

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
cool experiment to back inside tech so

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.040 
cool experiment to back inside tech so
if<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:14.820> guys<00:04:15.000> actually<00:04:15.300> want<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.750> come<00:04:15.930> and
