00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.460
 Russian customers how many of 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.960
 faults do not give up 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.809
 so we have about sixty planes 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.769
 have already sold in this region of 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.269
 world I do not know how to tell you this is 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.609
 rather agents of the sq on it has sold 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.840
 here here the Russian market is 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.429
 mainly a market of the future 9 you 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.650
 tell something dull at the end of 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.279
 account it's exquisite is used by the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.370
 president intervention detachment 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.370
 from Russia 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.400
 yes no the Russian authorities have bought 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.400
 falcons I think they are very 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.660
 satisfied with their planes 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.650
 I do not comment 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.540
 particular since they are to make 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.540
 comments if we live we do not comment 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.390
 never use our our 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.160
 customers in the last year you have 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.030
 won the call for tenders 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.150
 exceptional 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.040
 in handball - the contract is not signed 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.470
 until now 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.390
 how do you think is what the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.120
 Indian Ministry of Defense 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.730
 to successfully conclude this agreement before 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.680
 presidential the Russians know 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.200
 well Russians know India well 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.899
 so what we share 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:27.939
 the Russian market for 50 years this is a 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:30.619
 big contract that prepares for success 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.630
 bursting at the hand of something 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.100
 important for us but the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.350
 negotiations started a year ago 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.549
 they continue they are active 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.899
 I am confident after the elections this 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.429
 will be the sphere of the Indians to know 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.530
 when does he want to put it in 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.060
 force the contract so I have no 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.039
 comment we'll see next year 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.479
 the total value of this program not that 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.679
 it's confidential, it's necessary 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.470
 ask the Indian government is this 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.539
 that's true it's a lot more than 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.929
 we have to confirm or refute 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:10.989
 Information sabers an hour 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:14.239
 unrolled from raffhael count to 6000 euros 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.150
 not an hour of our no it's not true 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.819
 an hour of 1:02 burst it costs little 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.560
 almost 13 thousand euros but the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.109
 the question is how much does it cost 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.999
 an hour of saab 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:30.569
 how do you see the future of the fighting 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:34.200
 6th generation will be uninhabited 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.819
 without pino troops the t1 option then we 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.819
 first we do not really like this 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.760
 categorization generations because 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.709
 you know you do not call Americans 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.769
 riparian and here we are then I know 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.659
 not if it 's copy russia I do not 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.030
 know nothing but we do not copy on the 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.879
 americans that's for sure so we did 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.579
 the burst which is a versatile aircraft a 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.739
 aircraft that meets the needs 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.659
 of all the French forces it's up to 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.280
 say the Air Force and the Navy by 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.560
 burst will stay in service for at 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.739
 at least 30 35 years of time so I that 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.239
 we are preparing it's rather in the 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.269
 domain of drones in the field of 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.790
 unmanned combat aircraft and so 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.420
 we did a plane demonstrator from 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.490
 fight whose pilot that 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.470
 that we called the neuron so 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.880
 how will it be used in relation to 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.920
 fighter planes fly me I think 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.099
 that the fighter planes will remain 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.860
 pilot on board with pilots but he 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.390
 will be a mixed use three 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.340
 fighter pilot and aircraft 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.200
 fight fly on the ground it will be a mix 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.239
 of the two I do not know in which 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.830
 proportion will see this is the future that 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.489
 will say so but we are preparing for 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.489
 level of technology
