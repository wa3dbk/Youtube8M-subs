sits<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:15.000> what's<00:01:15.299> known<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
sits on is the the what's known as the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.630 
sits on is the the what's known as the
engine<00:01:16.229> brake<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.040> effectively<00:01:17.520> like

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
engine brake so this is effectively like

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120 
engine brake so this is effectively like
a<00:01:18.030> big<00:01:18.479> water<00:01:18.750> pump<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> power<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
pump and that's all measured and fed

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.080

back<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> computers<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.790> look<00:01:26.939> at

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
back to the computers so if we look at

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
back to the computers so if we look at
the<00:01:27.180> engine<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.680> largely

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the engine and it and it's largely

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
the engine and it and it's largely
simulated<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> car<00:01:30.689> with

one<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> critical<00:01:33.630> factors<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:34.140> these

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
one of the critical factors is these

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
one of the critical factors is these
little<00:01:35.009> things<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.369> these<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.880> lambda

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
little things here these are lambda

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.510 
little things here these are lambda
sniffers<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.229> they're<00:01:37.380> sniffing<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> air<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
sniffers so they're sniffing the air and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.390 
sniffers so they're sniffing the air and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.280 
inside there can monitor and adjust that
to<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> tuned<00:01:44.729> ability<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.930> engine

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
to get the tuned ability of the engine

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.450 
to get the tuned ability of the engine
exactly<00:01:47.040> right

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
exactly right

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
exactly right
over<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.030> side<00:01:48.090> we've<00:01:48.540> got<00:01:48.570> exhaust<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.409> of

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
over this side we've got exhaust one of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.569 
over this side we've got exhaust one of
the<00:01:49.560> things<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> engine<00:01:50.100> dyno<00:01:50.280> will<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the things the engine dyno will be

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.069 
the things the engine dyno will be
useful<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.119> trying<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:51.570> different<00:01:51.869> exhaust

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
useful be trying all different exhaust

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
useful be trying all different exhaust
configurations<00:01:53.060> we've<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> whole<00:01:54.390> car

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
configurations we've got the whole car

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.020 
configurations we've got the whole car
exhaust<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> back<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.549> but

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
exhaust and out the back there but but

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
exhaust and out the back there but but
so<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.899> running<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.320> engines<00:01:58.649> obviously

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
so it's for running in engines obviously

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.959 
so it's for running in engines obviously
before<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.520> them<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> race<00:01:59.939> car

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
before you put them in the race car

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.120 
before you put them in the race car
shooting<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> engines<00:02:01.380> trying<00:02:01.770> different

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
shooting the engines trying different

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.880 
shooting the engines trying different
engine<00:02:02.759> components<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.600> very<00:02:04.110> scientific

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
engine components all very scientific

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.410 
engine components all very scientific
beautifully<00:02:05.610> done<00:02:05.729> beautifully<00:02:06.240> made

beautifully done beautifully made
beautifully<00:02:06.600> engineered<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.950> Pete<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.520> might

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
beautifully engineered so Pete we might

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.759 
beautifully engineered so Pete we might
start<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.599> an<00:02:09.720> engine<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.170> give<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> run

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.080 

okay<00:02:14.769> so<00:02:14.830> peeps<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.459> started<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.879> engine

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
okay so peeps just started the engine

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.339 
okay so peeps just started the engine
there<00:02:16.209> what<00:02:16.360> we're<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.629> ask<00:02:16.780> Pete<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.200> do

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
there what we're going to ask Pete to do

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.069 
there what we're going to ask Pete to do
is<00:02:17.560> what<00:02:17.739> we<00:02:17.860> call<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.099> full<00:02:18.459> power<00:02:18.879> run<00:02:19.239> if<00:02:20.019> we

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
is what we call a full power run if we

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.179 
is what we call a full power run if we
look<00:02:20.319> at<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.530> instruments<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:20.980> he's

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
look at the instruments that he's

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.490 
look at the instruments that he's
looking<00:02:21.340> at<00:02:21.640> these<00:02:22.390> are<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.659> lamda<00:02:23.110> sniffers

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
looking at these are the lamda sniffers

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.990 
looking at these are the lamda sniffers
those<00:02:23.890> little<00:02:24.129> sniffers<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.579> exhaust<00:02:24.849> I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
those little sniffers in the exhaust I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.220 
those little sniffers in the exhaust I
was<00:02:25.090> telling<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.420> about<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.870> that's<00:02:26.019> what

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
was telling you about so that's what

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.050 
was telling you about so that's what
they're<00:02:26.379> monitoring<00:02:26.829> and<00:02:26.980> changing<00:02:27.430> here's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
they're monitoring and changing here's

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.240 
they're monitoring and changing here's
our<00:02:28.269> power<00:02:28.599> output<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.379> here's<00:02:29.799> our<00:02:29.950> torque

that<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.409> v8<00:02:32.650> supercar<00:02:33.129> engine<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.610> racecar

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
that a v8 supercar engine in the racecar

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.030 
that a v8 supercar engine in the racecar
is<00:02:34.329> allowed<00:02:34.989> only<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.409> go<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.560> seven<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
is allowed only to go to seven and a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.369 
is allowed only to go to seven and a
half<00:02:36.159> thousand<00:02:36.640> rpm<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.780> that's<00:02:37.989> what<00:02:38.170> people

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
half thousand rpm so that's what people

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.050 
half thousand rpm so that's what people
be<00:02:38.650> tuning<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.129> engine<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:39.879> let's

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
be tuning this engine up to so let's

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.330 
be tuning this engine up to so let's
just<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.329> look<00:02:40.450> bet<00:02:40.659> let's<00:02:41.040> let's<00:02:42.040> give<00:02:42.220> it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
just have a look bet let's let's give it

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:51.230 
just have a look bet let's let's give it
some

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.120 

that<00:02:51.630> thing<00:02:51.870> sing<00:02:52.140> there<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:52.530> go<00:02:52.650> four<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
that thing sing there we go four and a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.250 
that thing sing there we go four and a
half<00:02:53.160> five<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.700> half

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
half five and half

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.539 
half five and half
6,000<00:02:56.260> eyetality<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.830> thing<00:02:57.010> sounds<00:02:57.340> like

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
6,000 eyetality that thing sounds like

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.809 
6,000 eyetality that thing sounds like
it's<00:02:57.849> going<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.090> explode

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.540 

they<00:03:01.390> are<00:03:01.480> output<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:01.959> we<00:03:02.050> saw<00:03:02.200> about<00:03:02.349> 611<00:03:03.010> 612

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
they are output so we saw about 611 612

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.949 
they are output so we saw about 611 612
horsepower<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.300> particular<00:03:04.569> engine

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
horsepower on that particular engine

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.539 
horsepower on that particular engine
remember<00:03:05.200> they're<00:03:05.500> running<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.890> control

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549
