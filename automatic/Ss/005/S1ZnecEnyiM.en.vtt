00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.560
 chess game on this occasion os 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.570
 I present the mate of anastasia a mate 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.210
 popularly known by the name of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.700
 anastasia and the characteristic position 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 of this mate is what we are seeing in 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.170
 the board is a matte that is produced 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 usually with sacrifices in the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.769
 h7 box where right now is the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.439
 king and it's a mate that occurs when 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.810
 the rocker is given posts so the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.870
 Black side has castled short and side 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.030
 white has castled long or vice versa 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 ok and as I said, it's in the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.960
 characteristic position where a horse 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:48.690
 since the 7th is covering the exit of the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.500
 box g6 g8 is worth and a tower of this one 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 open column you end up giving in the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.329
 mate checkmate the black king I'm going to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 put now a couple of positions for 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.070
 to practice with this mate that you 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.080
 can save many games and we have 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.149
 to have it well present a 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 position we have already placed and in 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.799
 This position has to move to the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 blacks have a mate in four thanks 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.200
 to the mate of anastasia you can look at 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 solve it is very simple knowing 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.270
 the reference position that I have 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.770
 explained then very simple well then the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.020
 solution is very simple horse is 7 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.609
 check king 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.829
 h 8 and although the black threat in a mate 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.659
 here is of no use to you because we have the 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.899
 anastasia mate by the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:45.990
 white with a sacrifice of da 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:51.430
 commanded by h 7 check king for h 7 and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:57.130
 tower h 1 checkmate good 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:59.890
 to the h3 film and tower for h 3 checkmate 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.050
 well I tell you the position of this 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.180
 position is worth a moment 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.000
 although we had already done it because 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.000
 I tell you if someone needs it 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.650
 the worst in white are in adobe 2 efe 3 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.460
 the black pawns are in f 7 g7 h7 the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.850
 white piece are in lady c 2 tower 1 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:31.010
 horse of 5 and the black piece are lady 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.530
 to 8 bishops 6 tower f 8 king g 8 good and 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.090
 mate, as I said, it is 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:44.330
 horse 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:49.490
 is 7-8 they gave by h7 check king by h 7 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.710
 tower h 1 checkmate because the king 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.400
 in these two boxes it is controlled by 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.610
 horse the pawn fell down or is the box 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.750
 g6 g8 is controlled by the horse and is a 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.200
 checkmate 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.240
 after bishop to h3 tower for h 3 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.460
 Checkmate is well worth we put the 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.080
 next position well we have the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.030
 next position the white pawns 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:18.890
 are 2 of 2 c 4 efe 2 g 2 h 2 the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.730
 black pawns are in a 7 b 6 c 7 of 7 a 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.290
 6 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:29.480
 the white piece are in towers at 1 f1 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:32.870
 3 bishop knight c 5 queen g 6 king g 1 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.770
 and the black piece is bishop of 7 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:42.610
 horse of 4 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:46.900
 towers h 7 h 8 forgiveness tower to 8 h 8 lady 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.780
 F 6 king is 7 in this position touches them 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.830
 move the blacks we see that for a 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.300
 part seems to be about to lose 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.310
 the lady because by ray x the bishop is 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.550
 pointing to the range and the lady does not 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.570
 can go anywhere and in the next 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.020
 play lose the lady but the black 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.380
 They have the tactical resource mate 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.510
 anastasia and that's why he not only loses it in 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.280
 the range but they give the game then 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.430
 as we have already done several examples 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.340
 I suppose this position is going to turn out 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.000
 very easy to solve it well because the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.270
 correct play black would be the horse 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.810
 of 2 check as we have seen how it 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.330
 produces this mate king h1 and now 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.689
 black tower sacrifice 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.729
 tower for h 2 we see that these two 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:46.599
 squares are cut by action 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.509
 of the horse or the box g 3 and g 1 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:53.289
 the king has no choice but to king 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:57.939
 for h 2 and now the other tower would enter 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.860
 Check for the moment White does not 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.860
 it would be more remedy than to cover itself with the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.780
 lady is worth now it is white women who 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.020
 they're going to lose their lady because tower comes 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.020
 by 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.460
 I was the tower and flew already with in this 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.460
 departure 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.530
 with this game are two towers that have 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.180
 flown good as I said tower by 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.520
 6 check and now evidently at 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:30.210
 white are left with more than I say tower 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.100
 sorry to fib for h 6 and not just a one 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:37.980
 lost nothing but the lady in the 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:40.770
 to finish with lady h4 checkmate 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.350
 this time the mate of anastasia because he has 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.750
 starred the good lady friends then 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.000
