00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.620
 hi how is it all techno jacks 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.780
 well I want to have some 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.850
 alternatives to whatsapp because as 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.740
 will know from today if I do not 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.559
 WhatsApp is going to start doing 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.410
 a payment application this already stops 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.820
 to be a rumor is true I'm totally 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.220
 talking about the people of ihobe those 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.990
 users of gods in people by 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.360
 example that they have an android was already 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.220
 payment Ã¡vila whatsapp and free to 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.470
 download it but you have to pay for 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.899
 use it per year you have to pay an amount 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.850
 than less than a dollar but that's 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.460
 for people who want to get down now 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.170
 the whatsapp in the app store for example 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.760
 it is free if you are going to look for it 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.530
 whatsapp but you have to pay for it 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.920
 before, there was no need to pay for it now 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 Yes luckily this is for people 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.569
 new on whatsapp for old people 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.760
 like for example I do not have to pay 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:55.129
 for using whatsapp because I in his 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.139
 moment I took it down when still the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.789
 service was free is that it was in 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:00.769
 reality the other way around had to pay for the 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.299
 application but not for the service what 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.129
 what good is not to make a quilombo 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.530
 really this but hey it's basically 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.360
 so they will see that when they lower it to 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.470
 whatsapp the one that you want to activate now 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.330
 whatsapp is going to be able to 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.920
 it's free and for a year it's going to be 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.890
 use it but the second year is going to have 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.080
 to pay yes or yes to know if this is 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.060
 really is true and if you the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.120
 have for life for example the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.810
 application if you are not going to whatsapp 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.350
 and they go to settings 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.700
 mana account 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.399
 Payment information 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.560
 and there he will say service and if he says how 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.969
 says in my life good case 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.840
 means that I will never have 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.630
 to pay per year to use it like this 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.530
 go there, see what it says 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.369
 but this because I at the time 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.840
 I worked when the application still 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.759
 had the service totally free 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.020
 but good people who love her 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.079
 start using now will be 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.929
 restricted so we have some 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.000
 alternatives usually prove two that I 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.700
 they seemed the most complete and apart 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.549
 that the application as well as the service 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.540
 they are free and apart they are quite 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.430
 massive one is line and the other is widget 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.200
 that apart are very very similar between 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.769
 they have practically the same 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.360
 functionalities also clarified that these 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.340
 two applications that I am showing no 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.420
 they're just there to help each other 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.640
 I'm showing but they are 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.349
 multiplatforms are in all 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.450
 operating systems that what has 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.480
 good so I'm showing these two 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.319
 applications of these two alternatives 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.499
 we have 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.129
 and well, really, there's not much that 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:41.659
 they are very easy, there is no good 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.150
 connect to them you have to enter 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.489
 a user will send us by message 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.349
 text a code which we enter in 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.870
 the application and there is just going to 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.549
 activate the application and then good 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.069
 obviously you will find 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.200
 automatically the people who already 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.760
 are using this application for her 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.669
 I immediately started talking to them 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.200
 then well we already have chat obviously 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:05.240
 for example if I go to a person 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.540
 anyone 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.719
 some user 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.359
 we can go to this button that is here and 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.799
 we can make free calls 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.290
 really this is one of the things that 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.719
 more I like the line we can call 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.970
 totally free obviously for wifi 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:25.120
 It can be connected 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.370
 send them good photos all kinds of things 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.180
 all totally free really very 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.020
 very good that and then we have 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.340
 u and chat 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.130
 that they also have some things 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.100
 quite interesting one of them is 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.420
 that we can dictate we can send 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.370
 dictated or we can send messages 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.770
 but in audio it seemed pretty 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.170
 interesting that we can do 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.660
 video calls a kind of facetime 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.820
 for example an ibex we can do 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.710
 calls and well you're practically is 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.480
 same with those little differences that 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.770
 we can serve the calls we can 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.100
 send photos 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.630
 obviously messages all kinds of 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.330
 options we can connect it little in 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.880
 facebook is from widget we have here one 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.280
 what they call moments really 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.950
 we have a few very very options 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.360
 interesting that also make it 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.410
 a social application practically 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.060
 both this and online has its part 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.820
 as a social one can not share 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.780
 things with your contacts 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.760
 it really is very easy to use there is no 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.490
 Much more to say about them are very 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.560
 simple one adds to your contacts what 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.510
 you can add here on this button and the 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.760
 you can add by and of one in your profile 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.070
 you can put your life like this one can 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.770
 just look for a person for his 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.259
 lifetime 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.490
 exactly putting the same idea by 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.580
 QR code 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.789
 I can generate a QR code and then 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.919
 with my device I'll beat the code 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.050
 qr from another device and there add it 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.900
 automatically to that contact 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.449
 it really is very very simple to use 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.520
 these two are practically the same and what 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.229
 good of all they are free as well as not 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.819
 I leave those two alternatives to 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.440
 whatsapp since good now is going to start 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.210
 to do a little more limited by the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.699
 whatsapp especially for the new ones 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.740
 users so well I hope that you 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.900
 have served and well you know they can 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.030
 in the comments out there put if 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.800
 you use other alternatives than for 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.840
 They are also very interesting and very 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.669
 good and that even because they have more 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.580
 good things in the comments can 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.810
 put them in order to know them well 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.449
 I put these two that I thought was pretty 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.580
 interesting and obviously already know about 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.280
 follow me on the social networks of 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.009
 subscribe to the channel vote the video 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.969
 positive so good we're 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.969
 Seeing you later
