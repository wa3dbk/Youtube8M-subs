00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 outside it's cold a lot cold you see the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.940
 breath of people breathing 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.660
 while they walk wrapped in coats and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.519
 scarves and hands in pockets 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.279
 maybe the crests of the mountains are 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 covered with ice snow but there are 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 people who have their hearts warm and not 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.560
 it matters the cold of the streets people 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.740
 that have a heart to live people 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.679
 happy and who knows how to love who knows how to convert 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 all the hard things of life in something 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.790
 good something positive have hope 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.850
 trust in God they love their neighbor and they 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.239
 they strive to maintain a climate of peace and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.940
 heat in their homes at work but 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.820
 How hard it must be to make out there 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.989
 cold and the heart is frozen 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 made cold ice on the outside and cold on 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.710
 inside ice is the hopelessness left 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.769
 start every day the remains of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.310
 trust to which one grabs for 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.850
 keep living 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.890
 ice is the rancor and hatred that goes 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.579
 rotting little by little so 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.820
 irremediable so many hearts that the 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.780
 ice so hard is the fear of life at 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.520
 future to old age or disease to 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.020
 loneliness to not recognize you 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.299
 we need the sun to come up inside 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.689
 ourselves the sun of hope 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.329
 of love of peace optimism 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.450
 inside we have to strive to 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.670
 ourselves and first of all 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.209
 force us to believe that the sun can 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.700
 get out in our life a long time ago I bought 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:52.140
 a bottle of ice cream and how I did not eat it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.939
 everything I decided to keep it in the freezer 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.939
 for several days I was thinking about 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.000
 eat it but then I forgot it and what 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.830
 I kept saving for the other day 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.610
 finally it was time to 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.670
 eat it but to my surprise and my side 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.070
 it was totally frozen to such an extent 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.240
 that not even a knife could 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.030
 penetrate what 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.870
 I could hardly believe that in so little 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.600
 time would have hardened so much 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.630
 I had to wait more than 20 minutes 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.670
 to start eating what happened 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.460
 to my ice cream made me think of the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.310
 people who get mad at god with the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.160
 life with your friends and family that 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.550
 they lose hope and their hearts and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.410
 their lives are frozen are people who 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.890
 they have not known how to face the difficulties 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.150
 and difficult situations that say phrases 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.030
 how will one day forgive them but what 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.940
 they really do is put their hearts 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.760
 in the freezer as time goes by 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.430
 their hearts become more and more 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.460
 hard workers can not forgive those who 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.460
 some time they were offended they fail 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.330
 approach God and comfort in his 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:14.500
 love and his mercy and every day he 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.860
 they move further and every day it becomes all the more 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500
 hard 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.610
 if you feel like this remember what you 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.590
 happened to my ice cream do not wait long 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.830
 encourage yourself now to soften your heart 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.380
 surrounding the love and hope 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.860
 pardoning those who defended and everything 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.340
 the rest will come in addition do not leave 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.140
 for tomorrow what you can do today 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.830
 remember that nobody knows when 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.440
 can be called to account the 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.590
 that despair of everything can have many 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.830
 reasons and excuses but also something of 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.739
 guilt because of pain 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.070
 economic hardships are 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.520
 distributed in everyone's life but there 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.280
 is also the mind our mind to 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.360
 look for solutions to problems and ones 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.480
 they use them and others do not 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.870
 there are our hands to work and 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.600
 some give them use and others do not there 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.780
 God that does help those who trust but 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.360
 some pray to that god and others give 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.660
 the back there are the opportunities 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.810
 that offers life but some seek it 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.320
 and others excuse themselves saying that nothing 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.350
 can do 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.620
 the sun of hope can come out and from 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.200
 done comes out in the lives of all 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.500
 who strive to believe in 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.990
 god and in themselves that strive to 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.080
 expect the best to fight to get out 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.710
 forward in spite of everything I can not 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.730
 control the weather outside but if the 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.970
 inside of my spirit the problems what 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.090
 can break one if left but 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.590
 can strengthen it if you face them with 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.590
 magnificent challenges
