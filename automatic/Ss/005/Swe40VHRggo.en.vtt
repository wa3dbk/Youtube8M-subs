00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
pet drop and I was completely

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.810 
pet drop and I was completely
overwhelmed<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.810> point<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.289> had<00:00:22.820> 306

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
overwhelmed at this point I had 306

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.290 
overwhelmed at this point I had 306
Casey<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.359> think<00:00:24.480> 306<00:00:25.289> killcount<00:00:25.760> Iraq<00:00:26.760> saw<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
Casey I think 306 killcount Iraq saw and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.570 
Casey I think 306 killcount Iraq saw and
it<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.869> complete<00:00:28.260> RNG<00:00:28.650> whether<00:00:29.460> you're

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
it is just complete RNG whether you're

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.310 
it is just complete RNG whether you're
gonna<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.000> there's<00:00:30.119> no<00:00:30.240> set<00:00:30.480> drop<00:00:30.990> rate<00:00:31.199> or

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
gonna get it there's no set drop rate or

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.999 
gonna get it there's no set drop rate or
anything<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.650> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
anything like that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
anything like that
it's<00:00:32.279> based<00:00:32.520> actually<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.000> how<00:00:33.210> much<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.570> rage

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it's based actually on how much in rage

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.080 
it's based actually on how much in rage
you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> build<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.710> within<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.160> kill<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you can build up within the kill and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360 
you can build up within the kill and
that<00:00:36.210> increases<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.660> chance<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.370> whether

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
that increases your chance of whether

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.440 
that increases your chance of whether
you're<00:00:38.489> gonna<00:00:38.579> get<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> pet<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.360> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
you're gonna get the pet or not but this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.900 
you're gonna get the pet or not but this

which<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> acidic<00:01:40.380> spider<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.759> order

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
which was the acidic spider and in order

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.010 
which was the acidic spider and in order
to<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> kill<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> rack

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to get this one you have to kill a rack

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.319 
to get this one you have to kill a rack
see<00:01:43.200> after<00:01:43.560> she's<00:01:43.770> absorbed<00:01:44.220> 100%<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
see after she's absorbed 100% of the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
see after she's absorbed 100% of the
acidic<00:01:45.630> spiders<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.320> spawn<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.710> Phase

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
acidic spiders that can spawn in Phase

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.039 
acidic spiders that can spawn in Phase
three<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.509> achieved<00:01:48.600> by<00:01:48.990> killing

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
three so this can be achieved by killing

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.590 
three so this can be achieved by killing
a<00:01:49.409> rack<00:01:49.590> saw<00:01:49.799> without<00:01:50.460> luring<00:01:50.880> any<00:01:51.090> acidic

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
a rack saw without luring any acidic

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
a rack saw without luring any acidic
spiders<00:01:52.020> under<00:01:52.170> him<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.040> cannot<00:01:53.490> be

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
spiders under him this cannot be

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
spiders under him this cannot be
achieved<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.420> take<00:01:54.689> path<00:01:54.990> 2<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.619> have

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
achieved if you take path 2 so you have

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.700 
achieved if you take path 2 so you have
to<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.070> able<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.280> take<00:01:56.520> path<00:01:56.790> 1<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.329> 3<00:01:58.020> whilst

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to be able to take path 1 or 3 whilst

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
to be able to take path 1 or 3 whilst
path<00:01:59.009> 2<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.430> open<00:01:59.790> though<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
path 2 is open though and then you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.910 
path 2 is open though and then you
basically<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.020> leave<00:02:01.290> all<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> green

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
basically just leave all of the green

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.490 
basically just leave all of the green
acidic<00:02:02.310> spiders<00:02:02.729> alive<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.240> phase<00:02:03.479> 3<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> then

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
acidic spiders alive in phase 3 and then

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.530 
acidic spiders alive in phase 3 and then
wait<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:04.979> phase<00:02:05.490> 4<00:02:05.820> until<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.119> rack<00:02:06.270> Sears

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
wait in phase 4 until the rack Sears

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.889 
wait in phase 4 until the rack Sears
hazard<00:02:07.229> has<00:02:07.530> absorbed<00:02:07.860> 100%<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> acid<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
hazard has absorbed 100% of the acid and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.680 
hazard has absorbed 100% of the acid and
then<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.709> kill<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> rack<00:02:11.160> see<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:12.540> be

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
then you can kill a rack see I would be

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.880 
then you can kill a rack see I would be
showing<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.080> footage<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.530> life

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
showing the footage of the life

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.000 
showing the footage of the life
but<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.940> day<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.570> all<00:02:15.900> days<00:02:16.170> my<00:02:16.740> Camtasia

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.890 
but on this day of all days my Camtasia

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
pet was unlocked by defeating a rack

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.770 
pet was unlocked by defeating a rack
saws<00:02:34.710> range<00:02:35.100> form<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.850> then<00:02:36.210> Lana<00:02:36.540> is

unlocked<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.260> quite<00:02:37.470> quite<00:02:38.010> an<00:02:38.100> interesting

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
unlocked in quite quite an interesting

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.640 
unlocked in quite quite an interesting
way<00:02:38.610> actually<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.060> need<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.420> make<00:02:40.260> sure<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
way actually you need to make sure a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.160 
way actually you need to make sure a
rack<00:02:40.860> saw<00:02:41.040> heals<00:02:41.310> up<00:02:41.520> 160<00:02:42.270> thousand<00:02:43.020> life

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
rack saw heals up 160 thousand life

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.380 
rack saw heals up 160 thousand life
points<00:02:43.200> before<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.310> take<00:02:44.550> down<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.820> rack<00:02:45.150> see

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
points before you take down a rack see

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.150 
points before you take down a rack see
so<00:02:46.020> essentially<00:02:46.470> what<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.770> do<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.130> just

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
so essentially what you do is you just

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.430 
so essentially what you do is you just
skip<00:02:47.550> out<00:02:47.730> phase<00:02:48.000> 1<00:02:48.330> &amp;<00:02:48.510> 2<00:02:48.660> completely<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.410> you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
skip out phase 1 &amp; 2 completely so you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
skip out phase 1 &amp; 2 completely so you
can't<00:02:49.830> damage<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.370> racks<00:02:50.580> or<00:02:50.790> at<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.300> and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
can't damage the racks or at all and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.330 
can't damage the racks or at all and
phase<00:02:51.660> 1<00:02:51.900> &amp;<00:02:52.080> 2<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.709> had<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.010> take<00:02:53.190> my

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
phase 1 &amp; 2 so I had to take my

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
phase 1 &amp; 2 so I had to take my
deflected<00:02:53.850> prayers<00:02:54.120> off<00:02:54.330> site<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> go<00:02:54.780> back

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
deflected prayers off site to go back

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.780 
deflected prayers off site to go back
onto<00:02:55.110> normal<00:02:55.590> prayers<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.130> basically<00:02:56.700> just

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
onto normal prayers I basically just

for me to obtain the pets which were on

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.650 
for me to obtain the pets which were on
my<00:05:02.949> personal<00:05:03.550> list<00:05:03.760> of<00:05:04.000> ones<00:05:04.180> which<00:05:04.300> I<00:05:04.449> would

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
my personal list of ones which I would

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.080 
my personal list of ones which I would
really<00:05:04.930> like<00:05:05.229> to<00:05:05.260> get<00:05:05.620> or<00:05:05.919> general<00:05:06.639> or<00:05:06.789> door

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
really like to get or general or door

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.800 
really like to get or general or door
commando<00:05:07.750> mini<00:05:07.900> Anna<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.500> next<00:05:09.160> Terminator

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
commando mini Anna and next Terminator

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.150 
commando mini Anna and next Terminator
moving<00:05:10.810> on<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.050> then<00:05:11.169> of<00:05:11.260> course<00:05:11.470> Barry<00:05:11.830> and

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
moving on to then of course Barry and

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.010 
moving on to then of course Barry and
Mallory<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.850> would<00:05:13.180> like<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.419> get<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.630> decays

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
Mallory I would like to get the decays

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.040 
Mallory I would like to get the decays
one<00:05:14.289> so<00:05:14.500> Prime<00:05:14.919> Rex<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.580> supreme<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.449> then

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
one so Prime Rex and supreme and then

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.420 
one so Prime Rex and supreme and then
cubed<00:05:17.410> II<00:05:17.470> would<00:05:17.620> be<00:05:17.710> interesting<00:05:18.190> to<00:05:18.280> get

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
cubed II would be interesting to get

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.520 
cubed II would be interesting to get
mostly<00:05:19.090> because<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.449> money<00:05:19.690> making<00:05:20.110> which<00:05:20.380> I

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
mostly because the money making which I

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.050 
mostly because the money making which I
would<00:05:20.710> receive<00:05:21.070> from<00:05:21.370> getting<00:05:21.669> like<00:05:21.850> two

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
would receive from getting like two

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.610 
would receive from getting like two
thousand<00:05:22.570> cubed<00:05:22.870> equals<00:05:23.199> would<00:05:23.410> be

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
thousand cubed equals would be

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.770 
thousand cubed equals would be
absolutely<00:05:24.310> crazy<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:25.240> that's<00:05:25.389> one<00:05:25.570> reason

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
absolutely crazy so that's one reason

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.570 
absolutely crazy so that's one reason
why<00:05:25.990> I've<00:05:26.110> got<00:05:26.260> cubed<00:05:26.590> e<00:05:26.650> on<00:05:26.770> my<00:05:26.949> list<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.400> get

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
why I've got cubed e on my list to get

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.980 
why I've got cubed e on my list to get
and<00:05:27.729> then<00:05:28.180> one<00:05:28.419> which<00:05:28.570> doesn't<00:05:28.900> even

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
and then one which doesn't even

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.840 
and then one which doesn't even
contribute<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.830> let's<00:05:30.010> say<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.280> title<00:05:30.490> of<00:05:30.760> the

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
contribute to let's say the title of the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.879 
contribute to let's say the title of the
insane<00:05:31.150> final<00:05:31.570> boss<00:05:31.750> this<00:05:32.380> one's<00:05:32.620> called<00:05:32.770> the

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
insane final boss this one's called the

little tizzy pet which you can obtain

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.540 
little tizzy pet which you can obtain
from<00:05:34.630> killing<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.289> Beastmaster<00:05:35.919> boss<00:05:36.099> have

from killing the Beastmaster boss have
no<00:05:36.820> idea<00:05:37.150> what<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.389> drop<00:05:37.570> rate<00:05:37.750> is<00:05:37.930> but<00:05:38.380> it'd

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
no idea what the drop rate is but it'd

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.930
