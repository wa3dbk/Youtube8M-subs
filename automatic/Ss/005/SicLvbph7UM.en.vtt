00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
throughout the game hinting at this

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.660 
throughout the game hinting at this
theory<00:02:29.380> firstly<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.650> has<00:02:30.830> shown<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.250> Luigi

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
theory firstly it has shown that Luigi

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.850 
theory firstly it has shown that Luigi
had<00:02:31.850> won<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> house<00:02:32.390> from<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.750> contest<00:02:33.170> which<00:02:33.710> he

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
seen in the Mushroom Kingdom I also

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.050 
seen in the Mushroom Kingdom I also
noticed<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.070> if<00:02:43.160> Luigi<00:02:43.520> tries<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.910> take<00:02:44.030> a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
noticed that if Luigi tries to take a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.970 
noticed that if Luigi tries to take a
selfie<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.570> one<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.900> bathrooms<00:02:45.080> he<00:02:45.860> does

selfie in one of the bathrooms he does

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.710 
selfie in one of the bathrooms he does
not<00:02:46.160> appear<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.730> reflection<00:02:47.300> like<00:02:47.630> he

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
not appear in the reflection like he

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.470 
not appear in the reflection like he
does<00:02:47.900> in<00:02:47.930> other<00:02:48.260> mirrors<00:02:48.710> around<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.160> house

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
does in other mirrors around the house

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.220

why<00:02:50.480> would<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.780> be

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
why would that be

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.470 
why would that be
and<00:02:51.920> whenever<00:02:52.100> Luigi<00:02:52.580> does<00:02:52.850> take<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> picture
