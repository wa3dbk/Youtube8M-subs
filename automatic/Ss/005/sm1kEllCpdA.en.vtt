00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the things I know about right well I

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.990 
the things I know about right well I
mean<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.980> think<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.340> breakthrough<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
mean I think that breakthrough is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.689 
mean I think that breakthrough is
committed<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> families<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
committed to families as well that the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.939 
committed to families as well that the
families<00:01:00.059> are<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.539> involved<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.739> heard

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
families are really involved and I heard

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
families are really involved and I heard
a<00:01:02.039> figure<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.309> 100%<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.539> breakthrough

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
a figure that 100% of breakthrough

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
a figure that 100% of breakthrough
families<00:01:04.350> give<00:01:04.619> back<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> program<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
families give back to the program I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
families give back to the program I
think<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.840> only<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.229> amount<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.470> fun

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
think just not only the amount of fun

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.929 
think just not only the amount of fun
that<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> classroom<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.820> how

that we have in the classroom but how

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.870 
that we have in the classroom but how
serious<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> goals<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
serious we are about the goals that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.130 
serious we are about the goals that
students<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.600> themselves<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
students have for themselves in the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
real sense of purpose that other

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
real sense of purpose that other
programs<00:01:40.049> don't<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.220> way<00:01:41.369> better
