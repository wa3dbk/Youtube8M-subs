have absolutely no idea to play the
violin<00:00:16.010> and<00:00:16.539> at<00:00:17.539> the<00:00:17.630> very<00:00:17.840> beginning<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:20.210> is

violin and at the very beginning this is
the<00:00:20.419> first<00:00:20.509> video<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.200> hopefully<00:00:21.820> in<00:00:22.820> future

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
the first video and hopefully in future

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.689 
the first video and hopefully in future
we're<00:00:23.630> going<00:00:23.810> to<00:00:23.960> be<00:00:24.079> looking<00:00:24.380> at<00:00:24.529> scales<00:00:25.160> and

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
we're going to be looking at scales and

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.720 
we're going to be looking at scales and
very<00:00:25.880> simple<00:00:26.210> songs<00:00:26.590> but<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:28.099> first<00:00:28.369> lesson

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
very simple songs but the first lesson

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.759 
very simple songs but the first lesson
is<00:00:28.820> dedicated<00:00:29.420> to<00:00:29.810> something<00:00:30.500> which<00:00:30.619> is

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
is dedicated to something which is

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.710 
is dedicated to something which is
seemingly<00:00:31.070> simple<00:00:32.410> but<00:00:33.850> is<00:00:34.850> very<00:00:35.030> important

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
seemingly simple but is very important

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.759 
seemingly simple but is very important
and<00:00:35.900> that<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:38.449> bow<00:00:38.720> and<00:00:39.519> why<00:00:40.519> and<00:00:40.910> how<00:00:41.769> to

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
and that is the bow and why and how to

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.360 
and that is the bow and why and how to
put<00:00:43.339> rosin<00:00:44.270> on<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.480> bow<00:00:44.719> now<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:46.039> a

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
put rosin on the bow now this is a

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.740 
put rosin on the bow now this is a
violin<00:00:47.059> bow<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:48.309> as<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:49.430> can<00:00:49.520> see<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:50.180> is

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
violin bow and as you can see it is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.439 
violin bow and as you can see it is
quite<00:00:51.109> loose<00:00:52.180> impossible<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.239> play<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
quite loose impossible to play the

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.260 
quite loose impossible to play the
violin<00:00:53.780> if<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:54.440> loose<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:55.760> what<00:00:55.910> we<00:00:56.030> have<00:00:56.149> to

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
violin if it's loose so what we have to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.770 
violin if it's loose so what we have to
do<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:56.719> to<00:00:57.579> tighten<00:00:59.410> the<00:01:00.410> bow<00:01:01.359> now<00:01:02.359> people<00:01:02.629> say

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
do is to tighten the bow now people say

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.389 
do is to tighten the bow now people say
to<00:01:02.840> me<00:01:02.960> well<00:01:03.260> how<00:01:03.769> do<00:01:03.829> you<00:01:04.009> know<00:01:04.100> when<00:01:04.250> it's

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
to me well how do you know when it's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.460 
to me well how do you know when it's
tight<00:01:04.640> enough<00:01:04.720> if<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:05.810> just<00:01:05.960> put<00:01:06.140> on<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.320> back

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
tight enough if you just put on the back

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.749 
tight enough if you just put on the back
your<00:01:06.649> hand<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.670> bounces<00:01:10.030> then<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:13.399> bow<00:01:13.580> is

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
your hand and it bounces then the bow is

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.900 
your hand and it bounces then the bow is
ready<00:01:13.789> for<00:01:14.119> play<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:19.039> this<00:01:19.490> bow<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:19.880> ready

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
ready for play so and this bow is ready

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.820 
ready for play so and this bow is ready
for<00:01:20.179> playing<00:01:20.420> now<00:01:21.229> a<00:01:22.720> bow<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:24.349> doesn't<00:01:24.709> have

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
for playing now a bow that doesn't have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.880 
for playing now a bow that doesn't have
resin<00:01:25.840> on<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.709> is<00:01:27.920> rosin<00:01:29.619> rosin<00:01:30.619> by

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
resin on it and this is rosin rosin by

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.160 
resin on it and this is rosin rosin by
the<00:01:30.950> way<00:01:31.099> it's<00:01:31.280> just<00:01:31.929> solidified<00:01:32.929> three<00:01:33.830> drums

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
the way it's just solidified three drums

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.740 
the way it's just solidified three drums
and<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:39.039> is<00:01:40.039> very<00:01:40.789> important<00:01:41.360> when<00:01:41.569> you're

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
and this is very important when you're

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.109 
and this is very important when you're
playing<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.020> violin<00:01:42.349> because<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:43.520> gives<00:01:43.849> you

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
playing the violin because it gives you

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.880 
playing the violin because it gives you
the<00:01:44.270> friction<00:01:44.750> on<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:46.550> strings<00:01:47.739> now<00:01:48.739> it's

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
the friction on the strings now it's

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.080 
the friction on the strings now it's
very<00:01:49.069> easy<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.959> put<00:01:51.640> but<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.729> have<00:01:52.819> to<00:01:52.940> make

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
very easy to put but you have to make

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.430 
very easy to put but you have to make
sure<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.560> cover<00:01:55.340> from<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.149> top<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:57.319> the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
sure that you cover from the top to the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:09.990 
sure that you cover from the top to the
bottom<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.879> did<00:01:59.030> like<00:01:59.179> this

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.440 

make<00:02:11.000> sure<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:12.440> get<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.010> rosin<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.700> all<00:02:14.209> of

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
make sure you get the rosin on all of

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.550 
make sure you get the rosin on all of
the<00:02:15.550> all<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.880> buttons

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.730 

and<00:02:22.130> when<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.430> stop<00:02:22.790> think<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.330> know<00:02:23.740> that

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
and when you stop think you know that

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.330 
and when you stop think you know that
you<00:02:25.010> have<00:02:25.160> enough<00:02:25.550> resin<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.710> rosin<00:02:28.070> on<00:02:28.190> your

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
you have enough resin and rosin on your

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.110 
you have enough resin and rosin on your
breath<00:02:29.020> well<00:02:30.020> my<00:02:30.200> old<00:02:30.380> music<00:02:30.770> teacher<00:02:31.120> said

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
breath well my old music teacher said

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.170 
breath well my old music teacher said
that<00:02:32.330> if<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:33.130> grow<00:02:34.130> again<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> backi<00:02:34.820> hand

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
that if you grow again on the backi hand

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.520 
that if you grow again on the backi hand
and<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:36.560> very<00:02:36.980> gently<00:02:37.070> touch<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and just very gently touch it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.130 
and just very gently touch it
yes<00:02:39.530> it's<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.770> bit<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.010> white<00:02:40.250> which<00:02:40.610> there<00:02:40.790> is

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
yes it's a bit of white which there is

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.120 
yes it's a bit of white which there is
then<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:44.860> successfully<00:02:45.860> rosin<00:02:46.610> jabo

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
then you have successfully rosin jabo

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.080 
then you have successfully rosin jabo
obviously<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.220> don't<00:02:49.400> have<00:02:49.580> wasn't<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.910> too

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
obviously you don't have wasn't it too

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.360 
obviously you don't have wasn't it too
much<00:02:50.240> if<00:02:50.480> it's<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.660> cloud<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:51.500> appears<00:02:52.250> of

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
much if it's a cloud that appears of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.490 
much if it's a cloud that appears of
white<00:02:52.640> when<00:02:53.540> you've<00:02:53.690> done<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.020> then<00:02:54.320> you've

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
white when you've done this then you've

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.910 
white when you've done this then you've
done<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.220> too<00:02:55.400> much<00:02:55.780> state<00:02:56.780> variable<00:02:57.320> above

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
done it too much state variable above

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.320 
done it too much state variable above
that<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.250> nicely<00:02:58.550> wasn't<00:02:59.170> now<00:03:01.720> one<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.900> tip

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
that is nicely wasn't now one of the tip

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.500 
that is nicely wasn't now one of the tip
when<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.660> play<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.050> lighting<00:03:06.910> this<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.090> one

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
when you play the lighting this is one

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.760 
when you play the lighting this is one
of<00:03:08.630> mine<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:10.250> often<00:03:10.580> get<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.989> residue<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.620> the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
of mine you often get the residue of the
