00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.900 

because<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> doubled<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.400> over<00:01:11.730> you<00:01:11.850> should

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
because you doubled it over you should

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.790 
because you doubled it over you should
be<00:01:12.150> left<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.420> two<00:01:12.750> rectangles<00:01:13.410> over<00:01:13.620> like

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
be left with two rectangles over like

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.860 
be left with two rectangles over like
this<00:01:13.980> don't<00:01:14.550> work<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.000> edges<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.450> messy<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
this don't work the edges are messy and

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.220 
this don't work the edges are messy and
jagged<00:01:16.940> 90<00:01:17.940> wants<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> fold<00:01:18.510> over<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
jagged 90 wants to fold over all the

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.380 
jagged 90 wants to fold over all the
edges<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.800> create<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.130> hem<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.060> pin<00:01:21.270> them

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
edges to create a hem you can pin them

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.540 
edges to create a hem you can pin them
down<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.870> was<00:01:22.020> lazy<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.500> skip<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.950> step<00:01:23.220> so

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
down but I was lazy and skip the step so

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.670 
down but I was lazy and skip the step so
I<00:01:23.580> went<00:01:23.880> straight<00:01:24.000> ahead<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.600> sewed<00:01:25.200> them<00:01:25.470> in

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I went straight ahead and sewed them in

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.080 
I went straight ahead and sewed them in
place<00:01:25.920> using<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.760> running<00:01:27.060> step<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
place using a running step you want to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
place using a running step you want to
do<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.540> both<00:01:30.870> rectangles<00:01:31.620> and<00:01:31.830> when<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
do this on both rectangles and when you

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.350 
do this on both rectangles and when you
finish<00:01:32.370> you<00:01:32.520> should<00:01:32.550> have<00:01:32.700> something<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
finish you should have something that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.580 
finish you should have something that
looks<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:35.810> now<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.870> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> lay<00:01:37.410> them

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
looks like this now you want to lay them

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.930 
looks like this now you want to lay them
one<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.890> top<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.280> other<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> good

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
one on top of the other with the good

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.180 
one on top of the other with the good
sides<00:01:39.180> facing<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.740> wrong<00:01:40.920> sides

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
sides facing in and the wrong sides

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.160 
sides facing in and the wrong sides
facing<00:01:41.340> outwards<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> want<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:42.990> pin

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
facing outwards then you want to pin

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.940 
facing outwards then you want to pin
down<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.740> edge<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:52.740> do

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
down one edge like so and then do

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.190 
down one edge like so and then do
another<00:01:52.979> running<00:01:53.729> stitch<00:01:54.030> down<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
another running stitch down down the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.710 
another running stitch down down the
edge<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> complete<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.330> on<00:01:57.540> both

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
edge you want to complete this on both

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.560 
edge you want to complete this on both
sides<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.310> over<00:01:59.610> each<00:01:59.759> side<00:02:00.030> twice<00:02:00.300> if

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
sides you can go over each side twice if

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.999 
sides you can go over each side twice if
you<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.900> make<00:02:01.020> sure<00:02:01.050> that<00:02:01.410> your<00:02:01.590> seams

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009

stretching it as far as I could it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.540
