00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.610
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.809
 destiny today with a new video 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.099
 announcement or flea 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.799
 yes, because we have something new again 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.770
 think yes you know it's friday 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.810
 bonns kurtag saturday in gramm day and off 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.230
 now it will be Sunday that we are 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.600
 to incorporate the faction day 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.250
 So our third format as we are 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.750
 we also bring it out weekly 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.529
 There was not even a point where we were 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.359
 have said 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.610
 that does not come and even if neither 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.500
 nights then depend on the formats 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.880
 and of course we want that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.739
 you as a spectator a bit 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.559
 Regulated content have you to know 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.820
 On Saturdays that comes on Sundays and yes 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.770
 that was the planning 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.870
 Flo and I had the last ones now 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 day again very much we gambled 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 of course have a lot synonymous videos 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.480
 but made by the reviews 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.850
 to level up a lot again and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.250
 to make many forays and there are 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.770
 Of course, we also leveled up in the call 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.989
 certain fractions of the flea had the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.879
 monarchy in it and I had the rotor 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 becomes accurate and then we have the idea 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.670
 come that we just determined 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 keep packages and at the end of the week 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.740
 unpacking 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.479
 some will think what is 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.220
 because so special in the gramm 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.090
 tact level which indeed when craften 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.729
 war packages 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.820
 the special is when the one faction 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.220
 level then you can firstly exclusive 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.560
 shaders get bitter style for example 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.500
 So completely black, completely white, black and white 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.460
 or the monarch shader the red ones 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.380
 this year so hammer exactly like that and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.610
 that's just something special at the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.900
 fractions what you do not forget 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.850
 may is legendary ships so 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.100
 Group leader Each faction has only one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.930
 and people even rank 100 at 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 dead orbit have achieved this 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.130
 ship did not get and that is now 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.250
 our goal is that we all exclusive 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.439
 get shader as well as faction leader and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.329
 push the rank really high 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.710
 that will be our goal, we can do a lot 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.049
 be very interesting for you though 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.909
 you could practically see how long 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.280
 Take it until you get a shake at it 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.079
 when does he get and who gets 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.209
 maybe 50 more packages maybe 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.849
 after 5 also we will be in the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.560
 faction the whole thing so install that 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.989
 we always if 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 new news gives the week about how 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.470
 to include in the faction 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.230
 because do not forget to iron 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.910
 exams of the osiris the new event 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.830
 queen event all these are also who 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.930
 There are always factions and there 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.090
 news and we will be special 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.099
 also install it again and thus you 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.140
 It's a little bit insightful like the whole thing 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.300
 will look like we have here now 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.720
 Kindly get a video where someone 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.239
 15 dead orbit packages opens and we 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.580
 let it all go now and 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.549
 comment on it all so it knows 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.590
 The little ones have the packages and we clear 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.780
 see 15 dead orbit lingen 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.489
 So we are curious what's inside 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.989
 yes, we always see calls again 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.549
 then it grows and what's in it 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.849
 could look here gets the two 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.700
 fragments and there was a poor 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.890
 and energy yes of course you can too 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.620
 Armor parts get people there light 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.239
 Particle coins and of course below here 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.910
 We call these things again 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.470
 Award and that can be here 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.760
 The need to partially get around 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.950
 to be able to buy something 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.239
 also only with the first dc in weapons 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.370
 can you get as we do here 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.940
 Seeing it all so it could really 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.290
 be worth 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.090
 yes in any case, there you can good 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.410
 ostrich we will always pay 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.549
 Level different traditions again 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.739
 I believe the company is just the one 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.690
 monarchy yes makes the dead orbit 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.910
 let's see what we come out in front 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.190
 all how long we will need to 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.079
 to get the faction leader because of me 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.030
 wants that faction leader but also very much 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.359
 It would be interesting because it gets first 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.160
 or shader saw the little thing and 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.620
 after that we look very much 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:57.160
 of course, we do not know yet 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.140
 when or how much we have on packages 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.150
 We certainly would be sure 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.610
 are searched the whole week with it 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.650
 We sundays for the faction day then 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.860
 have the packages ready for you and 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.750
 then I'm curious how fast one 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.099
 from both of us the shader crea or something 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.900
 a ship we are curious first 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.280
 on it and the action boss am I am 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.500
 Most eager because they want 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.239
 yes, very many and video material 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.370
 as well as imagery is very much 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.110
 rarely in German there are even times 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.750
 not if it's either the first again 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.880
 I would be very happy , that's why 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.220
 Today next Sunday check the channel 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.780
 then the first fractional day will start 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.630
 We are hoping for the video 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.700
 was informative if you like this 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.040

 this format with the faction because 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.220
