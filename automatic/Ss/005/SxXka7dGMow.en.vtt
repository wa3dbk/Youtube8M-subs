00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
it's kind of a futuristic weapon and I

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.399 
it's kind of a futuristic weapon and I
think<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.849> looked<00:03:09.060> pretty<00:03:09.209> cool<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.139> I<00:03:10.169> got

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
think it looked pretty cool so I got

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.740 
think it looked pretty cool so I got
that<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:10.829> I<00:03:10.859> don't<00:03:11.099> have<00:03:11.220> only<00:03:11.459> world<00:03:12.450> war<00:03:12.599> two

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that so I don't have only world war two

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.830 
that so I don't have only world war two
weapons<00:03:13.049> i<00:03:13.169> can<00:03:13.349> get<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:13.889> more<00:03:14.189> like<00:03:14.840> an

some<00:05:17.710> of<00:05:17.830> my<00:05:17.979> videos<00:05:18.120> because<00:05:19.120> i<00:05:19.479> already<00:05:19.629> have

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
some of my videos because i already have

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.820 
some of my videos because i already have
some<00:05:20.110> ideas<00:05:20.139> for<00:05:21.039> tests<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.699> stuff<00:05:22.000> and

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
some ideas for tests and stuff and

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.140 
some ideas for tests and stuff and
become<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:24.310> green<00:05:24.789> combat<00:05:25.449> PDW<00:05:26.289> and<00:05:27.280> now<00:05:27.909> i'm

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
become a green combat PDW and now i'm

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.969 
become a green combat PDW and now i'm
not<00:05:28.300> really<00:05:28.419> sure<00:05:28.539> why<00:05:28.930> they're<00:05:29.139> in<00:05:29.229> green<00:05:29.620> my

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
not really sure why they're in green my

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.659 
not really sure why they're in green my
guess<00:05:30.280> is<00:05:30.520> because<00:05:30.940> of<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.509> new<00:05:31.810> is<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:33.520> that

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
guess is because of the new is so that
