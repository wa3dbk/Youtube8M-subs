00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.670
 Hello 

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:17.099
 I am very happy to be able to find you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:19.470
 today in this virtual space here and of 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.650
 I can tell you about a new way of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.699
 therapy 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.699
 to treat diseases 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:35.810
 I mean the decoding 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.810
 original biological disease 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:46.980
 it's a form of brief emotional therapy 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.650
 of information and complementary to 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.520
 pharmaceutical medical approaches and 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.520
 psychological 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.620
 and that is not intended to replace any 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:05.440
 from them 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.690
 My name is crisis and I created the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.810
 original biological decoding of 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.810
 diseases in 1993 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:25.830
 based on the doctor's work 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:25.830
 milton exxon and doctor frasier 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.740
 and I teach biological decoding 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.740
 original of diseases 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.270
 through seminars through 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.730
 workshop training conferences 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:57.010
 formations to form bio 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:00.450
 psychotherapists to this day I have written 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.450
 more than 20 books 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.170
 never 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.670
 in the year 2000 I founded the school of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.390
 original biological decoding of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.390
 diseases 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.920
 of a room with the objective of forming 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:34.370
 bio psychotherapists that could help 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:37.980
 to sick people training and is 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.530
 training lasts at least three years 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.190
 the information dispute to the tiger pointed 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.110
 because you need to integrate 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.110
 learn a lot of information 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:59.599
 the theory concerning medicine and 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.889
 etiology and biology and psychology 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.889
 to psychology 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.129
 also the structure and practice of 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.129
 protocols 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:21.280
 which consist of concrete exercises 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.280
 therapeutic 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.420
 additionally, a deep 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.440
 work 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:38.730
 personal therapeutic and supervisory 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.730
 also do supervisions 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.540
 currently to teach the 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.980
 original biological decoding of 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.980
 liver diseases 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.410
 there are only four beatriz teachers 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.410
 official 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.220
 and this server myself that is flex 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.430
 information center I know what that is because 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.860
 my profession unfortunately exist 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.160
 unscrupulous people who have 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:27.300
 self-proclaimed teachers of the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:30.520
 creators of the decoding of 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.930
 people unfortunately commit and 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.080
 they convey serious theoretical errors and 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.080
 practical 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.220
 some of them were my students 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.620
 to whom I never gave the validation 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:58.650
 neither of professors nor of if kobe or 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:05.750
 therapists and some others were 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.750
 organizers of my training courses 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.210
 but they did not complete their training either 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.210
 with me 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.309
 Some 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.270
 they did not complete the training for 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:25.270
 make teachers 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.780
 and for the above reasons 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.150
 I know that these people really do not 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.380
 they know the biological decoding 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.380
 original of diseases 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:49.110
 and felt that they should not be 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.110
 using this term to teach 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.600
 first of all because they do not know 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.000
 really the authority of the 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:04.210
 original biological decoding of 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.250
 insurance mÃ³nica diseases in 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.440
 second place because they are not trained 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.330
 on the subject with the seriousness and 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.330
 rigorousness that is required 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.169
 and thirdly because they do not have my 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.330
 validation since I am the creator of 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.689
 this form of therapy the 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.689
 decoding 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:35.960
 in fourth place because they say they are 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.960
 teaching decoding 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:44.629
 but they are actually teaching other 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:48.650
 things even as courses in miracles of 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:52.039
 family constellations total biology 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.039
 for example 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:04.250
 in fifth place because they put in 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.250
 great risk to sick people 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.389
 for its lack of theoretical competence and 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.389
 practice 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.190
 additionally gives a false image of the 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.820
 original biological decoding of 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.820
 diseases 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.280
 [Music] 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.350
 and they make dangerous assertions like 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.020
 for example that you should not resort to 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:39.690
 medicine in case of virus disease 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.760
 decoding is a serious approach 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.680
 professional and professional 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.680
 regarding the responsible 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:53.670
 in permanent change in permanent 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:57.450
 dear movement business manager of 

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:59.580
 production therapy different given that 

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:03.290
 seeks to find new ways for 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.290
 therapy and disease prevention 

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.280
 many thanks
