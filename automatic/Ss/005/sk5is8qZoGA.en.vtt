00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.269
 hello dear friends today i am 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.079
 I'll show you how to carve red fish 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:52.409
 salmon and salmon of pink whale 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.219
 it doesn't matter, but I have already begun the process. 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.820
 show equally 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.879
 the fish was gutted like we 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.799
 head we separate the fact is that if we 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.080
 let's cut it right here 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.390
 very much on the head remains very 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.990
 we have a lot of fish pulp and so we 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.569
 cut to look for take a fin under 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 flipper substitute the knife and cut on 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:25.470
 look for that is cut off the flesh so she 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.810
 we have too much and does not remain on the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.119
 head also turn the fish and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.110
 do the same on the other side here 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.140
 you can see that the flesh is cut as much as possible for 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.770
 Soup anyway, this little head will go 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.649
 no problem well, and I in the following lessons 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.390
 I will show you how to salt fish and how to fish 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.910
 to smoke 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.720
 therefore it is important for us to leave as much as possible 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.170
 pulp 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.170
 for pickling smoked for frying 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.770
 and since we cut fish into fillets you 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.650
 see that pre fish 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.650
 I do not like to clean when the scales 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.170
 come across later when you cut a fish 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.320
 why I do not like salty smoked 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.860
 fish cleaned find the ridge 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.840
 here we have it here we have a ridge along 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.440
 ridge we will cut along the ridge 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.540
 when we cut we feel the bones we 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.530
 undercut yes and here so along 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.680
 vertebral 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.680
 along the spine and cut 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.470
 you feel with a knife where the spine 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:56.430
 that's so neat 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:01.769
 turn over here so beautiful 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:05.849
 here it is we have a spine we walked with a knife 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.849
 straight along the spine 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.480
 what else do I want to say knife is desirable 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.690
 take as long as possible so you better 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.840
 be able to trim not nag namely 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.870
 cut and the knife should be very good 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:28.109
 sharpened so that our fillet was even 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:32.859
 and now we take aside fillet and 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:35.769
 we will cut the second fillet 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.709
 likewise the same water on us 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.519
 the spine we find the spine along 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.519
 spine 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:14.739
 here is the spine less often 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:15.340
 what a chic thing we have left for 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.910
 soup 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.760
 our ridge still has enough myasco on it 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.449
 wonderful going to court nothing 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.449
 throwing away 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:38.210
 now we have fresh 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.210
 cut off these bones with a fin 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.199
 So 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.740
 too, the soup will go 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.930
 here 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:08.750
 we cut off the bones and we 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.750
 girlfriends so 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.940
 here we are iris tears 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.550
 together and where are we still fin if we 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:32.199
 we will salt or smoke on us especially 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.199
 this part so 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.750
 Putin 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:46.820
 too we stick behind the captain to what is not possible 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:53.440
 also from soup now what else do we have 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.440
 left neatly 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:02.590
 what we still have left 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:06.550
 here are these bones if we hold here 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.250
 here, in principle, they are visible a little if 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.320
 we will hold our hand from the side of the head 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.230
 we will tail them very well 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:20.820
 feel they need tweezers 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:24.700
 neatly side of the head pull out and 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.300
 so remove the bones side of the head 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.300
 one 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.950
 one 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.940
 do 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.940
 pretty easy
