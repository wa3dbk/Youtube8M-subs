00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
because that's what my place where I get

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.099 
because that's what my place where I get
a<00:00:58.019> shiny<00:00:58.429> I<00:00:59.429> would<00:01:00.269> recommend<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.870> for

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
a shiny I would recommend this for

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.100 
a shiny I would recommend this for
people<00:01:01.589> with<00:01:01.739> combination<00:01:02.640> skin<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.359> oily

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
people with combination skin or oily

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.130 
people with combination skin or oily
skin<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:05.220> find<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.430 
skin I find that if you just want to
wear<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.320> alone<00:01:08.030> for<00:01:09.030> me<00:01:09.150> personally<00:01:09.440> don't
