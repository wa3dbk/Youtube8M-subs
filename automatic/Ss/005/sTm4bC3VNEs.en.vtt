this will be interesting this is what we
want<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.590> refreshing<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> apple<00:00:23.850> store

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
want to see refreshing the apple store

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.870 
want to see refreshing the apple store
now<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> macbook<00:00:25.199> air<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:26.189> based<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
now have the macbook air is based on a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.450 
now have the macbook air is based on a

well sir otherwise known as Haswell ult

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.270 
well sir otherwise known as Haswell ult
and<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.420> don't<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.750> Haswell<00:00:34.170> ult<00:00:34.649> ult<00:00:34.860> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and if you don't know Haswell ult ult is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700 
and if you don't know Haswell ult ult is
the<00:00:35.520> great<00:00:35.820> process<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.480> fruit<00:00:36.719> very<00:00:37.230> big

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the great process or fruit very big

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.049 
the great process or fruit very big
power<00:00:37.950> savings<00:00:38.430> Oh<00:00:40.670> stream<00:00:41.670> seems<00:00:41.910> you've

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
power savings Oh stream seems you've

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.180 
power savings Oh stream seems you've
frozen<00:00:42.270> more<00:00:42.780> energy-efficient<00:00:43.590> CPUs

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
frozen more energy-efficient CPUs

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.580 
frozen more energy-efficient CPUs
there's<00:00:44.850> twice<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.480> graphics<00:00:45.989> execution

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
there's twice the graphics execution

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.560 
there's twice the graphics execution
units<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.789> run<00:00:47.940> them<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:48.329> at<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
units so we can run them actually at a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
units so we can run them actually at a
slower<00:00:48.809> clock<00:00:49.079> speed<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> save<00:00:49.739> energy<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
slower clock speed to save energy and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.880 
slower clock speed to save energy and
still<00:00:50.789> deliver<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.750> forty<00:00:52.110> percent<00:00:52.410> faster

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
still deliver the forty percent faster

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.220 
still deliver the forty percent faster
graphics<00:00:53.370> performance<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> Apple

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
graphics performance and the Apple

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
graphics performance and the Apple
engineers<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.829> worked<00:00:55.860> together<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
engineers have worked together with the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.720 
engineers have worked together with the
intelligent<00:00:57.300> engineers<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:58.020> some<00:00:58.710> great<00:00:59.100> low

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
intelligent engineers are some great low

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.400 
intelligent engineers are some great low
power<00:01:00.059> states<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.020> things<00:01:01.199> like

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
power states so we can do things like

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
power states so we can do things like
wake<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.309> second<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.910> power<00:01:03.149> nap<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
wake up in one second and power nap is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.310 
wake up in one second and power nap is
supported<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.110> effect<00:01:04.850> are<00:01:05.850> three<00:01:06.090> days<00:01:06.390> but

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
supported in effect are three days but

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.530 
supported in effect are three days but
the<00:01:07.439> biggest<00:01:07.650> benefit<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> battery<00:01:08.909> life<00:01:08.939> so

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the biggest benefit is battery life so

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.600 
the biggest benefit is battery life so
here's<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> current<00:01:10.470> Wow<00:01:10.619> significant

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
here's the current Wow significant

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.210 
here's the current Wow significant
improvements<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.180> battery<00:01:12.450> life<00:01:12.600> watch<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
improvements in battery life watch this

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.130 
improvements in battery life watch this
the<00:01:14.220> 11-inch<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.820> now<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.509> from<00:01:15.720> five

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the 11-inch is now going to go from five

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.560 
the 11-inch is now going to go from five
hours<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.650> battery<00:01:17.040> life<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.420> an
