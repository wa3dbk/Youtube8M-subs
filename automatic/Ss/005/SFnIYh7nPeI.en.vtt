00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:09.450
 we are going to train a dog the first thing we have to do, is to accustom it to the use of the leash, 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.879
 the use of the belt is something that at first it is hard work, like everything but then the 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.240
 Dogs enjoy it very much, they just see the leash and they are all upset. This is a 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:31.230
 training belt, you need a 1.8 or 1.9 meter strap. we're going to grab it from this 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:47.320
 shape, nothing more hooked on the top finger and Kelly. the other part with this we're going to do 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:01:01.070
 with this we're going to do with the bitch we're going to do this U, it's a way of keeping 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.320
 also a certain, a certain energy. 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.090
 Normally it costs a little more work, but this bitch already knows how to walk on a leash 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:29.289
 it will be less, even though it has a distractor outside the house and wants to go outside because it 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:44.000
 They are making a lot of noise and they think it's going to come out, so nothing else what we have 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.609
 What to do sitting down what we're going to do, this is ready in case we need to, 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:00.420
 run belt or travel through space, there we have already traveled, if we do not need 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.740
 space, this is the position that will serve us, we will always do it normally 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.820
 on the left and what we're doing with this is that we're always going to move forward with our 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.610
 Left leg, when we start walking so that the dog realizes. 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:30.160
 Let's go, that's all we have to do, we turn it around, the bitch goes here. 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.170
 So with this simple movement the bitch will obey, when it is beginning, many 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.780
 Sometimes it is necessary, give prizes, that's why these belts are, because at a given moment, 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:55.430
 If the bitch does not listen to me, I'm pulling her with a prize, so the dog follows me because 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:04.440
 believe that I bring a prize I do not bring it Kelly come she learns to walk on a leash, 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:17.660
 this exercise must be done for 10, 15 minutes maximum, ideally 10, if they are 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:26.510
 5 is fine, you just have to do it 3 or 4 times a day, dogs do not have much 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.430
 capture time and in a moment we abuse them and after that time they lose 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.260
 the uptake, we see it with humans, humans when they go to class to a classroom after 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:50.760
 of the first half hour already dogs begin to be scattered in their thoughts 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.230
 5 minutes 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.980
 Once, this exercise we will be repeating about 10 or 15 times within the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:09.960
 house, without going outside, because this is the formula, once we've done it 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:18.350
 inside house wave, we will be able to start going out, but when we start 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:31.639
 going to the street will pull, we will also try to bring some kind of prize to 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.699
 that when he starts to pull we are giving him to go with us, because he's going 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.280
 seeing his prize, right now there is no prize here, the prize is not always necessary. all right 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.580
 Kelly, this is also a prize when we want to reward the pear if we caress her 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:59.650
 We are rewarding, it is very important that when we give a prize, which is a caress, 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.009
 we do not do it in the head, the head, the dogs get a little more crazy, you. put 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:13.210
 they will think, their heads are soused and they get mad, as is the dog, you do not have to so much 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:25.129
 head, this exercise of the belt I insist we do it every three hours 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:33.340
 or thing like that 5 minutes, if you can not do it once a day, it will take longer but also 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:42.050
 it can be the thing is not to spend more than ten minutes, every time you train a dog, 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.770
 After a while they will be on the leash all day, and the dog will see the leash every time 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.449
 will jump for joy, but at the beginning when learning is different, the dog 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:23.919
 You have to walk always by our side, you should not pull it, here it is like 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:41.210
 He does not want to, but if I do it like that, with the prize, there's the prize. 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.180
 With this we are finishing the part of the belt use course, which is one of the exercises 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.270
 that one must have mastered once the dog has mastered the use of a leash, 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.620
 inside the house, we can continue with the training. Thank you very much, if you like it, give it a 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.883
 like and if you like more follow me to see the whole course
