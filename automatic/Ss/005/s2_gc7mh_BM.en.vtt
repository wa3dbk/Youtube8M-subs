from Modern Warfare 2 I mean that might

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.859 
from Modern Warfare 2 I mean that might
be<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> factor<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.250> well<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.430> haven't<00:02:02.820> played<00:02:03.000> I

maybe it's just Call of Duty getting old
I<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.540> no<00:02:24.690> clue<00:02:24.900> yeah<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> guess<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.069> it

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
I have no clue yeah I guess that's it

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.650 
I have no clue yeah I guess that's it
really<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.610> play<00:02:26.760> any<00:02:26.970> Call<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.239> Duty<00:02:27.510> for

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
really if you play any Call of Duty for

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.910 
really if you play any Call of Duty for
too<00:02:27.750> long<00:02:27.930> you'll<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:28.230> bored<00:02:28.379> of<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.650> which<00:02:28.800> is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
too long you'll get bored of it which is

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.350 
too long you'll get bored of it which is
why<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.220> probably<00:02:29.550> kind<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.760> moved<00:02:29.970> back<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
why we probably kind of moved back to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.449 
why we probably kind of moved back to
one<00:02:31.290> war<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.590> two<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.920> occasionally<00:02:32.370> I'll

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
one war for two and occasionally I'll

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.710 
one war for two and occasionally I'll
pop<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.730> world<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.000> war<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.300> caught<00:02:33.450> four<00:02:33.630> as

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
weird like I played code for forever and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.050 
weird like I played code for forever and
I<00:03:09.870> found<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.040> know<00:03:11.160> five<00:03:11.430> or<00:03:11.459> six<00:03:11.730> normal

something either is ridiculous I landed
in<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.079> game<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.530> not<00:03:19.620> even<00:03:19.739> like<00:03:19.859> a

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
in the game and it's not even like a

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.620 
in the game and it's not even like a
normal<00:03:20.430> zombie<00:03:20.459> mode<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.060> you'd<00:03:21.209> expect<00:03:21.299> you

how<00:05:42.040> much<00:05:42.760> was<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.180> what<00:05:43.810> was<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:44.020> timer<00:05:44.230> in

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
how much was the what was the timer in

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.660 
how much was the what was the timer in
the<00:05:44.530> game<00:05:44.710> like<00:05:44.890> how<00:05:45.010> many<00:05:45.190> seconds<00:05:45.550> before

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
the game like how many seconds before

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.190 
the game like how many seconds before
the<00:05:45.850> game<00:05:45.970> ended<00:05:46.300> I<00:05:46.420> think<00:05:46.780> there's<00:05:46.930> literally

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
the game ended I think there's literally

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.690 
the game ended I think there's literally
like<00:05:47.290> one<00:05:47.560> or<00:05:47.680> two<00:05:47.710> seconds<00:05:48.250> before<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:48.580> guy

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
like one or two seconds before the guy

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.940 
like one or two seconds before the guy
got<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:48.880> final<00:05:49.210> kill<00:05:49.390> that<00:05:50.350> was<00:05:50.440> a<00:05:50.500> facepalm

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
got the final kill that was a facepalm

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.220 
got the final kill that was a facepalm
moment<00:05:50.980> but<00:05:51.460> yeah<00:05:51.970> that's<00:05:52.150> unlikely<00:05:52.630> yeah<00:05:53.050> the

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
moment but yeah that's unlikely yeah the

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.450 
moment but yeah that's unlikely yeah the
game<00:05:53.530> was<00:05:53.680> ending<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.980> up<00:05:54.070> right<00:05:54.280> now<00:05:54.430> the

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
game was ending it up right now the

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.250

videos<00:05:54.790> and<00:05:54.940> it's<00:05:55.090> all<00:05:55.210> probably<00:05:55.450> black

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
videos and it's all probably black

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.990 
videos and it's all probably black
screen<00:05:56.500> or<00:05:56.620> something<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.920> end<00:05:57.070> here<00:05:57.220> but<00:05:57.430> one

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950

something<00:06:36.250> about<00:06:36.340> the<00:06:36.520> FAMAS<00:06:36.820> but

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
them as much as I do the FAMAS at the

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.450 
them as much as I do the FAMAS at the
moment<00:06:52.300> but<00:06:52.900> maybe<00:06:52.930> when<00:06:53.320> they<00:06:53.440> tweak<00:06:53.770> the

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
moment but maybe when they tweak the

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.710 
moment but maybe when they tweak the
FAMAS<00:06:54.729> they're<00:06:54.910> gonna<00:06:55.030> people<00:06:55.539> are

definitely gonna find something else to

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.300 
definitely gonna find something else to
overuse<00:06:57.789> and<00:06:58.060> we<00:06:58.720> have<00:06:58.900> to<00:06:59.050> keep<00:06:59.590> the<00:06:59.800> mindset

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
overuse and we have to keep the mindset

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.070 
overuse and we have to keep the mindset
that<00:07:00.340> right<00:07:00.820> now<00:07:01.060> the<00:07:01.120> next<00:07:01.509> gun<00:07:01.690> that<00:07:01.870> comes

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
it's pretty much not going to be
