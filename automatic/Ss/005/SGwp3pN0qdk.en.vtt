to be supported in the future on 3gs
they<00:00:40.950> will<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.250> struggle<00:00:41.730> too<00:00:41.940> much<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.360> run

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
they will just struggle too much to run

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.869

that's<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.710> me<00:00:43.920> though<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that's just me though and there are a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
that's just me though and there are a
lot<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> people<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.600> can't<00:00:45.780> afford<00:00:45.870> high-end
