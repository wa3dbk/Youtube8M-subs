00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello friend let's talk a little more 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.280
 on some issues that are controversial 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.840
 but it is very important that people 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.160
 talk about them 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.740
 I want to talk about abortion. 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.020
 I searched for some information 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.859
 I wanted to bring you that goes 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.830
 watch this video simply by 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.189
 word the church often platinum 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.469
 some issues that are already resolved 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.480
 for us children of God 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.820
 abortion is already point is not optional 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.750
 to allow does not please God 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.570
 flee from all the biblical contexts that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.910
 we know many times 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.820
 people say the bible does not bring 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.100
 much information whether or not it is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.320
 abortion allowed 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.969
 There are so many things the Bible does not speak 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.870
 does not mention and that we know it is not 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.460
 allowed 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.240
 then in 33 years the shepherding 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.770
 I never got in the church's treasury 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.450
 and told the staff who 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.549
 church finances that I am here is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.680
 forbidden 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.170
 I never told them that they did not 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.750
 can buy any particular object 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 with church money and I do not even need 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.530
 talk because he knows he can not is that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.970
 We Christians know that abortion does not 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.280
 pleases God, life is from God, God gave 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.950
 god strip and some say cloth gets to 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.250
 life 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:53.630
 Orthodox Jews claim that life 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:58.009
 90 is born of the meeting of eggs 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.429
 another class of Jews 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.920
 I believe that life begins at birth 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.240
 when the bible talks about the breath of 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.130
 life 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.510
 I get the first class of Jews. 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.920
 Orthodox Jews start life if not 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.910
 maternal uterus 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.480
 there when the child starts 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.079
 training there is already life you 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.280
 God said many have many texts that 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:35.900
 in the womb of the mother I chose in the womb 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.860
 I know God knows the market. 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.579
 life or recognize life in the wind who 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.819
 are we not to recognize the most 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.609
 pastor law already exists so many laws 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.910
 speaking in month let's talk a little 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.880
 about law and morality 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.239
 there are things we do not need law 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.600
 to discuss why they are moral 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.299
 it's not because the law allows anything 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.130
 or open some there are some doors to 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:13.370
 some subjects that we will support 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.010
 there may be law but it is not moral 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.489
 abortion is not moral 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.019
 the pastor but she has very many pregnancies 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:26.360
 unwanted 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:30.470
 I agree with you but now we do not 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.510
 we may because of a mistake make a 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.200
 much greater sin 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.379
 You can not because of an error. 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.459
 commit a murder 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:47.359
 then my position on abortion is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.810
 the following if god knows the life of the 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:55.639
 man approve of God that man is born 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.639
 and if it was created it's not me and I believe 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:02.810
 that much less you who are watching 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:08.349
 that will end a life that began the 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:11.299
 psalmist the number of PS 139 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.120
 verses 13 to 16 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:18.260
 it brings very important information 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:22.359
 about life about the human being I want 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.359
 meditate with you about it 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:29.410
 pay close attention to what the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:35.180
 psalmist since you have formed my kidneys 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:38.389
 in 3d tcm in my mother's womb I love you 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.360
 I will praise because in an admirable and 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.849
 wonderful was informed wonderful 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.520
 it is his works and my soul knows it 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:52.419
 well your eyes saw my 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:57.560
 substance and in your book have been 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:05:00.889
 written every other day every day 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:07.960
 were ordained to me while I was still 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:11.020
 there was none of them do you think 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.259
 God knows your life, God programmed it. 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.580
 Your life, God, programs the lives of everyone. 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:20.099
 the human beings 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:24.910
 life does not begin when the person is born 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:26.530
 life begins when she is in the womb 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.259
 formed 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.050
 We need to take care of this other times. 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:35.080
 We will talk more about abortion today. 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.789
 I want to leave the word to you 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.930
 life belongs to god and only god can 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.669
 to draw 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.669
 God bless you until the next
