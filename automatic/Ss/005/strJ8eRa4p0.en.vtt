it off of the rock and it's more of a

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.610 
it off of the rock and it's more of a
move<00:02:56.500> Steve<00:02:56.799> type<00:02:57.099> deal<00:02:57.370> but<00:02:57.959> he<00:02:58.959> used<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.500> a

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
much though but what I probably do is

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.099 
much though but what I probably do is
switch<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.069> corporate<00:03:19.060> elbow<00:03:19.180> with<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.870> leap

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.250 
switch the corporate elbow with the leap
