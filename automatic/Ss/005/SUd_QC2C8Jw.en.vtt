00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.540 
checking that's okay but if you were to
play<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> two-way<00:02:41.390> forward<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.950> would<00:02:43.010> be<00:02:43.220> much

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
play a two-way forward it would be much

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.270 
play a two-way forward it would be much
higher<00:02:44.410> also<00:02:45.410> if<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.530> play<00:02:45.769> center<00:02:46.070> you'll

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
higher also if you play center you'll

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.210 
higher also if you play center you'll
have<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.519> put<00:02:46.640> face<00:02:46.820> off<00:02:47.060> saw<00:02:47.299> up<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:48.220> i

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
have to put face off saw up and i

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.850 
have to put face off saw up and i
believe<00:02:49.459> i<00:02:49.580> put<00:02:50.260> knots<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.530> flush

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
believe i put knots like I just flush

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.580 
believe i put knots like I just flush
those<00:02:52.040> three<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.480> we'll<00:02:53.870> check<00:02:54.140> FLOTUS<00:02:55.010> ISM

and<00:03:39.530> some<00:03:39.680> people<00:03:39.889> think<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.190> helps<00:03:40.400> with<00:03:40.519> face

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820

ights i think i did notice a difference
when<00:03:44.600> i<00:03:44.660> put<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:44.930> up<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.080> 81<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:45.980> for<00:03:46.310> now<00:03:46.430> I'm

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
when i put it up to 81 so for now I'm

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.970 
when i put it up to 81 so for now I'm
going<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.910> leave<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.090> unless<00:03:47.570> it's<00:03:48.530> proven

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
going to leave it unless it's proven

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.250 
going to leave it unless it's proven
that<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.280> doesn't<00:03:49.550> do<00:03:49.670> anything<00:03:49.970> but<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:51.140> now

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
that it doesn't do anything but for now

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.830 
that it doesn't do anything but for now
I'm<00:03:51.470> going<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.680> leave<00:03:51.860> my<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.040> strike<00:03:52.580> that<00:03:52.730> 81<00:03:53.030> I

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
I'm going to leave my I strike that 81 I

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.520 
I'm going to leave my I strike that 81 I
think<00:03:54.770> it<00:03:54.860> I<00:03:55.100> think<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.430> helps<00:03:56.140> but<00:03:57.140> anyways

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
think it I think it helps but anyways

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.100 
think it I think it helps but anyways
this<00:03:58.010> sniper<00:03:58.220> is<00:03:58.580> just<00:03:58.760> overall<00:03:59.210> pretty<00:04:00.020> good

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
this sniper is just overall pretty good

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.170 
this sniper is just overall pretty good
it<00:04:00.500> leads<00:04:00.860> towards<00:04:01.250> offensive<00:04:01.430> what<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.030> works

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
it leads towards offensive what it works

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.030 
it leads towards offensive what it works
for<00:04:02.330> me<00:04:02.440> hopefully<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.500> works<00:04:03.590> for<00:04:03.770> you<00:04:03.890> guys

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
for me hopefully it works for you guys

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.140 
for me hopefully it works for you guys
