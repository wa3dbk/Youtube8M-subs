00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.530
 channel but I 'm back and let's go 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
 this video is starting a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.500
 skyrim detonator this will be the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.960
 episode 10 will be theoretical galeras 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.410
 so if you're not so interested in 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.300
 know about the history of the game then 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.820
 skip to the first chapter so from here 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.900
 will be theoretical will be talking about the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.730
 game history 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.300
 I recommend only to those who are 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 interested in history even in this 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.960
 I detonated by voting a series of tips 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.300
 For you it 's about passing the quests. 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 how to evolve fast in a game I go 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.230
 do until the end to end this 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.140
 main I will also do some 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.950
 secondary things that are needed 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.300
 we buy money 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.120
 or arrange to join a small client 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.130
 I could finish the game well, Rodeo. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.350
 so let the history of the game is set 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.720
 nor ten years after the end of the crisis 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.260
 and I'm not going to get too 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.000
 details about the crisis of the credible 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.180
 never released the game of some points 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.560
 4 and 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.390
 today no time 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.909
 about the history of the game itself more 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.190
 the game takes place in the province of skyrim 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.260
 that gave origin or name of the game 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.260
 the empire begins to cede territories 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.450
 to our cells because there is no 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.670
 heir to the supreme king who was 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.189
 murdered by father 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.080
 is a song called Daily Use the Game 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.930
 in the middle of each operator's journals 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.800
 the city that in the case or freights makes 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.560
 cloud 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.700
 he has the desire to free his people 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.100
 standing 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 from then on an endless war 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.520
 11 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.990
 the crazy natives historical of skyrim 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.869
 nordic 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.450
 want independence to be free from 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.149
 empire has been dominating everything 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.050
 coming from prayers to God as stalks for 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.440
 example on the menu is the Fusar of Asilah and 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.020
 cities is not a rule of 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.560
 unnecessary right 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.490
 finally dominating all these things 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.220
 all 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.350
 independence from the Nordic countries. 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.870
 Now, let's go to the history of our 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.330
 protagonist of the game the great dragon 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.580
 although that in the case is the only thing that 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.890
 You can not avoid a game. 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.540
 the rest everything you can to avoid everything 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.630
 if you can have another choice is and 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.880
 so the game is practically changing 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.780
 the agreement story you're going to take 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.360
 in his decisions that is the dragon ball in 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.410
 that in the language of the Dragons Sun Aquino 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.320
 born of the dragons and in this case is the only 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.660
 the only person who can run out of time 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.790
 with the dragons sucking his soul and 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.640
 shouting on your tongue is a 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.760
 very old and powerful language 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.220
 You start with a wagon and with a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.040
 historical look that rolled a thief out of 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.170
 horse who is the locker and the leader of being 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.170
 am not weak historical look the club 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.450
 natal garden being taken to death 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.830
 the same way that love says you went 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.300
 caught trying to cross the border 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.610
 illegally 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.490
 in which the horse thief and says that 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.410
 we were caught in an imperial trap and 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.150
 which are the crazy story that they 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.580
 want not us 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.890
 if you're going to look around you come to the 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.310
 carts full of historical soldiers 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.370
 looks that confirm that block says 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.700
 without any hope whatsoever 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.130
 to help those who do not 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.030
 resolves after he exalts himself and runs in the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.030
 selection time 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.450
 yesterday the iphone looked at the imperials not 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.140
 know who you are and it's time you 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.900
 You choose who your character will be. 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.700
 the choice of your character does not 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.890
 will influence future changes in 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.970
 story only its powers 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.610
 special 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.380
 each race has a power that can be 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.810
 used to advantage of a given 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.570
 enemy for example that we have gas 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.480
 that unarmed combat can be used 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.360
 and can see in the dark using a power 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.639
 special for Goiano regenerate life 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.800
 more known among other species 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.530
 in my case I chose the breed well then 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.100
 which has a natural resistance to magic 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.530
 and you can and can use a special power 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.389
 called dragon skin that leaves more 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.660
 resistant yet magic and I did this 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.050
 choose because hurts are what will you 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.729
 fuck in the magic game will be a danger to 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.290
 If you're playing, do not 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.470
 higher if you are playing 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.500
 luize i did not get over zino super easy 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.410
 It's going to be on the different corner that goes. 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.410
 be a huge advantage and go to me 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.229
 they do a reasonable damage, you can have a 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.750
 late good record network confirms that you 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.010
 not on the fugitive list 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.610
 asking your superior what should be 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.100
 do 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.760
 capturing forget the list and continue 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.710
 A motherfucker, right? 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.230
 in this part and keep the words of 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.740

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.740
 It happened 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.250
 start to hear scary screams this 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.370
 they prefer to continue execution when 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.830
 It comes as a dragon attacks water that 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.800
 in case it is the city where you are 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.510

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.950
 to regret not having attacked the defendant 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.950
 after its execution 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.820
 Louçã says that the divine gave another 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:16.150

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.340
