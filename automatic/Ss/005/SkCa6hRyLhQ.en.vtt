 as a Christmas main course 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.150
 we recommend pink roasted duck breast 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:13.820

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.370
 again and salt pepper to taste 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.000
 First we give the herb butter 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.000
 in the pan 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.270

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.250
 pans that also make you warm 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 little oil pure 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.840
 then we go there the spectrums and 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:08.630
 sweat because if that tastes 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.650
 slightly sweaty then we give 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.650
 the onions to it 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.790

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.690
 and 12 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.909
 so when the herb butter melted 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.520
 is 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.999
 then we go to these photos bread cubes 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.240

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.160
 do not spice it up with salt 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.629
 a lot of salt part of the herb butter 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.200
 we have a reason taste 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.200
 or better 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:30.880
 then always two or three eggs 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:36.090
