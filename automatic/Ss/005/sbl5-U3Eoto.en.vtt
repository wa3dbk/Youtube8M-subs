00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.190

 limitations and all free time 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.129
 what kind of displacement on what 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.680
 surfaces like where good 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.899
 it is simply to treat the running doing 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.670
 acrobatics all these expressions what 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.129
 we do here and what they are called 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.990
 those who do parkour 77 ensures 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.310
 back this section holds while 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.310
 some classes to the body 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.930
 left scroll you cross with the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.120
 left but do the other side 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.570
 things with the right side to be 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.570
 exhaustion 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 practitioners of parkour more than a 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.030
 sport see it as a philosophy of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 obstacles that can be faced in the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.929
 daily life whether physical or 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.609
 Psychological where practices are not 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.209
 you can practice on everything in all 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:41.310
 places simply in a park in a 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:43.350
 building in Olympic gyms too 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.799
 there are specialized gyms to start 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.359
 in all places you can practice 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.429
 well the same jump an obstacle of 2 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.560
 meters of height to travel a great 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.849
 neighborhood full of buildings so 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.399
 so much everything behind 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.840
 in addition to a good physical preparation 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.420
 It is imperative that you have a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.909
 mental strength as are the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.709
 trials or as a practice not good at 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.959
 doing a physical activity always has 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.879
 that starting with a warm-up is 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.610
 basic because because that way you're going to avoid 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.370
 many injuries and you 're going to say you 're going to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.040
 start at the rhythm and then we 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 we started with force and because to 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.340
 do all this is in this part force 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.860
 I have a lot of strength in what are the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.109
 arms legs to be able to jump 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.160
 hold you on the wall and so on 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:32.280
 push yourself with your arms 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.780
 this was the first one if we already know that 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.280
 you can not spend three seconds without 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.739
 check your notifications 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.250
 save yourself is anguish and desolation
