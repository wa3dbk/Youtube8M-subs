00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.180
-I should've never gone on this stupid quest!
I would've been better getting her that bear trap!

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.940
-Oh, you mean that sweet hat?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.660
-Red, come on!

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.540
-Be very careful with that dynamite. It's going to the exprosion factory.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.740
-Wasabi!

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.320
-Holy crap, we made it. And we're floating
away!

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.779
-What you talking about?
-I mean, the tides are carrying us out to sea!

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.340
-Aw yeah, Bermuda Triangle, here we come!

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.240
-Well, what are we going to do?!
-I don't know, but hey, at least we got sushi.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.440
See ya, Japan! You stink crazy!

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.340
-Row boat triiiip! Woo!

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.300
-Will you shut up?! I don't know if you've noticed or not, but we're in some deep shit!

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.000
-Uh, I think it's called a rowboat?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.280
-That isn't funny! We're stuck in the middle
of the ocean with only the hilt of this stupid sword

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.400
and now we're going to die out here, and I'm going to miss Pink's birthday!

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.080
-I don't know why you're doing all this crazy stuff for her anyway.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.980
Who cares, she's just a girl!

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.280
-Well, I love her, okay? That's why.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.460
-Whaat dooes that meeean?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.620
-Wait, you really don't know what love means?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.700
Of course you don't.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.560
It's this feeling you get when you see someone.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.580
Deep down inside of you, your heart starts pumping and you just start feeling happy all over.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.410
It's the strongest most wonderful feeling
you can have for someone!

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.080
-So you mean a boner?
-NO!

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.320
-Dude, I'm in love all day.
-You are such an idiot!

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.120
-I wouldn't do all this for a boner. I'd just
go online and look up pictures of your mom.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.940
-Shut up! I'm doing this because I think she's
in love with me, too.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.820
-No way, man, she likes me!
-What!?

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.340
-Yeah dude, she's always giving me those dirty
looks. Mmm.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.040
-'Cause she hates you! Red, not every girl
in the world thinks you're cool hot shit.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.410
-Yeah they do, why do you think I beat up
all those bullies back in kindergarten?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.640
-To save my life?

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.920
-What? No!

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.500
Dude, I was trying to impress all those chicks.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.380
-WHAT!?
-Yeah, worked pretty good too.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.160
-You've beaten me up, embarrassed me, screwed my ex-girlfriends,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.840
crapped in my bed, stolen my shit, eaten my food and taken my money for years!

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.340
I stayed friends with you this whole time because for some reason

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.520
I actually thought
you were my friend, too!

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.360
-Well you must feel pret-ty stupid.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.340
-FUCK YOU!!

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.780
-You're such an asshole! I can't believe you
let me think we were actually friends!

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.680
-Well maybe I'd be friends with you if you
weren't such a goddamn...

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.960
Loser all the time!

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.660
-I'm a loser?! I caught you masturbating to
Animal Planet!

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.000
-That was ONE time! You're just racist against
ELEPHANTS!!

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.340
-I can't believe I stuck by your side for 20
god damn years!

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.240
I'm not your friend anymore!
-Good! I'm not yours!

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.280
-Great!
-Awesome!

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.840
-Good!
-I'm glad!
