00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:01.504
-What's happenin', forum?

00:00:01.504 --> 00:00:04.153
I've got some awesome videos to review for you guys.

00:00:04.153 --> 00:00:06.139
You're welcome.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:10.663
No, but anyway, there's this wasp chillin' on the lens of this security camera

00:00:10.663 --> 00:00:14.785
and then there's the hero of the story who rolls over with his little towel,

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.136
and he's gonna take care of the problem.

00:00:26.212 --> 00:00:28.479
Yeah, maybe I LOL'ed a little too hard at the video.

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.138
The fall wasn't so entertaining as much as it was funny

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:32.824
that the guy got owned by the wasp.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.164
But did you see the size of that thing?

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:37.198
That's got to be like 6 feet long.

00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:39.288
That's some s--t straight outta Starship Troopers.

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:41.300
No honestly, I can't make fun of the dude,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.300
'cause that's happened to me before.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.089
You know, I'm out with a girl, I try to impress her,

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.733
like "I'll take care of this bug,"

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.711
and suddenly it moves and I'm like "Bah!" like a little bitch.

00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:52.779
If I've learned anything from the Internet,

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:57.051
it's one, the girls on craigslist are not as hot as they describe themselves to be,

00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:00.868
and two, people who have been medicated by the dentist make the best viral videos.

00:01:00.868 --> 00:01:04.813
So the scenario is there's this brother and sister who've just got back from the dentist,

00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:07.854
and they are both seriously high.

00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:09.927
-Hey, want to play thumb war?

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:11.297
-What?

00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:14.214
-Want to play thumb war?

00:01:14.214 --> 00:01:15.214
-Okay.

00:01:15.214 --> 00:01:16.545
-Now.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.223
I can't move my finger!

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.732
[whimpers]

00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:38.272
Mommy, she bit me.

00:01:38.272 --> 00:01:39.474
-It's okay, guys.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.414
We'll be home in a few minutes.

00:01:41.414 --> 00:01:43.811
-Now, I don't know what kind of drugs the dentist gave them,

00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:45.559
I'm assuming it's Vodka and Xanax,

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:48.826
but it was enough to give this video 250,000 views

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:49.826
and a spot on Ellen.

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:50.826
And honestly, I'm jealous.

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:53.476
I wish I could be as high as that boy is,

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:55.586
'cause he is way higher than his sister.

00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:02.272
-Will you marry me?

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:10.560
-So Oedipus there is lucky 'cause he'll probably never get that high again...

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.664
at least not till college.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.721
Now, I recommend you watch the whole video,

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:15.207
it runs a little long at about 10 minutes,

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:17.796
but there are tons of awesome quotes in there.

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:20.188
I think at one point, he calls his sister a ho.

00:02:20.188 --> 00:02:23.229
-What are you doing to me, you ho?

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:24.229
-Hey!

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.803
-God, I need to get high like that.

00:02:25.803 --> 00:02:28.376
I mean, what? Don't do drugs, what?

00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:33.731
Guys, I can only describe the next video as very Japanese.

00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:35.220
And if you've watched this show for a while,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.858
you'll know that a lot of f--ked up videos come from Japan.

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:38.858
And there's nothing wrong with that;

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.310
it's just how they roll.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.087
Now the title of this particular video is "Vagina Bubbles from Hell".

00:02:44.087 --> 00:02:46.728
Oh, if only I were making it up.

00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:49.691
It's a clip from an old Japanese TV show or movie,

00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:52.711
and uhh... enjoy.

00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:14.314
-[gasping]

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.829
-Uh, pardon me, ma'am but it appears your vagina has rabies.

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.829
Squirtle.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.722
Either that, or you used the wrong kind of soap in your dishwater.

00:03:24.722 --> 00:03:25.722
Squirtle.

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:28.196
Man, Hiroshima really f--ked people up, didn't it?

00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:32.154
I mean, not only is there a foam party taking place in her crotch,

00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:34.493
but those bubbles come out and kill the dude across from her.

00:03:34.493 --> 00:03:40.978
-[gasping]

00:03:40.978 --> 00:03:43.530
-Now, I know this movie or show is absurd,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.390
and the clip itself got about 200,000 views.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.633
But realistically, I kinda get where the Japanese are going with this.

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:51.206
Maybe it's not a terrible premise for a horror movie.

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:55.416
Maybe it's a public service announcement reminding you to watch your nasty ass.

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:56.421
Either way, look ladies,

00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:57.591
I don't need to tell you this,

00:03:57.591 --> 00:04:01.685
but if there's ever bubble bath spewing profusely from your lady-parts

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:04.142
so much that it suffocates the guy across from you,

00:04:04.142 --> 00:04:07.771
I'd say it's time to seek immediate medical treatment.

00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:08.771
Squirtle.

00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:14.093
And on that note, I think I'm gonna go kill myself, 'cause I believe now I've seen everything.

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:15.093
But not before the comment question of the day,

00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:17.437
which comes from a user named, bing!,

00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:18.437
and they said...

00:04:18.437 --> 00:04:19.618
-Our question for you is...

00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:21.851
-Why didn't you do your homework?

00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:24.359
-Wait, is one of those girls from that movie?

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:25.359
Never mind.

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:26.705
So, why didn't you do your homework?

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:30.237
Leave your interesting or creative responses in the comments section below

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:31.673

But thanks for watching today's episode of =3.

00:04:34.338 --> 00:04:36.365

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.607
Oh, uh, so tell me forum,

00:04:40.607 --> 00:04:41.940

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.660
