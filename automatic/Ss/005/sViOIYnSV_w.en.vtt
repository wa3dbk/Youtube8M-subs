00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.949
 me schilling 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.489
 What's the interview he gave in broad daylight in time magazine 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.640
 he called me to talk to me no now I have the start 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.849
 the teenager would have things 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.729
 something is for example 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.690
 the reporter asks 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.340
 how could you define your association with paul otellini 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.060
 and you answer no 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.060
 we could say that I carried stones 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 it has the cement 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.220
 I knew then that I was bringing cement 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.080
 it was good and to say things it's been ten years that I always ask 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.270
 the same question 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.270
 I answered that could take something to prove 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.840
 but why these stars and feet 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.580
 children under 6 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.060
 the crew aboard the estuary father 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.830
 Yes 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.680
 the hand in the dough must first settle 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.770
 I belong is dead for us on Libya in Doha Qatar - the country 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.200
 I do not see why not seek solace in the building 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.340
 the summer is the cement is essential 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.550
 I am delighted 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.590
 perfect silence 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.350
 it suits me very well 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.200
 hard to say no no that's what I had to this neighboring country some 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.490
 vulgar thing that's probably why 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.390
 and I am someone who has 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.890
 the worst season in league 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.220
 and then no need to solicit also the others immobilized by mortars 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.200
 we 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.930
 the stone is already a miracle in itself 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.540
 while citigroup 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.490
 m 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.119
 borduas what are you answering see the rate of seekers to define our 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:01:59.950
 association 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.300
 always the same thing we are one and the same person one and the same 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.299
 performer but four-handed as two siamese brothers 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.569
 so we have to 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.339
 william gallas it's called a monster 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.379
 maybe it's an answer that has the advantage of putting us on a par 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.729
 the album to distinguish from each other yes but precisely I sometimes need 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:22.219
 to distinguish from each other 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.219
 see you soon 36 after these magnets been distinguished 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.549
 good wind of this job is to be filled to beat me 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.159
 yasmina 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.159
 in the mineral hierarchy 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.539
 on the spot the former leader of silence 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.379
 no doubt that m 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.119
 other 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.889
 I do not understand 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.199
 that I'm slightly cold is rife 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.199
 to be compared 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.349
 for donzÃ© only cement of the canvas 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:07.449
 I receive I receive and I absolutely agree with your child 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.849
 it's not let go of taking care of this study brings his tour like 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.289
 in other words, no problem 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.289
 the problem is that it is seen 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.530
 saleh in the island 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.489
 we can publish a denial 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.809
 but an error has crept into our previous issue 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.469
 this pole is very complicated 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.469
 she is destined to go out and to the residence 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.599
 It's not worth it 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.769
 bike lounge arm 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.769
 in reality here 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.309
 what am I going to bring as cement 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:52.869
 Forgeard 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.869
 before each case 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.889
 you see there 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.889
 yes the measure 58 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:16.009
 I have the impression that each time beaten 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.279
 Why 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.279
 I do not know how to say but you live 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.889
 it's an impression 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.909
 no but I understand three poles ended sentences that I believe 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.639
 thoughtful 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.520
 on board near 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.590
 at the same time 58 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.590
 58 59 62 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.300
 up to 69 ' 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.710
 29 70 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.090
 the dollar was falling more reflective it's interesting 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.639
 we see a failure apart from the car bns by a theme still 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.530
 to learn from operators from 70% of hotels to 71 major 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.600
 I pull myself together I am again named aquarium 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.309
 you know what I mean during the double tournament 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:12.199
 but it is the game that I am at home for example it is urgent that the paris 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.049
 sg welcomes also in a general way I wonder if we take 

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.680
 no 38 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.099
 you will have to take a noticeably slower tempo 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.379
 we may be taking a little too quickly 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.919
 yes which explains the anger the decline 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.190
 finally what do I say world my entourage to the 52 'measure to the capital punishment 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.820
 maybe also increased less quickly 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.589
 it even happens to a subscriber space 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.159
 relaxed 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.730
 yes again the relaxation and serenity 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.740
 are not always to wish when one plays in front of 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.099
 Yes 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.139
 but beyond what he sees every time I wait 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.139
 from the 58th 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.819
 here it is 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.469
 I'm moping 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.860
 belga movies with a moment to think 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.150
 I apologized stay there but what a report ben I feel that 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.599
 if I had not given this interview 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.189
 I will not think about the 58th measure here is the report to the identical but 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.189
 totally takes up mirrors at the end of the game 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.020
 Yes 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.050
 let's not forget that the transition to a little difficult from the 58 'tobacco 70 for the 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.050
 moment if you prefer 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.699
 it does not seem to put off some others but if you want to offer their 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.099
 siblings in the laboratory 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.099
 both ways not very sure of you 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.960
 talking about the plan on the volga in a way not very remarkably safe 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.469
 on why so why work the potato to you and I we do not dominate 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.050
 masterfully 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.379
 the three ngts 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.379
 see nothing 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.069
 so everyone goes 6 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:05.669
 final barjac beating schalke you and me domino to perfection the 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:10.430
 lesser extent of 7 agencies the device is rather paradoxical still 5 300 

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:13.499
 dollars an ounce before 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:17.300
 Tuesday night in the 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.259

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:21.169

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:30.939
 no 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.139
 when we see that we know 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.719
 respite last night too I heard a cello 

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:41.719
 no violence m rostropovich death m 

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:44.409
 a calendar 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:46.699
 no but it's not possible I can not work with the cello 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.699
 it was in the kitchen 

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:53.699
 oulala appreciable 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.050

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:01.930
 I would like people to have ensured
