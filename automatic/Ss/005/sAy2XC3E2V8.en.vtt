00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.470
 height difference 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.009
 of 180 meters that is the nightmare of many Stuttgart 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.140
 third and second of the two giant slalom 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 in slalom before fully on attack and had to pay for it here 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.169
 trouble 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.460
 already when threading a gate and the dream of on Volker Brien 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.590
 erupted 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.770
 The same happened to Michael Browser succeeding the winner of the first 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.220
 Giant slalom that had been driven in place of the Apostle car 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.240
 this is Michael Frank from WSV Isny 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.350
 Winner that second giant slalom is 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 the slow motion camera shows 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.610
 which is also rather in trouble Bayer has tilted 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.540
 and crashes 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.040
 with start number 43 Erhard Strohmeier out weigh which an Altera Fahrner 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.230

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.440

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.740
 Dr 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.740
 from one ski to another 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.270
 he is technically still a perfect man 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.190
 Plans now also want to speed the younger kibbutz 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.000
 unfortunately have 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.910
 we have our slow motion camera after these shots on the service so that 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.159
 Do not show them any more since Open Preferences 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.590
 he is hungry he finished sixth with Greig Ofner 4 seconds behind 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.940
 Felix Laile express Aarberg 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.400
 he had a gap of 3 chamber 1 second 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.409
 Immediately more impressed by rhythmic very safe haven 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 kl 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.190

 Oberndorf what says you see what the passenger can be in this 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.529
 second through 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.879
 Volker reads from the much swallows bathing-bathing the old students little time 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.929
 for training has technically excellent value 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.069
 and maybe 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.239
 the best talent is that the Ski Association Black Forest also send the track 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:36.809
 can 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:40.459

 Hans Pollner from Skiclub Weddings 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.720
 he drove very evenly in both passes very evenly 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.129
