to demonstrate this I have through a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.850 
to demonstrate this I have through a
combination<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.550> trickery<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.620> black

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
combination of trickery and the black

this<00:00:57.030> garbage<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.800> which<00:00:59.219> is

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
this garbage can right here which is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.560 
this garbage can right here which is
well<00:01:00.120> let's<00:01:00.510> measure<00:01:00.750> how<00:01:01.170> tall<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
well let's measure how tall it is it is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.840 
well let's measure how tall it is it is
just<00:01:04.670> under<00:01:05.930> two<00:01:06.930> feet<00:01:07.260> or<00:01:07.560> about<00:01:08.369> sixty

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
just under two feet or about sixty

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.440 
just under two feet or about sixty
centimeters<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> Europeans<00:01:10.890> tall<00:01:11.610> now

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
centimeters for you Europeans tall now

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.020 
centimeters for you Europeans tall now
that<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:14.570> 60%<00:01:15.570> taller<00:01:15.960> than<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
that is a good 60% taller than a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
that is a good 60% taller than a
five-gallon<00:01:18.030> bucket<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:20.130> we're<00:01:20.250> going

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
five-gallon bucket so what we're going

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.960 
five-gallon bucket so what we're going
to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.630> open<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:23.130> baby<00:01:23.460> up<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to do now is just open this baby up and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
to do now is just open this baby up and
if<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.259> mouse<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:26.100> jump<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.330> we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
if the mouse can jump out of it then we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260 
if the mouse can jump out of it then we
will<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.560> put<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> issue<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.400> rest<00:01:29.549> once<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
will have put the issue to rest once and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.200 
will have put the issue to rest once and
for<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.530> five<00:01:31.979> gallon<00:01:32.220> bucket<00:01:32.430> will

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
for all that a five gallon bucket will

00:01:33.210 --> 00:02:12.620 
for all that a five gallon bucket will
not<00:01:33.479> work<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.350> contain<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> mouse<00:01:35.189> let's<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.060> it

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.330

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
all right you guys well as we can see

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.930 
all right you guys well as we can see
our<00:02:15.640> mouse<00:02:16.150> was<00:02:16.510> easily<00:02:17.080> able<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.890> jump<00:02:18.430> out<00:02:18.880> of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
our mouse was easily able to jump out of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.100 
our mouse was easily able to jump out of
our<00:02:19.920> two-foot<00:02:20.920> tall<00:02:21.280> or<00:02:21.640> 60<00:02:22.300> centimeter<00:02:22.750> tall

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
our two-foot tall or 60 centimeter tall

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.130 
our two-foot tall or 60 centimeter tall
trash<00:02:23.800> pail<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.430> we<00:02:24.730> had<00:02:24.910> right<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.840> if

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
trash pail that we had right here so if

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.590 
trash pail that we had right here so if
a<00:02:26.470> mouse<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.890> jump<00:02:27.130> out<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.490> then<00:02:28.180> that

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
a mouse can jump out of that then that

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.300 
a mouse can jump out of that then that
should<00:02:28.780> prove<00:02:28.990> beyond<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.530> shadow<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
should prove beyond the shadow of a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.300 
should prove beyond the shadow of a
doubt<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:31.000> mouse<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:31.870> jump<00:02:32.260> out<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:33.010> a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
doubt that a mouse can jump out of a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.730 
doubt that a mouse can jump out of a
five-gallon<00:02:34.150> bucket<00:02:34.450> or<00:02:34.630> pretty<00:02:35.200> much<00:02:35.260> any

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
size of bucket you could realistically

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.010 
size of bucket you could realistically
get<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.530> your<00:02:38.800> house<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.610> trap<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.510> mouse<00:02:40.720> in

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
don't have to worry about that but

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.570 
don't have to worry about that but
should<00:02:58.900> still<00:02:59.140> prove<00:02:59.410> for<00:02:59.709> our<00:02:59.860> purposes<00:03:00.370> that

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
should still prove for our purposes that

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.690 
should still prove for our purposes that
a<00:03:01.180> deer<00:03:01.600> mouse<00:03:01.750> can<00:03:02.230> easily<00:03:02.800> jump<00:03:03.250> out<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.519> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
a deer mouse can easily jump out of a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.759 
a deer mouse can easily jump out of a
bucket<00:03:03.880> now<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.390> do<00:03:04.510> want<00:03:04.690> address<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.440> one

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
bucket now I do want address just one

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.290 
bucket now I do want address just one
thing<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.700> some<00:03:06.850> people<00:03:07.090> say<00:03:07.239> you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
thing and that is some people say you

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.850 
thing and that is some people say you
can<00:03:07.510> make<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.660> bucket<00:03:07.870> trap<00:03:08.170> work<00:03:08.410> by<00:03:08.620> putting

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
can make a bucket trap work by putting

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.979 
can make a bucket trap work by putting
water<00:03:09.220> or<00:03:09.670> oil<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.390> bottom<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.900> or

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
water or oil in the bottom of it or

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.720 
water or oil in the bottom of it or
something<00:03:11.170> like<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.769> that<00:03:11.800> is<00:03:12.100> true<00:03:12.580> it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
something like that and that is true it

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.040 
something like that and that is true it
probably<00:03:13.030> would<00:03:13.150> work<00:03:13.300> with<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.510> problem<00:03:13.870> for

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
probably would work with the problem for

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.960 
probably would work with the problem for
me<00:03:14.170> there<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.980> will<00:03:15.130> cause<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.550> mouse<00:03:15.730> to

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
me there is it will cause the mouse to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.440 
me there is it will cause the mouse to
die<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.450> horrible<00:03:17.040> slow<00:03:18.040> death<00:03:18.640> either<00:03:18.940> from

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
die a horrible slow death either from

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.960 
die a horrible slow death either from
drowning<00:03:19.750> or<00:03:20.310> exhaustion<00:03:21.310> when<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.730> can't

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
drowning or exhaustion when it can't

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.240 
drowning or exhaustion when it can't
swim<00:03:22.299> anymore<00:03:22.540> now<00:03:23.260> why<00:03:23.830> would<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.010> want<00:03:24.220> to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
swim anymore now why would you want to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.560 
swim anymore now why would you want to
do<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.580> would<00:03:24.820> never<00:03:25.030> want<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.390> do<00:03:25.540> that

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
do that I would never want to do that

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.479 
do that I would never want to do that
and<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.470> kind<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.709> defeats<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.130> whole<00:03:27.190> purpose

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
and it kind of defeats the whole purpose

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.610 
and it kind of defeats the whole purpose
of<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:28.000> live<00:03:28.209> capture<00:03:28.510> traveler<00:03:29.080> it's<00:03:29.350> just

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
of a live capture traveler it's just

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.300 
of a live capture traveler it's just
gonna<00:03:29.739> kill<00:03:30.040> it

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
gonna kill it

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.800 
gonna kill it
you<00:03:30.489> might<00:03:30.670> as<00:03:30.790> well<00:03:30.910> go<00:03:31.090> out<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.420> buy<00:03:31.540> you

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
you might as well go out and buy you

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.930 
you might as well go out and buy you

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
know a snap trap for like 2 bucks and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.120
