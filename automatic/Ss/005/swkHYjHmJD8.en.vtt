colors which is white black and gold so
these<00:00:27.160> are<00:00:27.340> usually<00:00:27.519> for<00:00:27.970> like<00:00:28.090> you<00:00:28.180> know

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
these are usually for like you know

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.729 
these are usually for like you know
jeeps<00:00:28.660> with<00:00:29.109> seven<00:00:29.529> inch<00:00:30.359> housings<00:00:31.359> and

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
jeeps with seven inch housings and

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.840 
jeeps with seven inch housings and
anything<00:00:32.739> that's<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.980> seven<00:00:33.250> inch<00:00:33.400> either<00:00:33.550> poly

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
anything that's a seven inch either poly

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.540 
anything that's a seven inch either poly
use<00:00:34.090> it<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.850> these<00:00:37.030> have<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.860> functions<00:00:39.100> which

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
use it so these have two functions which

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.860 
use it so these have two functions which
is<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.790> low<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.420> high<00:00:40.480> beam<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:43.719> it's

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
is the low and high beam so when it's

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.600 
is the low and high beam so when it's
low<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:45.370> will<00:00:45.520> be<00:00:45.700> turning<00:00:46.600> on<00:00:46.750> this<00:00:47.469> LED<00:00:47.920> this

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
low it will be turning on this LED this

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.049 
low it will be turning on this LED this
one<00:00:48.910> and<00:00:49.120> this<00:00:49.329> one<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:51.219> big<00:00:51.430> one<00:00:51.460> will<00:00:51.910> be
