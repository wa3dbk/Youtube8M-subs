projectiles now the comment as you can
see<00:04:32.210> is<00:04:32.479> hinged<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:33.770> can<00:04:33.979> move<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.280> upwards

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
see is hinged so you can move it upwards

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.050 
see is hinged so you can move it upwards
or<00:04:34.910> downwards<00:04:34.970> but

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
or downwards but

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.550 
or downwards but
you<00:04:36.090> can<00:04:36.240> move<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.600> two<00:04:36.780> places<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.320> can

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
you can move it in two places you can

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.379 
you can move it in two places you can
move<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.800> there<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.610> can<00:04:38.730> also<00:04:38.970> move<00:04:39.270> it

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
move it there and you can also move it

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.180 
move it there and you can also move it
there<00:04:39.570> as<00:04:39.690> well<00:04:39.870> so<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:40.169> could<00:04:40.350> lower<00:04:40.980> it<00:04:41.070> down

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
there as well so you could lower it down

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.370 
there as well so you could lower it down
like<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:42.060> if<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.419> don't<00:04:42.660> want<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:42.930> too<00:04:43.200> high

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
like that if you don't want it too high

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.790 
like that if you don't want it too high
you<00:04:43.950> have<00:04:43.980> that<00:04:44.820> option<00:04:45.180> stick<00:04:46.080> applications

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
you have that option stick applications

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.510 
you have that option stick applications
all<00:04:47.010> around<00:04:47.370> this<00:04:47.520> as<00:04:47.730> well<00:04:47.910> one<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.720> two<00:04:49.020> and
