00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.430
 I have two important competitors 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.410
 in the loo in segment in my hands 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.030
 namely the acer liquid z5 in the alcatel 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.740
 one touch pop c7 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.780
 that pop c7 is the cheapest device with 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.160
 a 5-inch screen is the acer liquid z5 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.570
 just slightly more expensive but also has a 5 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.730
 inch screen and with that they are both 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.679
 together the cheapest devices with such 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.509
 screen format on the market right now 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.980
 are therefore important competitors of 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.320
 each other and in this video I go them 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.539
 completely compare in price the pop c7 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.710
 costs around 140 euros at the moment 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.530
 liquid z5 costs a little more because 60 euros yes 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.969
 price difference is fairly significant 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.460
 of course in this segment but it is 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.989
 not we should do it and well 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.269
 for another thing of course and I will 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.109
 tell you very first in this video 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.899
 design design of the acer liquid z5 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:53.660
 slightly angular it is reasonable in itself 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.100
 I certainly don't think ugly even on 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.839
 more beautiful than the old ones and I'll be right there 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.579
 immediately back is above and below 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.019
 screens and speaker grill it is something 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.449
 more creative than the car counts 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.729
 back equipped with the so-called 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.380
 rapid puttenaar in red button to that 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.210
 sits about where your forefinger shit 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.920
 requires normal use and with that you can 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.450
 start applications I have it in this 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 Facebook linked in advance 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.990
 and you can also link it to others 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.399
 Applications keep him long pressed 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.170
 which will start the camera 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.909
 as you are going to see all the good around 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.200
 that and you can also take photos as 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.520
 once you are in the camera is in itself 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.270
 are pretty nice features to that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.829
 button 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 What is striking is that the construction of the 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.610
 Acer Liquid Z5 a bit on the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.840
 cheap plastic hand feels what the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.070
 back is used is reasonable 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.990
 rough actually feels good on its own 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.670
 there is some space under it seems so 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.140
 it feels cheap and allows 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.520
 also creaks a little 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.729
 that's a lot better at the hotel 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.930
 arranged that for quite solid on 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.820
 back of softex plastic feels 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.530
 just good roundings are also nice 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.450
 where you are in good hands and it 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.640
 felt a lot firmer and also something 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.920
 more expensive and therefore more luxurious than that of the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.840
 is there are from hotel 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.789
 I kinda boring it is really best 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.409
 well standard it is not ugly in itself 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.939
 device where it is also certainly not one 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.710
 device that jumps out should be that way 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.450
 it is just beautiful 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.189
 standard device is not that much wrong 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.820
 but something to be reckoned with 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.380
 to hold 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.659
 the build quality is better than with the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.610
 is 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.750
 acer so that concerns I think he 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.120
 wins in the field of design 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.489
 can also look fresh in terms of format 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.470
 the race is a bit bigger while they 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.470
 both have an equally large screen and 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.640
 yes then you actually prefer it 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.230
 a somewhat smaller device 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.000
 each that pretty well with the requirements 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.989
 the device is pretty big for it 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.989
 screen format it has 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.900
 further interface and interface of both 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.250
 devices is android of course android 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.780
 jelly bean on both devices it is 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.470
 not very adapted to the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.510
 standard 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.129
 to the acer liquid z5 actually has 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.329
 almost no adjustments a number 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.489
 widgets that have been added 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.160
 but the old then bit on the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.900
 car tire touch pop c7 that has one 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.760
 design or an interface that is something more 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.019
 has been adapted especially in the graphic field 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.879
 functional are not that many 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.730
 added car counts as you can see 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.780
 He is the button also learns something else and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.849
 itself does not have much to do with it 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.140
 but the multitasking function is also something 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.510
 different and therefore actually one of the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.730
 few adjustments to the hotel 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.200
 ah ma touch pop c7 when you see it 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.030
 just look like the always on 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.260
 Android with every beat is the vertical 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.450
 become a list 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.920
 everything com-mission and times is not a whole 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.510
 exciting change and beyond is the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.310
 really only depends on cosmetics 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.180
 looks nice in itself 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.040
 colorful 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.959
 my not so very much about the top fair 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.880
 like to more some touch with 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.560
 devices from samsung 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.200
 it is slightly less businesslike than 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.030
 that of the acer mahamaya just makes 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.680
 not so much out of both, certainly 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.769
 the performance is the acer 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.090
 liquid z5 has a dual core processor 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.799
 while the machine exports for a while 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.450
 quad-core processor 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.180
 at the multimedia library processors with arm 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.980
 cortex a7 nuclei they are therefore basically 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.480
 also a quick top so that also the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.190
 just have two more cores 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.859
 And yes that is something you do every day 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.440
 definitely noticed the hotel is in use 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.049
 do n't use it remarkably quickly 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.549
 for that quad core processor in this one 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.040
 price category I got it a little faster 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.450
 just expect me is just sure soon 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.829
 enough for daily use 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.900
 you are not going to retail in it 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.069
 use of the device at the is you is 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 that is more the case with the duo core 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.160
 we know the processor that is in it 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.629
 other phones too and is out there 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.310
 in itself not very slow but in this one 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.510
 it just doesn't get on well 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.250
 and also if you are a type for example 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.280
 It may still be that he has one 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.530
 is delayed and 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.670
 that they stuff we are just annoying 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.480
 so that is clearly a disadvantage of 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.160
 the acer 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.870
 in terms of room they have almost 5 megapixels 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.639
 camera has the advantage of rapid 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.410
 put but operate the car has not 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.720
 something like that, but otherwise, those cameras 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.800
 both not very exciting and that is it 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.240
 not one of the big differences between 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.980
 the two devices 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.419
 both are in dual sim and singles in 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.710
 versions available at the you can get one 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.780
 SD card next to punctures 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.970
 so there are not that many 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.530
 differences and two devices quite 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.510
 many similarities with each other but also 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.400
 the winter clearly on its construction and on 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.440
 his speed and that has run out 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.270
 two important points also include the screens 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.880
 Incidentally, the screen of each beat 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.950
 is slightly better we are among the not the 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.020
 best screens are therefore 5 inch screen and 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.690
 wvga revolution means they are not whole 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.630
 be sharp but yes in itself 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.160
 you move to evolution is sufficient you 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.720
 just can see everything well it is it 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.110
 is certainly not a very nice screen or something 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.150
 but it is sufficient the hotel you see 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.770
 so just slightly better off in the ECM 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.900
 slightly lesser viewing angle cees also has 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.900
 slightly less contrasts and color reproduction 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.180
 and that also benefits the hotel 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.410
 all in all hotel also has a number 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.220
 important advantages namely 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.830
 screen 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.090
 the construction and the processor and that is 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.040
 things that clear the acer 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.660
 wind and the requirements that is also slightly 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.460
 more expensive to my 20 euros so more expensive 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.690
 we would certainly recommend this for the alcatel 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.690
 one touch pop c7 go
