00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.820 
obviously he's quite expensive at the
moment<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.540> 17<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:26.019> rated<00:02:26.290> player<00:02:26.560> he's

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
moment for a 17 I rated player he's

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.270 
moment for a 17 I rated player he's
around<00:02:27.129> 8k<00:02:28.000> at<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.599> moment<00:02:28.959> but<00:02:29.170> his<00:02:29.950> price

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
around 8k at the moment but his price

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.830 
around 8k at the moment but his price
will<00:02:30.519> drop<00:02:30.700> because<00:02:31.060> he's<00:02:31.269> been<00:02:31.450> out<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.599> bit

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
will drop because he's been out a bit

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.440 
will drop because he's been out a bit
longer<00:02:32.049> don't<00:02:32.739> have<00:02:32.830> been<00:02:32.920> out<00:02:33.040> for<00:02:33.250> about

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
longer don't have been out for about

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.930 
longer don't have been out for about
three<00:02:34.450> or<00:02:34.480> four<00:02:34.569> days<00:02:35.340> though<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.519> quite

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
three or four days though is quite

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.630 
three or four days though is quite
expensive<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.450> moment<00:02:37.840> but<00:02:38.680> as<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.340> said<00:02:39.400> he

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
expensive a moment but as I said he

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.600 
expensive a moment but as I said he
should<00:02:39.879> come<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.090> bit<00:02:40.239> cheaper<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.370> right

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
who has 93 pace at the moment he's up

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.140 
who has 93 pace at the moment he's up
for<00:03:38.260> about<00:03:38.440> 17<00:03:39.040> k<00:03:39.310> 2<00:03:39.880> 22<00:03:40.389> k<00:03:41.220> but<00:03:42.220> as<00:03:42.730> he's<00:03:43.120> been

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
for about 17 k 2 22 k but as he's been

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.750 
for about 17 k 2 22 k but as he's been
out<00:03:43.419> a<00:03:43.450> bit<00:03:43.690> longer<00:03:43.930> like<00:03:44.769> Anderson<00:03:45.370> will<00:03:45.730> drop

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
out a bit longer like Anderson will drop

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.170 
out a bit longer like Anderson will drop
down<00:03:46.030> cheaper<00:03:47.190> my<00:03:48.190> opinion<00:03:48.579> probably<00:03:48.730> go<00:03:48.970> to

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
down cheaper my opinion probably go to

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.220 
down cheaper my opinion probably go to
around<00:03:49.419> 87<00:03:50.169> k<00:03:51.359> so<00:03:52.359> that's<00:03:52.510> about<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.780> for<00:03:52.959> now

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
around 87 k so that's about it for now

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.729 
around 87 k so that's about it for now
that'd<00:03:54.190> be<00:03:54.220> my<00:03:54.430> pasting<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.380> Barclays
