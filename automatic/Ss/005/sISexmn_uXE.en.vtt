00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
and then it needed just take it just at

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.630 
and then it needed just take it just at
the<00:03:00.050> very<00:03:00.080> end<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.100> don't<00:03:01.310> ruin<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
the very end so you don't ruin the

simple and then just take it I know this

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.160 
simple and then just take it I know this
takes<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.310> long<00:03:21.459> time<00:03:21.490> but<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.510> has<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.840> good

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
takes a long time but it has a good

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:51.280 
takes a long time but it has a good
result<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:25.709> go<00:03:26.709> like<00:03:26.830> this

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:59.690
