00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello today style 3 peter for 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:39.050
 3G Internet 980 it is designed to 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:44.280
 Gain 3g Internet is not already held 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:53.930
 externally to this matinee internally 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:59.930
 this shade antilla this cable is 10 meters 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:04.830
 it's in the outside and here it is the antennas 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:48.619
 outdoor which teaches sex goes 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:48.619
 complex without any problems 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:51.150
 We connect everything to each set 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:58.710
 adapter get buy what without 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:07.880
 3g there is no computer program at all 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:13.260
 special network monitoring program 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:17.420
 Take look Wieslaw's scale 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:24.860
 she lets it mean there is no connection at all 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.860
 3g internet is not this without repeaters 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.690
 turn on the flu then 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:42.440
 why did the captain load you see 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:04:05.780
 here is very weak because 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:19.400
 the connection is very weak in general it is on the street 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:25.310
 very weak mixture height of 10 meters 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.990
 the cable is very broken but it enhances 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:33.790
 even such a weak signal and we see 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.790
 the modem started flashing 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.180
 you appeared 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.180
 looking at a computer program and 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:05:00.020
 we see that we have almost full scale 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:07.940
 3G Internet works here 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:12.860
 look this 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:15.039
 whether Peter is more powerful designed at 200 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:22.310
 squares 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:27.010
 cover see full scale speak 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.590
 This means that the maximum level is 7 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:36.639
 Internet as if you are sitting near 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.639
 the very tower near the most basic itself 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:51.820
 the character rolls over sometimes twitches it 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.820
 not scary but still a great signal 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:03.280
 very much these two loops are stronger 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:20.560
 we jump all over Russia 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:23.469
 prove 8 923 408 37 19 you yourself 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:28.090
 well seen that before turning 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:33.340
 rehearse no 3g signal at all when 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:39.180
 turning on the receiver the signal is very good 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.180
 it means the internet works fine 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:44.860
 call order 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:48.400
 quality inexpensive 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:58.199
 repeaters ready-made kits 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:58.199
 setting on this all bye
