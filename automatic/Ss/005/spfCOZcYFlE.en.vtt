00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.549
 how do you remove paint 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.570
 yeah well sanding so throwing is mine 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.730
 not a hobby 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.930
 and sometimes it is also as thick as is 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.910
 browsed 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.240
 that you really with heavy guns to the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.240
 must get started 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:30.190
 I use a hot air for that 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.309
 gun that is adjustable in heat 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.010
 if you put it on one then you are about to sit 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.120
 60 degrees but if you set it to 10 then it goes 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.790
 that at least to 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.350
 You get that 600 degrees of heat there 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.120
 joy it off anyway 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.310
 you just have a mouthpiece there 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.470
 also look at other mouthpieces with one 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.200
 they export 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.510
 they set up animals so you don't have to 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.050
 but then you start to work that way 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.850
 much an ergonomic and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.660
 lemmer need my scraper that is there 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:07.929
 also in outer case off in this case suit 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:14.399
 I hold the triangle for a moment and then it is 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:17.880
 that again ok small mouthpiece on it 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.880
 and then we started 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.250
 I use order with hot air now 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.320
 further along scraping but 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.040
 can also use it feel on pvc 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.960
 pipes 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.850
 to heat and bend and to 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.530
 tightened bolts 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.060
 hot to make you again 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.040
 easier to get loose and you can 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.810
 boost your barbecue with it 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.310
 the moment you charcoal or you 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.060
 briquettes to start a bit 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.649
 to grow 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:12.280
 you say that 600 degrees hair dryer and the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.280
 flames shoot up
