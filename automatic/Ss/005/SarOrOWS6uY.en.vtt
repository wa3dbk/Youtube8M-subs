00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
down well this is the actuator here I've

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.470 
down well this is the actuator here I've
got<00:00:51.380> attached<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.310> blower<00:00:52.580> housing<00:00:52.610> goes<00:00:53.300> for

catch that
the<00:00:58.310> end<00:00:58.490> of<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.640> actuator<00:00:59.000> not<00:00:59.300> directly<00:00:59.710> can

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the end of the actuator not directly can

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.110 
the end of the actuator not directly can
intimately<00:01:03.730> clear<00:01:04.210> tubing<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.860> it's<00:01:06.640> fixed

at<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.390> pump<00:01:07.630> in<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.740> back<00:01:08.920> end<00:01:09.190> which<00:01:09.310> goes

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
at the pump in the back end which goes

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.070 
at the pump in the back end which goes
to<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.820> actuator<00:01:10.120> it<00:01:10.360> has<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.540> spot<00:01:10.900> here

so let's actually I have about a

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.380 
so let's actually I have about a
six-inch<00:01:17.469> stroke<00:01:17.859> really<00:01:18.759> only<00:01:18.969> about<00:01:19.119> 4

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
from when I

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.020 
from when I
operated<00:01:38.380> doing<00:01:39.160> that<00:01:39.280> part<00:01:39.550> of<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.730> actually

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
operated doing that part of the actually

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.610 
operated doing that part of the actually
that<00:01:40.180> set<00:01:40.360> up<00:01:40.480> it's<00:01:40.660> a<00:01:40.720> soft<00:01:40.990> woven<00:01:41.170> but<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.440> read

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
on a lift at you can operate this thing

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.640 
on a lift at you can operate this thing
anyway

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
anyway

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.350 
anyway
actually<00:01:50.040> pinned<00:01:50.310> down<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.760> that's<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
actually pinned down here that's the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.000 
actually pinned down here that's the
holding<00:01:51.750> position

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.660 

defeated<00:01:56.820> right<00:01:56.970> now

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.020 

with<00:01:59.940> a<00:01:59.970> pen<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> doesn't<00:02:00.990> actually

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 

through<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.510> blow<00:02:06.660> operation<00:02:07.410> we<00:02:07.740> can

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
through the blow operation we can

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.430 
through the blow operation we can
account<00:02:08.430> here

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.640 

and<00:02:14.560> pull<00:02:15.010> up<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.450> does

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.180 

if<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.770> see<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.040> Kenya<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.730> be<00:02:21.940> actuator<00:02:23.190> you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
if you see the Kenya can be actuator you

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:33.080 
if you see the Kenya can be actuator you
got<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.580> two<00:02:24.760> inches<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.240> quality<00:02:25.660> course

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.340 

you<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.240> definitely<00:02:34.390> use<00:02:34.660> down<00:02:35.080> pressure

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
you can definitely use down pressure

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.800 
you can definitely use down pressure
here<00:02:35.590> with<00:02:35.770> our<00:02:35.920> bath

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
here with our bath

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.990 
here with our bath
kind<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.260> little<00:02:38.560> for<00:02:38.739> float<00:02:38.980> good<00:02:39.670> time<00:02:39.880> if

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
kind of a little for float good time if

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.980 
kind of a little for float good time if
I<00:02:40.060> grab<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.420> glow<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.750> lift

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.260 

you<00:02:44.990> can<00:02:45.170> see<00:02:45.290> how<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.560> can<00:02:45.650> float<00:02:46.120> there's<00:02:47.120> a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
you can see how it can float there's a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.790 
you can see how it can float there's a
spring<00:02:47.570> down<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.020> this<00:02:48.140> elliptic<00:02:48.620> this

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.470 
found real dollars right now they
actually<00:03:10.230> about<00:03:10.610> two<00:03:11.610> or<00:03:11.880> three<00:03:11.910> inches<00:03:12.090> off

right now on the dash will potentially
below<00:03:19.050> ground<00:03:19.470> another<00:03:19.710> moment<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:22.200> is

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
below ground another moment so this is

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.640 
below ground another moment so this is
really<00:03:22.560> full<00:03:23.430> range<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:23.970> blower<00:03:24.570> all<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
really full range of this blower all the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.380 
really full range of this blower all the

go<00:03:30.390> pick<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.170> cool<00:03:31.380> name<00:03:31.620> covered<00:03:35.690> probably

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
go pick a cool name covered probably

go pick a cool name covered probably
about<00:03:37.080> feet<00:03:38.010> into<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.430> for

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.760 

down<00:03:42.849> they<00:03:43.840> get<00:03:43.989> about<00:03:44.140> eight<00:03:44.290> inches<00:03:44.590> with

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
down they get about eight inches with

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.979 
down they get about eight inches with
motion<00:03:45.160> up<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.489> down<00:03:45.610> with<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.629> points

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989

trophy

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.559 

so<00:03:51.660> here's<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> side<00:03:52.170> shot<00:03:52.970> let<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.090> actuator

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
so here's a side shot let the actuator

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.910 
so here's a side shot let the actuator
and<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.990> blower<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.290> currently<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.709> down

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
and the blower is currently the down

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.500 
and the blower is currently the down
position<00:03:56.130> I'll<00:03:56.730> run<00:03:56.970> up<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.270> down<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.390> couple

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
position I'll run up and down a couple

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:07.220 
position I'll run up and down a couple
times

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.990 

down<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.840> flow<00:04:10.050> position<00:04:10.530> their<00:04:11.000> down

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
down the flow position their down

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:24.770 
down the flow position their down
pressure<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:23.120> don't<00:04:24.120> think<00:04:24.449> I<00:04:24.479> don't<00:04:24.600> like<00:04:24.750> I

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
pressure I don't think I don't like I

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.180 
pressure I don't think I don't like I
thought<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.169> was<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.320> bit<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.680> twist<00:04:25.979> that

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
thought it was a bit of a twist that

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.580 
thought it was a bit of a twist that
have<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:29.180> little<00:04:30.180> off-center<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:31.320> tried<00:04:31.560> to

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
have a little off-center but I tried to

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.100 
have a little off-center but I tried to
find<00:04:31.860> geometry<00:04:32.550> where<00:04:32.729> I<00:04:32.850> could<00:04:33.030> mount<00:04:33.870> this

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
find geometry where I could mount this

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.500 
find geometry where I could mount this
actuator<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.220> actually<00:04:35.760> move<00:04:36.180> the

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
actuator and actually move the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.409 
actuator and actually move the
rotational<00:04:37.320> lever<00:04:37.610> with<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.729> actuator<00:04:39.060> but

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
rotational lever with the actuator but

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.969 
rotational lever with the actuator but
there<00:04:39.570> really<00:04:39.660> was<00:04:39.870> no<00:04:39.990> place<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.289> put<00:04:40.650> it<00:04:40.710> and

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
there really was no place to put it and

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.939 
there really was no place to put it and
still<00:04:41.850> be<00:04:42.030> able<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.560> at<00:04:43.560> least<00:04:43.710> have<00:04:43.919> some

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
still be able to at least have some

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.580 
still be able to at least have some
access<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.729> hood<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.660> had<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.139> nice<00:04:46.350> rigid

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
access to the hood and had a nice rigid

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.029 
access to the hood and had a nice rigid
mount<00:04:46.919> that<00:04:47.130> was<00:04:47.310> balanced<00:04:47.940> on<00:04:48.030> both<00:04:48.210> sides<00:04:48.510> so

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
mount that was balanced on both sides so

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.620 
mount that was balanced on both sides so
this<00:04:50.039> is<00:04:50.160> where<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.400> end<00:04:50.550> up<00:04:50.729> putting<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.479> it

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
this is where I end up putting it and it

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.390 
this is where I end up putting it and it
works<00:04:51.780> pretty<00:04:51.930> good

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
works pretty good

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.850 
works pretty good
another<00:04:53.400> close<00:04:53.669> up<00:04:53.850> here<00:04:55.580> this<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:57.860> square

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
another close up here this is the square

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.680 
another close up here this is the square
tubing<00:04:59.280> extension<00:04:59.850> that's<00:05:00.000> got<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.240> flow<00:05:00.419> pin

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
tubing extension that's got the flow pin

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.270 
tubing extension that's got the flow pin
in<00:05:00.810> it

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
in it

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.040 
in it
we'll<00:05:02.280> see<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:02.490> we<00:05:02.580> can't<00:05:02.850> run<00:05:03.690> up<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.020> down

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
we'll see if we can't run up and down

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:13.830 
we'll see if we can't run up and down
once<00:05:04.580> I'll<00:05:05.580> get<00:05:05.760> closer<00:05:06.030> into<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.570> one

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.300 

take<00:05:14.840> a<00:05:14.870> shot<00:05:15.139> here<00:05:15.349> cops<00:05:15.680> from<00:05:15.919> a<00:05:15.979> straight

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
take a shot here cops from a straight

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:41.300 
take a shot here cops from a straight
down<00:05:16.490> from<00:05:16.639> above<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.120> hood

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.409 

well<00:05:42.310> for<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.550> next<00:05:42.729> project<00:05:43.090> I'll<00:05:43.210> probably

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
well for the next project I'll probably

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.659 
well for the next project I'll probably
take<00:05:43.659> this<00:05:43.900> other<00:05:44.560> actuator<00:05:45.159> this<00:05:45.430> is<00:05:45.520> the

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
take this other actuator this is the

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.510 
take this other actuator this is the
shorter<00:05:45.970> actuator<00:05:46.419> from<00:05:46.629> the<00:05:46.720> JB<00:05:47.020> jr.<00:05:47.520> the

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
shorter actuator from the JB jr. the

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.429 
shorter actuator from the JB jr. the
actual<00:05:49.270> lift<00:05:49.449> actuator<00:05:49.960> for<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.229> front

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:50.439 
actual lift actuator for the front

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.529 
actual lift actuator for the front

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
bracket

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.230 
bracket
well<00:05:52.539> we<00:05:52.629> take<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:52.960> here<00:05:53.139> and<00:05:53.819> do<00:05:54.819> some<00:05:55.000> kind<00:05:55.150> of

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
well we take it here and do some kind of

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.040 
well we take it here and do some kind of
mounting<00:05:55.629> the<00:05:56.699> shoot<00:05:57.699> to<00:05:58.389> motorize<00:05:58.659> the

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
provides quite a bit of heat to it's

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.050

almost<00:07:08.020> like<00:07:08.259> sitting<00:07:08.469> under<00:07:08.710> a<00:07:08.740> heat<00:07:08.889> lamp

these<00:07:10.060> are<00:07:10.210> 2<00:07:10.449> 500<00:07:10.990> watt<00:07:11.440> halogen<00:07:11.680> bulbs<00:07:12.279> and

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:12.819 
these are 2 500 watt halogen bulbs and

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:15.149 
these are 2 500 watt halogen bulbs and
so<00:07:13.719> it's<00:07:13.839> a<00:07:13.900> thousand<00:07:14.259> watts<00:07:14.469> a<00:07:14.770> lot<00:07:14.949> of<00:07:15.069> it

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159 
so it's a thousand watts a lot of it

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:17.490 
so it's a thousand watts a lot of it
comes<00:07:15.250> out<00:07:15.430> as<00:07:15.550> heat<00:07:15.759> and<00:07:16.110> actually<00:07:17.110> tends<00:07:17.319> to

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
comes out as heat and actually tends to

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.990 
comes out as heat and actually tends to
keep<00:07:18.009> the<00:07:18.219> temperature<00:07:18.639> in<00:07:18.669> the<00:07:18.819> garage

pretty<00:07:19.300> even<00:07:19.599> even<00:07:19.810> without<00:07:20.020> having<00:07:20.319> to<00:07:20.409> use

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:20.529 
pretty even even without having to use

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:23.249 
pretty even even without having to use
my<00:07:20.789> usual<00:07:21.789> torpedo<00:07:22.360> heater<00:07:22.569> which<00:07:22.839> I<00:07:22.930> use<00:07:23.080> down

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
here to bring it up to temp but the

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.319 
here to bring it up to temp but the
lights<00:07:25.330> is<00:07:25.539> pretty<00:07:25.779> much<00:07:25.870> keep<00:07:26.050> it<00:07:26.139> there
