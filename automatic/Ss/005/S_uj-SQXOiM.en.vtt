00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.270
 Hmm 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.240
 yeah 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:14.860
 For the climbing of the original people gps d and x3 10:00 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.720
 At last I bought a lot so I often got lost 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:23.930
 But I thought Naa do If you do not buy 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:29.810
 I finally bought it because there was a shop that became quite cheap at Rakuten point recently 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:33.990
 It's just Rietrex, but this Yamanaka g was Japanese version, though 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.730
 If it is 30 etx 30, it is English version 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:42.660
 I can buy it for a price of about 30,000 yen 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.290
 Map software is hard to use Japanese map software 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.130
 Because it does not have Japanese notation after 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.090
 Though it is thick and expensive 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:56.680
 30 j is better to buy for Japan words I bought thought good kana 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.880
 So this is 30 people 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 But it is no good if you do not install the map software 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.860
 When I went to Mt. Takano the other day, I got this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.030
 Do you have this look ? 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.710
 I did not write the topographic map contour line either 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:24.670
 There is no station name, only information on the road 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 I think I just have entered that Tteyuu Japan outline map of the so-called a 10 parts per million 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.200
 Well then 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:38.950
 Do not use in this state because I'm about moving path is clear 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:43.270
 You can Toka or put to edit download the map data of that free Toka net 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.490
 Since the thought that a little troublesome but I 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.500
 I bought it 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.920
 It is Japan climbing map Popo store m + v Tsu 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.250
 Often used when climbing that mountain 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.250
 Look-contains the Yamato plateau map data 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.610
 This sd card is not this 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.650
 Just put it in the sea ​​and say it can be used immediately 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.650
 Then I would like to set as soon 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.180
 bj 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 me 2 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.000
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 pa 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.159
 Masu Tei 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.159
 Well then I really want to make it work if I can just use it 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.940
 dj 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.989
 Woofer el 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.240
 dj 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.240
 me 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.980
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.299
 me 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.870
 par 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.200
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.580
 Map data really went in just by inserting the card 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:18.079
 This is really 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:21.259
 But it is better to go It is convenient variety I is cheaper If you've done it yourself 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.220
 Those who bought this for a little over ten thousand 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:31.060
 I think I'm walking early 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:33.750
 It was because Yarakashi than three claws this year Naa has entered the mountain with confidence if there is this 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.750
 I think you
