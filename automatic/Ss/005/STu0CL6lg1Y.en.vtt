and it totally almost made my all my
people<00:01:55.470> go<00:01:55.619> away<00:01:55.680> all<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:56.460> acne<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.540> away<00:01:57.719> but

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
people go away all my acne go away but

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.910 
people go away all my acne go away but
now<00:01:58.560> i'm<00:01:58.710> left<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.040> acne<00:01:59.430> scars<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.920> guess

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
now i'm left with acne scars so I guess

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
now i'm left with acne scars so I guess
every<00:02:02.490> jump<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.030> buy<00:02:03.180> more<00:02:03.360> products<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.960> guess

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
every jump you buy more products I guess

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.830 
every jump you buy more products I guess
but<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:05.009> works<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.450> whitening<00:02:06.719> mask

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
but it works so of the whitening mask

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.130
