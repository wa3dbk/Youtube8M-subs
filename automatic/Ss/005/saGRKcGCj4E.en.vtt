00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
upgrades and researchable things that we

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600 
upgrades and researchable things that we
have<00:00:17.810> with<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.289> fortress<00:00:18.770> in<00:00:19.039> games<00:00:19.340> with<00:00:19.580> a

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
fortress so if we hit our build button

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.710 
fortress so if we hit our build button
we<00:00:22.939> have<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.060> look<00:00:23.240> at<00:00:23.330> all<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:23.570> different

we have a look at all the different

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.410 
we have a look at all the different
extensions<00:00:24.679> we<00:00:24.830> can<00:00:24.980> build<00:00:25.160> okay<00:00:25.550> we<00:00:26.179> have

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
extensions we can build okay we have

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.079 
extensions we can build okay we have
under<00:00:27.259> these<00:00:27.410> extensions<00:00:28.099> researchable

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:29.089 
under these extensions researchable

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.939 
under these extensions researchable
things<00:00:29.449> that<00:00:29.660> can<00:00:29.810> be<00:00:29.929> learned<00:00:29.960> but<00:00:30.470> you<00:00:30.619> can't

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
things that can be learned but you can't

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.480 
things that can be learned but you can't
access<00:00:31.429> them<00:00:31.669> unless<00:00:32.150> you<00:00:32.480> have<00:00:33.070> built<00:00:34.070> that

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
access them unless you have built that

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.360 
access them unless you have built that
extension<00:00:35.390> okay<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:36.650> we<00:00:36.740> have<00:00:36.830> the<00:00:36.950> Treasury

buildings<00:01:01.850> built<00:01:02.060> you<00:01:02.870> can<00:01:03.140> learn<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
buildings built you can learn the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.160 
buildings built you can learn the
abilities<00:01:04.790> that<00:01:04.939> will<00:01:05.540> affect<00:01:06.080> different

abilities that will affect different

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.980 
abilities that will affect different
parts<00:01:06.799> of<00:01:06.860> your<00:01:06.979> gameplay<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.180> for<00:01:08.600> instance

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
parts of your gameplay so for instance

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.020 
parts of your gameplay so for instance
if<00:01:09.200> we<00:01:09.290> go<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.500> research<00:01:09.950> now<00:01:10.640> all<00:01:10.850> these

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
if we go to research now all these

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.120 
if we go to research now all these
things<00:01:11.240> run<00:01:11.510> unlocked<00:01:12.050> we<00:01:12.260> can<00:01:12.560> learn<00:01:12.860> them

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
things run unlocked we can learn them

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.650 
things run unlocked we can learn them
okay<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.060> we'll<00:01:14.180> have<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.330> look<00:01:14.420> at<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
okay and we'll have a look at the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.950 
okay and we'll have a look at the
Treasury<00:01:15.050> these<00:01:15.800> two<00:01:16.160> here<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.090> mining<00:01:17.600> and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
Treasury these two here the mining and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.210 
Treasury these two here the mining and
the<00:01:18.760> taxing<00:01:19.760> one<00:01:20.170> increase<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.560> gold<00:01:21.920> amount

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
the taxing one increase the gold amount

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.830 
the taxing one increase the gold amount
you<00:01:22.340> get<00:01:22.550> from<00:01:22.850> your<00:01:23.360> minds<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.780> your

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
you get from your minds and your

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.330 
you get from your minds and your
fortress<00:01:24.320> at<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.560> start<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.830> your<00:01:24.890> turn<00:01:25.010> so

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
fortress at the start of your turn so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.620 
fortress at the start of your turn so
they're<00:01:25.520> really<00:01:25.670> useful<00:01:26.060> especially<00:01:26.150> in

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
they're really useful especially in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.540 
they're really useful especially in
games<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:26.930> Gold<00:01:27.290> Rush<00:01:27.500> then<00:01:28.100> we<00:01:28.190> have<00:01:28.370> this

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
games like Gold Rush then we have this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.610 
games like Gold Rush then we have this
one<00:01:28.730> called<00:01:28.970> alliance<00:01:29.480> which<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.960> can't<00:01:30.500> afford

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
one called alliance which I can't afford

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.140 
one called alliance which I can't afford
at<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.920> moment<00:01:31.190> so<00:01:31.460> in<00:01:31.670> my<00:01:31.790> turn

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
at the moment so in my turn

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.020 
at the moment so in my turn
and<00:01:33.140> all<00:01:33.290> wait<00:01:33.409> till<00:01:33.620> it's<00:01:33.740> modern<00:01:34.370> okay<00:01:34.670> so

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
and all wait till it's modern okay so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.530 
and all wait till it's modern okay so
research<00:01:35.690> now<00:01:36.409> we<00:01:36.650> have<00:01:36.890> taxing<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.790> that

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
research now we have taxing and that

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.570 
research now we have taxing and that
basically<00:01:38.990> increases<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.770> gold<00:01:40.100> amount<00:01:40.400> you

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
basically increases the gold amount you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.480 
basically increases the gold amount you
get<00:01:40.729> from<00:01:40.909> your<00:01:41.030> fortress<00:01:41.450> by<00:01:41.600> 50%<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.650> you'll

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
get from your fortress by 50% so you'll

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.330 
get from your fortress by 50% so you'll
get<00:01:43.720> 150<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.870> star<00:01:45.050> return<00:01:45.200> with<00:01:45.950> mining

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
get 150 of the star return with mining

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.830 
get 150 of the star return with mining
it's<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.520> same<00:01:46.760> deal<00:01:46.970> but<00:01:47.120> with<00:01:47.240> mines<00:01:47.510> and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
it's the same deal but with mines and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.420 
it's the same deal but with mines and
that's<00:01:48.229> really<00:01:48.440> useful<00:01:48.650> when<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.040> have<00:01:49.159> more

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
that's really useful when you have more

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.980 
that's really useful when you have more
than<00:01:49.549> one<00:01:49.820> gold<00:01:50.120> mine<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.540> if<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:50.720> have<00:01:50.810> two

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
than one gold mine so if you have two

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.719 
than one gold mine so if you have two
gold<00:01:51.229> mines<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.620> get<00:01:51.799> an<00:01:51.890> extra<00:01:52.100> hundred<00:01:52.430> at

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
gold mines you get an extra hundred at

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.219 
gold mines you get an extra hundred at
the<00:01:52.790> start<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.090> your<00:01:53.150> turn<00:01:53.360> rather<00:01:53.659> than<00:01:53.870> an

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
the start of your turn rather than an

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.080 
the start of your turn rather than an
extra<00:01:54.710> fifty<00:01:55.070> just<00:01:55.190> from<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.520> one<00:01:55.670> gold<00:01:55.909> mine

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
extra fifty just from the one gold mine

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.210 
extra fifty just from the one gold mine
and<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.110> finally<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:57.470> have<00:01:57.620> Alliance<00:01:58.040> which

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
and now finally we have Alliance which

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.480 
and now finally we have Alliance which
I'll<00:01:58.430> research<00:01:58.820> which<00:01:59.500> like<00:02:00.500> I<00:02:00.650> said<00:02:00.680> decrease

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
I'll research which like I said decrease

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.230 
I'll research which like I said decrease
the<00:02:01.729> costs<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.240> your<00:02:02.780> units<00:02:03.140> by<00:02:03.260> 100<00:02:03.650> gold<00:02:04.240> so

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
the costs of your units by 100 gold so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.570 
the costs of your units by 100 gold so
they're<00:02:05.420> really<00:02:05.690> useful<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:07.070> use<00:02:07.250> when<00:02:07.490> you

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
they're really useful to use when you

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.039 
they're really useful to use when you
want<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.820> save<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> bit<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.209> money<00:02:08.299> and<00:02:08.659> you<00:02:08.750> know

want to save a bit of money and you know

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.300 
want to save a bit of money and you know
that<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.319> games<00:02:09.530> going<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.890> go<00:02:09.979> for<00:02:10.159> a<00:02:10.190> while

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
that the games going to go for a while

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
that the games going to go for a while
okay<00:02:11.060> next<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.510> armory<00:02:11.870> we<00:02:12.170> have

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
okay next in the armory we have

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.530 
okay next in the armory we have
discipline<00:02:14.220> okay<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.210> discipline<00:02:15.750> basically

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
discipline okay and discipline basically

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.120 
discipline okay and discipline basically
increases<00:02:18.540> your<00:02:18.780> power<00:02:19.200> regeneration<00:02:19.890> in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
increases your power regeneration in

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.910 
increases your power regeneration in
your<00:02:20.280> units<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.660> moves<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.680> cost

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
your units so that your moves that cost

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.710 
your units so that your moves that cost

Paola will be able to refresh over a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.990 
Paola will be able to refresh over a
quick<00:02:27.990> amount<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.380> time

quick amount of time

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.810 
quick amount of time
okay<00:02:30.000> next<00:02:30.600> under<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.840> armory<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.500> have

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
okay next under the armory we have

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.040 
okay next under the armory we have
fortitude<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.120> fortitude<00:02:33.420> increase<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
fortitude and fortitude increase the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.070 
fortitude and fortitude increase the
amount<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.350> health<00:02:34.710> your<00:02:35.010> units<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:36.080> so

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
amount of health your units have so

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.900 
amount of health your units have so
that's<00:02:37.260> always<00:02:37.440> useful<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.160> longer<00:02:38.490> game<00:02:38.670> or

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
that's always useful in a longer game or

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.640 
that's always useful in a longer game or
games<00:02:39.120> where<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.450> need<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.750> endure<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.260> then

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
games where you need to endure and then

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.620 
games where you need to endure and then
speed<00:02:40.980> increases<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> amount<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.330> they<00:02:42.450> can

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
speed increases the amount that they can

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.190 
speed increases the amount that they can
move<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:45.120> games<00:02:45.390> when<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:45.870> all<00:02:45.990> about

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
move so in games when it's all about

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.870 
move so in games when it's all about
lasting<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.860> longest<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.340> know<00:02:47.430> capturing

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
lasting the longest you know capturing

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.940 
lasting the longest you know capturing
the<00:02:47.970> flag<00:02:48.090> quickest<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.050> all<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.680> sort<00:02:49.890> of

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the flag quickest and all that sort of

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.530 
the flag quickest and all that sort of
thing<00:02:50.190> when<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.580> less<00:02:50.880> about<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.420> know

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
thing when it's less about you know

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.350 
thing when it's less about you know
money<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.290> units<00:02:53.250> moves<00:02:53.489> then<00:02:53.820> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
money and and units moves then the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.449 
money and and units moves then the
Armory's<00:02:54.900> researchable<00:02:55.560> things<00:02:55.920> are<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
Armory's researchable things are the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.580 
Armory's researchable things are the
most<00:02:56.610> useful<00:02:56.850> because<00:02:57.750> then<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.020> toughen<00:02:58.410> up

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
most useful because then it toughen up

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.250 
most useful because then it toughen up
your<00:02:58.770> units<00:02:59.220> most<00:03:01.400> okay<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:02.820> looking<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
your units most okay now looking at the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.060 
your units most okay now looking at the
training<00:03:04.860> halls<00:03:05.750> researchable<00:03:06.750> area<00:03:07.140> what

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
training halls researchable area what

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.130 
training halls researchable area what
happens<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.610> we<00:03:08.760> open<00:03:09.060> up<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.360> channel<00:03:09.720> where

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
happens is we open up a channel where

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.350 
happens is we open up a channel where
every<00:03:10.709> unit<00:03:11.130> has<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> single<00:03:11.820> move<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.030> they

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
every unit has a single move that they

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.020 
every unit has a single move that they
can<00:03:12.620> research<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.950> add<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.400> their<00:03:14.550> stack<00:03:14.880> of

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
can research to add to their stack of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.060 
can research to add to their stack of
moves<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:16.020> we'll<00:03:16.170> take<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.350> look<00:03:16.500> at<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.709> ranges

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
moves so we'll take a look at the ranges

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.009 
moves so we'll take a look at the ranges
one<00:03:17.280> first<00:03:17.549> because<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:17.940> closest<00:03:18.390> okay

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
one first because it's closest okay

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.160 
one first because it's closest okay
here's<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.769> called<00:03:20.100> rapid<00:03:20.640> fire<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.989> if<00:03:22.049> we

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
here's one is called rapid fire so if we

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.320 
here's one is called rapid fire so if we
select<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.560> Ranger<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.280> we'll<00:03:23.910> fit<00:03:24.120> them<00:03:24.209> in

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
select the Ranger and we'll fit them in

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.410 
select the Ranger and we'll fit them in
there<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.690> click<00:03:25.230> any<00:03:25.470> unit<00:03:25.860> nearby<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.580> hold

it and then everyone within that range
will<00:03:36.959> be<00:03:37.049> hit<00:03:37.290> by<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.560> rapid<00:03:38.280> fire<00:03:38.459> no<00:03:38.700> matter

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
will be hit by it rapid fire no matter

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.729 
will be hit by it rapid fire no matter
how<00:03:39.209> many<00:03:39.510> people<00:03:39.959> as<00:03:40.110> long<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.440> they're<00:03:40.709> in

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
how many people as long as they're in

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.460 
how many people as long as they're in
range<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.880> really<00:03:42.209> useful<00:03:42.299> move<00:03:42.660> okay

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
range so it's a really useful move okay

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
range so it's a really useful move okay
so<00:03:43.590> I'll<00:03:43.890> just<00:03:43.920> learn<00:03:44.250> all<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.549> rest<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
so I'll just learn all the rest of the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.930 
so I'll just learn all the rest of the
moves<00:03:45.209> didn't<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.260> enough<00:03:46.500> money<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.980> but

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
moves didn't have enough money so but

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.310 
moves didn't have enough money so but
basically<00:03:48.060> yeah<00:03:48.510> we'll<00:03:48.690> go<00:03:48.810> through<00:03:49.080> them<00:03:49.230> one

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
basically yeah we'll go through them one

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
by one okay next we'll have a look at

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.740 
by one okay next we'll have a look at
the<00:03:52.680> Knights<00:03:52.980> special<00:03:53.310> move<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:54.570> one's

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.590 
the Knights special move and this one's
really<00:03:54.840> useful<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.340> case<00:03:56.549> where<00:03:57.090> like

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
really useful see in a case where like

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.330 
really useful see in a case where like
this<00:03:57.810> one<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.320> enemy<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.680> moving<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:59.160> and

this one the enemy is moving in and
attacking<00:03:59.790> me<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.060> surrounding<00:04:00.630> me<00:04:00.750> because

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
attacking me and surrounding me because

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.870 
attacking me and surrounding me because
they're<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:01.860> fat<00:04:02.160> he<00:04:02.400> can't<00:04:02.610> really

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
they're not so fat he can't really

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.360 
they're not so fat he can't really
escape<00:04:03.380> but<00:04:04.380> with<00:04:04.500> his<00:04:04.650> research<00:04:04.950> will<00:04:05.190> move

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
escape but with his research will move

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.460 
escape but with his research will move
it's<00:04:05.700> an<00:04:05.850> area<00:04:06.090> damage<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.660> where<00:04:06.930> if<00:04:07.230> you

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it's an area damage one where if you

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.930 
it's an area damage one where if you
select<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.890> nearby<00:04:08.070> unit<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.610> hold<00:04:08.790> your<00:04:08.880> mouse

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
select a nearby unit and hold your mouse

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.190 
select a nearby unit and hold your mouse
over<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.390> it'll<00:04:09.540> show<00:04:09.630> everyone<00:04:10.049> who's

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
over it it'll show everyone who's

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.650 
over it it'll show everyone who's
damaged<00:04:10.650> okay<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:11.430> all<00:04:11.790> those<00:04:12.030> through<00:04:12.269> we<00:04:12.450> hit

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
damaged okay so all those through we hit

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.020 
damaged okay so all those through we hit
and<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.410> does<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.829> high<00:04:14.130> amount<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.610> damage<00:04:14.910> to

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
and it does a high amount of damage to

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.610 
and it does a high amount of damage to
all<00:04:15.180> units<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.720> think<00:04:15.930> it's<00:04:16.049> around<00:04:16.200> 60

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
all units and I think it's around 60

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.000 
all units and I think it's around 60
damage<00:04:17.180> yeah<00:04:18.180> there<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.479> go<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.900> there<00:04:19.049> okay

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
damage yeah there you go and there okay

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.520 
damage yeah there you go and there okay
so<00:04:20.070> he<00:04:20.519> killed<00:04:20.790> one<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.000> them<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.479> got<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
so he killed one of them and got the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.930 
so he killed one of them and got the
other<00:04:22.560> ones<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:23.130> half<00:04:23.280> health<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.789> does

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
other ones to half health so it does

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.480 
other ones to half health so it does
quite<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.210> bit

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
quite a bit

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.520 
quite a bit
next<00:04:25.210> we'll<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.509> the<00:04:25.630> rogue<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.199> his<00:04:26.380> is

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
next we'll do the rogue and his is

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.559 
next we'll do the rogue and his is
assassinate<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.370> it's<00:04:27.940> as<00:04:28.150> simple<00:04:28.300> as<00:04:28.509> that

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
assassinate and it's as simple as that

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.960 
assassinate and it's as simple as that
it's<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.930> one-hit<00:04:29.350> kill<00:04:29.590> move<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.550> use<00:04:30.789> it

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
it's a one-hit kill move but to use it

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.659 
it's a one-hit kill move but to use it
he<00:04:31.210> has<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.330> be<00:04:31.600> both<00:04:31.870> invisible<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.770> have

he has to be both invisible and have
full<00:04:33.970> power<00:04:34.210> okay<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.259> not<00:04:35.740> only<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:35.949> he<00:04:36.280> has

once you select it he'll be invincible
for<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.050> whole<00:04:56.199> round<00:04:56.610> okay<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.759> finally<00:04:58.000> have

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
for a whole round okay and finally have

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.210 
for a whole round okay and finally have
the<00:04:58.419> major<00:04:58.660> special<00:04:59.289> ability<00:04:59.680> which<00:04:59.889> is<00:05:00.070> in

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
the major special ability which is in

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.580 
the major special ability which is in
power<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.330> that's<00:05:01.570> in<00:05:01.720> this<00:05:01.870> self<00:05:02.139> ability

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
power and so that's in this self ability

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.409 
power and so that's in this self ability
section<00:05:02.949> right<00:05:03.099> nearest<00:05:03.400> portrait<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.180> when

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
section right nearest portrait and when

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.480 
section right nearest portrait and when
selected<00:05:04.930> everyone's<00:05:05.650> power<00:05:06.009> level<00:05:06.370> is

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
selected everyone's power level is

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.270 
selected everyone's power level is
boosted<00:05:07.090> by<00:05:07.539> around<00:05:07.720> half<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:08.289> know<00:05:08.410> so<00:05:08.650> that

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
boosted by around half you know so that

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.670 
boosted by around half you know so that
means<00:05:09.550> using<00:05:10.120> that<00:05:10.330> most<00:05:10.870> people<00:05:11.259> can<00:05:11.440> start

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
means using that most people can start

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.110 
means using that most people can start
using<00:05:11.770> their<00:05:12.099> special<00:05:12.490> attacks<00:05:12.610> straight

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
using their special attacks straight

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.730 
using their special attacks straight
away<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:13.870> it's<00:05:13.990> actually<00:05:14.110> a<00:05:14.289> really<00:05:14.500> useful

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
away so it's actually a really useful

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.189 
away so it's actually a really useful
ability<00:05:15.310> if<00:05:15.539> you're<00:05:16.539> fighting<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:16.930> whole<00:05:17.050> bunch

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
ability if you're fighting a whole bunch

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.629 
ability if you're fighting a whole bunch
of<00:05:17.289> enemies<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.830> all<00:05:17.919> you<00:05:18.039> dudes<00:05:18.280> are<00:05:18.430> nearly

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
of enemies and all you dudes are nearly

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.550 
of enemies and all you dudes are nearly
dead<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.090> have<00:05:19.300> next<00:05:19.750> to<00:05:19.930> no<00:05:20.080> power<00:05:20.320> left

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
dead and have next to no power left

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.120 
dead and have next to no power left
because<00:05:20.860> they've<00:05:21.250> used<00:05:21.490> all<00:05:21.639> their<00:05:21.909> abilities

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
because they've used all their abilities

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.920 
because they've used all their abilities
okay<00:05:24.130> so<00:05:24.190> that<00:05:24.460> covers<00:05:24.669> most<00:05:25.000> everything<00:05:25.780> to

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
okay so that covers most everything to

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.710 
okay so that covers most everything to
