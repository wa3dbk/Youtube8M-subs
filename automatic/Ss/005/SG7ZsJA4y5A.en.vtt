00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it's realistic pal for get over so we

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.180 
it's realistic pal for get over so we
can<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.430> over<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:45.379> well<00:00:46.379> it's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
ten let me let me just check that make

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.569 
ten let me let me just check that make
sure<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> thirteen<00:01:01.530> thousand<00:01:02.039> times<00:01:02.219> seven

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
