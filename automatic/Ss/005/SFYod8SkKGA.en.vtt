don't<00:02:24.290> call<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.760> yeah<00:02:25.760> I've<00:02:25.850> gone<00:02:26.060> really

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
don't call it yeah I've gone really

happy<00:02:26.840> honorable<00:02:27.170> for

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.710 

but<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.830> could<00:02:30.980> do<00:02:31.129> it<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.400> 315<00:02:31.970> but

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
but I could do it with 315 but

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.880 
but I could do it with 315 but
realistically<00:02:33.230> I'm<00:02:33.409> trying<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.680> get<00:02:33.769> that

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
realistically I'm trying to get that

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.559 
realistically I'm trying to get that
that's<00:02:34.459> stretching<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.000> squeeze<00:02:35.269> back<00:02:35.450> at

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
that's stretching that squeeze back at

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.600 
that's stretching that squeeze back at
the<00:02:35.629> top<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.049> honestly<00:02:36.890> it's<00:02:37.370> pretty

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
the top so honestly it's pretty

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.990 
the top so honestly it's pretty
surprising<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:38.209> 225<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:39.230> 135<00:02:39.650> if<00:02:40.099> seems<00:02:40.909> to

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
surprising like 225 like 135 if seems to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.100 
surprising like 225 like 135 if seems to
be<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.090> pretty<00:02:41.209> good<00:02:41.299> way<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.540> get<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.810> squeeze

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
be a pretty good way to get that squeeze

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.750 
be a pretty good way to get that squeeze
I<00:02:42.260> don't<00:02:42.409> like<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.620> use<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.890> as<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> super<00:02:43.459> super

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
I don't like to use it as a super super

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.280 
I don't like to use it as a super super
heavy<00:02:43.940> movement<00:02:44.299> cuz<00:02:44.420> honestly<00:02:44.599> about<00:02:45.049> pain

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
heavy movement cuz honestly about pain

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.500 
heavy movement cuz honestly about pain
you'd<00:02:45.470> be<00:02:45.560> better<00:02:45.739> doing<00:02:46.129> an<00:02:46.700> isolation<00:02:47.330> like

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
you'd be better doing an isolation like

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.180 
you'd be better doing an isolation like
a<00:02:47.540> hamstring<00:02:48.379> curl<00:02:48.680> or<00:02:48.769> something<00:02:49.069> like<00:02:49.129> that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
a hamstring curl or something like that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.030 
a hamstring curl or something like that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
more specifically but like to use this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:08.110 
more specifically but like to use this
to<00:02:52.099> get<00:02:52.280> really<00:02:52.519> a<00:02:52.549> stretch

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.870 

all<00:03:09.120> right<00:03:09.270> now<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.660> way<00:03:09.780> extensions<00:03:10.790> sink

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.540 

and<00:03:14.150> stack<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.450> that's<00:03:14.900> cool<00:03:15.140> bike

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
and stack it that's cool bike

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:59.930 
and stack it that's cool bike
