00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.000
 today 's revenue is versatile and can be 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 served as an entry or accompanying a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.380
 main course to stay even longer 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.809
 interesting our eggplant terrine 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.020
 should be prepared in advance and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.760
 served cold or at room temperature 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.380
 as the name is the most popular here 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.400
 in Brazil let me explain what if 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.550
 treats 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.550
 its French origin terrine and define a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.740
 round oval bottom container or 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 rectangular in general made of crockery 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.059
 porcelain or ceramic with 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.799
 for me and with plastic cover here 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.750
 but if someone got discouraged thinking 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.250
 having to buy one has specific 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.559
 to prepare this recipe 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.110
 relax in the kitchen there are several adaptations 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.449
 possible and in this case we would use a 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.629
 cake or bread like this. 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.629
 hence 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.150
 Our terrine will have three steps one 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.640
 1 oven stove and a refrigerator 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.130
 all very simple the first will be 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.159
 put in preheated oven in 190 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.350
 grades 1 whole red bell pepper and one 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.740
 head of whole garlic wrapped in paper 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740
 aluminum 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.710
 Meanwhile we will make the eggplant with 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.810
 more or less centimeter a line 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.930
 faster but we can use the knife 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 also 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.760
 on a baking sheet greased with 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.220
 olive oil season with salt and pepper 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.610
 kingdom and brushing the slices with more 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.610
 olive oil 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.300
 the liner 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.069
 the dots are these soft eggplant and 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.750
 brown toast and garlic creamy 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.390
 each had a specific time of 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.090
 oven let's go to the stove with a pan 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.730
 small on low heat and 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.239
 olive oil, onion and salt are until 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.239
 soft 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:55.790
 add the chopped tomatoes or the peppers 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:03:01.000
 roasted bark and the threatened 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.000
 squeezing its peel parsley and thyme 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.980
 a little water capped the pot and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.140
 let's cook for 10 minutes 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.989
 while we take advantage to soften the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.819
 gelatine and a little cold water and to 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.819
 hit an angelic with oil 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.970
 we took the pan from the fire 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.340
 we mix the gelatin 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.270
 We're waiting to debut and we're going to 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.550
 contagion in we invested the cake form 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.980
 english with plastic film 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.230
 a hint to facilitate adhesion is a 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.200
 look a little the way we have to 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.900
 leave edges both on the side and 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.810
 here in the end because we are going to close 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.810
 then the terrine with this plastic 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.820
 the first layer should be the sauce with 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.380
 gelatine 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.380
 then enter an eggplant 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.490
 one of olive oil with basil and one of 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.140
 salt and pepper to taste 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.460
 we repeat this sequence until 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.460
 complete the form 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.470
 and the last layer is necessarily a 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.470
 gelatine sauce 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.419
 we closed the plastic film 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.140
 we take the refrigerator for 24 hours 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.300
 but I guess I already have an answer 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.300
 for uninformed people 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.090
 the ingredients you find in the 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.590
 Hortifruti stores in rio de janeiro are 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.880
 Paul and Holy Spirit 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.880
 the addresses are on the website 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:23.340
 www.aocp.com.br 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.340
 and this ends here are waiting for you 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:33.480
 happens in July 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.120
 ah
