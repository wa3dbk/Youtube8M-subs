give<00:02:07.480> this<00:02:07.750> cruise<00:02:08.110> control<00:02:08.590> out<00:02:08.800> of<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.039> way

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
give this cruise control out of the way

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.790 
give this cruise control out of the way
let's<00:02:11.210> move<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.510> aside<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.900> got<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.050> screw<00:02:12.410> here

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
let's move it aside you got a screw here

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.040 
let's move it aside you got a screw here
and<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.190> screw<00:02:13.490> here<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.000> pull<00:02:14.240> those<00:02:14.390> out<00:02:14.690> and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and a screw here you pull those out and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.710 
and a screw here you pull those out and
then<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.220> mass<00:02:16.520> airflow<00:02:16.790> sensor<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.390> just

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
then the mass airflow sensor is just

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.860 
then the mass airflow sensor is just
this<00:02:17.840> little<00:02:18.050> guy<00:02:18.260> right<00:02:18.440> here<00:02:18.880> now<00:02:19.880> as<00:02:20.630> you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
this little guy right here now as you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.630 
this little guy right here now as you
can<00:02:20.990> see<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:21.470> got<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.710> little<00:02:22.160> bit<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.460> a

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
can see it's got that little bit of a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.430 
can see it's got that little bit of a
bulb<00:02:22.940> thing<00:02:23.390> I've<00:02:23.600> got<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.870> centered<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.350> the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
bulb thing I've got it centered in the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.350 
bulb thing I've got it centered in the
frame<00:02:24.470> right<00:02:24.890> there<00:02:24.920> as<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.850> look<00:02:26.030> at<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.270> from

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
frame right there as you look at it from

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.690 
frame right there as you look at it from
this<00:02:26.600> side<00:02:26.810> it's<00:02:26.990> brown<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.290> gross<00:02:27.650> look<00:02:28.550> at

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
this side it's brown and gross look at

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.860 
this side it's brown and gross look at
it<00:02:28.820> from<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.090> side<00:02:29.270> it's<00:02:29.420> kind<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.690> yellow

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
it from this side it's kind of yellow

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.020 
it from this side it's kind of yellow
and<00:02:30.170> glows<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.440> little<00:02:30.830> bit<00:02:31.010> should<00:02:31.820> glow<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
and glows a little bit should glow a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and glows a little bit should glow a
little<00:02:32.210> bit<00:02:32.540> from<00:02:32.750> both<00:02:32.930> sides<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.490> take<00:02:34.790> that

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
little bit from both sides so take that

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.180 
little bit from both sides so take that
get<00:02:36.050> your<00:02:36.230> good<00:02:36.320> old-fashioned<00:02:36.980> Western

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
get your good old-fashioned Western

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.550 
get your good old-fashioned Western
family<00:02:37.820> isopropyl<00:02:38.480> alcohol<00:02:38.630> if<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.320> can't

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
family isopropyl alcohol if you can't

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.260 
family isopropyl alcohol if you can't
find<00:02:39.770> Western<00:02:40.220> family<00:02:40.610> some<00:02:40.790> other<00:02:40.910> brands

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
find Western family some other brands

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.840 
find Western family some other brands
will<00:02:41.480> too<00:02:41.660> I'm<00:02:42.350> sure

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
will too I'm sure

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.910 
will too I'm sure
so<00:02:43.850> put<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> little<00:02:44.990> in<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.290> lid<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.530> don't

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
so put a little in the lid I don't

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.010 
so put a little in the lid I don't
double<00:02:46.220> dip<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.240> that's<00:02:47.390> why<00:02:47.600> we've<00:02:47.720> got<00:02:47.750> so

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
double dip so that's why we've got so

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.620 
double dip so that's why we've got so
many<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.350> these<00:02:48.550> q-tips<00:02:49.550> we've<00:02:50.060> got<00:02:50.270> four

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
many of these q-tips we've got four

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.260 
many of these q-tips we've got four
swabs<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.410> use<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:52.910> gently

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
swabs I can use and you just gently

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.540 
swabs I can use and you just gently
brush<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.900> with<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.050> isopropyl<00:02:54.830> alcohol<00:02:54.950> and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
brush it with the isopropyl alcohol and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.970 
brush it with the isopropyl alcohol and
basically<00:02:56.510> what<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.780> does<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.470> cleans<00:02:57.770> it

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
basically what that does is it cleans it

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.280 
basically what that does is it cleans it
off<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.850> that's<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.300> pretty<00:02:59.510> much<00:02:59.750> sterile

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
off so that's just pretty much sterile

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.470 
off so that's just pretty much sterile
but<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.460> doesn't<00:03:01.970> affect<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:04.240> compound<00:03:05.240> that

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
but it doesn't affect the compound that

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.180 
but it doesn't affect the compound that
is<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.620> base<00:03:06.770> of<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:09.010> heard<00:03:10.010> people

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
is at the base of that heard people

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.250 
is at the base of that heard people
using<00:03:10.520> brake<00:03:10.910> parts<00:03:11.210> cleaner<00:03:11.390> but<00:03:11.930> stuff

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
using brake parts cleaner but stuff

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.620 
using brake parts cleaner but stuff
tends<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.620> eat<00:03:12.830> everything<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.210> wouldn't

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
tends to eat everything so I wouldn't

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.630 
tends to eat everything so I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:14.990> that<00:03:15.230> I'd<00:03:15.440> recommend<00:03:15.640> isopropyl

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
recommend that I'd recommend isopropyl

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.530 
recommend that I'd recommend isopropyl

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
have you want to get your codes read and

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.590 
have you want to get your codes read and
see<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:27.740> that's<00:03:27.920> what<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.460> this<00:03:28.790> had<00:03:29.120> six

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
see if that's what it is this had six

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.600 
see if that's what it is this had six
codes<00:03:29.930> four<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.620> them<00:03:30.800> are<00:03:30.950> from<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.190> spark

electrode and the other two codes were
the<00:03:41.420> p0<00:03:42.020> 171<00:03:42.710> which<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:43.040> just<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.400> lean<00:03:43.760> code

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
the p0 171 which is just a lean code

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.360 
the p0 171 which is just a lean code
could<00:03:44.510> also<00:03:44.660> be<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.960> vacuum<00:03:45.410> link<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.890> see<00:03:46.160> that

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
could also be a vacuum link I see that

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.400 
could also be a vacuum link I see that
from<00:03:46.790> time<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.150> time<00:03:47.210> but<00:03:47.630> almost<00:03:47.990> all<00:03:48.290> the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
from time to time but almost all the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.000 
from time to time but almost all the
time<00:03:48.620> like<00:03:49.220> with<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.610> one<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.090> get<00:03:50.480> a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
time like with this one you just get a

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.830 
time like with this one you just get a
mass<00:03:52.010> airflow<00:03:52.280> sensor<00:03:52.490> that<00:03:53.090> reads<00:03:53.270> like<00:03:53.510> this

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
mass airflow sensor that reads like this

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.770 
mass airflow sensor that reads like this
and<00:03:54.130> basically<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.730> winds<00:03:56.120> up<00:03:56.210> going<00:03:56.450> lean

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
and basically it winds up going lean

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.660 
and basically it winds up going lean
because<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.290> can't<00:03:57.500> sense<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:58.100> air<00:03:58.370> coming

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
because it can't sense the air coming

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.880 
because it can't sense the air coming
through<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.870> thinks<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.200> there's<00:04:00.470> no<00:04:00.650> air

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
through so it thinks that there's no air

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.740 
through so it thinks that there's no air
coming<00:04:01.130> through<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.730> allows<00:04:01.970> for<00:04:02.270> lots<00:04:02.510> and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
coming through so it allows for lots and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.720 
coming through so it allows for lots and
lots<00:04:02.960> of<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:04.040> makes<00:04:04.250> your<00:04:04.430> air<00:04:04.580> fuel

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
lots of it and it makes your air fuel

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.190 
lots of it and it makes your air fuel
mist<00:04:05.030> mixture

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
mist mixture

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.520 
mist mixture
lean<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.820> anyway<00:04:08.690> well<00:04:08.960> that's<00:04:09.140> out<00:04:09.320> full

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
lean so anyway well that's out full

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.950 
lean so anyway well that's out full
Cheers
