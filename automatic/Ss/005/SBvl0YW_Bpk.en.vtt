today<00:00:04.529> we're<00:00:04.830> installing<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.729> kit<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
today we're installing a kit a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.370 
today we're installing a kit a
low-profile<00:00:07.189> silhouette<00:00:08.189> smoke<00:00:08.519> alarm<00:00:09.380> as

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
low-profile silhouette smoke alarm as

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.549 
low-profile silhouette smoke alarm as
you<00:00:10.530> can<00:00:10.679> see<00:00:11.269> the<00:00:12.269> silhouette<00:00:12.540> has<00:00:12.929> about<00:00:13.289> a

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
you can see the silhouette has about a

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.619 
you can see the silhouette has about a
half<00:00:13.950> inch<00:00:14.190> exposure<00:00:14.730> from<00:00:14.999> the<00:00:15.179> ceiling

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:15.629 
half inch exposure from the ceiling

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.840 
half inch exposure from the ceiling
versus<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.470> standard<00:00:16.740> units<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.460> come<00:00:17.700> in

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
versus the standard units that come in

most houses are about an inch and a half

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.210 
most houses are about an inch and a half
inch<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.910> quarter<00:00:22.070> so<00:00:24.769> with<00:00:25.769> any<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.130> these

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
inch and a quarter so with any of these

inch and a quarter so with any of these
projects<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.089> make<00:00:27.269> sure<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.689> turn

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
projects you have to make sure you turn

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.079 
projects you have to make sure you turn
up<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.259> power<00:00:28.410> we've<00:00:29.039> done<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.429> already

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
up the power we've done that already

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.020 
up the power we've done that already
most<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> units<00:00:31.769> or<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.220> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> units<00:00:32.850> on

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
most of the units or all of the units on

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.000 
most of the units or all of the units on
the<00:00:33.060> market<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.840> twist<00:00:34.170> off<00:00:35.600> pull<00:00:36.600> them<00:00:36.719> down

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
the market just twist off pull them down

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.270 
the market just twist off pull them down
they'll<00:00:38.010> come<00:00:38.370> standard<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:38.879> three<00:00:39.270> wires

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
they'll come standard with three wires

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
they'll come standard with three wires
it's<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.340> good<00:00:41.550> idea<00:00:41.699> even<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> powers<00:00:42.719> off

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it's a good idea even on the powers off

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
it's a good idea even on the powers off
to<00:00:43.350> use<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> voltage<00:00:44.129> meter<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.760> voltage<00:00:45.149> tester

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
to use a voltage meter or voltage tester

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660 
to use a voltage meter or voltage tester
just<00:00:46.020> test<00:00:46.260> these<00:00:46.469> wires<00:00:46.739> make<00:00:47.070> sure<00:00:47.250> none<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
just test these wires make sure none of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
just test these wires make sure none of
them<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:48.000> hot<00:00:48.620> none<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.859> are<00:00:52.070> now<00:00:53.070> we

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
them are hot none of them are now we

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
them are hot none of them are now we
twist<00:00:53.399> off<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.090> mud<00:00:54.449> ring<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.109> box<00:00:55.320> ring

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
twist off the mud ring or the box ring

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.280 
twist off the mud ring or the box ring
here<00:00:57.800> hold<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> wires<00:01:02.719> pretty<00:01:03.719> standard

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
here hold on the wires pretty standard

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
here hold on the wires pretty standard
in<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.559> industry<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> black<00:01:05.550> wire<00:01:05.880> red<00:01:06.300> wire

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.649 
in the industry a black wire red wire
and<00:01:06.870> white<00:01:07.110> wire<00:01:08.060> now<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.210> gonna<00:01:09.390> disconnect

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and white wire now I'm gonna disconnect

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.039 
and white wire now I'm gonna disconnect
these<00:01:10.170> way<00:01:10.409> nuts<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.040> install<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.570> ring<00:01:12.810> that

these way nuts and install the ring that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.830 
these way nuts and install the ring that
comes<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> silhouette<00:01:14.280> unit<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
comes with the silhouette unit so you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.859 
comes with the silhouette unit so you
can<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.520> I've<00:01:17.520> installed<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.330> wiring

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
can see I've installed the wiring

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.210 
can see I've installed the wiring
harness<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.890> comes<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> unit<00:01:22.070> like<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220

up<00:01:34.700> snaps<00:01:35.700> together<00:01:39.680> just<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.770> that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
up snaps together just like that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.120 
up snaps together just like that
I'm<00:01:43.390> gonna<00:01:43.600> feed<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.020> wires<00:01:44.229> up<00:01:44.530> into<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.920> box

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
I'm gonna feed the wires up into the box

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.310 
I'm gonna feed the wires up into the box
get<00:01:45.549> them<00:01:45.729> out<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.119> way<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.110> harness

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
get them out of the way of the harness

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.800 
get them out of the way of the harness
just<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.640> can<00:01:54.820> see<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:55.150> dog<00:01:55.450> ear

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
just like that you can see this dog ear

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.929 
just like that you can see this dog ear
here<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.350> lines<00:01:56.680> up<00:01:56.950> with<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.310> notch<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:57.759> the

here that lines up with the notch on the

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.600 
here that lines up with the notch on the
unit<00:01:59.130> you<00:02:00.130> know<00:02:00.250> which<00:02:00.460> way<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.700> feed<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.180> on

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
unit you know which way to feed it on

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.850 
unit you know which way to feed it on
just<00:02:03.610> push<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.149> up<00:02:04.830> twist<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:06.100> like<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:08.110> snap

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
just push it up twist it like that snap

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.059 
just push it up twist it like that snap
in<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.479> as<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:10.989> see<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.380> profile<00:02:11.830> on

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
in and as you can see the profile on

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.300 
in and as you can see the profile on
that<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.489> about<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.760> half<00:02:13.000> inch<00:02:13.890> much<00:02:14.890> cleaner

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
that is about a half inch much cleaner

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.990 
that is about a half inch much cleaner
than<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.760> standard<00:02:16.180> unit<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.220> concludes

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
than the standard unit so that concludes

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.520 
than the standard unit so that concludes
the<00:02:19.300> installation<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> kin<00:02:20.500> of
