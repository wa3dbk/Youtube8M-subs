00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
so that that happens and in that was

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.810 
so that that happens and in that was
actually<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> very<00:00:56.250> good<00:00:56.550> move<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.760> his

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
actually not a very good move on his

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.310 
actually not a very good move on his
part<00:00:56.940> because<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.809> kill<00:00:57.960> him<00:00:58.050> off<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.260> an

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
part because I just kill him off with an

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
part because I just kill him off with an
ice<00:00:58.440> beam<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> critical<00:00:59.550> hit<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.090> then

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
ice beam it was a critical hit but then

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.250 
ice beam it was a critical hit but then
again<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.629> don't<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:00.960> he<00:01:01.020> would<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.199> been

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
again I don't think he would have been

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
again I don't think he would have been
able<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> kill<00:01:01.770> me<00:01:01.949> regardless<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> was<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
able to kill me regardless if it was a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.240 
able to kill me regardless if it was a
crit<00:01:03.619> regardless<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.739> he<00:01:04.830> would<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.040> lived

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
crit regardless if he would have lived

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.590 
crit regardless if he would have lived
he<00:01:05.729> probably<00:01:05.909> wouldn't<00:01:06.150> been<00:01:06.299> able<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> do

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
he probably wouldn't been able to do

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.929 
he probably wouldn't been able to do
shit<00:01:06.720> anyways<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.890> brings<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.159> volcano<00:01:08.700> and

which<00:04:31.880> has<00:04:32.090> not<00:04:32.270> been<00:04:32.330> a-been<00:04:33.140> out<00:04:33.440> in<00:04:33.590> the

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
which has not been a-been out in the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.470 
which has not been a-been out in the
battle<00:04:33.950> yet<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.730> go<00:04:34.850> for<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.060> substitute

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
battle yet and I go for the substitute

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.660 
battle yet and I go for the substitute
here<00:04:35.690> just<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:35.960> see<00:04:36.110> what<00:04:36.230> he's<00:04:36.320> gonna<00:04:36.380> do<00:04:36.680> he

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
here just to see what he's gonna do he

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.070 
here just to see what he's gonna do he
does<00:04:37.820> reveal<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.240> me<00:04:38.330> they<00:04:38.480> has<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.870> stone

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
does reveal to me they has the stone

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.980 
does reveal to me they has the stone
edge<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.620> kind<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:39.860> sucks<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:40.940> uh<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.540> can't

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
edge so that kind of sucks so uh I can't

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.740 
edge so that kind of sucks so uh I can't
set<00:04:42.650> up<00:04:42.680> an<00:04:42.890> initial<00:04:43.220> sweep<00:04:43.400> with<00:04:43.880> my<00:04:44.150> Sheneneh

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
set up an initial sweep with my Sheneneh

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.230 
set up an initial sweep with my Sheneneh
so<00:04:45.740> I<00:04:45.800> get<00:04:45.950> some<00:04:46.040> leftovers<00:04:46.550> we're<00:04:46.940> all<00:04:47.030> just

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
so I get some leftovers we're all just

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.460 
so I get some leftovers we're all just
kind<00:04:47.390> of<00:04:47.420> getting<00:04:47.600> leftovers<00:04:48.050> up<00:04:48.170> in<00:04:48.290> here<00:04:48.440> I

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
kind of getting leftovers up in here I

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.930 
kind of getting leftovers up in here I
go<00:04:48.620> for<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.860> feather<00:04:49.070> dance<00:04:49.310> though<00:04:49.580> because

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
go for the feather dance though because

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.220 
go for the feather dance though because
I<00:04:49.970> figure<00:04:50.300> if<00:04:50.420> I<00:04:50.510> can<00:04:50.660> get<00:04:50.780> his<00:04:50.900> attack<00:04:51.200> to

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
I figure if I can get his attack to

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.970 
I figure if I can get his attack to
minus<00:04:51.680> two<00:04:51.920> I<00:04:52.160> could<00:04:52.790> probably<00:04:53.180> take<00:04:53.660> a

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
minus two I could probably take a

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.620 
minus two I could probably take a
stealth<00:04:54.980> rock<00:04:55.250> left<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.210> right

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
stealth rock left and right

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.000 
stealth rock left and right
he<00:04:56.990> doesn't<00:04:57.290> for<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.470> earthquake<00:04:57.830> though

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
he doesn't for the earthquake though

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.300 
he doesn't for the earthquake though
which<00:04:58.190> was<00:04:58.310> out<00:04:58.430> actually<00:04:58.880> pretty<00:04:59.180> surprising

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
which was out actually pretty surprising

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.970 
which was out actually pretty surprising
considering<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.730> um<00:05:02.440> he<00:05:03.440> should<00:05:03.710> have<00:05:03.800> just

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
considering that um he should have just

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.350 
considering that um he should have just
gone<00:05:04.100> for<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.340> stone<00:05:04.580> edge<00:05:04.730> not<00:05:04.970> predicting

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
gone for the stone edge not predicting

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.300 
gone for the stone edge not predicting
me<00:05:05.480> to<00:05:05.570> switch<00:05:05.810> but<00:05:06.110> he<00:05:06.200> does<00:05:06.350> switch<00:05:06.620> into

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
me to switch but he does switch into

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.070 
me to switch but he does switch into
iron<00:05:07.550> man<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.120> stupid<00:05:08.480> little<00:05:08.630> ball<00:05:08.900> of

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
iron man the stupid little ball of

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.440 
iron man the stupid little ball of
