 I wanted to show you today a few 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.010
 kicks 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:23.180
 blows are not long anymore as well as 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.490
 counterattack it can be used 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.530
 since u can't see french 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.640
 push your feet push like karate 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.640
 try this 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.370
 so how much is everything like boxing or mom 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:48.460
 choice of opinion for the knee rises 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.460
 taller and how is it different from others 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.210
 mainly applied 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.710
 hit that bit but it's classic 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.220
 blow i am applying in order to 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.410
 I saw my opponent and made a block 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.720
 performance indicator why we do 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.550
 we will not do it is extremely simple 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.020
 lifting guitar you pulled 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.170
 and got bent back he pushed 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.369
 effective in that more notice with you 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.280
 Let's work on this I see even so much 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:30.620

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.750
 how to stand 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.950
 after this blow you can continue like that 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.280
 blow is delivered 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.580
 not 5 and not completely like this 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.580
 run 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.850
 like a knife 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.850
 as if you are throwing 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
