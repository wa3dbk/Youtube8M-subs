00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.529
 worldwide there are rallycross competitions 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.080
 where small converted series cars 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.029
 exciting races with about 600 ps 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.850
 clear offroad round courses 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.779
 to be driven vehicle contacts are 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.689
 just as normal 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.760
 the jumps and cool actually hits 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.369
 just like on offroad races in the rc 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.960
 area obvious so such 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.649
 Vehicles on the model athlete 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.200
 offer 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.629
 so traveling hobby also offers a new one 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.340
 model of bad era of 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 The Ford 4 is the optically the team 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.600
 imitated by olsberg msc 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 the global rallycross competitors 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.300
 dominate the model is complete 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.649
 finished painted and pasted 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.260
 next to the car are also still 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.239
 a spectrum dxb remote control for 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.020
 magnum batteries and accessories in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 delivery 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.340
 the complete chassis including the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.329
 axles is made of plastic alu is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.339
 not to be found here 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.500
 the chassis tub is on the sides 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.080
 slightly increases what penetrate the dirt 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.360
 should stop as drive shafts comes 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 telescope cvd copies for use 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.950
 the qualitatively a very good impression 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.869
 make the adjustment options on 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.270
 Suspension are very manageable 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.210
 the first test drive is first with 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.049
 completed a 21 lipo battery 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.180
 amazingly, the vac therapy goes 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.930
 first with the small battery already 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.060
 be right before 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.650
 The dampers are very soft so he 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.540
 when braking one springs up to the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.310
 Body on the floor grinds the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.110
 spring preload should therefore the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.120
 enclosed plasters slightly increased 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.830
 Now everything looks good 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.840
 better 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.710
 the integrated avc system works 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.630
 perfect 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.810
 the driver can here the driving behavior 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.700
 to adjust according to his wishes 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.320
 with a 3 s lipo is the performance 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 really impressive at 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.260
 solid gas flies fly the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.240
 stones only through the area 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.040
 It can quite while driving 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.420
 happen that the fiesta the ground 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.750
 loses under the wheels and through the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.759
 the vatea ford fiesta flies in the air 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.970
 Great car for beginners as well 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.530
 also for old modellbau have 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.080
 Here you get everything you need from one 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.580
 rtr set expected 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.440
 the high quality materials and the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.850
 Sophisticated technology is in the making 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.709
 Stability noticeable 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.150
 only the damper springs can 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.860
 be a little harder and one 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.010
 shaft cover would not be synonymous 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.010
 bad
