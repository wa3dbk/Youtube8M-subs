00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello no girls if I bring you a new 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.509
 tutorial in this case is going to be a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.000
 tutorial on how to get some nails 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.310
 velvet effect first of all 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.600
 what I wanted to tell you is how good these 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.640
 are all the products that we are going to 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.490
 need first of all we're going to 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.439
 need a nail polish to use it 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.400
 as a basis in this case I am using 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 the number 240 of kiko the following goes to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.189
 be a transparent nail polish and what 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.070
 follow this are the powders that 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.750
 we are going to use that if you can what 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.199
 you can ask on this website what is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.420
 by british store dotcom and you come what 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.140
 what is this product with the tweezers for 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.840
 take and the brochita to do the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.370
 final finish is worth of the nail 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.929
 this is the effect that we are going to get 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 and well it's something different and it has 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.629
 it seemed interesting the first thing that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.460
 let's do is going to be apply a 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.649
 base enamel and in this case it is worth 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.559
 I said I applied this from kiko the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.420
 following very simple let's take the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.400
 transparent enamel 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.930
 and we are going to apply it quite 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.930
 generously throughout the nail 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.860
 well then without waiting 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.470
 too much time we're going to catch these 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.130
 little hairs and we are going to put them on top 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.130
 of the nail 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.540
 A) Yes 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.380
 I'm going to use it on top of the boat 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.840
 Botecito then to avoid staining it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.370
 everything but good I have put some folios 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.370
 under the desk 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.180
 let's push a little bit like that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.530
 so that the product adheres well 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.369
 let's give a tap we hope a 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.640
 little bit to dry and then 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.209
 we remove the excess well now with it what 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.590
 what is this this brush we are going to push 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.670
 a little and withdraw 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.670
 the excess 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.150
 well, as you see 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.460
 As you can see, this is the effect that remains 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.210
 then let's do the 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.210
 next nail 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.420
 and we repeat the same thing we take polish 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.420
 transparent 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.750
 we apply it 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.540
 and then we are going to take the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.540
 polvito 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.360
 and we leave it we apply it over 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.920
 and we are going to press a little 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.430
 and now with the brush we remove the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.430
 excess 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.460
 and we already have the next good me 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.840
 while I'm going to finish these two and 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.840
 I come back with the final result 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.860
 Well this is the final result 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.590
 As you can see, it's something quite different and 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.379
 Well I hope you liked it as 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.520
 You see, it's very easy to do and nothing 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.520
 is going to make the next video
