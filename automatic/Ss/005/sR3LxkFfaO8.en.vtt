00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello dear friends with you scary 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.879
 top and this is a new edition of our Russian 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.290
 cities in minecraft ok 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 today's release I built it 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.900
 Metro Star's built 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.089
 the tram you asked me for a long time 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 I made the tram line I promised myself 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.050
 when you are 2 st her resident is now almost 25 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.779
 thousand already could that i have small 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.119
 The delays were all with mycroft 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.119
 from the video this is due to the fact that I 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.680
 switched to a new version of minecraft 18 here 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 and in the quality of it we are of course all 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.329
 let's see her total for let's get started 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.730
 please from the new metro station 5 here 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.430
 the bike master then I'll show here the station 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 metro star we got this 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.110
 we have sounds here right now 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.850
 cut down means that and that I can get you 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.500
 show here such from us so observe 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
 standard bill not to see here 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.539
 new lamps appeared before this pine 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.770
 deaths are connected in principle 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.590
 on the basis would they look 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.809
 cool granite pillars like and 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.789
 smooth diorite is more accurate here confused 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.270
 I now put a little differently 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.869
 fall before the passage is inserted that is not 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.180
 as it used to be but just a green block and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.150
 I will put the stove so much 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 instead, well, more efficiently how are you 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 you look cool to see us 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.659
 such dark fences are like new 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.600
 turnstiles such here we pass and what 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.670
 and this is our subway station Star Well 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.250
 I got a little bit even boring you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 I will say there are waiting well I would not build 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.030
 in general she 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.370
 not an arch somehow done but just empty 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.230
 even dragging the box so I wanted 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.160
 would build but unfortunately I don’t 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.110
 there was enough space 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.900
 because we got a narrow platform here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970
 ok now 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.570
 much better and as you see we are new here 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.900
 tiles 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.729
 here we have this dark recognized here 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.500
 Generally some interesting topic and give 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.350
 an hour though camps no longer need something here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.760
 super through the type there so I will not click on 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.890
 contra and i fast i'm flying 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.520
 ok inscription star and basically everything 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.990
 even there is no ad I just built it 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.420
 okay guys let's see more this 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.100
 we have a dead end standard here that we have 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.410
 end station star all we have on 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.700
 first line six stations also 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.690
 slowly build the second line I'll 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.790
 extend soon 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.320
 the clan is still an interesting topic on 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.989
 a tunnel that is it as if 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.459
 reworked the arrow at the depot he at all 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.680
 the water path falls with it for a long time 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.750
 bother not know whom to bypass everything 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.750
 same as it is done here according to our type 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.489
 Petersburg and did all these here 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.500
 at 100 inversion as it is available as you can see 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.160
 far race station is it even 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.170
 very good 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.730
 u frank as we can see and columns 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.230
 we pass it all as we have at the station 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.660
 Metro Avtovo there all the same 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.330
 happening is about to get it herself 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.820
 First metro station in the city so we 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.620
 clamp then arrow 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.580
 oh no guys i forgot to put something 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.910
 this is us a lever 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.820
 here so that is attack ignores this 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.350
 arrow and from straight and everything is in principle yes 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.540
 here in the world a turn to give it too 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.110
 let's see here that is the way out 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.690
 surface here 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.500
 and here's the heat of course a little longer 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.180
 Itself is also so interesting 5 so the best 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.980
 Here in general with the arrows figured out and 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.840
 let's get down to the tram now 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.200
 update by the way in this release 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.730
 by residential buildings it is very good 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.060
 that's because here's me until the fig was so 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.650

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.140

 east and make a line here for example he 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.720

 the most important is to strive for takhet not 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.439
 I know these sites where we wash my 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.749
