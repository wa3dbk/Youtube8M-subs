00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 first thing I'm going to do before 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.899
 use the transfer paper so that 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.179
 there is no problem is to take the picture and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.860
 print it on plain paper in a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.350
 folio normal din a4 to see how it comes out 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.810
 once we have printed on paper 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.500
 folio the image and we have seen that the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.269
 color is fine that the shape and that is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.119
 printed the way we want in 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.849
 vertical let's proceed to do it in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.399
 the transfer paper to then put it in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.280
 the shirt in here we already have our 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.980
 drawing made on transfer paper as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.950
 you can see you have gone backwards 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.649
 of how I showed you the other photo and it's 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.489
 that in the computer there is an option for 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 at least in mine to print on paper 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.130
 special to make transfer for 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.520
 t-shirts and that's why I've used this 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.930
 to do it in this special role and for 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.940
 that has come out the other way around because now 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.210
 we supposedly have to iron the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.490
 this side so that the drawing comes out 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.490
 in this in this orientation 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.520
 well now something super important that 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.429
 we have to do is ironing very well 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.130
 the area where we are going to put the 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:21.909
 decal transfer paper as well 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.909
 what looks like a decal 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.220
 for example here we are going to put 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.220
 we put the iron on top 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.440
 making little circles 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.869
 we were five or six minutes either have already 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.280
 past five minutes and we're going to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.280
 remove the sea 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.240
 and well here you have to yosimar me and the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.689
 shirt perfectly put now me 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.689
 I'm going to put it 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.440
 good here is my 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.490
 my god and with the sea, and as you can see 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.800
 perfectly fit 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.620
 I do not rule this neck a little bit 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.310
 because I do not like this is another shirt 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.980
 This is from the set and it's from Mario 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.100
 Good thing it looks the same with paper 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.500
 transfer here I do not know what happened but it came out 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.450
 a little weird but I'm happy 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.760
 because I like it a lot 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.849
 I really wanted to have one like that and 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.129
 well up here here the video 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.840
 I hope you liked a very 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.069
 great and see you in more videos 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.069
 I'm happy
