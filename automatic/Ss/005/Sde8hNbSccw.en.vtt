00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
the left but it still Shane just a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.270 
the left but it still Shane just a
little<00:03:54.630> bit<00:03:54.720> by<00:03:54.900> something<00:03:55.260> crazy<00:03:55.530> or

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
little bit by something crazy or

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
whatever it's just regular because all

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.600 
whatever it's just regular because all
we've<00:03:58.709> sheds<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.100> course

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
we've sheds of course

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.580 
we've sheds of course
so<00:04:00.030> it's<00:04:00.269> regular<00:04:00.660> shedding<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:03.380> tangling<00:04:04.380> I

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
so it's regular shedding and tangling I

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.710 
so it's regular shedding and tangling I
don't<00:04:04.830> really<00:04:04.950> get<00:04:05.100> any<00:04:05.280> tangles<00:04:05.489> either<00:04:05.880> but

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
don't really get any tangles either but

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.410 
don't really get any tangles either but
this<00:04:06.989> 18<00:04:07.500> which<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.769> have<00:04:07.920> at<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.100> top<00:04:08.299> if<00:04:09.299> you

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
this 18 which I have at the top if you

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
this 18 which I have at the top if you
saw<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.630> video<00:04:09.810> when<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.810> initial<00:04:13.170> review

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
saw the video when I the initial review

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.780 
saw the video when I the initial review
video<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.100> hair<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.959> 18<00:04:16.530> inch<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:17.040> think<00:04:17.669> it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
video of the hair the 18 inch I think it

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.670 
video of the hair the 18 inch I think it
like<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.510> humidity<00:04:18.870> or<00:04:19.140> something<00:04:19.380> up<00:04:19.470> stuck

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
like the humidity or something up stuck

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.900 
like the humidity or something up stuck
in<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.979> package<00:04:20.430> and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
in the package and

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.210 
in the package and
it<00:04:22.210> may<00:04:22.420> sit<00:04:22.600> here<00:04:22.750> like<00:04:22.930> Maddie<00:04:23.290> entangling

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
it may sit here like Maddie entangling

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
it may sit here like Maddie entangling
so<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:26.190> think<00:04:27.190> that's<00:04:27.430> why<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.610> 18-inch<00:04:28.000> was

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
so I think that's why the 18-inch was

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.350 
so I think that's why the 18-inch was
acting<00:04:28.540> like<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:30.460> just<00:04:30.850> see<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.240> the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
acting like that and I just see that the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.660 
acting like that and I just see that the
18-inch<00:04:31.750> is<00:04:32.080> getting<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.590> tangled<00:04:33.460> more

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
18-inch is getting it tangled more

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.060 
18-inch is getting it tangled more
tangle<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.390> like<00:04:34.600> it<00:04:35.470> just<00:04:35.650> gets<00:04:35.800> tangled

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
tangle you like it just gets tangled

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.960 
tangle you like it just gets tangled
very<00:04:36.400> easily<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:38.640> just<00:04:39.640> shutting<00:04:39.940> a

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
very easily and it just shutting a

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.250 
very easily and it just shutting a
little<00:04:40.240> bit<00:04:40.420> more<00:04:40.690> than<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:40.960> rest<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.200> the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
little bit more than the rest of the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.200 
little bit more than the rest of the
hair<00:04:41.440> but<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.220> 20<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:42.760> 22<00:04:43.120> inch<00:04:43.480> is<00:04:44.320> great<00:04:45.210> any
