100% in this case I'm going to go to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.029 
100% in this case I'm going to go to
200%<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.690> I've<00:00:54.809> got<00:00:54.989> some<00:00:55.199> familiar<00:00:55.590> sliders

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
200% and I've got some familiar sliders

here if you've ever used unsharp mask

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.119 
here if you've ever used unsharp mask
this<00:00:58.980> works<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.789> like<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.649> like<00:01:01.649> unsharp

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
this works a lot like that like unsharp

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.910 
this works a lot like that like unsharp
mask<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.809> aggressively<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
mask if you use this aggressively you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.300 
mask if you use this aggressively you
will<00:01:05.189> start<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.880> create<00:01:06.439> artifacts<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> you

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
will start to create artifacts and you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.760 
will start to create artifacts and you
can<00:01:08.430> control<00:01:08.790> those<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:09.840> degree<00:01:10.140> with

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
can control those to some degree with

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.440 
can control those to some degree with
the<00:01:10.799> detail<00:01:11.250> slider<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.180> kind<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the detail slider here it's kind of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.840 
the detail slider here it's kind of
similar<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.080> threshold<00:01:13.590> slider<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.580> one

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
similar to the threshold slider now one

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
similar to the threshold slider now one
thing<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.570> Camera<00:01:15.900> Raw<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.389 
of course the shortcoming here is that
it<00:01:51.899> does<00:01:52.079> create<00:01:52.320> artifacts<00:01:52.890> when<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.159> use<00:01:53.280> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
it does create artifacts when you use it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.889 
it does create artifacts when you use it
aggressively<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> would<00:01:54.329> only<00:01:54.450> sharpen<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
aggressively so I would only sharpen a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
aggressively so I would only sharpen a
little<00:01:55.259> bit<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.619> Camera<00:01:56.310> Raw<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:57.090> more

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
little bit in Camera Raw for more

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.550 
little bit in Camera Raw for more
aggressive<00:01:57.659> sharpening<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.259> want<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.469> use

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
aggressive sharpening you want to use

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.700 
aggressive sharpening you want to use
Photoshop<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.810> let's<00:02:00.990> cancel<00:02:01.200> out<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
Photoshop so let's cancel out of this

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.740 
Photoshop so let's cancel out of this
and<00:02:02.009> we'll<00:02:02.850> come<00:02:02.880> back<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> our<00:02:03.299> image<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and we'll come back to our image and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.359 
and we'll come back to our image and
again<00:02:03.869> let's<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.500> double<00:02:05.070> click<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.310> our

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
again let's just double click on our

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.980 
again let's just double click on our
zoom<00:02:05.670> tool<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.119> come<00:02:06.329> into<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.540> hundred<00:02:06.840> percent

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
zoom tool to come into a hundred percent

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.529 
zoom tool to come into a hundred percent
and<00:02:07.819> we're<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> come<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> our

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and we're going to come up here to our

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
and we're going to come up here to our
filter<00:02:09.929> menu<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:11.069> there<00:02:11.310> are<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> lot<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
filter menu now there are a lot of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.160 
filter menu now there are a lot of
different<00:02:12.060> ways<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.209> sharpen<00:02:12.720> we're<00:02:12.989> just

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
different ways to sharpen we're just

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.940 
different ways to sharpen we're just
going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.319> focus<00:02:13.680> on

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
going to focus on

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.160 
going to focus on
not<00:02:14.580> using<00:02:14.940> one<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.450> making<00:02:15.720> sure<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.050> we

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
not using one and making sure that we

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.680 
not using one and making sure that we
use<00:02:16.319> another<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.280> before<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:17.879> let's

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
use another but before we do that let's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.780 
use another but before we do that let's
convert<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.260> smart<00:02:19.560> filters<00:02:19.980> that's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
convert to smart filters that's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.089 
convert to smart filters that's
essentially<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> filter<00:02:21.959> layer<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:22.950> back

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
essentially a filter layer I can go back

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.280 
essentially a filter layer I can go back
and<00:02:23.280> change<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.670> properties<00:02:24.180> after<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.050> fact

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and change the properties after the fact

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.309 
and change the properties after the fact
I<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.620> edit<00:02:25.800> my<00:02:25.980> sharpening<00:02:26.580> afterwards<00:02:27.450> so

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
I can edit my sharpening afterwards so

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.140 
I can edit my sharpening afterwards so
in<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> filter<00:02:28.830> menu<00:02:28.980> here<00:02:29.370> let's<00:02:29.670> first<00:02:29.910> look

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
in the filter menu here let's first look

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.910 
in the filter menu here let's first look
at<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.660> common<00:02:31.080> way<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> sharpen<00:02:31.470> but

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
at a really common way to sharpen but

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.410 
at a really common way to sharpen but
one<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.220> I'm<00:02:32.310> not<00:02:32.459> going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> recommend<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
one that I'm not going to recommend and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.839 
one that I'm not going to recommend and
that's<00:02:33.870> unsharp<00:02:34.380> mask<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:35.400> has<00:02:35.580> been<00:02:35.730> in

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
that's unsharp mask this has been in

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.270 
that's unsharp mask this has been in
here<00:02:36.030> forever<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.989> works<00:02:37.230> really<00:02:37.530> well<00:02:37.650> it's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
here forever it works really well it's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.150 
here forever it works really well it's
very<00:02:38.550> similar<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> what<00:02:39.209> we<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:39.390> did<00:02:39.750> in

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
very similar to what we just did in

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.530 
very similar to what we just did in
Camera<00:02:41.160> Raw<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.510> can

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
Camera Raw you can see that we can

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.240 
Camera Raw you can see that we can
sharpen<00:02:42.900> here<00:02:43.319> but<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.620> soon<00:02:43.830> as<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.069> get

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
sharpen here but as soon as we get

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.070 
sharpen here but as soon as we get
aggressive<00:02:44.940> we're<00:02:45.510> going<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.690> pick<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:45.989> a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
aggressive we're going to pick up a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.990 
aggressive we're going to pick up a
bunch<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.349> artifacts<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.430> got<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> funny<00:02:47.910> name

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
bunch of artifacts it's got a funny name

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.850 
bunch of artifacts it's got a funny name
a<00:02:48.420> lot<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.810> people<00:02:49.019> know<00:02:49.140> about<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.590> lot<00:02:49.799> of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
a lot of people know about it a lot of

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.410 
a lot of people know about it a lot of
people<00:02:50.069> use<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.459> but<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:50.849> is<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> better<00:02:51.299> way

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
people use it but there is a better way

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.539 
people use it but there is a better way
to<00:02:51.540> do<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.680> let's<00:02:52.860> cancel<00:02:53.099> out<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.430> that

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
to do this so let's cancel out of that

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.120 
to do this so let's cancel out of that
and<00:02:54.590> come<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.709> here<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.040> smart<00:02:56.430> sharpen<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:59.010> can

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
and come in here to smart sharpen we can

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.559 
and come in here to smart sharpen we can
do<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> lot<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.489> unique<00:02:59.819> things<00:02:59.880> with<00:03:00.269> smart

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
do a lot of unique things with smart

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.000 
do a lot of unique things with smart
sharpen<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.110> can<00:03:01.890> zoom<00:03:02.160> in<00:03:02.340> closer<00:03:03.620> I've<00:03:04.620> got<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
sharpen I can zoom in closer I've got a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.610 
sharpen I can zoom in closer I've got a
nice<00:03:05.220> preview<00:03:05.610> here<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.599> can<00:03:06.780> have<00:03:06.930> our<00:03:07.170> image

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
nice preview here we can have our image

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.000 
nice preview here we can have our image
at<00:03:07.769> 100%<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.519> our<00:03:09.060> preview<00:03:09.540> here<00:03:09.870> at<00:03:09.959> 200%<00:03:10.769> I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
at 100% and our preview here at 200% I

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.990 
at 100% and our preview here at 200% I
want<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.090> set<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.079> lens<00:03:13.319> blur<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.849> can

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
want to set this to lens blur and I can

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.379 
want to set this to lens blur and I can
see<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.360> even<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.930> aggressively<00:03:16.769> sharpen

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
see that even if I aggressively sharpen

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.330 
see that even if I aggressively sharpen
because<00:03:18.389> I've<00:03:18.510> got<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:19.130> reduced<00:03:20.130> noise

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
because I've got this reduced noise

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.059 
because I've got this reduced noise
slider<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.180> get<00:03:22.079> all<00:03:22.170> those<00:03:22.290> artifacts<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.889> got

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
slider I get all those artifacts I got

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.449 
slider I get all those artifacts I got
before<00:03:23.269> but<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.299> can<00:03:24.510> wash<00:03:24.780> those<00:03:25.079> away<00:03:25.459> using

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
before but I can wash those away using

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.150 
before but I can wash those away using
reduce<00:03:26.760> noise<00:03:27.000> now<00:03:27.989> let's<00:03:28.560> say<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.709> committed

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
reduce noise now let's say I committed

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.830 
reduce noise now let's say I committed
this<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.489> obviously<00:03:29.579> this<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.120> way<00:03:30.780> too

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
this and obviously this is way too

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.050 
this and obviously this is way too
crunchy<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.530> way<00:03:31.680> too<00:03:31.739> sharpened<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
crunchy and way too sharpened the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.349 
crunchy and way too sharpened the
benefit<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:34.230> using<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.799> smart<00:03:35.370> filter<00:03:35.579> is<00:03:35.970> that

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
benefit to using a smart filter is that

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.120 
benefit to using a smart filter is that
I<00:03:36.389> can<00:03:36.569> change<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.109> after<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.470> fact<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:37.980> if<00:03:38.040> I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
I can change that after the fact so if I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.099 
I can change that after the fact so if I
go<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.400> print<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.569> find<00:03:39.720> that's<00:03:39.959> way

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
go and print this and I find that's way

it<00:04:01.769> but<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.400> truth<00:04:02.609> is<00:04:02.760> if<00:04:02.910> you're<00:04:03.060> using<00:04:03.090> a

it but the truth is if you're using a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.240 
it but the truth is if you're using a

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
smart filter workflow you can always

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.430 
smart filter workflow you can always
change<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.819> parameters<00:04:06.359> after<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.870> fact<00:04:07.109> so

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
change the parameters after the fact so

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.020 
change the parameters after the fact so
if<00:04:07.560> you're<00:04:07.680> going<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:07.950> web<00:04:08.250> if<00:04:08.549> you're

if you're going to the web if you're
going<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.389> print<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:10.349> can<00:04:10.500> make<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.739> just<00:04:10.919> the

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
going to print you can make it just the
