gonna<00:01:43.749> make<00:01:43.899> it<00:01:44.020> through<00:01:44.229> all<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.920> way<00:01:45.039> we

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
gonna make it through all the way we

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.859 
gonna make it through all the way we
don't<00:01:45.789> know<00:01:45.969> we<00:01:46.149> don't<00:01:46.179> know<00:01:46.390> where<00:01:46.840> that

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
don't know we don't know where that

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.169 
don't know we don't know where that
civil<00:01:47.469> war<00:01:47.649> storyline<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.310> going<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.700> go<00:01:48.909> and

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
civil war storyline is going to go and

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.889 
civil war storyline is going to go and
lead<00:01:49.359> up<00:01:49.539> into<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:51.070> excuse<00:01:51.729> me<00:01:51.909> infinity<00:01:52.630> 1<00:01:52.749> &amp;

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
lead up into that excuse me infinity 1 &amp;

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:53.999 
lead up into that excuse me infinity 1 &amp;
2<00:01:52.990> we<00:01:53.109> don't<00:01:53.200> know<00:01:53.320> where<00:01:53.439> that's<00:01:53.530> going<00:01:53.799> so<00:01:53.979> I

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
2 we don't know where that's going so I

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.469 
2 we don't know where that's going so I
think<00:01:54.159> it<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.640> need<00:01:54.820> not<00:01:54.969> only<00:01:54.999> just<00:01:55.299> because

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
think it you need not only just because

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.149 
think it you need not only just because
profitable<00:01:55.929> which<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.109> agree<00:01:56.319> with<00:01:56.469> but<00:01:56.920> I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
profitable which I agree with but I

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.800 
profitable which I agree with but I
think<00:01:57.549> for<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.819> overall<00:01:58.060> arc<00:01:58.420> of<00:01:58.630> what

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
think for the overall arc of what

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.690 
think for the overall arc of what
they've<00:01:58.929> done<00:01:59.049> from<00:01:59.200> Iron<00:01:59.530> Man<00:01:59.679> 1<00:01:59.950> until<00:02:00.549> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
they've done from Iron Man 1 until the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.660 
they've done from Iron Man 1 until the
end<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:01.210> phase<00:02:01.689> 3<00:02:02.109> it<00:02:02.560> makes<00:02:03.069> sense<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.640> have

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
end of phase 3 it makes sense to have

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.419 
end of phase 3 it makes sense to have
Tony<00:02:03.999> Stark<00:02:04.359> dead<00:02:04.569> whereas<00:02:04.869> Chris<00:02:05.109> Evans<00:02:05.429> cap

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
Tony Stark dead whereas Chris Evans cap

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.550 
Tony Stark dead whereas Chris Evans cap
could<00:02:06.880> die<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.329> be<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> part<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.170> storyline

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
could die and be a part of the storyline

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.930 
could die and be a part of the storyline
it<00:02:08.800> makes<00:02:08.920> sense<00:02:09.100> not<00:02:09.280> just<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.550> kill<00:02:09.700> him<00:02:09.820> off

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
it makes sense not just to kill him off

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.260 
it makes sense not just to kill him off
because<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.570> would<00:02:10.690> fur

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
because it would fur

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.660 
because it would fur
emotional<00:02:11.780> emotional<00:02:12.740> time<00:02:13.160> not<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.520> mention

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
emotional emotional time not to mention

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.370 
emotional emotional time not to mention

they're ready for Captain America he
comes<00:04:06.110> back<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:06.650> I've<00:04:07.040> never<00:04:07.520> believed<00:04:07.910> that

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
comes back so I've never believed that

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.330

he's retiring or is gone from I just

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.800 
he's retiring or is gone from I just
think<00:04:10.670> they're<00:04:10.850> they're<00:04:11.209> gonna<00:04:11.330> take<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.570> break

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
think they're they're gonna take a break

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.240 
think they're they're gonna take a break
from<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.050> character<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.590> think<00:04:12.680> they're<00:04:13.160> gonna

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
from the character I think they're gonna

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.560 
from the character I think they're gonna
take<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.459> break<00:04:13.640> from<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.880> couple<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.180> characters

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
take a break from a couple of characters

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.320 
take a break from a couple of characters
I<00:04:14.690> think<00:04:14.959> Thor<00:04:15.320> is<00:04:15.620> gonna<00:04:16.609> have<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.910> break

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
I think Thor is gonna have a break

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.270 
I think Thor is gonna have a break
coming<00:04:17.660> up<00:04:17.959> after<00:04:18.109> Rock<00:04:18.770> probably<00:04:19.160> after

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
coming up after Rock probably after

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.740 
coming up after Rock probably after
Ragnarok<00:04:19.669> after<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.090> Avengers<00:04:20.299> stuff

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
Ragnarok after the Avengers stuff

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.420 
Ragnarok after the Avengers stuff
I<00:04:20.780> think<00:04:21.229> Thor's<00:04:21.470> gonna<00:04:21.590> have<00:04:21.919> a<00:04:22.100> bit<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.310> a

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
I think Thor's gonna have a bit of a

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.710 
I think Thor's gonna have a bit of a
break<00:04:22.669> but<00:04:22.880> then<00:04:22.970> it'll<00:04:23.090> come<00:04:23.240> back<00:04:23.270> to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
break but then it'll come back to

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.030 
break but then it'll come back to
or<00:04:23.810> later<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.290> I<00:04:24.500> think<00:04:24.650> that's<00:04:24.770> what<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:24.890> was

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
or later and I think that's what I was

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.920 
or later and I think that's what I was
gonna<00:04:25.130> might<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.520> suggest<00:04:25.700> since<00:04:26.510> we<00:04:26.660> we're

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
gonna might I suggest since we we're

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.480 
gonna might I suggest since we we're
talking<00:04:27.170> about<00:04:27.230> a<00:04:27.320> ten-year<00:04:27.800> span<00:04:27.890> that<00:04:28.310> they

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
talking about a ten-year span that they

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.330 
talking about a ten-year span that they
maybe<00:04:28.790> shoot<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.360> trilogy<00:04:29.930> in<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.230> year<00:04:30.560> like

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
think Marvel can step up and say we're

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.580 
think Marvel can step up and say we're
gonna<00:04:43.070> shoot<00:04:43.370> three<00:04:43.790> Inhumans<00:04:44.570> three<00:04:44.900> do<00:04:45.110> you

gonna shoot three Inhumans three do you

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.900 
gonna shoot three Inhumans three do you
have<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.740> better<00:04:45.860> chance<00:04:45.950> know<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.670> after

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
have a better chance know that after

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.090 
have a better chance know that after
phase<00:04:47.270> three<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.780> think<00:04:48.140> that<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.440> agree<00:04:48.500> no<00:04:49.070> I

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
phase three I think that I agree no I

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.980 
phase three I think that I agree no I
think<00:04:49.340> that's<00:04:49.730> very<00:04:49.880> possible<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.390> even<00:04:50.750> going

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
think that's very possible to even going

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.420 
think that's very possible to even going
back<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.230> Star<00:04:51.410> Wars<00:04:51.440> again<00:04:51.680> -<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:52.100> even<00:04:52.220> a

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
back to Star Wars again - is that even a

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.830 
back to Star Wars again - is that even a
rumor<00:04:52.670> that<00:04:52.700> obi-wan<00:04:53.090> thing<00:04:53.510> -<00:04:53.600> where<00:04:53.720> it

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
rumor that obi-wan thing - where it

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.060 
rumor that obi-wan thing - where it
would<00:04:53.930> be<00:04:53.960> just<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.260> separate<00:04:54.560> trillion<00:04:54.830> but<00:04:54.920> oh

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
would be just a separate trillion but oh

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.650 
would be just a separate trillion but oh
we<00:04:55.430> want<00:04:55.640> where<00:04:55.940> you<00:04:55.970> could<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.510> could

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
we want where you could you could

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.720 
we want where you could you could
absolutely<00:04:56.780> though<00:04:57.410> with<00:04:57.560> Marvel<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.010> DC<00:04:58.310> but

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
absolutely though with Marvel and DC but

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.640 
absolutely though with Marvel and DC but
continuing<00:04:59.270> this<00:04:59.390> first<00:04:59.660> story<00:05:00.380> arc<00:05:00.590> that

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
continuing this first story arc that

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.080 
continuing this first story arc that
they're<00:05:00.920> doing<00:05:01.190> but<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.370> agree<00:05:01.850> with<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:02.030> I

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
they're doing but I agree with you I

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.610 
they're doing but I agree with you I
think<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.300> would<00:05:02.540> be<00:05:02.570> really<00:05:02.960> smart<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.470> do

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
think that would be really smart to do

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.410 
think that would be really smart to do
but<00:05:04.010> at<00:05:04.100> this<00:05:04.220> point<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.640> think<00:05:04.910> if<00:05:05.180> I'm<00:05:05.300> an

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
but at this point I think if I'm an

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.600 
but at this point I think if I'm an
executive<00:05:05.690> at<00:05:06.080> Marvel<00:05:06.470> even<00:05:06.920> as<00:05:07.040> successful

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
as everything else has been I don't

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.050 
as everything else has been I don't
