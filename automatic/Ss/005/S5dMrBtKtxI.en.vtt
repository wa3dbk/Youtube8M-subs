00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.370
 then we will start with the order 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.970
 of the people that was this pretty we are going to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.120
 grab a few granites or fences 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.000
 of pepper and it passes to the processor or 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.449
 the women's hand or the blender 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 then the split black pepper remains 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.189
 thick flat perfect there is what you have that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.150
 it's called black pepper kids millions 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.950
 million and what is it used to cover 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.160
 these pieces 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.230
 he became the one to be and so with his 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.770
 own moisture is adhered to the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 pepper in the flesh and meanwhile 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.320
 We are overflowing this side and side 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.030
 but they justify of good it comes pixel 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.360
 says pepper with cream potatoes 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.760
 rich the version of the pig these pibes of

 pork bondiola with pepper 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.710
 sweet potatoes to the cream then we start 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.629
 to cook in a pan comanda where 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.080
 everything expectant in his family in 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.080
 Holland 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.510
 but it's a joke 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.500
 knows that it is very likely that we will go 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.320
 the party is very likely very 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.700
 likely to leave this this 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.060
 Wednesday at 13 with the doubt prepare 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.060
 the guarantor 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.560
 it is very likely very good we will see 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.850
 here and if one thing you live on this 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.920
 of bondiola just do not appeal or enough 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.470
 battered with that ground black pepper 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.320
 they put more you put less according to your 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.990
 taste is not going to sting much is going to be more 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.280
 that nothing aromatic in so we're going 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.970
 putting a little salt 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 the idea is to brown the steaks on one side and 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.679
 of the other issue of a minute of each 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.899
 side since they do not have more than one 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.600
 centimeter and a half thick and then 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.090
 remove them and send them to the oven for 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.220
 final cooking after marking and that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.010
 final merger is going to be about 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.040
 8 or 10 minutes nothing else is solved 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.110
 pretty little quickie golden that was the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.450
 meat on one side we are turning and in 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.450
 the way more art we are going to generate 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.480
 red wine sauce and onions that goes 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.700
 to make use exactly you're going to 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.050
 use to accompany 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.360
 bondiola you have another pan that 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.520

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.610
 accompany the potatoes has a can 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.120
 with a can notice that we already took it out 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.630
 quickly these three encores of bondiola 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.300
 Tired or battered with pepper 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.970

 come for fast chains that all that and 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.950
 di maría is amazing and maría bueno 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.620
 in the same pan where the 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.510
 bondiola that was a steak of a 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.209
 centimeter and a half that could by the way 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.450
 having been the whole ball or bieber more 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.810
 thick that's your choice brewed 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.769
 batter side and side 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.569
 chopped black pepper very thick more or 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.060
 less according to the amount you want 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.760
 but do not fear him there in this same 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.879
 pan as I tell you we are taking advantage 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.239
 a little goya onion desired to the 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.760
 that we are going to put a little salt 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.799
 no more pepper because it has enough 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.069
 the steaks and once this onion 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.579
 be more or less little that the thing 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:05.060
 happens fast there we're going to start 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:10.209
 incorporate onion liquid and wine 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.209
 red therefore dear there goes 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.269
 designs 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.400
 we advise you to leave it at least 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.130
 about 10 minutes of evaporation so that 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.949
 the wine will go to strong acidity and 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.110
 apart caramelize with the natural sweet 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.380
 who have the onions is the rich 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.050
 rich then we're going to add that and 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.270
 I come here to look for a bit of 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.630
 caldito or the sauce is going to have the 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.940
 imprint of red wine but not all 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.250
 the liquid is going to be red wine is going to be 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.180
 a kind of wine and broth from 2008 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.960
 wine and kallio 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.810
 first boiling onions go 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.270
 taking color will lengthen the sugar 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.220
 natural we have put salt this what 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.470
 We are cooking from the pan 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.320
 where we browned from side to side the steaks 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.479
 returned the one with the first one is more 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.360
 now because all the flavor there 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.419
 then let reduce the wine and when 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.919
 They spent about 5 minutes you put the same 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.990
 amount that would have put him 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.569
 It is that you put him in wine 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.689
 this time they put him with a broth of meat 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.759
 to reduce that is a sauce 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.360
 with a liquid component with a 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.009
 solid component and with the due 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.020
 reduction ie evaporation and 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.119
 concentration because a sauce can not 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.399
 be absolutely liquid and neither 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:35.969
 species weighs like a stew has to 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:38.009
 have this a very appropriate texture 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.809
 now if you get the five minutes and 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.539
 well you have time for that evaporation 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:44.969
 and all the philosophy of the good house will 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:48.479
 nailed them nails is a cornstarch they are in 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:51.089
 this case the corn starch diluted in 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.930
 a little water or wine thing that 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:56.999
 this is chosen by effect of one's own 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.819
 cornstarch 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:02.430
 see how quickly he took another 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:05.129
 texture became thick 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.999
 and now this is going to be a wonder 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.519
 after a minute of boiling and now 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:14.639
 yes let's make the sauce my dear 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:16.160
 Darius would pass me the ball pan 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.750
 hot to do 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.270
 the sauce that is very simple for some 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.500
 banana potatoes that had washed them 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:27.980
 the'd had cut straight out 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.680
 the skin and had sent them to a hip 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.050
 with 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.699
 a little oil thing that you have more 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.009
 tapitas the oven are good enough 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:38.740
 towards the oven we will finish it in 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.070
 a sauce where here we will Cream 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.930
 of milk if it was a bit hot 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.660
 because before as it was hot there is 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.620
 milk cream there is some milestone and there you 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.620
 We are going to receive

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.340
 exactly then you are these potatoes 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.920
 they will be absolutely rigorous in 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.680
 that cheese cream once saved 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.430
 breath when it decides it seems that 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.110
 we attend everything more or less planned 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.469
 replacing as it corresponds so 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:30.789
