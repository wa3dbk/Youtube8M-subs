and<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.710> act<00:02:05.890> out<00:02:06.040> stuff<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.580> can't<00:02:06.760> say

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
and you act out stuff and you can't say

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.490 
and you act out stuff and you can't say
anything

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
anything

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500 
anything
that's<00:02:08.500> charades<00:02:08.920> there<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:09.670> go<00:02:09.850> it's

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
that's charades there you go it's

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.750 
that's charades there you go it's
charades<00:02:10.840> with<00:02:11.020> 3d<00:02:11.380> basically<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> greatest

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
charades with 3d basically the greatest

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.100 
charades with 3d basically the greatest
thing<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.270> if<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.420> look<00:02:13.600> here<00:02:13.840> at<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
thing is is that if you look here at the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.770 
thing is is that if you look here at the
wireframe<00:02:14.680> here<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.940> any<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.209> those<00:02:16.270> modelers

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
wireframe here for any of those modelers

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.510 
wireframe here for any of those modelers
out<00:02:16.959> there<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.290> know<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.070> level<00:02:18.430> of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
out there you know that the level of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.120 
out there you know that the level of
detail<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.810> something<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.860> and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
detail in something like this and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.100 
detail in something like this and
something<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:21.970> free-flowing<00:02:22.450> like<00:02:22.810> this

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
something so free-flowing like this

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.920 
something so free-flowing like this
takes<00:02:23.830> hours<00:02:24.459> upon<00:02:24.790> hours<00:02:25.000> upon<00:02:25.240> hours<00:02:25.720> upon

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
takes hours upon hours upon hours upon

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.560 
takes hours upon hours upon hours upon
hours<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:26.830> did<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.100> in<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:28.180> what<00:02:28.330> five

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
hours I just did that in just what five

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.630 
hours I just did that in just what five
ten<00:02:28.959> seconds<00:02:29.380> something<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.190> what<00:02:30.520> I'm

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
ten seconds something like that what I'm

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.060 
ten seconds something like that what I'm
familiar<00:02:30.820> with<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.630> 3d<00:02:32.320> like<00:02:32.560> graphic

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
familiar with with 3d like graphic

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.130 
familiar with with 3d like graphic
simulations<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.930> to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
simulations like this is you have to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.080 
simulations like this is you have to
take<00:02:35.350> every<00:02:35.680> single<00:02:35.980> point<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.519> move<00:02:36.880> them

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
take every single point and move them

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.670 
take every single point and move them
separately<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.959> seemed<00:02:38.170> like<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.560> were

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
separately and it seemed like you were

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.350 
separately and it seemed like you were
just<00:02:38.709> able<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.280> press<00:02:39.610> one<00:02:39.850> area<00:02:40.150> and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
just able to press one area and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.970 
just able to press one area and
everything<00:02:40.540> kind<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.930> floated<00:02:41.320> in<00:02:41.440> together

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
everything kind of floated in together

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.220 
everything kind of floated in together

pull it got the point you pull it can
you<00:02:50.680> imagine<00:02:50.890> how<00:02:51.220> long<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.430> takes<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.000> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
you imagine how long it takes you to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.330 
you imagine how long it takes you to
make<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.930> by<00:02:53.200> grabbing<00:02:53.440> once<00:02:53.950> I'm<00:02:54.100> pulling

artistic nature into a digital world and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.759 
artistic nature into a digital world and
it's<00:03:07.180> it's<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.540> 2.0<00:03:07.989> stage<00:03:08.200> right<00:03:08.410> now<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.560> it's

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
it's it's a 2.0 stage right now and it's

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.699 
it's it's a 2.0 stage right now and it's
already<00:03:08.950> exploding<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:10.570> can<00:03:10.720> expect<00:03:11.019> huge

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
already exploding so you can expect huge

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
things from this software that's

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.750 
things from this software that's
incredible<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.440> think<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.860> this<00:03:15.340> model

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
incredible and I think this this model

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.820 
incredible and I think this this model
right<00:03:15.880> here<00:03:15.940> has<00:03:16.299> more<00:03:16.600> polygons<00:03:17.200> than<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
right here has more polygons than the

when you wear the glasses put these on
will<00:04:47.169> go<00:04:47.260> super<00:04:47.590> geek<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:49.060> take<00:04:49.240> these<00:04:49.360> yeah

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
will go super geek you take these yeah

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.110 
will go super geek you take these yeah
you<00:04:51.010> take<00:04:51.160> these<00:04:51.310> glasses<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.850> they<00:04:51.970> have

you take these glasses and they have

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.670 
you take these glasses and they have
sensors<00:04:52.539> in<00:04:52.570> them<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.229> tracks<00:04:53.530> the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
sensors in them and it tracks the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.590 
sensors in them and it tracks the
sensors<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.460> if<00:04:54.640> I'm<00:04:54.789> Square<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.240> screen

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
sensors so if I'm Square to the screen

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.900 
sensors so if I'm Square to the screen
here<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.560> get<00:04:56.770> my<00:04:56.950> adder<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.400> remove<00:04:57.669> tool

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
here and I get my adder and remove tool

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.570 
here and I get my adder and remove tool
and<00:04:58.210> I<00:04:58.600> just<00:04:58.810> pull<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.590> alien<00:05:00.130> thing<00:05:00.370> out<00:05:00.490> of

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
and I just pull the alien thing out of

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.159 
and I just pull the alien thing out of
his<00:05:00.700> chest<00:05:01.030> which<00:05:01.510> you'll<00:05:01.720> see<00:05:01.870> here<00:05:02.050> in<00:05:02.110> a

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
his chest which you'll see here in a

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.080 
his chest which you'll see here in a
second<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.680> way<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.550> works<00:05:03.700> is<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:03.940> the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
second the way it works is that the

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.110 
second the way it works is that the
sensors<00:05:04.570> on<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.780> screen<00:05:05.110> here<00:05:05.610> they<00:05:06.610> register

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
sensors on the screen here they register

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.700 
sensors on the screen here they register
the<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.570> placement<00:05:08.020> of<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.169> glasses<00:05:08.410> in

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
the the placement of the glasses in

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.800 
the the placement of the glasses in
relation<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.580> screen<00:05:09.850> so<00:05:10.090> let's<00:05:10.570> say<00:05:10.750> you

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
relation to the screen so let's say you
