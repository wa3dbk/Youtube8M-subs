to look at is the tab if you look at the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
to look at is the tab if you look at the
stitching<00:00:37.860> around<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.309> tab<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.790> clean<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
stitching around the tab it's clean a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.660 
stitching around the tab it's clean a
lot<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.320> times<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> fakes<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
lot of times the fakes what they do is

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
lot of times the fakes what they do is
they<00:00:41.790> cut<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.660> then<00:00:42.960> they<00:00:43.260> stitch<00:00:43.559> in

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
they cut it out and then they stitch in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.860 
they cut it out and then they stitch in
another<00:00:44.010> tab<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.059> should<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.600> able<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
another tab so you should be able to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.690 
another tab so you should be able to
tell<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> stitching<00:00:46.950> isn't<00:00:47.280> clean<00:00:47.460> like

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
tell if the stitching isn't clean like

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.139 
tell if the stitching isn't clean like
this

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.920 
this
it's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.690> fake<00:00:48.899> pair<00:00:49.789> some<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> Levi's<00:00:51.270> they

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it's a fake pair some of the Levi's they

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.270 
it's a fake pair some of the Levi's they

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
make don't have it has are by itself

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.770 
make don't have it has are by itself
doesn't<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.520> Levi's<00:00:56.969> written<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> but

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
doesn't have Levi's written on it but

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
doesn't have Levi's written on it but
that<00:00:57.899> doesn't<00:00:58.260> necessarily<00:00:58.379> mean<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that doesn't necessarily mean it's a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.860 
that doesn't necessarily mean it's a
fake<00:00:59.460> pair<00:00:59.670> Levi's<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:01.020> arbitrarily<00:01:02.870> puts

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
fake pair Levi's just arbitrarily puts

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320 
fake pair Levi's just arbitrarily puts
the<00:01:04.049> registered<00:01:04.470> trademark<00:01:04.580> only<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the registered trademark only on some of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.250 
the registered trademark only on some of
the<00:01:06.390> pair's<00:01:08.689> another<00:01:09.689> thing<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the pair's another thing you want to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
the pair's another thing you want to
look<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.220> part<00:01:11.460> number<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.000> this

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
look at is the part number so this

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.340 
look at is the part number so this
particular<00:01:12.780> pair<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.380> 501<00:01:14.070> 0<00:01:14.939> 194<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
particular pair is a 501 0 194 which is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
particular pair is a 501 0 194 which is
a<00:01:16.380> dark<00:01:16.710> blue<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.909> should<00:01:18.119> match<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
a dark blue and it should match the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.710 
a dark blue and it should match the
number<00:01:18.930> inside<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> Parapan<00:01:19.950> so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.390 

if<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:26.930> open<00:01:27.170> up<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.380> pair<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.620> pants<00:01:27.920> there

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
if you open up the pair of pants there

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.320 
if you open up the pair of pants there
should<00:01:28.610> be<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.730> tag<00:01:29.060> here<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:31.220> tag<00:01:31.490> should

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:44.380 

read<00:01:38.080> 501<00:01:39.130> 0<00:01:40.130> 1<00:01:40.670> 9<00:01:40.940> 4<00:01:42.610> so<00:01:43.610> those<00:01:43.850> two<00:01:44.150> should

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
read 501 0 1 9 4 so those two should

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.470 
read 501 0 1 9 4 so those two should
match<00:01:47.110> another<00:01:48.110> thing<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.410> look<00:01:48.560> for<00:01:48.830> are<00:01:49.480> the

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
match another thing to look for are the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.070 
match another thing to look for are the
rivets<00:01:50.860> all<00:01:51.860> Levi's<00:01:52.720> will<00:01:53.720> have<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.140> LS<00:01:55.240> SF<00:01:56.240> Co

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
rivets all Levi's will have the LS SF Co

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.750 
rivets all Levi's will have the LS SF Co
so<00:01:58.070> if<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.430> look<00:01:58.610> at<00:01:58.730> this<00:01:58.880> rivet<00:02:00.400> you<00:02:01.400> can<00:02:01.580> see

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
so if you look at this rivet you can see

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.060 
so if you look at this rivet you can see
it<00:02:01.910> has<00:02:02.120> Levi<00:02:02.810> Strauss<00:02:03.050> at<00:02:03.380> San<00:02:03.590> Francisco

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
it has Levi Strauss at San Francisco

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.660 
it has Levi Strauss at San Francisco
company<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:04.970> all<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.170> other<00:02:06.200> rivets

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.360 

although<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.820> rivets<00:02:11.180> should<00:02:11.690> say<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.050> same

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
although the rivets should say the same

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.730 
although the rivets should say the same
so<00:02:13.370> look<00:02:13.670> throughout<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.150> pants<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.740> make

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
so look throughout the pants and make

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.890 
so look throughout the pants and make
sure<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.340> has<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.550> LS<00:02:17.540> SF<00:02:18.530> Co
