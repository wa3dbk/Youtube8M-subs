00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
 thank you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.360
 because in college because we didn't have 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.220
 choice 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.740
 last year she repeated the third one 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.750
 the third will not believe it and they were not there 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.400
 improvements my eldest son every 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.420
 year is the first of the class in each 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.340
 matter with it according to her 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.559
 problem his attitude a 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.360
 problem towards study towards all 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.060
 things always have an excuse makes the whims 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.829
 never listens no one asks her what it is 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.630
 the problem and you describe the symptoms to me 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.790
 he's saying his son's fever 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.250
 we already know this because he has a fever 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:01:01.600
 I ask her what is the cause why 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:03.309
 you don't tell me the mistakes ahead 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.950
 when he writes he follows a pattern 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.590
 there is an error that repeats itself as a scheme 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:19.990
 schema are errors on errors has not 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:22.119
 understood that there is a signal look here 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.159
 instead of b he writes la di e 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.250
 vice versa they are letters that seem to him 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.900
 the same confuses them and here he wrote if 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.360
 he was on the contrary writing so many letters to the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.650
 otherwise look at lowercase h and ti 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.240
 tiny you see like the mirror 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.890
 animal animal animal wrote it in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.630
 three different ways 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.840
 it means that he has memorized a word 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.500
 wrong second thing confuses words 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.310
 similar 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:55.619
 watch types of vent more than your own 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:02:00.070
 ld because it is so stupid and wrong 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:04.720
 no i think it has difficulty a 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.210
 recognize letters when she already 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.880
 ppl and apple I imagine the beautiful apple 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.410
 true smooth can read the word 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.920
 and he doesn't understand what it means to read 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.930
 and write 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.319
 It is important to understand her in the spelling 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.840
 how important it is to understand its meaning 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.030
 he does not practice the skills of 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:38.980
 base that is saying his are all 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:44.139
 excuses for not studying please 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.359
 sir bind this as i do 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.519
 read and written in Chinese and at least there 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.590
 try concentrates as you would say 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.969
 sorry how do I read it has one 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.019
 unfair attitude 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.019
 I'm not going around 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:11.790
 this is the way he feels in jean 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:13.980
 he cannot recognize the alphabet there 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.820
 difficulty in reading and writing 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.820
 it's called dyslexia 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.650
 sometimes to children with this disorder 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.870
 may also have other difficulties for 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.110
 example include instructions 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:39.030
 complex page 60 chapter 8 paragraph 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.130
 2 rig a1 confusion or difficulty 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.750
 more or less severe motor 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.959
 the sun has never had difficulty 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.060
 tying the shirt on the shoes you joan 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.060
 if you throw a ball then take flight 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.770
 Well he can not intercept it does not 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.620
 manages to measure simultaneously 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.150
 size distance and speed 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.090
 how big the ball is when it is far away 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:08.450
 how fast is the time to make it happen 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:12.720
 the train has passed and you realize 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.970
 a child of only 89 years old 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.829
 he can read and write or do 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.060
 the simple things of everyday life not 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.650
 he can do everything he is 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.299
 elementary for every boy of his 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.720
 age 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:29.100
 how do you think his is heard 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.780
 self-esteem sinks underground for 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.000
 masking his difficulty fights 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.729
 every day he makes the unruly rebel 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.810
 his is a constant war monster a 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.600
 all who are not capable 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.780
 they better challenge them learn it from 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.780
 adults 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.140
 the result is that the rebel comes 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.140
 made out 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.950
 I'm so sorry that I don't feel like it 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.950
 to paint 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:18.599
 it's really a shame because right at the 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:20.429
 my and no I don't know lady is a nuisance 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.559
 nervous can happen to anyone 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:25.229
 sometimes it can be genetic for 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:27.779
 simplify let's say you have a problem 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.489
 in brain connections therefore stands 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.889
 saying that my son is not normal that 

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:36.719
 he delayed knows that she is a lot 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:38.459
 strange look look at these drawings and 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.739
 capable of expressing millions of thoughts 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:43.319
 with color to much more talent than all 

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:45.419
 us and the advantage as it is because it seeks 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.759
 an advantage that I have to look for that will do 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.639
 when will he be an adult, as he will do 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.629
 confront the world that will happen 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.629
 when we will no longer be there 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.699
 he knows 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.350
 in this world competition is a value 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.020
 strong 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:18.820
 consequently the maximum aspiration e 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.710
 having winning children must be 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.800
 always at the maximum 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.050
 doctor engineer manager scientist 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.880
 otherwise you don't want to settle for them 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.910
 always at most a minor role does not 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:36.039
 you can accept but think about it 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:40.150
 each child has his own talent 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:43.419
 of his abilities to of his interests and 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.370
 but no, you parents always want to 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.380
 more from the children 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.410
 does nothing if they have to pay dearly 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.410
 price
