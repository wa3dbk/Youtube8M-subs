this<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.320> huge<00:01:39.770> game<00:01:39.860> for<00:01:40.100> both<00:01:40.400> teams<00:01:40.460> I

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
this is a huge game for both teams I

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.810 
this is a huge game for both teams I
like<00:01:41.390> George's<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.380> be<00:01:42.650> in<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.310> ballgame<00:01:43.580> but

I<00:01:43.909> think<00:01:44.090> lsu's<00:01:44.420> defense<00:01:44.450> will<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.320> one<00:01:45.530> to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
I think lsu's defense will be the one to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.530 
I think lsu's defense will be the one to
win<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:45.979> I'm<00:01:46.130> going<00:01:46.400> with<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.550> Tigers<00:01:46.940> in<00:01:47.060> this
