love metallics and I love dichroic glass
I<00:02:22.280> wanted<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.000> bring<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.330> same<00:02:23.930> feeling<00:02:24.680> into

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
I wanted to bring that same feeling into

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
I wanted to bring that same feeling into
those<00:02:25.310> tiles

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
those tiles

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.030 
those tiles
I<00:02:27.430> used<00:02:28.450> regular<00:02:29.450> two<00:02:29.750> ounce<00:02:29.959> craft<00:02:30.470> paints

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
I used regular two ounce craft paints

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.940 
I used regular two ounce craft paints
for<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> tiles<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.030> once<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.140> chose<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.739> color

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
for the tiles and once I chose the color

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.610 
for the tiles and once I chose the color
palette<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.520> mix<00:02:34.790> them<00:02:35.000> with<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.270> glaze<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:36.440> break

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
palette I mix them with a glaze to break

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.010 
palette I mix them with a glaze to break
the<00:02:36.770> paint's<00:02:37.100> down<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.370> little<00:02:37.640> bit<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.720> took

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
the paint's down a little bit and I took

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.240 
the paint's down a little bit and I took
a<00:02:39.260> large<00:02:40.190> cellulose<00:02:41.090> kitchen<00:02:42.080> sponge<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.830> I

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
a large cellulose kitchen sponge and I

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.060 
a large cellulose kitchen sponge and I
cut<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.730> sponge<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.360> same<00:02:44.600> size<00:02:45.200> as<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.770> tile

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
cut the sponge the same size as the tile

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.210 
cut the sponge the same size as the tile
and<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:47.180> dipped<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.690> into<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.590> mixture<00:02:48.980> of

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
and just dipped it into the mixture of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.010 
and just dipped it into the mixture of
the<00:02:49.310> different<00:02:49.580> paints<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.420> glaze<00:02:50.690> and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
the different paints and the glaze and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.830 
the different paints and the glaze and
applied<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.950> directly<00:02:52.100> onto<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.790> tile<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.630> get

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
applied it directly onto the tile to get

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.740 
applied it directly onto the tile to get
that<00:02:54.050> marbleized<00:02:54.890> look<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.400> wanted

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
that marbleized look that I wanted

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.930 
that marbleized look that I wanted
after<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> paint's<00:02:58.230> were<00:02:58.560> dry<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.340> went<00:02:59.850> ahead

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
after the paint's were dry I went ahead

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.650 
after the paint's were dry I went ahead
and<00:03:00.510> applied<00:03:01.020> an<00:03:01.620> oil<00:03:02.370> adhesive<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.330> all<00:03:03.480> of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and applied an oil adhesive to all of

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.410 
and applied an oil adhesive to all of
the<00:03:03.780> tiles<00:03:04.200> as<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.770> walk<00:03:05.010> by<00:03:05.340> changes<00:03:06.090> color

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
the tiles as you walk by changes color

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.260 
the tiles as you walk by changes color
and<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.170> reminds<00:03:07.710> me<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.860> dichroic<00:03:08.610> glass<00:03:08.640> it's

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
and it reminds me of dichroic glass it's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.760 
and it reminds me of dichroic glass it's
beautiful

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
beautiful

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.440 
beautiful
in<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:12.980> breakfast<00:03:13.550> nook<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.940> created<00:03:14.300> a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
in the breakfast nook I created a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.960 
in the breakfast nook I created a
crumbling<00:03:15.110> wall<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:16.070> give<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.370> sense<00:03:16.700> of

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
crumbling wall to give it a sense of

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.190 
crumbling wall to give it a sense of
depth<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:18.020> sense<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.500> age<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.960> plaster<00:03:20.960> it

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
depth and a sense of age the plaster it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.740 
depth and a sense of age the plaster it
looks<00:03:21.380> like<00:03:21.560> has<00:03:21.770> has<00:03:22.160> fallen<00:03:22.550> off<00:03:22.940> over<00:03:23.510> time

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
looks like has has fallen off over time

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.830 
looks like has has fallen off over time
and<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.260> exposed<00:03:24.770> this<00:03:25.490> brick<00:03:25.910> wall<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.300> was

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
and it exposed this brick wall that was

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.860 
and it exposed this brick wall that was
there<00:03:27.260> hundreds<00:03:28.040> of<00:03:28.160> years<00:03:28.430> ago<00:03:28.720> it's<00:03:29.720> not

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
there hundreds of years ago it's not

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.660 
there hundreds of years ago it's not
real<00:03:30.200> brick<00:03:30.470> but<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.770> sure<00:03:30.980> looks<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.430> feels

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
real brick but it sure looks and feels

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.260 
real brick but it sure looks and feels
like<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:33.370> before<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.400> started<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.910> wall<00:03:35.090> I

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
like it before I started the wall I

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.300 
like it before I started the wall I
actually<00:03:35.630> measured<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.260> real<00:03:36.470> brick<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.070> I

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
actually measured a real brick and I

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.270 
actually measured a real brick and I
took<00:03:37.550> those<00:03:37.760> dimensions<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.950> created<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.040> grid

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
took those dimensions and created a grid

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.690 
took those dimensions and created a grid
