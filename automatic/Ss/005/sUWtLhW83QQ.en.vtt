00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.700
 chicken with vegetables 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.250

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.680
 these strips are put in the other 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.680
 meaning to make cubes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 here 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.310

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:37.380
 special roll of paper papillotes 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:43.770
 transparent and you discover a square of 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 40 cm by 40 cm and here you come rap and and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:56.330

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.789
 and a little bit of onions 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 everything and vegetables must be cut from the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.080

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.450
 homogeneous 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:28.489
 I add my little pieces of chicken 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.760
 on the top we season with a little 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:35.349
 salt flower 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.349
 a small drop of coconut milk 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.340
 just before closing tap the driver you 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.640
 add a few small washers of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.640

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.270

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:56.130

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.510
