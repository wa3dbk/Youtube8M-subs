00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello to everyone here at christmas crowd and we get 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:12.559
 found on in the pokemon arena that 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.000
 I built myself of course and so 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.440
 I think I'm doing several episodes for 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.630
 introduce you to how to build it 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.310
 so this is well done because over or 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.920
 black but in fact it's wool 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.769
 So it's over to him some ions that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.769
 is well in the middle of vast infinite 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.090
 so here and then on top so in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.690
 underneath there is the queen and then there is 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:53.329
 So pc with pokemon and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.260
 business I just dropped a little bit the sound 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.260
 that norms and gic 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:14.030
 so here is so I represented a 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.670
 giant pokéball 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:26.759
 so I did not do we survive flying 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:34.979
 game like that I did with them how 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:38.479
 to say is that creative is so if we 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.479
 take that off 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.380
 it gives a real pokéball what 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.210
 maybe a bit wide on the side but 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.750
 good it does it a little bit 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.790
 we will say after the top 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.070
 well I do not know how to do it 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:04.420
 top of a pokéball years I do them 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:17.290
 like that and the part ambages the facts 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:17.290
 down in game so I can not go in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:32.840
 here I am closing up so here is so 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.950
 this is the queen where there is fighting 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.760
 where all the trainers meet 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:46.340
 so to do that you have to start 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.260
 by the base then after continue so I 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.620
 believe in the pokéball frost like that is 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.580
 pretty well done because I had 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.660
 did one before he had a very bad 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.350
 does kembo skin oval summer and they 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:10.390
 have round 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:10.390
 and then the outside is that it was 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.540
 kl outside it was in triangle so there 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:22.530
 if we know well round ahead pretty well 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:30.319
 triangle that six titles aig was very 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.319
 ugly it was not too much so here you go 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:43.410
 so I think yes it still remains 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:48.890
 few minutes because the tantad 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:52.079
 next I will show you the base so 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.010
 you have to find a lot of land 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.920
 we will say we do not see too much of that 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.379
 will be great 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.690
 so I put the pokéball mode in pixels 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:09.299
 mode pixels I do not have too much how that 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.810
 is called and it's the mode I think I 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.760
 can on and so full of pokemon 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.620
 like that and as you can see at 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:25.789
 right to left sorry I pikachu and 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:30.060
 magnetic and shackles yes wield myth 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:33.139
 so line have changed a bit and for them 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:40.740
 catch the flying ones 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:45.060
 below so at the base so for the 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.960
 base I chose so white of the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.940
 red black 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.010
 so as you can see if one of 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.010
 pokéball and the game 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:17.530
 so I'll start there the framework 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:17.530
 three after we close voice 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:34.169
 i'm sewing calculated gmail no i believe 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:41.040
 I miscalculated crazy that I add a 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:47.160
 thickness by here it is so I'm going 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:49.910
 to pass like that at all after I put 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.910
 so there 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:09.190
 notice so often have to start with the 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:12.340
 base one otherwise it does not often make 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:19.080
 proportions problems all that so that's it 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:19.080
 it will be what we push to be able 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.300
 so 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:45.650
 I think that's how it's going I'm 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.530
 very mean i'm a pokemon a 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.650
 poor pique unusual and defenseless 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:54.800
 so that's for the pokémon in sierre 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.140
 looking like we will say because perso 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.110
 I think it looks pretty good 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:02.110
 after you do not have to doctors 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:09.380
 so that gives that after but when 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.910
 even better we'll say yes so it's 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:16.730
 this is the base and I will do 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:20.200
 other episodes for the rest so the 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.200
 next for episode 2
