one is very simple you choose this
drop-down<00:02:31.319> menu<00:02:31.799> it's<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.099> German<00:02:32.579> here<00:02:32.879> but

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
drop-down menu it's in German here but

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.830 
drop-down menu it's in German here but
you<00:02:33.870> will<00:02:34.049> get<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.530> idea<00:02:34.859> of<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.129> so<00:02:35.969> first

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
you will get the idea of it so first

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.209 
you will get the idea of it so first
setting<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.469> as<00:02:37.829> shot<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.139> uses<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
setting is as shot so it just uses the

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:47.179 
setting is as shot so it just uses the
white<00:02:41.639> balance<00:02:42.319> your<00:02:43.319> camera<00:02:44.299> took<00:02:46.189> second

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
white balance your camera took second

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.240 
white balance your camera took second
one<00:02:47.340> here<00:02:47.639> is<00:02:47.790> auto<00:02:48.200> which<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.319> choose<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.859> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
one here is auto which I choose now and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.819 
one here is auto which I choose now and
it<00:02:50.340> lets<00:02:50.780> Lightroom<00:02:51.780> adjust<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.620> white

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
it lets Lightroom adjust the white

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.089 
it lets Lightroom adjust the white
balance<00:02:52.889> by<00:02:53.430> itself<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.169> case<00:02:55.500> this

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
balance by itself and in this case this

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.159 
balance by itself and in this case this
leads<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.909> a<00:02:57.239> worse<00:02:57.680> result<00:02:58.680> than<00:02:58.980> before<00:03:00.139> so<00:03:01.139> I

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
leads to a worse result than before so I

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.589 
leads to a worse result than before so I
don't<00:03:01.560> use<00:03:01.859> this<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.819> other<00:03:02.939> settings<00:03:03.389> here

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
don't use this the other settings here

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.750 
don't use this the other settings here
are<00:03:03.780> presets<00:03:04.469> just<00:03:04.889> like<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.189> presets<00:03:05.639> you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
are presets just like the presets you

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.369 
are presets just like the presets you
would<00:03:05.939> use<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.299> your<00:03:06.419> camera<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:06.930> daylight

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
would use in your camera like daylight

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.000 
would use in your camera like daylight
cloudy<00:03:07.799> shadow<00:03:08.340> tungsten<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.120> stuff<00:03:10.010> we

cloudy shadow tungsten and stuff we
don't<00:03:11.189> use<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.549> here<00:03:11.819> either<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.219> auto

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
don't use that here either so the auto

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
don't use that here either so the auto

by clicking on the gray card and you see
where<00:04:17.699> this<00:04:17.849> leads<00:04:17.909> so<00:04:18.329> I'm<00:04:18.449> just<00:04:18.630> too<00:04:18.989> lazy

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
where this leads so I'm just too lazy

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.110 
where this leads so I'm just too lazy
for<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.009> just<00:04:20.190> click<00:04:20.400> around<00:04:20.459> in<00:04:20.970> the

it<00:04:25.979> looks

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
it looks

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.800 
it looks
right<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.270> my<00:04:27.420> eye<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:29.100> i<00:04:29.130> click<00:04:29.970> on<00:04:30.000> different

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
right to my eye so i click on different

to a temperature of two thousand Kelvin
which<00:04:42.420> is<00:04:42.570> very<00:04:42.840> cool<00:04:43.700> but<00:04:44.700> in<00:04:44.970> this<00:04:45.540> case<00:04:45.810> it

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
which is very cool but in this case it

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.930 
which is very cool but in this case it
looks<00:04:46.980> almost<00:04:48.680> ok<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.740> me<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.220> seems<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.700> little

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
looks almost ok to me it seems a little

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.680 
looks almost ok to me it seems a little

your taste of the taste of the viewer so

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.410
