00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:11.809
 I want to bring to your attention a simple 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.809
 greenhouse temperature controller 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:23.550
 consisting of two plastic bottles 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.769
 one big here she stands on the table and 2 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:34.620
 small interconnected 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:38.790
 a straw to adjust 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.670
 the temperature in the greenhouse is needed from above 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:48.930
 greenhouses ventilated pane or here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:55.920
 yassi mother window she 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:01:03.449
 rises and falls window leaf and glue 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:07.320
 on the bone between 2d strikes laid 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.020
 little bottle I sleep kilograms 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.020
 lakes as a return spring 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:23.220
 Here is our principle of action 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:25.439
 large plastic works are suspended 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.560
 on top of the greenhouse where the largest 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.060
 temperature for better efficiency 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.070
 You can still here and roll black 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.070
 polyethylene film 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:48.180
 it raises the temperature in the bottle to 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:51.210
 eighty degrees that's all 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.010
 reflected pressure loss 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.690
 the higher the temperature of the bottle the greater 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.690
 pressure here i am 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.030
 connected to a manometer from a tonometer 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.680
 even here through the tubing tube 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:18.220
 plastic bag not to the gauge 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:21.880
 here is the fattest body in the bottle also 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.600
 like here in the back here too 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:32.310
 pipe and tube connected here 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:35.650
 on the tubes of such a copper tube 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.970
 here 1 is cut the thread turns out and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.680
 on thermo glue for sealing ie 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.160
 must be tight if somewhere 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.630
 will the air pass this system 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.300
 will not work so be hot 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.360
 or the air expands rises 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.530
 pressure is transmitted through the tube 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:05.080
 always a little bottle small 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:09.850
 bottle expands raises dostochka 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.660
 and opens the window like this now we 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.739
 simulate this case by simply clicking on 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.440
 since this heating process 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:22.030
 happens a few minutes will not 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.600
 abuse your attention and just 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.600
 let's push on here and from 1 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:36.610
 follow the window leaf 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:39.120
 pressure is opening up 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.290
 rises 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.290
 somewhere around 40 millimeters 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.370
 bottle is small from being lost 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.200
 Boards rises pane rises 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.489
 holidays 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.819
 this is how it happens 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:05.079
 greenhouse temperature control for now 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.940
 we and airing so how hot 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:12.090
 air accumulates at the top 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.379
 greenhouses and open vents it goes 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.560
 Well that's all 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:21.519
 the whole system and even pressure in real 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:26.470
 conditions rises to 100 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:31.690
 millimeters of mercury pushing 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:35.830
 only up to 60 my push and here 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.889
 which raise real greenhouses should 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.180
 schools open window is stronger 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:46.750
 u so simplest adjustment 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.900
 temperatures in the greenhouse can be said 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.830
 folk improvised two 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:58.510
 Bottles and tubules 2 springs 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.780
 which you can left and the window here 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.780
 everything
