00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.550
 Napoleon is the name of the newest part of the baptism WHO series by Creative Class 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.990
 invites finds seventh offshoot of a few yes, but also without that 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 Main program runs the game, the reinstallation is sold namely the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.230
 normal sale that without the front of the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.310
 and the FDP wants the tables of the imperial edition who want us 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.519
 now look at the lousy boxing times 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.119
 which is more normal as it is the name suggests are not normal it is 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.039
 namely only dvd-box in which we have the manual and here 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.700
 at the balls played the woman who loves the game comes on two DVDs 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.980
 indeed 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.900
 and also has a correspondingly large installation art not 18 years old 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.140
 So for the installation should come from 8 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.620
 the Northwestern speed up to 20 minutes we go that data 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.100
 the hard disk shovel that is pretty steep 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.900
 the manual itself is 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.960
 after relatively thin because not already accused that he is quite complex 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.480
 It does not look too pretty for black, but it does not stand up 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.199
 the 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.699
 around the back part we cheerfully see the big HSV ours too 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.049
 After one more pixelated around five bidder units you get this one 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.070
 You can only get sales in this version 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.520
 Dawson then made five units in the course of the Sinclair campaign 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.540
 can unlock 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.530
 for example, that they are only a part of the element for themselves 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.400
 Austrian whose history I would like to summarize briefly now it 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.540
 As you know, that did not start 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.780
 March next to Isaac take home five super spectacular but after all, the dozens 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.020
 Campaign a bit more 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.649
 if you get them then just by the appropriate technology 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.840
 and every bit a bit more historical flair 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.010
 this version 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.550
 costs 35 euros so not quite as much as in the episode price plays that is yes 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.860
 as I said now in Hanappi no matter what the campaigns also comparatively 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.730
 are short 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.260
 is so much for the price for me 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.700
 the Celtic costs a little more, namely 50 euros and they are 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.060
 exclusively only on Amazon 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.570
 that means the sufferer can of course be the game over Steam Danon 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.070
 Also needs the online platform Steam forced activation 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.920
 there they can buy the imperialist too 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.110
 but hey if they buy on Steam, this pretty one has this pretty one 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.889
 Pappschuber Eifel course at once what's in there anyway 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.309
 namely as Mandy MÃ¼ller "They need me 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.259
 and for another 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.259
 the List book similar unfolds 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.939
 in them are again the two DVDs this was neatly separated 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.449
 as he needed it says we want it now has a turnover of good 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.209
 on the way, "she said 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.799
 maybe you could have synonymous with DVD or something with deliver and 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.909
 would have asked too much in the end 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.480
 the manual is exactly the same as in the normal retail version and that 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.040
 are 2000 on which also has its reason 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.410
 because in the many Greeks are in addition to the five units of the normal 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.670
 Retail version again ten additional units reasons 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.310
 that's the face reading that I can not with the customer yes 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.030
 Remember the heroes of the Napoleonic wars may well arise after 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.929
 Olympia would have no idea are popular 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:56.119
 and that's exactly what regiments are doing 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.139
 certain researched technologies or discounts provinces in the campaign 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.699
 For example, the site unlock French Lance Cavalry or that 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.849
 the first East Prussian grenadier battalion who does not know that 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.889
 But the thing is also a young rather nice idea 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.729
 these arbitrarily dangerous water-soluble of paid them 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.510
 contains only one but are as a star witness I must from Merck 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.889
 which was rejected by FIFA 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.339
 because that is too nice 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.219
 that is, the implementation contains an exclusive print 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.759
 with the factions and information about Napoleon's career 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.439
 Just as the stock market is supposed to be our exclusive there with info on Napoleons 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.299
 But now to the allegations I am something very different than 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:38.809
 not that one 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:43.229
 Walking time but also a little poster with some information about it 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:47.239
 Napoleon's and his career so I would have them as an exclusive print 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.619
 he is to be called 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.479
 Label fraud would almost say it's a small monastery like mine 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.919
 I also think that I can hardly believe it 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.699
 Wanting to hang on wall can make that happy I am so follows 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.299
 m and you are not much is still no nutritional value and several times back then 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.680
 the version collected costs 15 euros more than the normal retail version what 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:05.689
 you really 10 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.999
 okay they still stock their stuff over Steam in additional units 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.070
 published what a part already 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.369
 under this foul poster 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:16.569
 I want to buy the empirical even if the boxes are a bit 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:18.779
 Handsome looks rather do not stay with the normal ones 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.959
 Retail version the tracks striking
