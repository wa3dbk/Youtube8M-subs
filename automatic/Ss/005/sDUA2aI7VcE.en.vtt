00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
of jerks mine was nice and smooth and we

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.909 
of jerks mine was nice and smooth and we

however the water got measured and I can

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.409 
however the water got measured and I can

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
confirm that the men won because they

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.740 
confirm that the men won because they
were<00:05:59.509> faster<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:01.190> men<00:06:01.370> get<00:06:01.550> that<00:06:01.759> the<00:06:02.479> women

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
were faster so men get that the women

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:10.450 
were faster so men get that the women
get<00:06:02.900> that<00:06:08.620> hey<00:06:09.620> I<00:06:09.650> don't<00:06:09.830> like<00:06:10.069> you<00:06:10.250> very<00:06:10.400> much
