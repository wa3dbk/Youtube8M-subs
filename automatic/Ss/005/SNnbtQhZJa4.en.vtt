has<00:03:48.180> alienated<00:03:49.130> third-party<00:03:50.130> developers

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
has alienated third-party developers

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.870 
has alienated third-party developers
pretty<00:03:51.030> much<00:03:51.239> since<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.260> n64<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.280> really

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
pretty much since the n64 and really

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.000 
pretty much since the n64 and really
before<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.480> they<00:03:54.630> used<00:03:54.840> bullying<00:03:55.410> tactics

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
before that they used bullying tactics

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.340 
before that they used bullying tactics
to<00:03:56.579> keep<00:03:56.790> third-party<00:03:57.389> developers<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.170> make

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
to keep third-party developers to make

you<00:04:03.239> really<00:04:03.420> think<00:04:03.750> about<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.109> from<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.380> n64

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
you really think about it from the n64

from the n64 they've alienated
third-party<00:04:10.019> developers<00:04:10.590> it's<00:04:11.280> insane<00:04:11.760> when

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
approximately I think a gigabyte and a

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.740 
approximately I think a gigabyte and a
half<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:53.550> know<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:53.850> more<00:04:54.000> than<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.240> gigabyte<00:04:54.419> it

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
half you know is more than a gigabyte it

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.140 
half you know is more than a gigabyte it
was<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:54.870> gigabyte<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.380> a<00:04:55.530> half<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.150> developers

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
was a gigabyte and a half and developers

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.180 
was a gigabyte and a half and developers
got<00:04:57.419> pissed<00:04:57.780> off<00:04:57.960> again<00:04:58.320> because<00:04:58.770> they<00:04:58.979> either

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
got pissed off again because they either

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.430 
got pissed off again because they either
have<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.460> release<00:04:59.880> games<00:05:00.120> on<00:05:00.419> multiple<00:05:00.990> discs

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
have to release games on multiple discs

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.980 
have to release games on multiple discs
or<00:05:01.770> compress<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.850> crap<00:05:03.150> out<00:05:03.389> of<00:05:03.419> their<00:05:03.630> video

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
or compress the crap out of their video

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.290 
or compress the crap out of their video
and<00:05:04.050> their<00:05:04.590> code<00:05:04.889> and<00:05:05.280> they<00:05:05.370> got<00:05:05.550> frustrated

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
and their code and they got frustrated

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.379 
and their code and they got frustrated
too<00:05:06.479> then<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.530> go<00:05:07.680> on<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.389> generation

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
too then you go on to the generation

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.840 
too then you go on to the generation
after<00:05:09.570> that<00:05:09.780> yes<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.470> Wii<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.770> original<00:05:11.639> Wii

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
after that yes the Wii the original Wii

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
after that yes the Wii the original Wii
was<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.750> success<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.130> point<00:05:14.639> but<00:05:15.540> what

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
was a success to a point but what

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.050 
was a success to a point but what
happened<00:05:16.350> was<00:05:16.560> after<00:05:17.340> everyone<00:05:17.669> got<00:05:17.820> over

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
happened was after everyone got over

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.680 
happened was after everyone got over
swing<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.169> dildos<00:05:19.530> around<00:05:19.919> on<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.250> screen

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690

third-party<00:05:21.690> developers<00:05:22.229> couldn't<00:05:22.650> release

third-party developers couldn't release

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.070 
third-party developers couldn't release
the<00:05:23.550> same<00:05:23.850> games<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.539> they<00:05:24.630> could<00:05:24.780> release

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
the same games that they could release

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.310 
the same games that they could release
on<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.440> 360<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.280> ps3<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.690> games<00:05:27.900> because

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
on the 360 and ps3 the games because

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.110 
on the 360 and ps3 the games because
let's<00:05:28.979> face<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.400> original<00:05:29.760> Wii<00:05:29.910> was

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
let's face it the original Wii was

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.270 
let's face it the original Wii was
really<00:05:30.510> just<00:05:31.260> as<00:05:31.350> capable<00:05:31.800> as<00:05:31.860> an<00:05:32.039> original

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
really just as capable as an original

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.890 
really just as capable as an original
Xbox<00:05:32.610> actually<00:05:33.300> I<00:05:33.330> think<00:05:33.419> it<00:05:33.539> was<00:05:33.600> slightly

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
Xbox actually I think it was slightly

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.680 
Xbox actually I think it was slightly
less<00:05:34.350> powerful<00:05:34.620> than<00:05:35.100> an<00:05:35.550> original<00:05:35.820> Xbox<00:05:36.150> so

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
less powerful than an original Xbox so

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.330 
less powerful than an original Xbox so
you<00:05:36.780> weren't<00:05:37.020> releasing<00:05:37.650> those<00:05:37.770> triple-a

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
you weren't releasing those triple-a

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.070 
you weren't releasing those triple-a
