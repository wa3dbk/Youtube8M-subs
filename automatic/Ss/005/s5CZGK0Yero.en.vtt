we sports tennis so our main focus has
been<00:01:18.750> motion<00:01:19.750> control<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.800> so<00:01:20.890> he's<00:01:21.010> taking

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
been motion control and so he's taking

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.800 
been motion control and so he's taking
that<00:01:21.400> very<00:01:21.610> simple<00:01:22.030> sort<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.300> control<00:01:22.570> system

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
that very simple sort of control system

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.359 
that very simple sort of control system
that<00:01:23.050> everybody<00:01:23.350> kind<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.680> expect<00:01:24.070> but

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
that everybody kind of expect but

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.730 
that everybody kind of expect but
marrying<00:01:24.910> it<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.479> very<00:01:25.750> real<00:01:25.960> contender

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
marrying it to a very real contender

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.320 
marrying it to a very real contender
scale<00:01:26.979> which<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.430> think<00:01:27.580> will<00:01:27.640> provide<00:01:27.940> private

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
scale which I think will provide private

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330 
scale which I think will provide private
from<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:28.720> it's<00:01:28.900> going<00:01:29.110> so<00:01:29.500> we're<00:01:29.740> doing<00:01:29.920> taking

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
from so it's going so we're doing taking

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.859 
from so it's going so we're doing taking
the<00:01:30.460> elements<00:01:30.820> from<00:01:30.880> these<00:01:31.090> boxed<00:01:31.420> items<00:01:31.690> and

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
the elements from these boxed items and

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.719 
the elements from these boxed items and
adding<00:01:32.290> more<00:01:32.410> jet<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.800> doing<00:01:33.010> more<00:01:33.250> movements

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
adding more jet to doing more movements

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.600 
adding more jet to doing more movements
and<00:01:33.910> more<00:01:34.390> control

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.280

technically so that's a gyroscope to the
we<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.850> allows<00:01:47.120> you<00:01:47.330> to<00:01:47.480> get

control and also allows us to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.440 
control and also allows us to
distinguish<00:02:16.040> more<00:02:16.280> between<00:02:16.700> shots<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.150> drop

with<00:02:58.460> VT<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.210> it's<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.480> very<00:02:59.660> realistic

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
with VT is that it's a very realistic

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
probably been our biggest challenge I

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.040 
probably been our biggest challenge I
think<00:03:12.680> if<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.100> practice<00:03:13.520> enough<00:03:13.610> with<00:03:14.209> VT<00:03:14.690> 09

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
think if you practice enough with VT 09

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.410 
think if you practice enough with VT 09
on<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.770> wing<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.400> might<00:03:16.580> be<00:03:16.730> able<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.060> learn<00:03:17.360> a

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
you're using motion plus as you'll be

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.570 
you're using motion plus as you'll be
