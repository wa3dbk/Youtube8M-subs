snap sometimes this is made of a more
absorbent<00:04:43.810> material<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.810> shock<00:04:47.140> is

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
absorbent material so that the shock is

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.560 
absorbent material so that the shock is
handled<00:04:48.310> much<00:04:48.580> better<00:04:48.880> and<00:04:49.120> therefore<00:04:49.450> you
