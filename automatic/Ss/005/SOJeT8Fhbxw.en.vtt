00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
bands of the punch just in in a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.600 
bands of the punch just in in a
horizontal<00:03:00.390> fashion<00:03:00.860> with<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.040> one<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.370> just

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
horizontal fashion with this one I just

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.059 
horizontal fashion with this one I just
used<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:03.030> two<00:03:03.420> punches<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.680> did<00:03:04.920> them

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
used to two punches and I did them

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.100 
used to two punches and I did them
vertically<00:03:05.580> because<00:03:05.850> again<00:03:06.269> it's<00:03:06.450> about<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> 12

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
vertically because again it's about a 12

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.770 
vertically because again it's about a 12
inch<00:03:07.350> tall<00:03:07.620> box<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.940> was<00:03:09.090> it's<00:03:09.360> four

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
inch tall box and it was it's four

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.320 
inch tall box and it was it's four
inches<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.500> was<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.220> can't<00:03:11.880> quite<00:03:12.060> get

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
inches so it was like I can't quite get

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.900 
inches so it was like I can't quite get
12<00:03:12.720> inches<00:03:13.140> in<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:14.069> circumference<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.610> the

12 inches in the circumference of the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.479 
12 inches in the circumference of the
box<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.080> decided<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.709> run<00:03:16.920> them<00:03:17.100> vertically

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
box so I decided to run them vertically

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.310 
box so I decided to run them vertically
and<00:03:17.790> with<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.420> one<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.989> used<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.840> Martha

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
and with this one I used this Martha

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.490 
and with this one I used this Martha
Stewart<00:03:22.739> shell<00:03:23.430> type<00:03:23.820> looking<00:03:24.359> punch<00:03:25.200> and
