00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
like a little tail back there and they

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.080 
like a little tail back there and they
make<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> video<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.779> him<00:00:22.189> because<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> picture

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
make a video of him because a picture

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.550 
make a video of him because a picture
doesn't<00:00:24.269> serve<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> much<00:00:24.779> justice<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.380> don't

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
doesn't serve a much justice I don't

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.910 
doesn't serve a much justice I don't
think<00:00:25.859> because<00:00:26.430> he's<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.760> awkward<00:00:27.680> yeah<00:00:28.680> but

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
think because he's so awkward yeah but

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.450 
think because he's so awkward yeah but
there's<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> bottom<00:00:30.800> little<00:00:31.800> tail<00:00:34.460> he's

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
there's the bottom little tail he's

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.590 
there's the bottom little tail he's
actually<00:00:35.640> wills<00:00:36.510> favorite<00:00:38.120> for<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.270> reason

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
actually wills favorite for some reason

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.850 
actually wills favorite for some reason
I<00:00:39.780> guess<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.290> he's<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.530> only<00:00:40.620> one

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I guess is because he's the only one

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.240 
I guess is because he's the only one
doesn't<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.219> big<00:00:41.489> gaping<00:00:42.000> mouth<00:00:43.160> next<00:00:44.160> we
