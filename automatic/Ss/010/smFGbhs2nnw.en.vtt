00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.490
 g 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.770
 are philosophical reasons for which 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.410
 then you have to do a restaurant 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.079
 if in mystery it is in isolated places 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.720
 because joy almost three and a half years ago 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.850
 in the honey bag manager of the room 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.010
 historical Latin theme saying 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.780
 I feel it is not wrong 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.110
 little Londoners during calacipites 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.309
 wish us too much and think about it 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.129
 say I made an extremely gesture 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.489
 extremely exciting impulsive 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.019
 I met Matthew we found in 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.510
 harmony with the Greek stock cars 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.460
 unexpectedly the pda caf and not there 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.619
 doubt that matthew collapses his 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.330
 genius of the sum to his profession 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:05.170
 heels I have no way amplified the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.150
 my brizzi 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.210
 I really tried to do the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.740
 what there was a transformed place 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.080
 because it comes from later for i 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.810
 Turin does not repeat a prestige in Venice 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.750
 for the city and in the reason of pride that 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.200
 I talk to some of those accounts 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.910
 works at 100 also selected by virtue 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.210
 of it is normally passion heat 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.760
 place a lot to chat and 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.880
 voter sharing with them a 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.230
 barchino I knew learned and known 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.450
 which is to be extremely 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:43.630
 open ticino darkness available and makes 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.130
 yes it will go into the pool decorations 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.580
 also the langue setting 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.290
 there is the emptiness that hides where it goes 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.050
 hospitality is to be felt by anyone 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.300
 will go to the special camp that comes to 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.840
 enough cocktail because this above 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.030
 of partners cisco concorde goes to whom 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.150
 instead old because maybe they are 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.039
 different to eat at sun sea â€‹â€‹dinner for 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.739
 a gastronomy delivery kitchen 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.680
 the palace of the camp as they were 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.629
 present 50 years history tries to 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.109
 there are recurrent contemporary ways 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.540
 this is not talking about artists 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.969
 the past decorative night this is 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.189
 an important day regardless you love 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:31.159
 baronet that the share of the caudio a 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.049
 important day because torino has of 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.720
 new change I've always had 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.469
 the ambition to return to turin because 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.980
 even Turin could have had of 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.790
 new an important meeting point e 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.730
 enjoyable 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.099
 I liked the crazy good taste 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.720
 that he put into this project 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.060
 and that's why I married you ask 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.069
 enter into partnership with him because 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.840
 I think then there are moments where 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.959
 in life he can also have courage 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.569
 I give myself to the fuchsia city I grant myself 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.169
 it is I who ask you and ask turin 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:18.280
 to then be able to express everything else 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:18.280
 I think it can come on the 14th of a 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.229
 stock of old gearboxes 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.840
 very minimal stock we bought 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:37.950
 just money 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.490
 but there is nothing because it was us 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.730
 bottles bottles bottles 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.600
 liqueur also from the late nineteenth century and 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.990
 barolo we have 1961 can all but 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.990
 yet
