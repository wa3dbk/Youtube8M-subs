hey<00:00:05.640> guys<00:00:05.879> morphologies<00:00:06.660> here<00:00:06.810> again<00:00:07.020> with<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
hey guys morphologies here again with a

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.500 
hey guys morphologies here again with a
new<00:00:07.379> video<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.710> space<00:00:08.250> engineers<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:08.970> today<00:00:09.360> I

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
new video on space engineers and today I

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.450 
new video on space engineers and today I
want<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.809> showcase<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.530> new<00:00:10.830> design<00:00:11.190> for

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
want to showcase to you a new design for

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.520 
want to showcase to you a new design for
a<00:00:11.490> blaster<00:00:12.090> that's<00:00:12.420> only<00:00:12.690> been<00:00:12.960> made<00:00:13.230> possible

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
a blaster that's only been made possible

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.950 
a blaster that's only been made possible
by<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.070> recent<00:00:14.580> update<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.269> merge<00:00:15.599> blocks

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
by the recent update with merge blocks

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.349 
by the recent update with merge blocks
now<00:00:16.410> blasters<00:00:17.070> aren't<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.490> new<00:00:17.609> thing<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.090> space

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
now blasters aren't a new thing in space

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.849 
now blasters aren't a new thing in space
engineers<00:00:18.869> people<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.350> done<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
engineers people have done it in the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
engineers people have done it in the
past<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.699> what's<00:00:21.180> different<00:00:21.570> now<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
past but what's different now is that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.050 
past but what's different now is that
you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.230> make<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> much<00:00:22.920> more<00:00:23.220> compact<00:00:23.880> design

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
you can make a much more compact design

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.900 
you can make a much more compact design
than<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.050> could<00:00:25.320> before<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.250> update<00:00:26.670> in

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
than you could before the update in

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.029 
than you could before the update in
addition<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.840> design<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> lot<00:00:28.800> more

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
addition this design is a lot more

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.040 
addition this design is a lot more
stable<00:00:29.519> than<00:00:29.670> previous<00:00:30.210> iterations<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
stable than previous iterations of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.110 
stable than previous iterations of
blasters<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.099> that's<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> past

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
blasters and that's because in the past

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.330 
blasters and that's because in the past
it<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.480> only<00:00:33.809> possible<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.410> create<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.739> blaster

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
it was only possible to create a blaster

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.549 
it was only possible to create a blaster
with<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> single<00:00:36.180> pivot<00:00:36.420> point<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.410> see

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
with a single pivot point as you can see

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
with a single pivot point as you can see
here<00:00:37.829> without<00:00:38.070> merge<00:00:38.520> blocks<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.120> blast<00:00:39.480> or

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
here without merge blocks a blast or

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.660 
here without merge blocks a blast or
could<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.469> child<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.160> two<00:00:41.370> rotor

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
could not be the child of a two rotor

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
could not be the child of a two rotor
relationship<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.660> now<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.260> merge

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
relationship but now because of merge

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.650 
relationship but now because of merge
blocks<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.250> actually<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> blast<00:00:45.329> or

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
blocks you can actually have a blast or

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
blocks you can actually have a blast or
with<00:00:46.079> two<00:00:46.350> rotors<00:00:46.739> attached<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
with two rotors attached to it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.100 
with two rotors attached to it
effectively<00:00:48.120> making<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> much<00:00:49.079> more

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
effectively making for a much more

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.189 
effectively making for a much more
stable<00:00:49.829> design<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
stable design as you can see the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
stable design as you can see the
transition<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.890> very<00:00:53.190> smooth<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.059> haven't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
transition is very smooth and I haven't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
transition is very smooth and I haven't
had<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> come<00:00:54.960> off<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> tracks<00:00:55.590> yet<00:00:55.920> or

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
had it come off the tracks yet or

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.490 
had it come off the tracks yet or
destroy<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> blaster<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> process<00:00:58.289> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
destroy the blaster in the process in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049 
destroy the blaster in the process in
addition<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> mechanism

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
addition you can see that this mechanism

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.630 
addition you can see that this mechanism
hardly<00:01:00.870> takes<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.289> any<00:01:01.350> space<00:01:02.039> behind<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
hardly takes up any space behind the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
hardly takes up any space behind the
door<00:01:02.879> what's<00:01:03.539> more<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> much

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
door what's more is that you have a much

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.679 
door what's more is that you have a much
tighter<00:01:05.010> tolerance<00:01:05.610> between<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.150> blaster

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
tighter tolerance between the blaster

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.929 
tighter tolerance between the blaster
and<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.229> structure<00:01:07.710> itself<00:01:08.100> meaning<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and the structure itself meaning that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
and the structure itself meaning that
it's<00:01:09.119> much<00:01:09.360> harder<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.750> people<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.350> fit<00:01:10.560> or

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it's much harder for people to fit or

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.429 
it's much harder for people to fit or
shoot<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> gaps<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.030> also<00:01:12.570> tested<00:01:13.080> its

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
shoot in the gaps I also tested its

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.679 
shoot in the gaps I also tested its
scalability<00:01:14.040> by<00:01:14.430> testing<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> very

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
scalability by testing it on a very

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.289 
scalability by testing it on a very
large<00:01:16.080> blast<00:01:16.530> door<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> station<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
large blast door for a station in the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
large blast door for a station in the
background<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.229> generator<00:01:19.710> just

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
background you can see a generator just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
background you can see a generator just
to<00:01:20.310> give<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> an<00:01:20.640> idea<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:21.240> large<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.930> door

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
to give you an idea how large this door

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.190 
to give you an idea how large this door
actually<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
actually is and here you can see that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200 
actually is and here you can see that
the<00:01:25.350> mechanism<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.040> essentially<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:27.030> as

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the mechanism is essentially the same as

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330 
the mechanism is essentially the same as
on<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.390> smaller<00:01:27.840> door<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:28.979> large

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
on the smaller door but on a very large

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.880 
on the smaller door but on a very large
scale<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:30.090> comparison<00:01:30.780> now<00:01:31.200> although<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
scale in comparison now although this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.530 
scale in comparison now although this
design<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> lot<00:01:32.759> more<00:01:32.970> simple<00:01:33.240> than

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
design is a lot more simple than

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.719 
design is a lot more simple than
previous<00:01:33.990> iterations<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.799> blasters<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.549> is

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
previous iterations of blasters it is

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.030 
previous iterations of blasters it is
still<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> bit<00:01:36.450> finicky<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.200> put<00:01:37.409> together<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
still a bit finicky to put together and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.310 
still a bit finicky to put together and
that's<00:01:38.400> why<00:01:38.640> later<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.420> week<00:01:39.659> I'm<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that's why later this week I'm going to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.200 
that's why later this week I'm going to
make<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> tutorial<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.250> show<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.460> guys<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
make a tutorial to show you guys how to
