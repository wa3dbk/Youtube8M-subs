00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
just means the system's being turned on

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.500 
just means the system's being turned on

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
and then red is bad so most likely a bad

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.830 
and then red is bad so most likely a bad
fuse<00:04:23.900> or<00:04:24.080> at<00:04:24.440> least<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.740> can<00:04:24.919> start<00:04:25.610> with<00:04:25.760> a
