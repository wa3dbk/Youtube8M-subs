00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.239
 How about friends, I'm Javier Motta and now 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 we are here on the outskirts of new 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.270
 york in the test of the new line of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 the audi that now has versions for 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.059
 the model s 6 ls 7 that is the great 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 tourism and the 8 s that now with this 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.800
 new improvement in the engine that has been 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.839
 fact is the most powerful sedan ever 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.059
 manufactured by the audi we are driving 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.659
 at 6 o'clock with the new v8 engine of 4 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.250
 liters that generates 420 horsepower 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.100
 and that also has the innovative system 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.560
 that eliminates the use of four cylinders 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.310
 once a speed is reached 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.310
 cruise determined by the revolutions 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.820
 of the engine not so much for the speed that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.820
 he is driving 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.570
 this engine developed by a group of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.010
 100 engineers in Germany 100 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.430
 audi engineers who worked 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.040
 only in the refinement of this 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.440
 engine of a job that took more than 2 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.120
 years of development is now available 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.000
 here in the usa for audi a6 and a7 a 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.360
 motor that is also substantially more 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.270
 light thanks to the integration of the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.180
 turbos of the turbochargers within 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.550
 the body as such of the engine with 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.220
 which eliminates a lot of space and also makes 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.050
 make it much more efficient by the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.500
 weight loss that was achieved in the 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.910
 development of this new engine 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.580
 the s 8 model also has a v8 engine 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.670
 of 4 liters with double turbo charger 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.540
 but this develops 520 horses 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:21.010
 force between 6,000 and 6400 revolutions 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.040
 per minute has 481 pounds of torque 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.670
 per linear foot and accelerates from 0 to 60 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.600
 minutes in only 3.9 seconds with 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.880
 a maximum speed of 155 miles per 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.010
 one of the great advantages that has 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.870
 achieved the team of engineers of the audi 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.590
 with these new engines especially with 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.500
 this one of the s8 is that thanks to the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.020
 reduction in fuel consumption the s8 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.600
 now you do not have to pay the tax 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.480
 for excessive consumption of gasoline other 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.370
 great advantage for luxury lovers 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.370
 performance car models
