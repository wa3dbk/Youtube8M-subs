00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
this edge I'm going to bring some warm

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.100 
this edge I'm going to bring some warm
into<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.380> but<00:02:25.860> dark<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:27.090> let<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.570> blend

together<00:02:29.210> or<00:02:30.210> mingle<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.340> still<00:02:32.670> a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
together or mingle and is that still a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.100 
together or mingle and is that still a
little<00:02:32.910> dampen<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> little<00:02:33.990> bit

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
little dampen that it's a little bit

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.840 
little dampen that it's a little bit
damp<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.740> right<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.250> edge<00:02:35.460> it's<00:02:35.760> a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
damp and right on this edge it's a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.490 
damp and right on this edge it's a
little<00:02:36.090> bit<00:02:36.240> damp<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.810> see<00:02:37.020> how<00:02:37.110> we're<00:02:37.380> getting

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
little bit damp to see how we're getting

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400 
little bit damp to see how we're getting
a<00:02:37.740> soft<00:02:38.010> edge<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:39.420> some<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.840> areas<00:02:40.230> where

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
a soft edge but some of the areas where

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.930 
a soft edge but some of the areas where
I<00:02:40.470> didn't<00:02:40.830> paint<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.310> there's<00:02:41.730> going<00:02:41.880> to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
I didn't paint it all there's going to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:53.560 
I didn't paint it all there's going to
be<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.120> hard<00:02:42.420> edge<00:02:42.630> there<00:02:49.250> okay<00:02:51.560> more<00:02:52.560> yellow<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
be a hard edge there okay more yellow a

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:01.550 
be a hard edge there okay more yellow a
little<00:02:54.570> more

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.470 

now<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.190> can<00:03:02.340> do<00:03:02.460> this<00:03:02.670> without<00:03:02.850> turning<00:03:03.330> it

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
now you can do this without turning it

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.450 
now you can do this without turning it
into<00:03:03.630> mud<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.320> let<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.560> do<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.920> crawling

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
into mud if you let it do the crawling

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.280 
into mud if you let it do the crawling
around<00:03:05.790> instead<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.390> pushing<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.870> all<00:03:07.050> around

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290

with your brush I'm going to darken up
quite<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> bit<00:03:10.560> right<00:03:10.770> on<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.130> edge<00:03:11.370> what<00:03:11.880> do

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
quite a bit right on this edge what do

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.870 
quite a bit right on this edge what do
we<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.270> about<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:13.310> where<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.400> turns<00:03:14.670> into

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
we know about that where it turns into

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.950 
we know about that where it turns into
the<00:03:15.030> core<00:03:15.240> shadow

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
the core shadow

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
8020 chance it's gonna look good

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:55.219 
8020 chance it's gonna look good

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
get down in here I'm gonna let it get

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.820 
get down in here I'm gonna let it get
just<00:05:57.089> a<00:05:57.209> little<00:05:57.240> bit<00:05:57.569> bluer<00:05:58.020> so<00:05:58.589> I'm<00:05:58.680> gonna

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
just a little bit bluer so I'm gonna

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.949 
just a little bit bluer so I'm gonna
just<00:05:59.339> roll<00:05:59.939> it<00:06:00.149> back<00:06:00.389> a<00:06:00.419> little<00:06:00.569> bit

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:00.959 
just roll it back a little bit

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:06.429 
just roll it back a little bit
introducing<00:06:01.919> this<00:06:02.069> blue<00:06:02.309> into<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:02.669> orange

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:06.439 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:08.779 

just<00:06:07.439> so<00:06:07.619> I<00:06:07.649> can<00:06:07.800> have<00:06:08.129> a<00:06:08.159> little<00:06:08.339> more<00:06:08.580> variety

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
just so I can have a little more variety

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:15.440 
just so I can have a little more variety
in<00:06:09.180> here<00:06:09.479> really<00:06:09.990> no<00:06:10.259> other<00:06:10.409> reason

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.620 

yeah<00:06:16.370> break<00:06:17.370> that<00:06:17.640> up<00:06:17.670> where<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.180> snow<00:06:18.450> is

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
yeah break that up where the snow is

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.180 
yeah break that up where the snow is
falling<00:06:19.020> so<00:06:19.200> it<00:06:19.290> looks<00:06:19.500> a<00:06:19.620> little<00:06:19.740> bit<00:06:19.980> for

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
falling so it looks a little bit for

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.310 
falling so it looks a little bit for
where<00:06:20.340> it<00:06:20.460> falls<00:06:20.700> on<00:06:20.970> the<00:06:21.150> rocks<00:06:21.390> then<00:06:22.170> I'll

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
where it falls on the rocks then I'll

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.490 
where it falls on the rocks then I'll
bring<00:06:22.620> these<00:06:22.890> rocks<00:06:23.280> down<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:24.690> bring<00:06:25.410> them

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
bring these rocks down and bring them

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:36.210 
bring these rocks down and bring them
right<00:06:25.740> up<00:06:25.950> against<00:06:26.900> where<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:28.050> snow<00:06:28.320> does

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.570 

and<00:06:37.000> this<00:06:37.210> one<00:06:37.770> leave<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.800> little<00:06:39.100> edge<00:06:39.220> there<00:06:39.550> a

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
and this one leave a little edge there a

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:48.690 
and this one leave a little edge there a
little<00:06:39.790> highlight

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.279 

look<00:06:49.060> how<00:06:49.240> that<00:06:49.300> changed

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.909 

okay<00:06:54.949> now<00:06:55.369> I'm<00:06:55.490> going<00:06:55.669> to<00:06:55.759> paint<00:06:55.999> the<00:06:56.919> places

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
okay now I'm going to paint the places

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:06.100 
okay now I'm going to paint the places
where<00:06:58.099> the<00:06:58.249> snow<00:06:58.550> comes<00:06:58.969> through<00:07:04.719> to<00:07:05.719> create<00:07:06.080> a

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
where the snow comes through to create a

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.859 
where the snow comes through to create a
shape<00:07:06.469> in<00:07:06.770> here<00:07:07.069> that<00:07:07.759> kind<00:07:08.059> of<00:07:08.149> helps<00:07:08.509> us<00:07:08.629> to

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:08.869 
shape in here that kind of helps us to

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:11.920 
shape in here that kind of helps us to
to<00:07:09.439> come<00:07:09.680> down<00:07:09.860> like<00:07:09.889> this<00:07:10.309> as<00:07:10.520> an<00:07:10.669> angle<00:07:10.930> I'll

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
to come down like this as an angle I'll

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.339 
to come down like this as an angle I'll
be<00:07:12.199> following<00:07:12.649> that<00:07:12.949> from<00:07:13.279> there<00:07:14.169> that<00:07:15.169> we've

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:15.349 
be following that from there that we've

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:20.499 
be following that from there that we've
started<00:07:15.619> to<00:07:15.889> develop<00:07:16.309> with<00:07:16.490> the<00:07:16.610> sky<00:07:19.509> now

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:20.509 
started to develop with the sky now

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:23.290 
started to develop with the sky now
these<00:07:20.719> are<00:07:21.169> this<00:07:22.159> is<00:07:22.219> the<00:07:22.520> style<00:07:22.789> of<00:07:22.969> course

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300 
these are this is the style of course

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.809 
these are this is the style of course
and<00:07:23.599> these<00:07:23.899> patches<00:07:24.259> I'm<00:07:24.680> making<00:07:25.129> are<00:07:25.580> the

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:25.819 
and these patches I'm making are the

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:27.969 
and these patches I'm making are the
patches<00:07:26.389> that<00:07:26.599> were<00:07:27.259> seeing<00:07:27.589> through<00:07:27.949> the

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:27.979 
patches that were seeing through the

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:30.609 
patches that were seeing through the
snow<00:07:28.430> and<00:07:28.729> once<00:07:29.029> we<00:07:29.240> we<00:07:29.599> kind<00:07:29.899> of<00:07:29.990> form<00:07:30.349> those

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:30.619 
snow and once we we kind of form those

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:33.399 
snow and once we we kind of form those
and<00:07:30.889> giving<00:07:31.219> some<00:07:31.399> shape<00:07:31.789> and<00:07:32.659> dimension<00:07:33.229> when

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:33.409 
and giving some shape and dimension when

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:36.279 
and giving some shape and dimension when
we<00:07:33.559> get<00:07:33.709> the<00:07:33.860> shadow<00:07:34.779> shadows<00:07:35.779> on<00:07:35.959> there<00:07:36.139> to

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:36.289 
we get the shadow shadows on there to

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.949 
we get the shadow shadows on there to
look<00:07:36.439> more<00:07:36.649> interesting
