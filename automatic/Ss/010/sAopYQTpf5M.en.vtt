strike very a moat around right here a
tester<00:01:25.070> receiver<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.579> battery<00:01:25.899> what<00:01:26.899> we're

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
tester receiver and battery what we're

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.690 
tester receiver and battery what we're
hoping<00:01:27.289> is<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.649> they<00:01:28.009> notice<00:01:28.610> the

hoping is that they notice the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.620 
hoping is that they notice the
indicators<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.450> they<00:01:30.170> react<00:01:30.799> based<00:01:30.979> on<00:01:31.219> that

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
indicators and they react based on that

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.349 
indicators and they react based on that
eventually<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:33.079> convoy<00:01:33.500> appears<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:38.060> teams

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
eventually the convoy appears the teams

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.580 
eventually the convoy appears the teams
