white and now we're going to more games
within<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:44.000> series<00:01:44.420> on<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.229> d/s<00:01:45.590> now<00:01:46.310> i<00:01:46.340> find

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
within the series on the d/s now i find

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.310 
within the series on the d/s now i find
that<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.030> be<00:01:47.210> kind<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.600> waste<00:01:47.780> because<00:01:47.990> i

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
that to be kind of a waste because i

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.810 
that to be kind of a waste because i
think<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.680> would<00:01:48.770> be<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.890> much<00:01:49.159> better<00:01:49.220> move<00:01:49.670> on

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
think it would be a much better move on

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.609 
think it would be a much better move on
antennas<00:01:50.270> part<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.630> bring<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.869> on<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.080> 3ds<00:01:51.439> i

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
antennas part to bring it on the 3ds i

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.380 
antennas part to bring it on the 3ds i
mean<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.040> their<00:01:52.280> current<00:01:52.640> platform<00:01:52.909> for

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
mean that is their current platform for

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.020 
mean that is their current platform for
their<00:01:53.510> handheld<00:01:53.930> gaming<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.700> overall<00:01:55.700> i<00:01:55.729> mean

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
their handheld gaming and overall i mean

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.480 
their handheld gaming and overall i mean
it's<00:01:56.150> got<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.299> lot<00:01:56.450> more<00:01:56.510> horsepower<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.560> well

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
it's got a lot more horsepower and well

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.670 
it's got a lot more horsepower and well
it'd<00:01:58.820> just<00:01:59.119> be<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.330> better<00:01:59.600> idea<00:01:59.810> at<00:02:00.200> least<00:02:00.260> i

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
it'd just be a better idea at least i

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.210 
it'd just be a better idea at least i
think<00:02:00.799> so<00:02:01.420> but<00:02:02.439> overall<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:03.830> doesn't<00:02:04.100> matter

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
think so but overall it doesn't matter

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.249 
think so but overall it doesn't matter
pokemon<00:02:04.850> games<00:02:05.060> they<00:02:05.240> are<00:02:05.270> going<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.689> sell<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
pokemon games they are going to sell and

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.510
