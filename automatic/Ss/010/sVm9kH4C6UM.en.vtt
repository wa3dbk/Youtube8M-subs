9.9 engine four-stroke long shaft
well<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.040> bought<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.940> because<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.150> got<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> good

well I bought it because it got a good
deal<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:16.250> at<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> long<00:00:17.580> shaft<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.230> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
deal on it at the long shaft so what I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.779 
deal on it at the long shaft so what I
needed<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.590> make<00:00:19.740> with<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.010> transom<00:00:20.369> elevator

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
needed to make with the transom elevator

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.960 
needed to make with the transom elevator
I<00:00:21.949> didn't<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> lot<00:00:23.130> about<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.609> transom

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
I didn't know a lot about the transom

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580 
I didn't know a lot about the transom
elevator<00:00:24.359> did<00:00:24.600> some<00:00:24.750> research<00:00:25.080> books<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
elevator did some research books on the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.070 
elevator did some research books on the
Internet

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
Internet

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
Internet
so<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> made<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:29.000> with<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> specs<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.539> I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
so I made one with the specs that I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.749 
so I made one with the specs that I
found<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> internet<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.550> made<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> big

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
found on the internet and it made a big

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090 
found on the internet and it made a big
difference<00:00:33.050> when<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> had<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> long<00:00:34.590> shaft<00:00:34.860> on

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
difference when I had the long shaft on

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
difference when I had the long shaft on
here<00:00:35.309> without<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.000> transom<00:00:36.390> elevator

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
here without the transom elevator

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.680 
here without the transom elevator
I<00:00:37.110> ran<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:37.950> nine<00:00:38.160> miles<00:00:38.579> an<00:00:38.730> hour<00:00:38.940> before

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I ran about nine miles an hour before

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
I ran about nine miles an hour before
water<00:00:40.170> went<00:00:40.559> back<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:41.190> come<00:00:41.370> over<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> back

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
water went back would come over the back

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
water went back would come over the back
transom<00:00:42.690> into<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> boat<00:00:43.350> well<00:00:44.309> after<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> made

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
transom into the boat well after I made

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.670 
transom into the boat well after I made
my<00:00:44.879> transom<00:00:45.510> elevator<00:00:45.960> put<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> transom

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
my transom elevator put the transom

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.069 
my transom elevator put the transom
elevator<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> now<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.149> run<00:00:48.329> at<00:00:48.480> 23

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
elevator on there I now can run at 23

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.430 
elevator on there I now can run at 23
miles<00:00:49.320> an<00:00:49.559> hour<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.840> nothing<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
miles an hour and there's nothing to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.250 
miles an hour and there's nothing to
worry<00:00:52.649> about<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.699> transom<00:00:54.059> elevator<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:55.199> be

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
worry about the transom elevator can be

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
worry about the transom elevator can be
bolted<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> transom<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:57.360> right

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
bolted down to the transom that's right

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.330 
bolted down to the transom that's right
now<00:00:58.340> because<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:00:59.579> telling<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:01.340> C

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
now because I'm telling it I have C

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.840 
now because I'm telling it I have C
clamps<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.830> but<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
clamps on it but you can now use a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.469 
clamps on it but you can now use a
transom<00:01:06.360> elevator<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.740> 9.9<00:01:08.400> engine<00:01:09.150> long

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
transom elevator and a 9.9 engine long

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
transom elevator and a 9.9 engine long
shaft<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> transom<00:01:11.159> elevator<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.820> get

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
shaft with a transom elevator to get

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.410 
shaft with a transom elevator to get
full<00:01:12.299> max<00:01:12.570> speed<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> let's<00:01:14.820> try<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.180> real

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
full max speed so let's try it out real

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.280 
full max speed so let's try it out real
quick<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:16.560> fast<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.009> go<00:01:18.290> gonna

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
quick and see how fast we can go gonna

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.130 
quick and see how fast we can go gonna
put<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.680> gear

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.100 

go<00:01:27.650> turn<00:01:27.860> us<00:01:27.980> around
