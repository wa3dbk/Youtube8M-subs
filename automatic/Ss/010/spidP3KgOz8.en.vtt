 we have to do it's good we're going to 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.909
 work two games on this side I have 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.899
 my hot pot and on this side my 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.429
 hot pan 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.799
 the first thing that we are going to do now is good 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.949
 that's how we add our chicken cream 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:57.760
 with mushrooms we're going to pour it out of this 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.309
 side of our pan is very hot and 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.999
 let's book this side we're going to 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.999
 mix very well 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.479
 add a little water 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.759
 Excellent 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.829
 and let's rest approximately 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.399
 for three minutes but you have to mix 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.110
 very well we have to make it homogeneous 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.579
 excellent we will let it rest 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.740
 while I'm going to prepare the mass of 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.360
 my gorditas on this side I already have a list 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.299
 to my marzipan gorditas as we prepare it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 it is simply corn flour with a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.600
 touch of salt and water 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.810
 let's incorporate all these well 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.220
 ingredients to form this dough 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.649
 We are going to form our masita as well and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.770
 we are going to make little circles with our 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.569
 hand and to make the gorditas good there 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.149
 that to flip now yes you have to flatten from 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.649
 this way you have to do them a little bit 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.840
 thick because at the moment for the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.590
 moment to open do not leave us 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.270
 break perfect we already have list let's 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.610
 add the here to our pan not 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.069
 we need oil just going 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.270
 direct that we're going to do two it seems 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:07.640
 there goes we do the same procedure 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 we cut a little bit that from the other side 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.590
 very well 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.750
 extend and move to our pan if 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.030
 his hands are stuck he picks up his hands 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.850
