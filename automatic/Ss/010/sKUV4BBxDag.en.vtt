hi<00:00:01.410> my<00:00:01.589> name<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.740> Cole<00:00:02.010> with<00:00:02.190> expert<00:00:02.520> village

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hi my name is Cole with expert village

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.190 
hi my name is Cole with expert village
we'll<00:00:03.300> be<00:00:03.330> talking<00:00:03.510> about<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.899> buoyancy

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
we'll be talking about the buoyancy

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.230 
we'll be talking about the buoyancy
compensator<00:00:04.799> device<00:00:05.069> or<00:00:05.339> also<00:00:05.790> BCD<00:00:06.319> BCD

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
compensator device or also BCD BCD

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.330 
compensator device or also BCD BCD
basically<00:00:09.440> it<00:00:10.440> looks<00:00:10.590> pretty<00:00:10.800> technical<00:00:11.010> but

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
basically it looks pretty technical but

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.070 
basically it looks pretty technical but
it's<00:00:11.670> nothing<00:00:12.000> more<00:00:12.120> than<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.360> glorified<00:00:12.540> life

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
it's nothing more than a glorified life

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.250 
it's nothing more than a glorified life
preserver<00:00:13.519> at<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> surface<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:15.690> inflated

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
preserver at the surface it's inflated

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.050 
preserver at the surface it's inflated
using<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.619> blue<00:00:16.800> buttons<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.730> can<00:00:17.850> float

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
using this blue buttons so we can float

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.490 
using this blue buttons so we can float
there<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.480> hang<00:00:18.630> out<00:00:18.750> nice<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.080> easy<00:00:19.320> you

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
there and hang out nice and easy you

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.450 
there and hang out nice and easy you
don't<00:00:19.560> hit<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> kick<00:00:19.949> or<00:00:20.100> struggle<00:00:20.400> or

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
don't hit the kick or struggle or

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.830 
don't hit the kick or struggle or
anything<00:00:20.760> then<00:00:21.240> when<00:00:21.359> you're<00:00:21.480> ready<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> go

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
anything then when you're ready to go

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080 
anything then when you're ready to go
down<00:00:22.080> press<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:22.980> black<00:00:23.310> button<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.789> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
down press the black button and it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.060 
down press the black button and it
deflates<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.619> sink<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.039> down<00:00:27.320> now<00:00:28.320> one

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
deflates and you sink on down now one

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.279 
deflates and you sink on down now one
thing<00:00:29.250> also<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.390> used<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
thing also that it is used for is to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
thing also that it is used for is to
make<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.830> diver<00:00:32.550> neutrally<00:00:33.210> buoyant

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
make it the diver neutrally buoyant

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.330 
make it the diver neutrally buoyant
underwater<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.140> you're<00:00:34.350> not<00:00:34.500> banging<00:00:34.950> against

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
underwater so you're not banging against

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
underwater so you're not banging against
the<00:00:35.399> reef<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.480> floating<00:00:36.809> back<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the reef and not floating back up to the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.229 
the reef and not floating back up to the
surface<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.820> usually<00:00:39.000> by

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
surface and so you do that usually by

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
surface and so you do that usually by
just<00:00:39.510> tapping<00:00:39.690> little<00:00:40.170> bits<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> air<00:00:40.620> into<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
just tapping little bits of air into the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.290 
just tapping little bits of air into the
jacket<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.520> inflating<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.649> also<00:00:43.800> be

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
jacket and inflating it it can also be

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.630 
jacket and inflating it it can also be
manually<00:00:45.300> inflated<00:00:45.510> should<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.039> mechanism

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
manually inflated should the mechanism

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
manually inflated should the mechanism
start<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> fail<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> hose<00:00:48.870> become<00:00:49.260> cut

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
start to fail or the hose become cut

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.299 
start to fail or the hose become cut
whatever<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:54.530> then<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.800> we're<00:00:55.949> ready<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> go

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
whatever and then when we're ready to go

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
whatever and then when we're ready to go
down<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:57.000> simply<00:00:57.360> press<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> black<00:00:57.960> button

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
down we simply press the black button

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.139 
down we simply press the black button
and<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.859> water<00:00:59.039> pressure<00:00:59.219> squeezes<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> air

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and the water pressure squeezes the air

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
and the water pressure squeezes the air
out<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> jacket<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.289> sink<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.680> down

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
out of the jacket we can sink on down

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
out of the jacket we can sink on down
real<00:01:02.100> nice<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> slow

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
real nice and slow

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.230 
real nice and slow
most<00:01:03.930> species<00:01:04.350> also<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.979> Dearing's<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> them

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
most species also have Dearing's on them

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.330 
most species also have Dearing's on them
to<00:01:06.420> attach<00:01:06.659> various<00:01:06.900> accessories<00:01:07.590> such<00:01:08.310> as

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to attach various accessories such as

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
to attach various accessories such as
slates<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.490> also<00:01:11.610> attach<00:01:11.850> us<00:01:12.710> signaling

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
slates you can also attach us signaling

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.330 
slates you can also attach us signaling
devices<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.310> stuff<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.080> and
