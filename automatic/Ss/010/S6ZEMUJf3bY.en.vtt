he<00:01:49.049> does<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.470> switch<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.189> you've

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
he does have to switch there so you've

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.789 
he does have to switch there so you've
got<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> on/off<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.939> try<00:01:51.180> me<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> also<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
got the on/off and try me and also it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.469 
got the on/off and try me and also it
comes<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.250> kind<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.579> elastic<00:01:53.790> strap<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
comes to this kind of elastic strap and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.200 
comes to this kind of elastic strap and
the<00:01:54.540> idea<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.579> you<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.060> he's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the idea is you can kind of he's

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.639 
the idea is you can kind of he's
supposed<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> go<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:58.049> shoulder<00:01:58.500> but

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
supposed to go on your shoulder but

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.170 
supposed to go on your shoulder but
obviously<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.490> wouldn't<00:01:59.670> fit<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.000> my

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
obviously it wouldn't fit on my

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.520 
obviously it wouldn't fit on my
shoulders<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> dolt<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> be

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
shoulders and a dolt you do have to be

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.200 
shoulders and a dolt you do have to be
quite<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> small<00:02:02.040> child<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:02.549> more<00:02:02.909> more
