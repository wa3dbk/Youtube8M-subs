that and actually probably evilly evilly
EV<00:00:40.860> training<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> evil

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329

version of EV training and this is
probably<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> most<00:00:45.000> annoying<00:00:45.420> match<00:00:45.719> ever

time it's kind of boring for me to do
that<00:02:06.360> all<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.660> time<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.050> they<00:02:07.140> want<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.410> keep

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680

Skarmory and the whole time I don't
understand<00:02:11.130> why<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.940> delphox<00:02:12.360> would<00:02:12.810> be

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
understand why like delphox would be

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.270 
understand why like delphox would be
switched<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.320> now<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.130> would've

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
switched in now I think that would've

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.810 
switched in now I think that would've
been<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.640> my<00:02:15.330> first<00:02:15.630> choice<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.790> what<00:02:17.790> I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
been like my first choice but what I

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.520 
been like my first choice but what I
would<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.000> done<00:02:18.090> because<00:02:18.720> now<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.350> just

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
would have done because now I can just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.229 
would have done because now I can just
pretty<00:02:19.860> much<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:20.970> annoying

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
pretty much this was in the annoying

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.000 
pretty much this was in the annoying
thing<00:02:21.450> as<00:02:21.570> well<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> defense<00:02:21.959> rose<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.650> I'm

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
thing as well the defense rose and I'm

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.610 
thing as well the defense rose and I'm
about<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> switch<00:02:23.520> out<00:02:24.320> because<00:02:25.320> there's<00:02:25.500> no

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
about to switch out because there's no

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
or goodra plus gamma rii i think that's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.979 
or goodra plus gamma rii i think that's
a<00:02:43.770> very<00:02:43.950> good<00:02:44.070> tactic<00:02:44.640> for<00:02:45.270> online<00:02:45.570> because

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
a very good tactic for online because

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.610 
a very good tactic for online because
think<00:02:46.200> about<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.980> give<00:02:47.160> goodra<00:02:48.440> move<00:02:49.440> like

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
think about it you give goodra move like

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.560 
think about it you give goodra move like
dragon<00:02:50.010> tail<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.519> then<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.360> keep<00:02:51.510> switching

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
dragon tail and then just keep switching

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.350 
dragon tail and then just keep switching
it<00:02:52.019> out<00:02:52.110> spikes<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.190> work<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
it out spikes is going to work and the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.120 
it out spikes is going to work and the
reason<00:02:54.510> goodra<00:02:54.989> would<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> good<00:02:55.830> pokemon

that<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:54.210> last<00:04:54.419> out<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.750> whole<00:04:54.930> battle<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.610> I

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
that to last out the whole battle and I

but<00:04:59.370> you<00:05:00.330> know<00:05:00.419> personally<00:05:00.900> out<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.200> 3

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
but you know personally out of the 3

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.820 
but you know personally out of the 3
stars<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:02.070> think<00:05:02.550> greninja<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.780> probably<00:05:04.710> the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
stars I think greninja is probably the

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.920 
stars I think greninja is probably the
best<00:05:05.010> mainly<00:05:05.640> because<00:05:05.669> it's<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.390> protein

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
best mainly because it's the protein

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.080 
best mainly because it's the protein
ability<00:05:07.350> if<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:07.500> can<00:05:07.650> get<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:07.950> in<00:05:08.610> fact<00:05:08.850> I

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
ability if you can get that in fact I

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.440 
ability if you can get that in fact I
got<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.270> protein<00:05:10.610> froakie<00:05:11.610> through<00:05:11.880> wonder

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
got a protein froakie through wonder

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.300

would<00:06:18.820> it<00:06:18.970> worked<00:06:19.270> a<00:06:19.360> lot<00:06:19.480> better<00:06:19.980> just

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980
