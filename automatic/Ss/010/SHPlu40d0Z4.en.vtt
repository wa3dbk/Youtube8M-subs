00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
think those two are like at the top of

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.070 
think those two are like at the top of
the<00:01:48.130> food<00:01:48.280> chain<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.790> division<00:01:49.060> crime<00:01:49.930> is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
the food chain in that division crime is

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.210 
the food chain in that division crime is
awesome<00:01:50.320> I've<00:01:50.409> trained<00:01:50.650> with<00:01:50.680> him<00:01:50.890> first<00:01:51.070> hand

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220

I've wrestled with him I boxed it I mean
the<00:01:52.600> guy's<00:01:52.720> unbelievable<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.500> phenomenon

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
the guy's unbelievable is a phenomenon

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.139

everywhere he's he's gonna be one of the
great<00:01:57.250> legends<00:01:57.550> he's<00:01:57.880> one<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.240> few<00:01:58.479> guys

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
great legends he's one of the few guys

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.270 
great legends he's one of the few guys
who's<00:01:58.990> got<00:01:59.170> at<00:01:59.290> all<00:01:59.409> you<00:01:59.770> know<00:01:59.860> one<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.190> the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
who's got at all you know one of the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.800 
who's got at all you know one of the
handful<00:02:00.729> that's<00:02:01.090> got<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.360> all<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.509> think<00:02:01.720> he's

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
handful that's got it all I think he's

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.350 
handful that's got it all I think he's
gonna<00:02:01.930> be<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.549> champion<00:02:03.549> for<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.820> long<00:02:03.940> time

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
gonna be a champion for a long time

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.730 
gonna be a champion for a long time
I<00:02:04.390> think<00:02:04.690> he's<00:02:04.810> gotta<00:02:04.960> watch<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.320> first<00:02:05.530> round

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
I think he's gotta watch the first round

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.230 
I think he's gotta watch the first round
I<00:02:05.799> think<00:02:05.860> Belfort<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.369> dangerous<00:02:06.759> with<00:02:06.940> with

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
I think Belfort is dangerous with with

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.490 
I think Belfort is dangerous with with
charity<00:02:07.570> without<00:02:07.750> TF<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.140> forget<00:02:08.380> all<00:02:08.470> that

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
charity without TF you forget all that

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.990 
charity without TF you forget all that
first<00:02:09.100> of<00:02:09.190> all<00:02:09.220> he's<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.520> most<00:02:09.670> dangerous

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
first of all he's the most dangerous

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.310 
first of all he's the most dangerous
after<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.539> have<00:02:10.630> more<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.959> chance<00:02:11.170> to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
after that you have more of a chance to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.680 
after that you have more of a chance to
subdue<00:02:12.310> him<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:12.970> think<00:02:13.150> Whiteman's<00:02:13.450> smart

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
subdue him and I think Whiteman's smart

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.390 
subdue him and I think Whiteman's smart
enough<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.110> Vitor<00:02:14.709> Belfort<00:02:15.100> scan

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
enough to do that Vitor Belfort scan

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400 
enough to do that Vitor Belfort scan
came<00:02:15.820> back<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.360> he's<00:02:16.810> ripped<00:02:17.140> through<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
came back and he's ripped through the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.620 
came back and he's ripped through the
division<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.160> yeah<00:02:18.730> without<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.269> doubt<00:02:19.420> of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
division so yeah without a doubt of

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.810 
division so yeah without a doubt of
course<00:02:19.840> he<00:02:19.959> could<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.680> don't<00:02:21.100> know<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.640> go

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
course he could but I don't know I go

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.360 
course he could but I don't know I go
Weidman<00:02:22.209> for<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.480> from<00:02:22.660> Weidman<00:02:23.350> he's<00:02:23.980> just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
Weidman for this from Weidman he's just

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.800

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.330 
so good everywhere and I think if it
started<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.200> go<00:02:29.260> bad<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.800> feet<00:02:30.010> he'll<00:02:30.190> put

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
started to go bad on the feet he'll put

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.130 
started to go bad on the feet he'll put
