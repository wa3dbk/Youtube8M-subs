prefer assault rifles and submachine

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.389 
prefer assault rifles and submachine
guns<00:00:57.019> because<00:00:57.289> they're<00:00:57.710> easiest<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.219> get<00:00:58.339> a

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
guns because they're easiest to get a

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.459 
guns because they're easiest to get a
lot<00:00:58.609> of<00:00:58.640> kills<00:00:58.910> with<00:00:59.179> all<00:00:59.839> the<00:00:59.989> other<00:01:00.109> ones<00:01:00.320> are

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
lot of kills with all the other ones are

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.119 
lot of kills with all the other ones are
harder<00:01:00.949> to<00:01:00.980> do<00:01:01.480> but<00:01:02.480> i<00:01:02.539> recommend<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.230> mp7<00:01:03.589> and

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
harder to do but i recommend the mp7 and

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.040 
harder to do but i recommend the mp7 and
the<00:01:04.309> vector<00:01:04.730> k10<00:01:05.089> which<00:01:05.449> are<00:01:05.600> both<00:01:05.780> from<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
the vector k10 which are both from the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.219 
the vector k10 which are both from the
submachine<00:01:06.470> gun<00:01:06.860> category<00:01:07.400> um<00:01:08.180> those<00:01:09.079> are

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
submachine gun category um those are

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.929 
submachine gun category um those are
both<00:01:09.380> very<00:01:09.619> good<00:01:09.829> gun<00:01:10.009> or<00:01:10.280> primary<00:01:10.759> guns

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
both very good gun or primary guns

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.520 
both very good gun or primary guns
because<00:01:11.180> they<00:01:11.540> have<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.689> good<00:01:11.810> fire<00:01:12.049> rate<00:01:12.320> and

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
because they have a good fire rate and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.130 
because they have a good fire rate and
they're<00:01:13.159> good<00:01:13.340> handling<00:01:13.759> guns<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.210> AD<00:01:14.780> and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
they're good handling guns and AD and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.840 
they're good handling guns and AD and
the<00:01:15.200> attachments<00:01:15.860> for<00:01:16.040> those<00:01:16.189> guns<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.670> want

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
the attachments for those guns you want

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.870 
the attachments for those guns you want
a<00:01:16.970> silencer<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:18.530> laser<00:01:18.829> sight<00:01:19.189> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
a silencer and a laser sight the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.670 
a silencer and a laser sight the
silencers<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.899> don't<00:01:21.140> get<00:01:21.290> seen<00:01:21.500> on<00:01:21.590> the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
silencers so you don't get seen on the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.800 
silencers so you don't get seen on the
radar<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:22.250> can<00:01:22.369> get<00:01:22.460> more<00:01:22.640> kills<00:01:22.820> laser

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
radar and you can get more kills laser

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.630 
radar and you can get more kills laser
sight<00:01:24.079> so<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.829> know<00:01:24.950> get<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.220> hip<00:01:25.430> fire

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
sight so you can you know get a hip fire

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.109 
sight so you can you know get a hip fire
kill<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:26.560> get<00:01:27.560> more<00:01:27.740> kills<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.250> as<00:01:28.970> your

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
kill and get more kills and as your

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.550 
kill and get more kills and as your
secondary<00:01:29.509> gun<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.290> can<00:01:30.530> use<00:01:31.100> any<00:01:31.460> secondary

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
secondary gun you can use any secondary

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.639 
secondary gun you can use any secondary
use<00:01:33.560> pistols<00:01:34.159> though<00:01:34.369> because<00:01:34.610> launchers<00:01:35.479> and

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
use pistols though because launchers and

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.050 
use pistols though because launchers and
specials<00:01:36.649> are<00:01:36.890> hard<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.399> get<00:01:37.490> kills<00:01:37.700> with<00:01:37.880> use

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
specials are hard to get kills with use

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300 
specials are hard to get kills with use
the<00:01:38.240> b34r<00:01:38.840> that's<00:01:39.290> my<00:01:39.439> recommendation<00:01:39.590> and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
the b34r that's my recommendation and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.389 
the b34r that's my recommendation and
use<00:01:41.240> extended<00:01:41.869> max<00:01:42.049> for<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:42.979> can<00:01:43.130> if

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
use extended max for that so you can if

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.340 
use extended max for that so you can if
you<00:01:44.119> need<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.390> reload<00:01:44.659> on<00:01:44.689> your<00:01:44.899> primary<00:01:45.049> and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
you need to reload on your primary and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.600 
you need to reload on your primary and
you<00:01:45.409> don't<00:01:45.560> reload<00:01:45.770> fast<00:01:46.040> enough<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.310> can

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
you don't reload fast enough you can

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.340 
you don't reload fast enough you can
just<00:01:47.119> pull<00:01:47.299> out<00:01:47.390> your<00:01:47.570> secondary<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.200> get<00:01:48.320> a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
just pull out your secondary and get a

you guys use engineer when you throw
down<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.359> care<00:03:37.570> package<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:38.019> let's<00:03:38.170> say<00:03:38.230> you

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
down a care package you let's say you

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.590 
down a care package you let's say you
get<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.470> UAV<00:03:38.739> you<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.579> double<00:03:39.880> tap<00:03:40.060> double

get all kinds of stuff with engineer in
a<00:03:54.160> care<00:03:54.340> package<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.209> then<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
a care package so and then you the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.759 
a care package so and then you the
lightning<00:03:56.470> strike<00:03:56.799> is<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.549> like<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:59.590> good

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
lightning strike is a like a really good

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.920 
lightning strike is a like a really good
one<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.340> can<00:04:00.519> just<00:04:00.760> call<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.450> in<00:04:01.569> wherever<00:04:01.780> you

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
one you can just call it in wherever you

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.180 
one you can just call it in wherever you
see<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.049> whole<00:04:02.200> bunch<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.440> enemies<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.950> is

see a whole bunch of enemies and is
almost<00:04:03.370> guaranteed<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.940> kill<00:04:04.209> if<00:04:04.329> they're

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
almost guaranteed to kill if they're

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.360 
almost guaranteed to kill if they're
sitting<00:04:04.720> outside<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:05.319> that's<00:04:05.769> good<00:04:06.069> as

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
sitting outside so that's good as

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.539 
sitting outside so that's good as
scorestreak<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.209> use<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:08.769> want<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.370> play

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
scorestreak to use you want to play

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.780 
scorestreak to use you want to play
certain<00:04:09.970> games<00:04:10.000> too<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:11.829> prefer<00:04:12.400> kill
