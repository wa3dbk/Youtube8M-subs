it's been so long since i played this

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.340 
it's been so long since i played this
game<00:04:05.209> out<00:04:05.330> of<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.510> know<00:04:05.660> what<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.959> controls

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
buns to run babe i miss the big buttons

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.030 
buns to run babe i miss the big buttons
to<00:04:16.540> pick<00:04:17.540> everything<00:04:17.840> pick<00:04:18.350> people<00:04:18.709> up<00:04:18.829> and

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
to pick everything pick people up and

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.480 
to pick everything pick people up and
keep<00:04:19.700> traveling<00:04:20.120> in<00:04:20.530> pairs<00:04:21.530> or<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.950> whip<00:04:22.220> them

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.950 

and<00:04:25.490> i<00:04:25.550> guess<00:04:25.760> those<00:04:25.940> tires<00:04:26.270> are<00:04:26.390> like<00:04:26.540> for<00:04:26.810> the

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
and i guess those tires are like for the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.780 
and i guess those tires are like for the
substitute<00:04:27.890> for<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.100> ring<00:04:28.310> roots

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.100 

and<00:04:33.790> I<00:04:33.850> guess<00:04:34.060> when<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.360> get<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.660> maximum

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
and I guess when you get to maximum

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.220 
and I guess when you get to maximum
momentum<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:35.890> perform<00:04:36.370> your<00:04:37.230> signature

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
momentum you can perform your signature

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:57.870 
momentum you can perform your signature
maneuver<00:04:46.410> no<00:04:47.410> man<00:04:47.940> this<00:04:48.940> game's<00:04:49.180> ass<00:04:55.980> and<00:04:56.980> the
