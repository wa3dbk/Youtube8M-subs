what<00:00:38.309> I'm<00:00:38.430> doing<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:38.730> I'm<00:00:38.820> looking<00:00:39.090> down<00:00:39.270> into

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
what I'm doing now I'm looking down into

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.090 
what I'm doing now I'm looking down into
the<00:00:39.690> water<00:00:39.809> I've<00:00:40.050> got<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> sonar<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:40.980> I've

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the water I've got the sonar here I've

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.459 
the water I've got the sonar here I've
got<00:00:41.250> about<00:00:41.520> 20<00:00:41.910> foot<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.180> water<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.079> I'm

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
got about 20 foot of water and I'm

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.930 
got about 20 foot of water and I'm
trying<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> sort<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.489> mental<00:00:44.789> picture

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
trying to get a sort of a mental picture

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.180 
trying to get a sort of a mental picture
of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> underwater<00:00:45.780> geography<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.829> first

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
of the underwater geography as my first

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
of the underwater geography as my first
step<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:48.170> looking<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> stingrays<00:00:51.260> unless

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
step in looking for the stingrays unless

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.600 
step in looking for the stingrays unless
you've<00:00:52.410> got<00:00:52.469> fish<00:00:52.739> symbols<00:00:53.160> straight<00:00:53.399> away

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you've got fish symbols straight away

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
you've got fish symbols straight away
but<00:00:53.670> they've<00:00:53.969> been<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.480> middle<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> water

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
but they've been the middle of the water

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.049 
but they've been the middle of the water
they're<00:00:55.949> unlikely<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.610> stingrays

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
they're unlikely to be stingrays

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.959 
they're unlikely to be stingrays
although<00:00:57.710> if<00:00:58.710> there's<00:00:59.010> something<00:00:59.430> close<00:00:59.789> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
although if there's something close to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.670 
although if there's something close to
the<00:01:00.059> bottom<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> could<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.719> array<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.289> think

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the bottom it could be array I do think

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
the bottom it could be array I do think
that<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:01.980> don't<00:01:02.879> spend<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> time

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
that they don't spend all the time

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
that they don't spend all the time
necessarily<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.320> stuck<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.949> down<00:01:05.250> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
necessarily just stuck right down I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
necessarily just stuck right down I
think<00:01:06.000> sometimes<00:01:06.450> they<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.600> actually<00:01:07.020> rise

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
think sometimes they do actually rise

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.770 
think sometimes they do actually rise
off<00:01:07.619> maybe<00:01:08.520> three<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:08.880> four<00:01:08.970> feet<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.540> glide

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
off maybe three or four feet and glide

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.320 
off maybe three or four feet and glide
away<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.860> convinced<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.790> giant

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
away I'm convinced there are giant

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.960 
away I'm convinced there are giant
stingrays<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.280> before<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
stingrays down here but before I can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.719 
stingrays down here but before I can
unpack<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.509> rod<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.710> border<00:01:17.040> police<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.610> on

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
unpack my rod the border police are on

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.970 
unpack my rod the border police are on
to<00:01:17.880> me

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
to me

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.300

one<00:01:21.310> problem<00:01:21.520> about<00:01:21.729> here<00:01:22.000> it's<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.299> border

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
one problem about here it's the border

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.630 
one problem about here it's the border
between<00:01:23.290> two<00:01:23.560> countries<00:01:23.950> Thailand<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.430> Laos

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
between two countries Thailand and Laos

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.310 
between two countries Thailand and Laos
I<00:01:24.880> might<00:01:25.090> have<00:01:25.210> possibly<00:01:25.330> strayed<00:01:25.869> over<00:01:26.229> the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
I might have possibly strayed over the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.639 
I might have possibly strayed over the
border<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:28.270> just<00:01:28.450> going<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.659> carry<00:01:28.869> on<00:01:28.960> acting

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
border I'm just going to carry on acting

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.200 
border I'm just going to carry on acting
normal<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.100> suppose<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.490> have<00:01:30.640> got<00:01:30.670> some<00:01:30.970> sort<00:01:31.149> of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
normal I suppose I have got some sort of

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.810 
normal I suppose I have got some sort of

fairly high-tech looking gear on the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.609 
fairly high-tech looking gear on the
boat<00:01:34.000> I'm<00:01:34.479> spying<00:01:34.869> on<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.229> bottom<00:01:35.440> of<00:01:35.500> the

boat I'm spying on the bottom of the

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.330 
boat I'm spying on the bottom of the
river<00:01:37.920> okay

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
river okay

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.730
