this<00:00:01.110> video<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.770> continuation<00:00:02.190> of<00:00:02.879> our

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
this video is a continuation of our

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.099 
this video is a continuation of our
autonomous<00:00:04.620> program<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:06.270> just<00:00:06.299> added<00:00:06.870> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
autonomous program we just added the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.390 
autonomous program we just added the
wait<00:00:07.680> block<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.429> change<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.540> value<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.400> 1500

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
wait block and change the value to 1500

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.680 
wait block and change the value to 1500
for<00:00:11.969> 1.5<00:00:12.929> seconds<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.710> clicked<00:00:14.400> ok<00:00:17.630> now<00:00:18.630> we

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
for 1.5 seconds and clicked ok now we

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.620 
for 1.5 seconds and clicked ok now we
could<00:00:19.080> add<00:00:19.260> our<00:00:19.770> next<00:00:20.250> motion<00:00:20.490> blocks<00:00:21.000> at<00:00:21.300> this

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
could add our next motion blocks at this

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.710 
could add our next motion blocks at this
point<00:00:21.960> but<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.859> good<00:00:23.070> practice<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
point but it's good practice to have the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.439 
point but it's good practice to have the
robot<00:00:24.990> stopped<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> moment<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.670> let<00:00:27.060> things

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
robot stopped for a moment to let things

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
robot stopped for a moment to let things
settle<00:00:27.779> before<00:00:28.380> starting<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> next<00:00:29.460> motion

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
settle before starting the next motion

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.470 
settle before starting the next motion
to<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.019> we're<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.040> save<00:00:32.340> time<00:00:32.790> by

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
to do this we're going to save time by

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.380 
to do this we're going to save time by
right-clicking<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.559> blocks<00:00:34.890> above<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:36.180> bring

right-clicking the blocks above to bring

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.470 
right-clicking the blocks above to bring

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.720 

now<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.470> make<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.830> robot<00:02:10.190> turn<00:02:10.690> right<00:02:12.730> let's

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
now to make a robot turn right let's

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.070 
now to make a robot turn right let's
copy<00:02:14.150> our<00:02:14.450> two<00:02:15.490> beginning<00:02:16.490> motor<00:02:17.060> blocks<00:02:17.450> to

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
copy our two beginning motor blocks to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.530 
copy our two beginning motor blocks to
the<00:02:18.170> end<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.560> our<00:02:18.680> program

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the end of our program

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.050 
the end of our program
you<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.750> select<00:02:21.170> both<00:02:21.500> blocks<00:02:21.950> by<00:02:22.460> holding

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
you can select both blocks by holding

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:36.090 
you can select both blocks by holding
the<00:02:23.180> shift<00:02:23.210> key<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.020> clicking<00:02:24.740> each<00:02:25.160> block

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.460 

there<00:02:36.730> are<00:02:36.880> three<00:02:37.150> ways<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.420> make<00:02:37.720> our<00:02:37.900> robot

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
there are three ways to make our robot

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.280 
there are three ways to make our robot
turn<00:02:38.740> right<00:02:39.240> first<00:02:40.240> we<00:02:40.540> could<00:02:40.720> slow<00:02:41.020> down<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
turn right first we could slow down the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.130 
turn right first we could slow down the
right<00:02:41.710> wheel<00:02:42.010> by<00:02:42.610> giving<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.240> smaller<00:02:43.660> user

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
right wheel by giving it a smaller user

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.940 
right wheel by giving it a smaller user
defined<00:02:44.740> value<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:46.600> would<00:02:47.080> place<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.590> pivot

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
defined value this would place the pivot

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.400 
defined value this would place the pivot
point<00:02:48.250> outside<00:02:48.520> of<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.120> robot<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.780> make<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
point outside of the robot and make the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:03:14.290 
point outside of the robot and make the
robot<00:02:50.890> drive<00:02:51.460> in<00:02:51.820> an<00:02:52.060> arc

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.710 

second<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.860> could<00:03:16.160> stop<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.910> right<00:03:17.090> motor<00:03:17.420> and

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
second we could stop the right motor and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.290 
second we could stop the right motor and
the<00:03:18.200> pivot<00:03:18.440> point<00:03:18.860> would<00:03:19.340> be<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.970> right

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
the pivot point would be on the right

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:33.900 
the pivot point would be on the right
wheel

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.360 

or<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.180> last<00:03:35.450> method<00:03:36.050> which<00:03:36.680> we<00:03:36.920> are<00:03:36.950> going<00:03:37.100> to

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
or the last method which we are going to

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.410 
or the last method which we are going to
use<00:03:37.610> is<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:39.200> spin<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.710> right<00:03:39.980> wheel<00:03:40.420> backwards

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
use is to spin the right wheel backwards

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.830 
use is to spin the right wheel backwards
this<00:03:42.320> will<00:03:42.530> cause<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:43.220> pivot<00:03:43.910> point<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.720> be

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
this will cause the pivot point to be

00:03:44.840 --> 00:04:02.430 
this will cause the pivot point to be
inside<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.830> robot

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.370 

now<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.490> want<00:04:03.820> our<00:04:03.970> motors<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.480> stay<00:04:04.720> on<00:04:04.960> for

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
now we want our motors to stay on for

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.350 
now we want our motors to stay on for
1/2<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:06.550> second<00:04:07.030> then<00:04:07.630> stop<00:04:08.110> for<00:04:09.010> 1/2<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.940> second

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
1/2 a second then stop for 1/2 a second

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.190 
1/2 a second then stop for 1/2 a second
to<00:04:10.510> settle<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.680> select<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.250> program<00:04:12.550> blocks<00:04:13.210> 3

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
to settle so select a program blocks 3

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.490 
to settle so select a program blocks 3
through<00:04:14.680> 6<00:04:15.070> by<00:04:15.490> holding<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.000> shift<00:04:16.269> key<00:04:16.500> copy

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
through 6 by holding the shift key copy

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500 
through 6 by holding the shift key copy
and<00:04:17.799> paste<00:04:18.070> them<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.580> end<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.000> program

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
and paste them to the end of the program

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.440 
and paste them to the end of the program
then<00:04:20.140> edit<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.799> last<00:04:21.070> box<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:24.100> wait<00:04:24.460> block<00:04:24.760> to

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
then edit the last box the wait block to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:54.340 
then edit the last box the wait block to
500<00:04:26.320> milliseconds<00:04:27.070> or<00:04:27.220> 1/2<00:04:27.760> second

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.000 

to<00:04:55.130> finish<00:04:55.370> our<00:04:55.640> last
