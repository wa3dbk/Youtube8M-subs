00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
to the hoof because she's thin and also

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.800 
to the hoof because she's thin and also
to<00:02:15.030> act<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> cup<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.590> keep<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.040> shoe<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:18.030> the

foot now it looks nice so you know

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.310 
foot now it looks nice so you know
should<00:02:28.500> behave<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.250> look<00:02:29.400> even<00:02:29.550> nicer<00:02:30.320> there

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
should behave it look even nicer there

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.770 
should behave it look even nicer there
we<00:02:31.470> go<00:02:31.700> now<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.760> last<00:02:33.030> thing<00:02:33.330> I'm<00:02:33.450> gonna<00:02:33.540> do

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
we go now the last thing I'm gonna do

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.320 
we go now the last thing I'm gonna do
for<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.110> horse

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
for this horse

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.580 
for this horse
there<00:02:36.330> was<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.690> reason<00:02:36.990> we're<00:02:37.110> adding<00:02:37.410> length

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
there was the reason we're adding length

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.170 
there was the reason we're adding length
to<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> foot<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.340> we're<00:02:38.459> trying<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.730> paddle<00:02:38.940> at

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
to the foot is we're trying to paddle at

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.750 
to the foot is we're trying to paddle at
a<00:02:39.240> lift<00:02:39.680> well<00:02:40.680> she<00:02:40.920> should<00:02:41.160> she's<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.670> be

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
a lift well she should she's going to be

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.710 
a lift well she should she's going to be
shown<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.620> soft<00:02:43.620> footing<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:45.450> simply

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
shown in soft footing and just simply

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.330 
shown in soft footing and just simply
adding<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.080> rim<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.440> super<00:02:46.680> fast<00:02:46.890> on<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> bottom

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
adding a rim of super fast on the bottom

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.470 
adding a rim of super fast on the bottom
of<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.519> foot

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
of the foot

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.530 
of the foot
it's<00:02:49.019> fine<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.670> foot<00:02:50.850> can<00:02:51.030> sink<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
it's fine but the foot can sink in that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.080 
it's fine but the foot can sink in that
soft<00:02:51.780> footing<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.650> what<00:02:52.769> we're<00:02:52.890> gonna<00:02:52.950> do<00:02:53.310> for

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
soft footing so what we're gonna do for

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.610 
soft footing so what we're gonna do for
one<00:02:54.300> reason<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.840> we're<00:02:54.989> gonna<00:02:55.110> fill<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
one reason is we're gonna fill the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.070 
one reason is we're gonna fill the
bottom<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.010> support<00:02:56.750> we're<00:02:57.750> gonna<00:02:57.900> fill

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
bottom of the support we're gonna fill

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.850 
bottom of the support we're gonna fill
it<00:02:58.200> with<00:02:58.230> aqua<00:02:58.709> pack<00:02:59.750> completely<00:03:00.750> as<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> pad

it with aqua pack completely as a pad

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.100 
it with aqua pack completely as a pad
not<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.489> not<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.850> protect<00:03:03.120> our<00:03:03.239> foot<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:04.019> to

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
not just not to protect our foot but to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.960 
not just not to protect our foot but to
act<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.620> paddle<00:03:04.920> access<00:03:05.190> flotation<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.790> keep

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
act the paddle access flotation to keep

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
just that little eighth of an inch and

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.050 
just that little eighth of an inch and
also<00:03:09.840> as<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.650> also<00:03:11.100> helped<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.489> secure<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
super presses a cup so the sand is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.790 
super presses a cup so the sand is
ripped<00:03:15.630> off<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> edges<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.320> super<00:03:16.620> fast

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
ripped off the edges of this super fast

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
capsule growth or movement at all that's

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.990 
capsule growth or movement at all that's
just<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.600> hoof<00:03:33.780> wall<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.950> I'll<00:03:35.130> go<00:03:35.459> ahead<00:03:35.489> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
just like hoof wall so I'll go ahead and

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:32.770 

let<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.750> kick<00:04:18.989> for<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.260> second<00:04:23.240> easy<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.419> go

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.420 

look<00:04:33.780> at<00:04:33.930> also<00:04:34.080> what<00:04:34.440> we're<00:04:34.560> doing<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.010> this

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
look at also what we're doing to this

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.790 
look at also what we're doing to this
this<00:04:35.850> pad<00:04:36.150> will<00:04:36.810> help<00:04:36.990> keep<00:04:37.169> some<00:04:37.350> action<00:04:37.740> on

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
this pad will help keep some action on

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.040 
this pad will help keep some action on
our<00:04:37.860> frog<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:39.030> keep<00:04:39.540> your<00:04:39.660> heels<00:04:39.870> from

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
our frog and keep your heels from

our frog and keep your heels from
contracting<00:04:40.650> which<00:04:41.430> grow<00:04:41.729> feet<00:04:41.970> tend<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.330> do

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.540 

that<00:04:55.260> for<00:04:55.440> ten<00:04:55.590> minutes<00:04:55.800> so<00:04:56.039> I<00:04:56.100> could<00:04:56.220> peel<00:04:56.400> the

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
that for ten minutes so I could peel the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.870 
that for ten minutes so I could peel the
board<00:04:56.760> off<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.300> we'll<00:04:57.570> be<00:04:57.690> done
