00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello everybody I'm corna and be well 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.020
 come to another minecraft video and this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.750
 time we are here in this world to 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.370
 explain and a nice yalcin belt and it is 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.160
 basically with jael had its title 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.820
 how to create and how to make it smell kripka 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.410
 cat 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.320
 in this group the boxes is important to say 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.990
 that only do not find a solution only appear 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580
 a trip almost a tripod is hit by 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.230
 a thunder and goods in china announced a 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 colloquium already have to write is 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.880
 therefore we have to give ourselves 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.309
 own a kivu so you have to do 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.079
 so keeping alive my name right my 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.300
 nick in angola in 3d 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.399
 minecraft as a block has to be like this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.070
 this way so that we can say as soon as the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.989
 minecraft give us this block of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.309
 Commander I already have so this was 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.450
 just for you to see how our 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.120
 school and have a voice 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.690
 now it's more technical to use one of this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 colloquium to write the command o 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.539
 tire will be on us will give the weather so much 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.000
 for this we have to write the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 your way out of the way. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.750
 retraction of education but will bring the cri 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.489
 to the earth will bring what for me is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.049
 I need to pay attention to the ones watching the clip. 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.930
 capital advice 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.479
 therefore this is fundamental then 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
 three guys who will symbolize both the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.840
 cpp coordinates 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.460
 It's like we are not creating an account 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.119
 specific can be useful not only because 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.759
 yea 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.810
 now we use the button here this goes 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.880
 help the coritiba in this journey 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.960
 played on the block we did not do anything 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.090
 which was no longer good now is fundamental 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 but although dead mother 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.520
 now if we want to put it and so 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 any time to sell to that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.920
 point here plus 10 why not more 10 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.810
 by hour is now put it we have it here 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.390
 10 more so than here above 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.000
 a height of 10 wherein the optanto 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.520
 May 1st is going to be the time to be 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.880
 first time will be hosted on x 1 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.070
 in the other room will leave a quarter of the 400 00 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.320
 now we have ours we go 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.689
 open fronts yes in years no rules 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.110
 are correct does not always hurt me later - 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:13.130
 power of 2.111 will equal the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.970
 of the other and 0 to 0 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.670
 the false therefore we do this and the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.920
 our cryp in chahr said he liked 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.590
 one more time will die and attention alone 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.510
 this clip found appear when I come back 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.510
 say when they are hit by thunder 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.880
 now we are going to show what 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.270
 happens when they were not so 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:44.450
 burned 10 of the cases is the clip goes to 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.410
 us and is and simply did not think that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.470
 give me one more life 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.490
 but not any of the sun forms I 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.960
 I also left a large hole in the ground 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.480
 so I do not know if it's going to be interesting 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.690
 see the hole 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.810
 the video is a fan of the priest 's college 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.960
 appears everywhere but now in that 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.590
 girl who attended the final 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.160
 people like 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.610
 Rafael was there and spending the sun is the crater 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.530
 that I was talking about so it 's a 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.280
 big trace so we won something 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.490
 and therefore if they see tea 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.870
 Crippa paa so in the normal world is 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.760
 because I was hit by the typhoon 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.070

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.500
 possibly in some business is 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.060
 mingled with sparkling like is 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.880

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.580
 be in the southern description on acre by 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:43.070
