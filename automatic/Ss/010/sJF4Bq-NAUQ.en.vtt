much better performance in terms of the

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
one of the mid lane found themselves

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.200 
one of the mid lane found themselves
with<00:05:20.720> that<00:05:20.900> turret<00:05:21.320> advantage<00:05:21.860> especially

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
with that turret advantage especially

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.900 
with that turret advantage especially
but<00:05:23.210> CJ<00:05:23.930> is<00:05:24.470> able<00:05:24.919> to<00:05:25.039> take<00:05:25.280> very<00:05:25.729> small

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
but CJ is able to take very small

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.110 
but CJ is able to take very small
mistakes<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.080> really<00:05:28.010> punish<00:05:28.400> them<00:05:28.610> hard<00:05:28.880> and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
mistakes and really punish them hard and

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.570 
mistakes and really punish them hard and
keep<00:05:29.750> on<00:05:29.960> pressing<00:05:30.590> through<00:05:30.979> their<00:05:31.370> power

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
keep on pressing through their power

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.210 
keep on pressing through their power
spikes<00:05:32.120> around<00:05:32.389> this<00:05:33.080> Corky<00:05:33.590> so<00:05:33.770> they<00:05:33.889> don't

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
spikes around this Corky so they don't

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.540 
spikes around this Corky so they don't
give<00:05:34.750> genera<00:05:35.750> chance<00:05:36.229> to<00:05:36.500> scale<00:05:36.830> into<00:05:37.370> that

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
give genera chance to scale into that

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.029 
give genera chance to scale into that
late<00:05:37.789> game<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.419> really<00:05:39.169> want<00:05:39.349> to<00:05:39.440> see<00:05:39.500> what<00:05:39.800> set

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
late game I really want to see what set

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.419 
late game I really want to see what set
up<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.370> kill<00:05:40.669> on<00:05:40.849> the<00:05:40.970> pilot
