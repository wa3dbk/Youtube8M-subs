00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.570 

try<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> avoid<00:02:37.020> your<00:02:37.380> car<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.950> ban<00:02:38.160> litter<00:02:38.460> the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.610 

otherwise<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.630> would<00:02:44.780> have<00:02:44.960> to<00:02:45.110> pay<00:02:45.290> more

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.980 

I<00:03:18.910> think<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.060> game<00:03:20.270> is<00:03:20.300> running<00:03:20.660> pretty<00:03:20.810> well

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
I think this game is running pretty well

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:30.490 
I think this game is running pretty well
on<00:03:21.290> both<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.680> these<00:03:21.830> devices

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:43.229 

the<00:03:31.500> race<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:32.220> completed<00:03:32.850> guys

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.759 

suppose<00:03:44.239> these<00:03:44.510> are<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:44.749> gaming<00:03:45.109> graphics<00:03:45.260> of

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
suppose these are the gaming graphics of

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.179 
suppose these are the gaming graphics of
real<00:03:46.159> recently<00:03:46.819> on<00:03:47.030> an<00:03:47.180> iPhone<00:03:47.510> 5<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.019> on<00:03:48.439> iPad

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
real recently on an iPhone 5 and on iPad

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.160 
real recently on an iPhone 5 and on iPad
4<00:03:51.549> both<00:03:52.549> of<00:03:52.760> these<00:03:52.909> devices<00:03:53.120> play<00:03:53.749> this<00:03:53.810> game

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
4 both of these devices play this game

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.220 
4 both of these devices play this game
is<00:03:54.379> smooth<00:03:54.590> but<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.310> think<00:03:55.659> iPhone<00:03:56.659> 5<00:03:56.930> gameplay

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
is smooth but I think iPhone 5 gameplay

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.500 
is smooth but I think iPhone 5 gameplay
is<00:03:57.500> more<00:03:57.739> smoother<00:03:58.099> than<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.459> gameplay<00:03:58.849> of<00:03:59.150> an

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
is more smoother than the gameplay of an

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.890 
is more smoother than the gameplay of an
iPad<00:04:00.170> 4<00:04:00.879> so<00:04:01.879> now<00:04:02.030> here<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.389> can<00:04:02.540> repair<00:04:02.870> your

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
iPad 4 so now here you can repair your

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.929 
iPad 4 so now here you can repair your
power<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.469> can<00:04:03.680> also<00:04:03.859> service<00:04:04.400> your<00:04:04.609> car<00:04:04.760> you

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939
