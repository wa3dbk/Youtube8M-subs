00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:22.800
 because the gestures that I know I 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 think I know myself I know I'm 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 a complete player of water birds 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 mineral like that is that knowing 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.730
 that it's not an example because you 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.450
 gives today it's because they have 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.260
 Rights 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.219
 we like in the budget and I committed 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.559
 a big mistake is not at all and 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.329
 I think three points because I think 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.610
 that badly of time the intervention and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.989
 indicated that he wanted to apologize to 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 All those who have read his gestures when 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.500
 it does not feel what I like about the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.640
 to say and I do not know but as early 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.170
 than in currencies because I think 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 that today I have not seen anything 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.400
 that if I could redo I find myself 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.470
 with pleasure but in another way 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.610
 a better way to advertise 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 that they do not want beautiful values 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.729
 who will tend and unfortunately I 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.830
 trains me the image of a world that is 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.500
 not good today that's why I 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.170
 especially hold women or 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.759
 rooney who only show I said 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 I imagine bad excuses that by chance 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.479
 today because I know how if 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.040
 both boys selling this picture 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.080
 when I got them on the phone is and 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.590
 from the south - and I think it's not a 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.680
 example to follow for example at the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 today's youth I have not shown 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.100
 I hope now that the threshold 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.340
 will forgive everyone by 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.320
 sheets and that the next tests 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 encouraging show another face 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.369
 better faces we like to see 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.350
 play soccer 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.570
 the camourenais explosion 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.500
 desire all over the world 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.430
 unfortunately that today I can 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.369
 not repeat this error 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.960
 it's done and of course I assume it's 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.420
 really bad because I said we have 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.220
 a nice team of the fort and where I 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.649
 recognize my sight and good family 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 that's all I had to say thank you 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.220
 OK, thanks
