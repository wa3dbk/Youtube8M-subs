00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
deck wood I'm probably gonna run the

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.579 
deck wood I'm probably gonna run the
stuff<00:05:54.830> under<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.949> camper<00:05:57.080> widthwise<00:05:58.080> and

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:58.589 
stuff under the camper widthwise and

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:59.929 
stuff under the camper widthwise and
then<00:05:58.680> when<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:58.860> get<00:05:58.979> to<00:05:59.219> the<00:05:59.339> back<00:05:59.520> there<00:05:59.789> I'll

00:05:59.929 --> 00:05:59.939 
then when I get to the back there I'll

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:03.469 
then when I get to the back there I'll
run<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:00.240> lengthwise<00:06:01.069> just<00:06:02.300> because<00:06:03.300> it'll

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
run it lengthwise just because it'll

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.719 
run it lengthwise just because it'll
grow<00:06:03.719> it'll<00:06:03.990> be<00:06:04.080> stronger<00:06:04.409> sideways<00:06:05.279> for<00:06:05.580> this

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
grow it'll be stronger sideways for this

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.700 
grow it'll be stronger sideways for this
thing<00:06:05.969> because<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:07.020> can<00:06:07.169> see<00:06:07.349> it's<00:06:07.499> already

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
thing because you can see it's already

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.529 
thing because you can see it's already
starting<00:06:08.009> to<00:06:08.430> like<00:06:08.639> bend<00:06:08.999> those<00:06:09.180> cross

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
starting to like bend those cross

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:16.249 
starting to like bend those cross
members<00:06:09.990> and<00:06:10.169> stuff<00:06:11.389> so<00:06:12.710> yeah<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:14.129> then<00:06:15.259> some

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
members and stuff so yeah and then some

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.749 
members and stuff so yeah and then some
storage<00:06:16.560> and<00:06:16.830> stuff<00:06:17.009> up<00:06:17.219> there<00:06:17.249> maybe<00:06:17.669> we'll

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
storage and stuff up there maybe we'll

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.790
