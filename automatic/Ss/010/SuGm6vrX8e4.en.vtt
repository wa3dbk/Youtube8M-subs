pin<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.730> shore<00:02:22.800> well<00:02:25.080> what<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.200> does<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:26.769> I'm

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
pin on shore well what that does if I'm

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.770 
pin on shore well what that does if I'm
adding<00:02:27.370> my<00:02:27.640> score<00:02:27.880> right<00:02:28.000> if<00:02:28.150> he<00:02:28.239> converts<00:02:28.420> it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780

adding my score right if he converts it
it<00:02:28.870> still<00:02:29.110> means<00:02:29.260> if<00:02:29.440> couch<00:02:29.650> strikes<00:02:30.010> out<00:02:30.250> he

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the match previous to this one and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.150 
the match previous to this one and
Parker<00:04:12.780> bone<00:04:12.930> didn't<00:04:13.380> struggle<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.800> much<00:04:14.010> on

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
Parker bone didn't struggle that much on

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.400 
Parker bone didn't struggle that much on
lane<00:04:14.370> 19<00:04:14.819> Parker<00:04:15.510> had<00:04:15.630> one<00:04:15.810> ball<00:04:16.019> go<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.230> little

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
lane 19 Parker had one ball go a little

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.900 
lane 19 Parker had one ball go a little
high<00:04:16.560> when<00:04:16.739> they<00:04:16.859> left<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.370> six<00:04:17.579> pin<00:04:17.760> in<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
high when they left a six pin in the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.610 
high when they left a six pin in the
ninth<00:04:18.060> frame<00:04:18.329> but<00:04:18.540> basically<00:04:19.079> he<00:04:19.290> was<00:04:19.440> just

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
ninth frame but basically he was just

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.330 
ninth frame but basically he was just
lined<00:04:19.859> up<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.940> think<00:04:21.329> Jason<00:04:21.870> might<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.280> felt<00:04:23.280> a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
lined up I think Jason might have felt a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.590 
lined up I think Jason might have felt a
little<00:04:23.400> pressure<00:04:23.730> bowling<00:04:24.090> for<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> title

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
little pressure bowling for the title

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.400 
little pressure bowling for the title
and<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.870> made<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.560> difference<00:04:27.080> just<00:04:28.080> notice

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
and that made the difference just notice

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.960 
and that made the difference just notice
he<00:04:28.530> came<00:04:28.710> up<00:04:28.860> on<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.130> toe<00:04:29.340> again<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:29.820> left

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
he came up on that toe again and left

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.969 
he came up on that toe again and left
another<00:04:30.090> six<00:04:30.540> Ben<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.050> he<00:04:31.380> comes<00:04:31.560> up<00:04:31.710> on<00:04:31.830> it
