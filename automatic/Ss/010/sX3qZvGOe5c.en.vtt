00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.190
 a fateful morning was lived and in the 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.620
 monumental stadium where the trainer 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.390
 physical Eduardo Mguez talked long and 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.920
 laid with the whole team after what 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.660
 regenerative work was ordered for 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.790
 who were starters yesterday while 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.410
 the rest made football reduced after 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.450
 meet with the president of white and 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.950
 black in the last locker at 14 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.200
 hours went out to face the media the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.640
 technical director luis pÃ©rez who 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.099
 recognized the bitterness for what was done 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.660
 yesterday at the national stadium also the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.340
 champion of america stressed that there is no 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.060
 right to pass this shame 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.060
 a colo colo 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.460
 for us for the campus 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.270
 the intern 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.480
 I believe that feelings feelings 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.110
 we could already observe the night 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.170
 player 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.150
 reference of the establishment and I believe that the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.450
 team in general is reflected in what 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.090
 that last night I commented on a certain 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.050
 a defeat 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.050
 and very broad 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.810
 a team superior to ours 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.520
 but that obviously leaves us a taste 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.200
 very very bitter 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.770
 and the people that last night refer to the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.729
 they did it 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.729
 Y 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100
 we do not have the right to 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.880
 to show what we did yesterday of the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.380
 words of esteban walls who 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.360
 he assured that many had to go 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.860
 Perez said that it would give the feeling and 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.840
 the apologies but they will continue fighting 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.000
 by entering playoff while there 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 chance one 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.270
 when he plays directly he has a great 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.619
 responsibility 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.060
 and I think it's going to come out all the court and 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.100
 they feel 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.119
 in that sense very responsible for the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.050
 situation that is being lived and 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.880
 especially last night 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.970
 and the same thing happens to me or I can not 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.570
 be oblivious to that feeling 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.570
 seventh 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.130
 one night sportingly speaking and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.650
 and to some extent we are aware 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.190
 of the situation and if the only thing that we 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.869
 it is true, it is true 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.330
 raise your head and we know what 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.340
 maybe with my sports image we have 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.110
 touched bottom but we still have the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.860
 illusion and mathematically hope 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.830
 to be able to classify 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.350
 and in that sense we are not going to give up 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.050
 until until we achieve 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.570
 the classification and we can show something 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.070
 different to the best of the properties 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.690
 finally stressed that magic could not 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.210
 do in what little it takes to command the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.310
 team recognizing in passing that the group 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.080
 it came down in every aspect besides 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.570
 He recalled that he has an agreement to 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.890
 work quiet until June review 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.760
 big I'm not going to do we take two 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.680
 weeks and a half 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.250
 working with the team we found the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.260
 team 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.940
 very low in physicists the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.500
 football what is psychic and obviously 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.300
 that then go there mean we can not 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.490
 make miracles or so the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.140
 self - criticism of course that also 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.360
 is present in the coaching staff but 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.520
 we had very little time working with 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.290
 them but we trust that we can leave 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.610
 ahead of this situation good the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.680
 backup we do not have the directory from 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.570
 the first day we assumed independent 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.220
 of what will happen on this date the 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.200
 commitment is to work quietly until 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.080
 to finish this new opening so 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.600
 in that sense we are calm so 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.610
 less us 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.650
 in the time that we have of jobs and 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.550
 that we hope we can do something 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.550
 important with dates
