00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.149
 Now I'm Pete Seeger and welcome to the 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.620
 part number 2 of the how-to tutorial 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.090
 fly jet fighters the first 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.219
 part was of the basic controls and 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.410
 how not to crash basically in this 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.330
 part let's see how to optimize better 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.039
 the turns and in some way that are 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.710
 more competitive what do I mean if 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.960
 you realize and we do the 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.630
 tutorial of the last we look towards the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.090
 right we pull the nose up is 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.890
 a relatively broad tour guien 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.660
 by the draft mini-map that is in the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.360
 lower left will realize 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.790
 that we relatively fly in a broad 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.470
 circle if we leave nothing else the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.060
 controls as we have left them once 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.910
 past how we can optimize 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.950
 make a quicker lap and especially 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.420
 a shorter circle so that that 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.980
 speed will look much steeper 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.280
 as you can see here practically 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.500
 explaining in the same place 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.899
 there are several ways not necessarily a 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.940
 series of steps but the key is in that 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.000
 if they see in force g good then 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.570
 is the g so to speak where it says g 1 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 and he also the speed that says 342 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.490
 they may realize that while 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.100
 we give a common and ordinary return the ag 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:19.899
 happens from different ranges as could 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:23.979
 be a 1 6 7 6 8 suddenly it goes up 7 8 and 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.390
 the speed is at 333 in 39 341 that 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.910
 makes the turns in the speed 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.890
 makes the turns very very 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.570
 broad if you lower the speed to 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.149
 practically everything that the engine gives 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.490
 you can see 230 2019 the laps in 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.700
 They are actually too effective 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.100
 slow but imagine doing this 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.420
 in the middle of a fight between planes 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.939
 they are really going to end up losing 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.040
 because they're going to be like floating around 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.630
 so say less what is the balance between 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.420
 a turn a short turn and give it 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.670
 quickly from baa3 it is said that 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.640
 there are 290 some other 310 more than anything 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.619
 that they earn with the ability and more 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.390
 ok with the practice but the point 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.479
 precise is a speed more or less I 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.430
 I consider between 290 and 300 and in what 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.760
 says force g around that always 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.769
 stay in about 7 to be guided 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.810
 at what speed do it how can 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.620
 maintain that speed either by slowing down 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.510
 constantly 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.709
 and kept up the speed they can do is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.040
 a way or fernando alternating with the 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.569
 braking and alternating with him 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.819
 the turbine reaction so they go 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.159
 relatively slow fast slow fast 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.959
 that is more technical than everyone 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.700
 the important thing is that they control that 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.890
 speed so you guys go to 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.989
 test field they grab a jet and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.610
 Put yourself to practice circles like this 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.739
 I'm doing until they keep a 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.840
 speed at which you already 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.049
 get used to how the plane feels 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.819
 how that speed feels and what 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.069
 speed and strength that are maneuvering 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.510
 so they can see how fast they can give 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.720
 the turns and can even 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.220
 extrapolate those more more advanced so 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.660
 say it but towards upwards or towards 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.790
 down so that the laps also do not 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.230
 they are too broad you like if 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.690
 with apply the same principles and 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.030
 they control the same speed 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.560
 they may realize they are turning more 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.420
 closed and probably we would be in 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.570
 against the ground is that however 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.280
 they took a turn up they will give 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.900
 that gravity affects 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.810
 differently and practically not 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.890
 we are crashing 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.510
 for we almost crashed in that way 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.310
 if you are equally control your 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.310
 speed is to say speed up a little on 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.830
 the climb 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.880
 and slow down a little on the way down 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.160
 maintain a speed more or less 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.080
 constant and they will be able to turn much more 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.569
 accurate but this video has been useful 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.470
 and above all that it has been informative if 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.390
 it was like this please leave on the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.800
 qualification subscribe to the channel if they are 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.180
 new ones see the other videos so they 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.340
 compensate and the social network is in the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.340
 description see you in the next
