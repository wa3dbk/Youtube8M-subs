00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hi to all the guys and here we are 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.180
 finally in this brand new video 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.189
 we are here today with a very first guide 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.889
 gta 5 of that from you I was really 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.320
 much in demand and so I said why 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.020
 no, why not start with a guide 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.080
 as from the title today we are going to see in 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.109
 this brand new guide for the very first guide 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.900
 how to make endless money through a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.230
 glitch exactly in the position that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.269
 I'm showing you on the map how 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.740
 in the old sky rimini video there is not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 worried I'll always show you 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.280
 exactly the place they are interested in 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 once arrived here then on this 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.320
 sorry mountain let's go to the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.450
 we will find two jet skis on the beach 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.980
 we must take only one reason 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.050
 it is not right that we can go up 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.969
 on two jet skis at the same time 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.280
 in the kidney of an ae b to hold e 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.910
 go on let's say you have to go towards 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.809
 the ocean to wide until you arrive 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.650
 in this precise point that I am 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.270
 but doing little to see on the map 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.600
 exactly here once you 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.430
 arrive here that was the coast where 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.850
 we were there a few seconds ago 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.710
 you have to dive in what you will find in the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.409
 backdrop of this ocean 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.170
 you will see a destroyed airplane that is 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.530
 sunk and you must continue along 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.390
 the direction of the state in fact 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.390
 that is, seeing the wing of the rope and you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.460
 you must continue in that direction 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.409
 there will also be a cave that I will make you 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.680
 see you soon 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.750
 now I dive again see it will be there 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.229
 a cave that right direction 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.450
 you must travel until you find it 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.030
 this other part of the euro plane that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.820
 it would be the queue what is there 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 you have to come down get 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.650
 be careful with the app knows why 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.650
 I recommend other institutions for sure 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.360
 drown because the bottom is deep 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.520
 so I recommend it 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.000
 once you arrive here you will find one 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.000
 suitcase that will give you 12 thousand dollars 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.069
 and here begins my dear friends 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.030
 what the real guide must do 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.319
 if you can emerge safely and 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.230
 then the north of your character 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.170
 it does not drown what it must do 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.760
 I advise you to save for what reason 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.500
 just because you want to 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.830
 risk drowning then losing 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.950
 money you made you save in 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.260
 any save and then stay there 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.170
 just to change characters or 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.310
 any character is fine 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.069
 wait for the change to take place 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.090
 so wait then again 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.530
 return to your character that 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 you left there in the ocean and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.750
 dive or maybe there's something here 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.819
 weird you noticed yes or the mask e 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.299
 the cylinder in such a way that it does not risk 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.739
 to die drowned in an upcoming video 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.230
 I'll show you the place where you can 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.290
 take let's say the mask bomb 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.900
 so to do this 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.079
 this quickly without having 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.709
 fear of drowning here and dying 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:21.140
 in the vastness of this ocean though 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.000
 for those therefore who will say no is not 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.130
 right if I don't have the tanks like 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.160
 I 'll show you another area 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.640
 then with this area precisely here 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.880
 now I show you the map I'm showing you 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.799
 exactly the map the exact point 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.720
 where we need to go once you 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.750
 what you simply have to do 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.380
 dive into the water in this 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.200
 precise dive point you will find one 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.220
 I didn't understand what it is 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.400
 a boat a boat that always is 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.819
 sunk and you will find another briefcase 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.610
 but this recipe will have $ 7,500 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.129
 so it will give you $ 7,500 though also 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.110
 with this you can do the same let's say 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.540
 trick you must do the same 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.209
 the same thing here makes no sense to save 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.370
 because the risk of drowning very low 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.340
 change character and then return 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.410
 in the woods what you left there 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.900
 in the middle of the sea to catch up again 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.690
 a suitcase you all want to do this 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.840
 as often as you like, I greet you 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.500
 release a good like a comment that 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.930
 tell me 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.210
 what did you use the money for 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.880
 what reason do you want to do this we say 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.900
 this trick and see you at the next 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.050
 video 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.050
 Hello
