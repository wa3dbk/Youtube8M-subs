pull the throttle stick back you would

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740

just<00:00:43.649> cut<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> throttle<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.480> use<00:00:45.629> an

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
just cut the throttle so we use an

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.619 
just cut the throttle so we use an

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
be with the switch all the way away from

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.330 
be with the switch all the way away from
you<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.360> switch<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.949> left-hand

you this switch here on the left-hand

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
you this switch here on the left-hand
side<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> most<00:00:59.910> common<00:01:00.329> switch<00:01:00.539> but

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
side is the most common switch but

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
side is the most common switch but
different<00:01:01.469> radios<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.010> different<00:01:02.520> setups

different radios have different setups
so<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> check<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.530> own

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
so you have to check with your own

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.030 
so you have to check with your own
radios<00:01:05.280> manual<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> radio<00:01:07.890> in

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
up and off the ground and Electric

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.920 
up and off the ground and Electric
helicopters<00:01:12.119> would<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.299> similar

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
helicopters would be similar

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.740 
helicopters would be similar
once<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:14.040> flying<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.180> would<00:01:15.299> flip<00:01:15.540> into

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
once you're flying you would flip into

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
once you're flying you would flip into
an<00:01:15.930> aerobatic<00:01:16.409> flight<00:01:16.590> mode<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.430> has

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
an aerobatic flight mode this one has

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160 
an aerobatic flight mode this one has
two<00:01:17.909> different<00:01:18.240> flight<00:01:18.420> modes<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.840> an<00:01:18.930> idle

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
then you have full power and full pitch

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
then you have full power and full pitch
available<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.220> with<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> upper<00:01:26.880> portion<00:01:27.180> of

throttle from an idle at the bottom you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.730 
throttle from an idle at the bottom you
can<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> throwing<00:01:40.259> barrel<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.650> is

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
can see that the throwing barrel here is

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 
can see that the throwing barrel here is

would<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.570> flip<00:01:48.899> into<00:01:49.079> an<00:01:49.200> aerobatic<00:01:49.770> flight

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
would then flip into an aerobatic flight

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.179 
would then flip into an aerobatic flight
mode<00:01:50.189> which<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.890> intended<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> maintain

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
mode which then is intended to maintain

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.090 
mode which then is intended to maintain
the<00:01:53.700> rotor<00:01:53.909> speed<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> throttle

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the rotor speed so we have a throttle

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.130 
the rotor speed so we have a throttle
curve<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> pitch<00:01:56.880> curve<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.630> which

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
curve and a pitch curve on here which

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.560 
curve and a pitch curve on here which
allows<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> adjust<00:02:00.590> where<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.390> output<00:02:03.390> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
allows you to adjust where the output is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.440 
allows you to adjust where the output is
at<00:02:03.869> any<00:02:04.320> given<00:02:04.560> point<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> stick<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.880> five

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
at any given point on the stick or five

different<00:02:10.080> radios<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.619> different<00:02:10.920> setups

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
different radios have different setups

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.589 
different radios have different setups
but<00:02:11.520> in

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
but in

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.929 
but in
in<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.019> nutshell<00:02:13.230> what<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.220> allows<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.730> do

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
in a nutshell what it allows you to do

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.479 
in a nutshell what it allows you to do
is<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.450> allows<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.920> several

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
is it allows you to have several

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.020 
is it allows you to have several
different<00:02:17.640> modes<00:02:18.030> which<00:02:18.959> give<00:02:19.260> you

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
different modes which give you

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.449 
different modes which give you
consistent<00:02:21.030> power<00:02:21.269> for<00:02:22.049> aerobatic<00:02:22.530> without

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
consistent power for aerobatic without

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.890 
consistent power for aerobatic without
cutting<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.970> power<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.420> when<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.659> bring<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
cutting it power it's when you bring the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.210 
cutting it power it's when you bring the
throttle<00:02:25.049> down<00:02:25.319> then<00:02:25.709> when<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:25.980> ready<00:02:26.010> to

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
throttle down then when you're ready to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.460 
throttle down then when you're ready to
land<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:27.209> would<00:02:27.329> flip<00:02:27.540> back<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.079> normal

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
land you would flip back in the normal

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.289 
land you would flip back in the normal
mode<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.890> you'd<00:02:29.159> be<00:02:29.280> able<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.640> land<00:02:29.849> normally

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
mode and you'd be able to land normally

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.690 
mode and you'd be able to land normally
or<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.379> use<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> throttle<00:02:31.829> hole<00:02:32.129> which

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
or you can use the throttle hole which

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.009 
or you can use the throttle hole which
is<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.849> whole<00:02:33.000> nother<00:02:33.150> situation<00:02:33.390> but

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
is a whole nother situation but

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.990 
is a whole nother situation but
basically<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.920> throttle<00:02:35.250> hole<00:02:35.370> allows<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
basically the throttle hole allows you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.569 
basically the throttle hole allows you
to<00:02:36.299> cut<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.230> throttle<00:02:37.470> back<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:38.040> an<00:02:38.159> idle<00:02:38.459> at

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
to cut the throttle back to an idle at

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.690 
to cut the throttle back to an idle at
any<00:02:38.700> time<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.109> over<00:02:41.040> any<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.489> flight

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
any time and you over any of the flight

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.089 
any time and you over any of the flight
modes<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.900> important<00:02:43.319> because<00:02:43.500> you

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
modes and this is important because you

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.800 
modes and this is important because you
need<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.370> able<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.640> both<00:02:44.879> auto<00:02:45.209> rotate<00:02:45.569> and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
need to be able to both auto rotate and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.940 
need to be able to both auto rotate and
you<00:02:45.900> also<00:02:46.079> need<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.409> be<00:02:46.470> able<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.620> cut<00:02:46.829> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you also need to be able to cut the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.910 
you also need to be able to cut the
power<00:02:47.069> if<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.459> have<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> crash<00:02:48.269> because

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
power if you have a crash because

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.349 
power if you have a crash because
crashing<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.370> throttle<00:02:50.700> hold<00:02:51.030> engaged

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
crashing with the throttle hold engaged

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.259 
crashing with the throttle hold engaged
will<00:02:52.319> dramatically<00:02:53.250> reduce<00:02:53.519> damage<00:02:54.120> if

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
will dramatically reduce damage if

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.030 
will dramatically reduce damage if
you're<00:02:54.480> gonna<00:02:54.629> go<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.799> hit<00:02:55.889> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
you're gonna go in you can hit the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.619 
you're gonna go in you can hit the
throttle<00:02:56.220> hold<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.180> cut<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.480> power

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
throttle hold and you can cut the power

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.470 
throttle hold and you can cut the power
and<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.500> will<00:02:58.650> reduce<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.790> amount<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.090> energy

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and it will reduce the amount of energy

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.210 
and it will reduce the amount of energy
that<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> helicopter<00:03:01.470> has<00:03:01.650> going<00:03:01.980> into<00:03:02.129> the

ground and it's one of the things that

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.309 
ground and it's one of the things that
you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.609> learn<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.909> do<00:03:06.090> as<00:03:06.359> a<00:03:06.659> reaction<00:03:07.200> if

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
you can learn to do as a reaction if

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.640 
you can learn to do as a reaction if
