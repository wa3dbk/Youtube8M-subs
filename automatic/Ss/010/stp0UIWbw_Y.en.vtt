00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
head has turned slightly to the right

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.500 
head has turned slightly to the right
almost<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.489> if<00:02:53.609> it's<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:53.849> it's<00:02:54.090> soaring

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510

almost as if it's like it's soaring
above<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:55.200> seen<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> fish<00:02:56.599> now<00:02:57.599> although<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
above it's seen a fish now although the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.500 
above it's seen a fish now although the
pose<00:02:59.220> well<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.329> flying<00:03:00.780> stance<00:03:01.409> but<00:03:01.920> I

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
pose well it is a flying stance but I

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.970 
pose well it is a flying stance but I
don't<00:03:03.510> know<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.629> any<00:03:03.750> pterosaurs<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.739> stood

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
don't know of any pterosaurs that stood

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.170 
don't know of any pterosaurs that stood
like<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.620> would<00:03:08.459> have<00:03:08.579> liked<00:03:08.819> if<00:03:08.970> me

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
like this but I would have liked if me

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.610 
like this but I would have liked if me
if<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.510> wings<00:03:09.720> were<00:03:09.870> bit<00:03:10.079> more<00:03:10.260> spread<00:03:10.560> out

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
if the wings were bit more spread out

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.849 
if the wings were bit more spread out
but<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.459> guess<00:03:12.049> it's<00:03:13.049> just<00:03:13.199> how<00:03:13.379> they've<00:03:13.590> really

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
but I guess it's just how they've really

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.550 
but I guess it's just how they've really
like<00:03:14.010> designed<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.609> I<00:03:14.760> guess<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.629> that's<00:03:16.379> just

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
like designed it I guess but that's just

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.199 
like designed it I guess but that's just
me<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.769> need<00:03:17.099> to<00:03:17.220> see<00:03:17.370> more<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.579> see<00:03:17.819> wrong<00:03:18.030> with

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
me you need to see more I see wrong with

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.869 
me you need to see more I see wrong with
it<00:03:18.359> but<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.739> still<00:03:19.739> think<00:03:19.919> it's<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.099> fantastic

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
it but I still think it's a fantastic

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.849 
it but I still think it's a fantastic
piece<00:03:21.209> I'm<00:03:21.359> also<00:03:21.510> one<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.989> pterosaur<00:03:22.500> that

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
piece I'm also one of the pterosaur that

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.789 
piece I'm also one of the pterosaur that
