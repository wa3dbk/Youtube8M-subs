00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.190
 attack the words c is everything to your games 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.590
 made in the same top 5 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.989
 so that's it! moc est 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.860
 hastened to wire 13 that marked me is 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.309
 fifth party position santi cazorla 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.699
 already national players so it's a 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.140
 killing I'm talking about the player in real life 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.510
 a very, very big season from him 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.010
 very decisive very good technically 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.700
 now we talk a little about his card 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.899
 Smart 17 complete 84 86 2 assists its 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.010
 dribbling at 110 86 to 78 in speed that's 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.690
 a complete player and when we go on 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.509
 foot l we see that it is that of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.930
 85 bullet control glass 87 of 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.840
 dribbling 91 balance 92 access the 82 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.720
 of acceleration here he knows it's a 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.190
 player that I like sir he has a 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.000
 sacred bangs for the long hot 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.950
 it's perfect it has 81 57 85 passes 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.690
 short or six this is a player 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.310
 very complete I had discovered place six 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.070
 years in the arsenal team on fall and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.460
 that was the best thing about this 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.530
 team 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.409
 in addition it has four floors and techniques 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.240
 5 stars bad foot frankly it's 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.159
 a very complete player who do not cost 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.610
 dear at all so I'm more on 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.740
 14 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.510
 it may be very badly viewed 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.990
 season that he did in the fourth 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.580
 position 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.210
 we still mark this first league 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.729
 david silva from manchester city goes to him 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.080
 also a very complete player 90 known to 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.470
 ball 93 agility 83 acceleration this is 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.430
 it's like those same caliber that cazorla 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.770
 in a little better 86 years not 79 whole 88 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.409
 in dribbling here is a good quality of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.909
 goes long shot shot this is it 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.289
 a very complete game costs more than 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.569
 cazorla anyway 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.030
 and here he is four stars and 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.280
 techniques a good little left foot 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.659
 twenty thousand credit about pc here 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.719
 it's more expensive than cazorla but my 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.549
 choice that limits you cazorla that's enough 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.019
 david silva nothing there is some 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.939
 difference if he's left-handed already but 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.849
 after no more than that so here's your 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.890
 fight he goes fourth in the ranking in 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.260
 third position 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.090
 adel tarrabt the moroccan queen's park 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.359
 rangers that so that was transferred late 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.269
 who was on loan I believe in fulham so 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.920
 here it is it is a day 5 stars 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.010
 5 Stars 5 Stars technical game 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.329
 bad foot trumps a player 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.189
 very complete really 5 stars 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.530
 extraordinary a very good conduct 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.540
 ball long shot towards madness 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.389
 yann that fucking good typing 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.639
 stat in a free-kick very agile 87 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.349
 agility this is a very good player 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.269
 5 stars which you nothing at all level 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.799
 value for money is excellent it 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.340
 has five stars in speed which is still 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.829
 an advantage 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 and here is really a pleasure 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.780
 to type big long shot with this 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.230
 player 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.049
 and that's why I liked it 3rd 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.870
 in 2nd position we go in series to he 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.150
 this is kevin-prince boateng this is him 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.060
 I really liked this player for 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.699
 the cdu a guy 85 of the very work wright 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.620
 very balanced or raid high tack and 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.760
 defensive to the four stars and 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.340
 technical and bad foot 88 thesis 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.940
 82-83 leading 77th defense 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.449
 the guy is super complete he has no 7 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.599
 63 77 and the guy and m oci still has 77 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.879
 in defense that's it's complete hyper 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.729
 90 endurance 88 of force 90 of aggression 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.370
 82 positioning a strike 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:54.040
 beautiful a set in power and in 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.379
 laughing free kick that's perfect it's 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.639
 really this word is frozen that makes 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.810
 Here is my second in 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.819
 but I really loved them 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.650
 voracious and sees the cdc crazy on the 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.040
 terrain he is present from everywhere he is 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.030
 from everywhere it is huge that's it's in 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.830
 uc ifs and finally the number 1 of this 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.130
 ranking he is Brazilian 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.560
 it is simply ronaldinho 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.400
 my friends here it is not the fastest 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.419
 but the gains are madness 93 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.490
 ball driving 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.440
 this is this is the thing that makes 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.669
 different if the slow box there is a 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.590
 cabbage ball hill and you 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.450
 frankly we do not feel its 58 of 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.490
 limits and his impression that he has I 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.620
 believe our correct speed passes 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.060
 from everywhere 89 in dribbling they we 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.889
 hit naked crowds it's a blow 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.100
 frank but thinks it's madness 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.310
 especially it's boost versions here 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.320
 this player cc - looted prefect and by far 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.900
 and by far he's from everywhere he's five 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.510
 technical star it is extraordinary 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.800
 it's really it's so it's 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.139
 so much fun I had that cost 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.350
 not expensive at all it's perfect 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.240
 ronaldinho number one is by far and of 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.310
 far the number one of the words that's from this 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.170
 fifa 13 for me 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.640
 here it is work yet air 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.470
 is for him at the base on the map 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.660
 nothing here is there any work raid that 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.640
 are ba and defensive ba attacks but 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.930
 here are the guys the rsa we have two 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.690
 balls and dribbles and hits 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.710
 it's perfect and ola number one 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.940
 ronaldinho 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.380
 I hope you have who does this 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.570
 ranking of these camps words and more and 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.130
 my ranking so I'm aware 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.590
 that some will not have one with me 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.840
 but here I hope you have who 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.060
 do we find ourselves so polish top 5 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.680
 who will be the scorers at the 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.680
 next guys and his route
