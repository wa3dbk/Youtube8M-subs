one of my videos maybe four or five
months<00:01:35.009> ago<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.490> micro<00:01:35.820> transactions<00:01:36.479> within

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
months ago was micro transactions within

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
months ago was micro transactions within
the<00:01:36.900> game<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.340> said<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.640> weren't

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the game and they said they weren't

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.310 
the game and they said they weren't
going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> affect<00:01:39.240> people<00:01:39.509> too<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:39.960> but

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
going to affect people too much but

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.520 
going to affect people too much but
anyways<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.909> air<00:01:42.090> drops<00:01:42.450> from<00:01:42.720> airplanes

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
anyways the air drops from airplanes

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.840 
anyways the air drops from airplanes
supposedly<00:01:44.490> by<00:01:45.560> supply<00:01:46.560> drops<00:01:46.890> from

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
supposedly by supply drops from

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
supposedly by supply drops from
organizations<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.470> will<00:01:49.619> provide<00:01:49.920> air

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
organizations and they will provide air

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
organizations and they will provide air
drops<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.729> supplies<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:52.350> pretty<00:01:52.590> sure

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
drops with supplies I'm pretty sure

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.569 
drops with supplies I'm pretty sure
you're<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.130> supplies<00:01:53.430> are

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you're going to know what supplies are

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.399 
you're going to know what supplies are
going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> air<00:01:54.270> drops<00:01:54.540> before<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
going to be in the air drops before you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.690 
going to be in the air drops before you
buy<00:01:55.560> them<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.490> probably

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
buy them so you know you can probably

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.429 
buy them so you know you can probably
pick<00:01:56.880> whatever<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.240> want<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> air

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
pick whatever you want to be in the air

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.219 
pick whatever you want to be in the air
drop<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.579> however<00:02:00.180> how<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> turn<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
drop but however how this can turn the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.350 
drop but however how this can turn the
tables<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.100> when<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.369> pay<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
tables on you is when you pay for the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
tables on you is when you pay for the
airdrop<00:02:03.840> where<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.619> lose<00:02:04.829> money<00:02:05.100> if

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
airdrop where you can lose money if

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.499 
airdrop where you can lose money if
you're<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.549> paying<00:02:05.759> attention<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.360> where<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you're not paying attention to where the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.960 
you're not paying attention to where the
air<00:02:06.750> drop<00:02:07.049> falls<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.340> someone<00:02:08.610> else<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
air drop falls and someone else is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.780 
air drop falls and someone else is
closer<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> same<00:02:10.830> sir<00:02:11.039> servers

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
closer that is on the same sir servers

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.760 
closer that is on the same sir servers
you<00:02:11.970> they<00:02:12.270> could<00:02:12.450> actually<00:02:12.629> steal<00:02:13.260> your

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you they could actually steal your

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.920 
you they could actually steal your
apply<00:02:13.950> drop<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.580> can't<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:14.970> back<00:02:15.090> so

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
apply drop and you can't get it back so

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.990 
apply drop and you can't get it back so
you<00:02:16.470> actually<00:02:16.680> wasted<00:02:17.280> money<00:02:17.460> for<00:02:17.760> something

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you actually wasted money for something

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.290 
you actually wasted money for something
yet<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.480> didn't<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.320> game<00:02:20.300> seems

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
yet you didn't get so this game seems

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.760 
yet you didn't get so this game seems
like<00:02:21.480> microtransactions<00:02:22.320> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.560> turn<00:02:22.680> out

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
like microtransactions going to turn out

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.490 
like microtransactions going to turn out
really<00:02:22.860> bad<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:24.350> people<00:02:25.350> can

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
really bad to see that people can

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.170 
really bad to see that people can
actually<00:02:25.680> steal<00:02:26.040> something<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.640> spent

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
actually steal something that you spent

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.050 
actually steal something that you spent
physical<00:02:27.750> money<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.550> i'm<00:02:29.670> pretty<00:02:29.850> sure

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
physical money on so i'm pretty sure

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.490 
physical money on so i'm pretty sure
that'll<00:02:30.300> piss<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> lot<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.780> people<00:02:30.870> off<00:02:31.140> if<00:02:31.410> you

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
that'll piss a lot of people off if you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.310 
that'll piss a lot of people off if you
buy<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> supply<00:02:32.460> drop<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.090> falls<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.080> can't

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
get there and they end up stealing it so

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.300 
get there and they end up stealing it so
however<00:02:39.660> much<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.050> Supply<00:02:40.440> Drop<00:02:40.500> costs<00:02:41.010> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
however much a Supply Drop costs and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.950 
however much a Supply Drop costs and
someone<00:02:42.120> steals<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.420> from<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.720> you're

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
basically screwed so they might end up

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.970 
basically screwed so they might end up
changing<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.960> future<00:02:46.080> because<00:02:46.440> of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
changing that in the future because of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.010 
changing that in the future because of
what<00:02:47.130> they<00:02:47.250> said<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.330> forum<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.840> they
