00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
driving and I could just see a lot of
problems<00:01:51.750> emanating<00:01:52.290> from<00:01:52.500> legalizing

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
problems emanating from legalizing

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800 
problems emanating from legalizing
marijuana<00:01:53.430> quite<00:01:53.909> frankly<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.630> he's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
marijuana quite frankly so he's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
marijuana quite frankly so he's
acquainting<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> with<00:01:55.829> alcohol<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.729> know

acquainting it with alcohol do you know

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.179 
acquainting it with alcohol do you know
I<00:01:57.450> agree<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.439> should<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.649> legalized

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
I agree i think that should be legalized

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.730 
I agree i think that should be legalized
it<00:01:59.430> has<00:01:59.579> very<00:01:59.880> positive<00:02:00.570> medicinal<00:02:01.170> purposes

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it has very positive medicinal purposes

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.429 
it has very positive medicinal purposes
and<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.240> dangerous<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:04.140> some<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
and it's not as dangerous as some of the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.540 
and it's not as dangerous as some of the
other<00:02:04.590> drugs<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.610> there

our country ramifications are deadly for
years<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.110> years<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.620> don't<00:03:09.070> think<00:03:09.160> that

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
years and years I don't think that

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.120 
years and years I don't think that
people<00:03:09.910> smoking<00:03:10.180> recreationally<00:03:11.080> are<00:03:11.470> going
