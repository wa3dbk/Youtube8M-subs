the interesting weapon of my opinion

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.230 
the interesting weapon of my opinion
because<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.229> has<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.410> grab<00:01:54.770> mechanic<00:01:55.400> I'm<00:01:56.000> the

because it has a grab mechanic I'm the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.320 
because it has a grab mechanic I'm the
damage<00:01:56.660> is<00:01:56.899> kind<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.530> not<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:58.009> great<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.550> it

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
damage is kind of not that great and it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.760 
damage is kind of not that great and it
doesn't<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.720> any<00:01:59.960> punch<00:02:00.229> through<00:02:00.470> but<00:02:00.740> you

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
doesn't have any punch through but you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.710 
doesn't have any punch through but you
can<00:02:01.009> put<00:02:01.130> shred<00:02:01.430> on<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.820> but<00:02:02.119> you<00:02:02.180> know<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.509> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
can put shred on it but you know the the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.780

the load of speaking and everything else
like<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:54.990> I'm<00:03:55.080> not<00:03:55.230> going<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.470> do<00:03:55.530> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
like that but I'm not going to do the

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.350 
like that but I'm not going to do the
whole<00:03:55.830> thing<00:03:55.860> because<00:03:56.550> that's<00:03:56.700> like<00:03:56.820> spoilers

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
whole thing because that's like spoilers

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:18.590 
whole thing because that's like spoilers
so<00:03:58.200> let's<00:03:59.040> get<00:03:59.220> into<00:03:59.340> that<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:18.419> of<00:04:18.540> course

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
so let's get into that so of course

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.900 
so let's get into that so of course
because<00:04:19.169> Lotus<00:04:19.590> say<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:19.859> we<00:04:20.220> got<00:04:20.400> get<00:04:20.580> up<00:04:20.700> and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
because Lotus say so we got get up and

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.850 
because Lotus say so we got get up and
then<00:04:21.090> do<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.330> for<00:04:21.780> her<00:04:21.900> because<00:04:22.260> that's<00:04:22.740> just

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
then do that for her because that's just

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.650 
then do that for her because that's just
the<00:04:23.010> way<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.250> happens<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.120> course<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.510> go
