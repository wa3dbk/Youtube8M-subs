00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello friends welcome to another tuto 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.340
 Tuesday 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.590
 I am leonardo pÃ©rez grandson and I love 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.800
 london at night good actually 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.630
 London I love at any time today 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.380
 let's make a sketch of the beautiful 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.440
 sampol cathedral trying to give this 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.930
 lighting effect by the sides 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.690
 for this we are going to use a paper 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.810
 black and let's draw with a pencil 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.320
 white first let's mark some 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.890
 measurements of width and then where 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.890
 starts the dome the campanile and so on 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.200
 and we started to shape it 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.970
 from the perspective I think it would look more 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.970
 or less so 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.700
 having the stroke we can begin to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.460
 give you the light remember that we are 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.920
 drawing in negative 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.350
 we usually draw shading but in 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.020
 this case we are going to draw putting the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.539
 lights this gives a very special effect 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.079
 I chose this particular angle because 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.659
 from here it is illuminated by the sides 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:46.840
 you remember leaving the center more in 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.840
 we are going to try to give that effect 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.060
 the columns on the left side go to 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.130
 be illuminated on the left side 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.560
 while those on the right side 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.220
 they will be illuminated by the reflector 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.220
 the right side 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.649
 I like how it is appearing 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.250
 let's make noise clouds 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.000
 I correct the tower above because the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.690
 perspective it looked weird and we continue 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.690
 detailing 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.830
 now like you see it a little Swedish the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.330
 I'm going to move little in the right 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.330
 over here I think it's better 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.050
 Now what I see is that the columns of 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.630
 in the middle I was too bright 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.310
 and they do not give the effect that I totally wanted 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.730
 so I'm going to clarify them with the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.730
 draft 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.120
 that's better now I'm happy 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.970
 if you are too , please give him 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.650
 like and subscribe to the channel and I'll see you 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.650
 The next Tuesday
