00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.660
 m 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.660
 we 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.920
 hello my name is anthony phillips 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.560
 I am 45 years old I am a teacher at the utbm 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.779
 and I just participated in triathlon 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.410
 ironman of hawai it is to chain 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.650
 3 km 800 swimming 180 km cycling and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.239
 a marathon 42 km the great man of hawaii 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.949
 is a very special race because 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.030
 that she is the support of 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.070
 Ironman world championships 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.870
 that is, to tacitly participate 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.290
 at the ironman of Hawaii you have to qualify 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.330
 through one of the thirty iron man who 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.710
 exist self in the world that these are 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.170
 not necessarily count people 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.370
 is that to participate in that it is 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.659
 clear that behind there is a 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.309
 everyday investment the 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.760
 preparation she's on the very long 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.500
 term 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.409
 that represents in my case 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 between 15 and 22 hours 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.860
 workout in the week actually 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.940
 I train a lot alone 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.739
 almost all the time alone 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.540
 precisely because there is work so 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.130
 there are very tight slots 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.600
 students when they are going 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.890
 defect and do not realize that they 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.299
 I had in the morning in class they told me 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.409
 again in the afternoon and between the two 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.450
 I did a two-hour session at 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.590
 foot with a well defined program and in 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.560
 eating like making a sandwich 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.000
 empowering the departure actually and 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560
 2000 people who are in the water the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.070
 departure and aluminum at about 200 meters 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.320
 from the beach 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.500
 so all models in the water in half 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.120
 hour it's brawl on the spot to hold 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.890
 his place at the start is not nice 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.680
 as moment there is tension then is 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.000
 we are in the water there are helicopters 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.010
 who turns above who is filming there are 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.080
 giant screens and the sound system with the anthem 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.280
 american there is a hymn to mahwah ya the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.170
 pressure rises the pressure goes up 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.150
 he rescued but with cannon and there 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.140
 down all the apprehension that were them 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.310
 who were there before 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.420
 for hours what concerns me 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.340
 it 's zero in a split second 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.540
 and then it's gone we're white 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.830
 a real washing machine a it's 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.420
 infernal it's not a race of 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.380
 swimming there is his hallway for himself all 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.760
 alone there everyone will be at the same 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.120
 place at the same time it's a sport of 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.920
 contact swimming in water 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.480
 yeah cycling the test is so 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.490
 hard that anyway we will go through 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.320
 times when there is nothing that will 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.880
 legs go faster at times 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.560
 where it's much better so that's it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.610
 he must come to manage must especially 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.140
 manage your diet 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.790
 because robillon we must not forget 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.340
 that when we put the bike and a marathon 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.190
 behind what is pretty paradoxical 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.230
 this is when the bike we are asked 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.430
 arrives at such a stage of engagement 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.630
 in the race that at that moment we get 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.400
 said ah that's more than a marathon 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.570
 as if it looks like nothing while in 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.980
 do it's a huge thing that happens 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.450
 behind the first 15 kilometers are 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.770
 in relatively easy quotation marks 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.750
 because they are a little bit 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.650
 city ​​finally along the seaside but 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.680
 there are people and spectators 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.510
 for an hour or so it's okay and after 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.650
 we go on a high road 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.210
 the same again in the fields of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.760
 lava or there is nobody there there is 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.710
 that run the lava fields the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.900
 will sulk well black that reflects well 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.380
 sun now there it becomes 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.730
 difficult 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.960
 I have already had the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.160
 tears in the eyes on arriving because 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.220
 it's so huge when we arrive 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.560
 like a little everything that are released and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.760
 it's a feeling but I would say 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.270
 almost need to be known for 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.620
 understand 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.350
 it's quite special and it's also 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.010
 this feeling that makes us want 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.780
 we want to go back 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.700
 I am actually the first to have 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.220
 do ten homes in France I want to do 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.959
 competing by being competitive before more 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.730
 high level I do not envision for the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.660
 do it halfway when I do them eight 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.100
 I was not happy with my race 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.140
 so suddenly I went back for a 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.700
 ninth when I did the 9th I got 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.220
 like I said it's a shame not 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.840
 try to do 10 to be able to a 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.560
 round figure cross foot why not 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.560
 stopped on it
