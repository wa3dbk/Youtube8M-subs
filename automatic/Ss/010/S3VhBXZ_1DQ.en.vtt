00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
so and you learn as you get older to

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.770 
so and you learn as you get older to
listen<00:00:29.370> to<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.700> body<00:00:29.790> and<00:00:30.420> then<00:00:30.600> you<00:00:30.690> were

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
listen to your body and then you were

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
couple of weeks that will put me in a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.069 
couple of weeks that will put me in a
better<00:01:32.789> position<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.359> forward<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.750> London

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
better position going forward to London

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
better position going forward to London
for<00:01:34.770> me<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> 5<00:01:35.159> k's<00:01:35.460> been<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:35.820> pet<00:01:36.030> event<00:01:36.270> for

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
for me the 5 k's been my pet event for

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
for me the 5 k's been my pet event for
the<00:01:36.479> last<00:01:36.689> nine<00:01:37.289> of<00:01:37.530> 10<00:01:37.710> years<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.250> think

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the last nine of 10 years and I think

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.279 
the last nine of 10 years and I think
I've<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:38.579> one<00:01:39.240> more<00:01:39.270> Olympics<00:01:39.810> where<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> can

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
I've got one more Olympics where I can

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.319 
I've got one more Olympics where I can
do<00:01:40.680> better<00:01:40.829> than<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.039> have<00:01:41.189> done<00:01:41.219> before<00:01:41.670> okay

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
do better than I have done before okay

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.069 
do better than I have done before okay
so<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.689> fourth<00:01:42.899> Olympics<00:01:43.320> 32<00:01:44.070> years<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.429> age

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
so your fourth Olympics 32 years of age

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.709 
so your fourth Olympics 32 years of age
remains<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.200> seen<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> make<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.100> Rio

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
remains to be seen if you make it to Rio

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.730 
remains to be seen if you make it to Rio
36<00:01:48.740> 336<00:01:49.740> yet<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.140> whew<00:01:52.409> is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
36 336 yet is this is this it whew is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.510 
36 336 yet is this is this it whew is
this<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.189> opportunity<00:01:54.469> in<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.710> 5k<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.219> think

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this your opportunity in the 5k I think

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.130 
this your opportunity in the 5k I think
it<00:01:56.640> probably<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:57.960> last

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it probably is one of my last

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
it probably is one of my last
opportunities<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.890> an<00:01:59.159> Olympics<00:01:59.549> obviously

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
opportunities at an Olympics obviously

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.539 
opportunities at an Olympics obviously
because<00:02:00.060> there's<00:02:00.210> four<00:02:00.509> years<00:02:00.749> between<00:02:00.960> them

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
because there's four years between them

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.760 
because there's four years between them
you<00:02:02.549> mentioned<00:02:02.939> Rio<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:03.929> push<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you mentioned Rio if I if I do push to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
you mentioned Rio if I if I do push to
Rio<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.219> probably<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> different<00:02:05.939> event

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
Rio it probably be in a different event

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.910 
Rio it probably be in a different event
but<00:02:06.719> most<00:02:07.079> certainly<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> 10<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
but most certainly the 10 or the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.880 
but most certainly the 10 or the
marathon<00:02:08.399> I've<00:02:09.300> never<00:02:09.810> shied<00:02:10.409> away<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.649> the
