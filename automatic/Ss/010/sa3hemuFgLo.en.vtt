00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.669
 hello all welcome today we are going to teach you how to make a carbonara sauce 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.460
 for the carbonara sauce the ingredients are virgin citoliva and affect the outro 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.060
 White wine 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.720
 an egg yolk grated cheese 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.920
 b with julián addresses which sought I'm going to shit 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.480
 fine salt white pepper and oregano 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.390
 we will propose a casserole to the fire 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.820
 and add the splash of virgin olive oil 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.440
 those who want it to look very strong 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.360
 anaheim and also another 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.220
 olive half 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.640
 little olive and a little butter 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.020
 and in this case we are going to do it with affection 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.320
 we can warm up and then without it being too strong we will add the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 onion 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.190
 and the doctor 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.240
 normally twice as much onion forgive twice the ikea concept 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.430
 we want a little bit of salt and white pepper little flowers that we will reach 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 final 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 what happens is to get the water out of the countries outside the region 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 if it were little by little 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.479
 GQ 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.479
 very ugly very ugly 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.160
 for let's leave a politician 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.310
 let's add the onion 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.950
 and the boycott 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.030
 that we have the onion and that of the bankrupt we will add white pine 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.289
 it was time to be 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.289
 if it does not yes 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.810
 that is, everyone is much more acidic when it comes to gossiping, 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.950
 reduction coli but white c is strengthened is practically reduced 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.479
 I agree 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.479
 until there is nothing left despite the fact that for decades for the dollar 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.269
 of the trunk to see is how it is 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.399
 if you have doubts 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.079
 because of course some will think I made good and it does not reduce much and I have left acid 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.079
 plan a little sugar is already affiliated although the year we are going to quote 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.169
 if we do not reduce white wine well, it will give the sauce a strange taste 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.169
 On many occasions we have practiced 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.859
 it's practically disappearing 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.979
 the juice that had stuck to the bottom of the school sports pan 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:49.889
 It is gone 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.799
 for the state with white wine 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.789
 if we are going to let detail the cacique reading 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.529
 the best way to bring the nose 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.659
 civilians and still has a strong smell white wine alcohol is still missing 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.569
 6 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.150
 then we will add lorena gonzález you can leave at the end of 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.659
 year will do it so that you go with a little 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.659
 maybe too much 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.639
 for practically 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.199
 there is no white wine and then what we do 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.199
 Spain gave the can 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:36.429
 and let it be reduced little by little even though it is the note we reduce it 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:37.809
 very fast 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.869
 what is not going to happen is that it is going to be cut 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.710
 just go up slowly 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.650
 and so we are not at risk of being cut off and two ways of cutting 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.350
 very fast style or that the network look too much and a point that is no longer 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.350
 water and fat is cut 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.879
 for when the sauce we have there are several ways to finish 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.769
 for same as it is we can add a little nutmeg and if 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.459
 we have a task that in some macaroni finish working it all together 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.929
 and the sauce is already discounted 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.509
 these weightlifter wanted us a good pasta 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:14.149
 if we make more quantity at a given moment we are left light and have flavor and no 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.169
 we want to reduce the mass what we would do would be to add a little 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.279
 pesos 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.620
 to finish ligating it 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.809
 and in any case 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.809
 if there was an egg yolk that is what we have here 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.819
 be careful with the yolk because this case that we are doing a caporal de 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.009
 type casarsa 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.219
 we serve, let's call it a quick stretch, it will set 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.580
 and what will happen is that we will remain there margin that mixed prof 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.029
 what I have done together all to one side let's throw the flame 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.779
 and what we are going to do is mix very fast 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:48.139
 so that it will not make us 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.139
 lusaka 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.210
 normally for the amount that we have actually used it would not be necessary 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.800
 add the yolk 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.199
 only if your quantity symptoms 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.930
 It can also happen to us 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.930
 that they take out a little expressed I recommend it 6 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.939
 will start let's mix 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:19.839
 and we are going to have 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.289
 a carbonara sauce 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.169
 and the same thing that's why we wanted the pasta we just worked quickly right 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.129
 that hot pasta and we have a soda carbon 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.949
 I'm not going to plant 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.949
 so you can see 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:42.969
 today in the market 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.779
 we buy very curious pasta and we can obtain very good results but 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.949
 important that the handles fear month and here we have 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:50.709
 a carbonara
