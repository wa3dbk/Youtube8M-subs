00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 coffee machines are getting smarter 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.259
 I personally use the device which 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.170
 brews coffee in just a minute and all that 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.620
 need to do no push one button 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.780
 we will show you another car which 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.270
 understands the coffee regions of his 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.850
 vegetation and more so its 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.890
 cooking now in coffeehouses can 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.439
 try coffee made by four 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.900
 ways vs press machine coffee machine 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.920
 drip type french press and pullover 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.990
 every way 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.510
 unique and reveals the taste of each 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.370
 blend in its own way but in addition to these 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.410
 types have a new 5 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.420
 any coffee beans cooked in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 new smart coffee machine clover 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 innovative device skips 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.440
 ground coffee through a 70 micron filter with 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.989
 using vacuum thanks to which the grain 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.149
 give all your taste and aroma each 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.850
 a cup of coffee I made this machine can 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.460
 say exactly and as done 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.770
 for you most often we are guests 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 We offer to get acquainted with coffee ways and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.789
 brewing french press 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.820
 but when klammer appeared were that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.310
 it is in the camp that the coffee is revealed 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.700
 most clearly that is to say what it is 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.460
 the trick is that flavor and taste become 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.619
 clean crystal clear and without husk 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.450
 that is, we sort of clean the coffee 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.759
 the whole seed is not needed 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.970
 information around it and get that 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.040
 the very heart and aroma and taste of coffee 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.110
 the clover machine is really smart but to 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.479
 sorry she can't make coffee 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.579
 herself to make barista coffee 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.320
 you need to choose a region of coffee growing 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.329
 extraction time depends on it 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.759
 water temperature and several others 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.740
 Parameters further need to pour specific 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.960
 the amount of ground coffee from with accuracy 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 up to a gram and then the machine is using 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.729
 the vacuum will drive hot water through 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.250
 filter with pressed coffee and you get 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.200
 delicious tonic for 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.210
 Essentially this technology is close to the prince 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.000
 press upside down but 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.700
 looks very tech and most importantly in 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.210
 coffee is still not technology but aroma and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.210
 taste
