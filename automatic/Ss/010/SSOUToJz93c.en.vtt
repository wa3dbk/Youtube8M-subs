there oh I noticed today when I was
looking<00:00:59.850> at<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> thought<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:01.079> exhaust

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
looking at it that I thought my exhaust

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.280 
looking at it that I thought my exhaust
got<00:01:01.980> uh<00:01:02.300> got<00:01:03.300> through<00:01:03.539> without<00:01:03.750> any<00:01:03.899> problem

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
got uh got through without any problem

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.730 
got uh got through without any problem
but<00:01:04.619> you're<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:06.229> I'm<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> part

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
but you're that thing I'm not the part

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.050 
but you're that thing I'm not the part
that's<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.250> person<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.820> replace

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that's how the person that would replace

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.460 
that's how the person that would replace
the<00:01:09.299> exhaust<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.020> other<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.350> i<00:01:10.380> can

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the exhaust for that other so i can

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.810 
the exhaust for that other so i can
probably<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.830> away<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.070> leaving<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
probably get away with leaving that I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
probably get away with leaving that I
don't<00:01:12.740> it<00:01:13.740> looks<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.189> mean<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.640> feels<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:16.310> don't

punched<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.680> now<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.130> fairing

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
punched in now you can see that fairing

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.420 
punched in now you can see that fairing
over<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.270> done<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.159> said<00:01:32.340> all

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
over there is just done so you said all

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.100 
over there is just done so you said all
fairings<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.119> pretty<00:01:33.329> much<00:01:33.479> done<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.930> race

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
fairings are pretty much done the race

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
fairings are pretty much done the race
rails<00:01:34.409> did<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> good<00:01:35.280> job<00:01:35.630> mostly<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
rails did a good job mostly but there is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.990 
rails did a good job mostly but there is
that<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> engine<00:01:41.430> case<00:01:41.700> cover<00:01:42.390> thing

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
that it's the engine case cover thing

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.480 
that it's the engine case cover thing
I'm<00:01:45.000> probably<00:01:45.240> replace<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.460> because<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
I'm probably replace that because I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.859 
I'm probably replace that because I
would<00:01:47.850> want<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> replace<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> case

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
would want to replace I just in case

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.039 
would want to replace I just in case
it's<00:01:49.259> holding<00:01:49.740> something<00:01:50.479> like<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.810> needs

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it's holding something like that needs

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.469 
it's holding something like that needs
to<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.710> held<00:01:53.310> correctly<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to be held correctly I don't want that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.420 
to be held correctly I don't want that
to<00:01:54.659> lose<00:01:54.840> its<00:01:55.020> structural<00:01:55.350> integrity<00:01:55.439> got

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to lose its structural integrity got

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.920 
to lose its structural integrity got
some<00:01:56.820> pairing<00:01:57.090> damage<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.869> said

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
some pairing damage here but like I said

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.929 
some pairing damage here but like I said
the<00:01:58.140> whole<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> failures<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:59.100> done<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.610> i

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the whole all the failures are done so i

came back down and hit the front and hit
the<00:02:38.269> brake<00:02:38.480> lever<00:02:38.719> because<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:38.989> can<00:02:39.109> see<00:02:39.290> now

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
the brake lever because you can see now

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.849 
the brake lever because you can see now
when<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.489> turn<00:02:40.609> I<00:02:41.590> don't<00:02:42.590> know<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:42.739> it's

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
when I turn I don't know if it's

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.640 
when I turn I don't know if it's
focusing<00:02:43.459> but<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.840> brake<00:02:45.049> lever<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.349> actually

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
focusing but the brake lever is actually

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.039 
focusing but the brake lever is actually
touching<00:02:46.099> this<00:02:46.250> fairing<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.870> fair

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
touching this fairing and that fair

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.409 
touching this fairing and that fair
exactly<00:02:48.500> where<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.799> supposed<00:02:48.889> to<00:02:49.280> be<00:02:49.519> so

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:50.419 
exactly where it's supposed to be so

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.879 
exactly where it's supposed to be so
that<00:02:50.659> brake<00:02:50.840> lever<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.199> can<00:02:51.349> probably<00:02:51.469> pull<00:02:51.769> it

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
that brake lever I can probably pull it

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.300 
that brake lever I can probably pull it
up<00:02:52.010> but<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.579> mean<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:54.739> just<00:02:54.769> doesn't<00:02:55.129> feel<00:02:55.250> right

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
up but I mean it just doesn't feel right

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.640 
up but I mean it just doesn't feel right
so<00:02:55.699> I'm<00:02:55.790> talking<00:02:56.060> enough<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.299> replace<00:02:56.540> that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
so I'm talking enough to replace that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.439 
so I'm talking enough to replace that
the<00:02:57.650> tank<00:02:57.949> is<00:02:58.099> going<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.340> be<00:02:58.400> an<00:02:58.489> asshole<00:02:58.699> to

00:02:59.439 --> 00:02:59.449 
the tank is going to be an asshole to

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.699 
the tank is going to be an asshole to
replace<00:02:59.750> but<00:03:00.019> somebody<00:03:00.290> said<00:03:00.319> I<00:03:00.500> might<00:03:00.590> be

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
replace but somebody said I might be

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.470
