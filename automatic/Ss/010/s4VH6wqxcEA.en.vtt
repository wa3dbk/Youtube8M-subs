00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
probably the best mic that CAD puts out

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.609 
probably the best mic that CAD puts out
so<00:01:11.979> I'm<00:01:12.160> looking<00:01:12.580> forward<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.030> being<00:01:14.070> using<00:01:15.070> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so I'm looking forward to being using it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:33.660 
so I'm looking forward to being using it
for<00:01:18.960> lower<00:01:21.030> lower<00:01:22.030> frequency<00:01:24.659> applications
