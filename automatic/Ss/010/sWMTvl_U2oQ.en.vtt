00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.969 
probably is a few months away do you
think<00:01:16.049> Paul<00:01:16.200> Allen's<00:01:16.470> gonna<00:01:16.590> look<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:16.950> on

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
think Paul Allen's gonna look back on

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
think Paul Allen's gonna look back on
his<00:01:17.549> decision<00:01:18.000> two<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> half<00:01:18.750> three<00:01:18.869> years

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
his decision two and a half three years

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
his decision two and a half three years
ago<00:01:19.229> at<00:01:19.560> filing<00:01:20.130> bankruptcy<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.670> giving<00:01:20.880> up

ago at filing bankruptcy and giving up
ownership<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> Rose<00:01:21.780> Garden<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.770> he

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
ownership of the Rose Garden and is he

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
ownership of the Rose Garden and is he
ever<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.130> say<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> big<00:01:24.060> mistake<00:01:24.090> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
ever gonna say that was a big mistake I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
ever gonna say that was a big mistake I
should<00:01:24.780> not<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.140> done<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:26.220> think

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
should not have done that I don't think

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
should not have done that I don't think
he'd<00:01:26.549> ever<00:01:26.700> admit<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:28.229> you're<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
he'd ever admit it and when you're a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.370 
he'd ever admit it and when you're a
billionaire<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.369> take<00:01:29.579> risks<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
billionaire you can take risks and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
billionaire you can take risks and
probably<00:01:31.380> take<00:01:31.619> risk<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:32.070> than<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.790> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
probably take risk more than you and I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.630 
probably take risk more than you and I
can<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.159> his<00:01:35.250> heart<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
can but I think you know in his heart of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.399 
can but I think you know in his heart of
hearts<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:36.299> probably<00:01:36.570> would<00:01:36.869> say<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> was<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
hearts he probably would say it was a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.920 
hearts he probably would say it was a
mistake<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> when<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.509> he<00:01:39.570> gave<00:01:39.750> up

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
mistake so when when he gave up
