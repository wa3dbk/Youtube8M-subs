00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
think about it right if you think

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
think about it right if you think
negative<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.140> negative<00:02:01.950> things<00:02:02.100> happen<00:02:02.399> if

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
negative then negative things happen if

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.649 
negative then negative things happen if
you<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.729> positive<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.240> fun<00:02:03.390> things

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

happened that's how I look at things

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.130 
happened that's how I look at things
like<00:02:05.399> I've<00:02:05.820> watches<00:02:06.180> videos<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.960> a

Mike right super safe like there's so

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.240 
Mike right super safe like there's so
many<00:03:26.940> traction<00:03:27.900> control<00:03:28.260> I'll<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.130> like

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
many traction control I'll get like

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.870 
many traction control I'll get like
sports<00:03:29.700> tires<00:03:30.019> like<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:32.010> some

towards<00:03:35.730> driving<00:03:36.269> fast<00:03:36.690> well<00:03:37.019> not<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.769> dry

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
towards driving fast well not that dry

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.009 
towards driving fast well not that dry
place<00:03:38.160> anyways<00:03:38.489> well<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.239> case<00:03:39.540> like<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
place anyways well in the case like the

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.750 
place anyways well in the case like the
most<00:03:40.200> accidents<00:03:40.709> are<00:03:40.799> caused<00:03:41.040> by<00:03:41.190> people<00:03:41.609> join

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
most accidents are caused by people join

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.270 
most accidents are caused by people join
the<00:03:41.880> class<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.269> teenagers<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:43.560> don't<00:03:43.829> tend

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the class like teenagers like don't tend

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.589 
the class like teenagers like don't tend
to<00:03:44.310> gain<00:03:44.459> accidents<00:03:44.880> because<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.239> driving

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
to gain accidents because it driving

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.990 
to gain accidents because it driving
really<00:03:45.840> fast<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:47.099> driving<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.700> driving

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
really fast and the driving the driving

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.400 
really fast and the driving the driving
a<00:03:48.030> crappy<00:03:48.419> car<00:03:48.569> that's<00:03:48.810> not<00:03:48.930> meant<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.319> be

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
a crappy car that's not meant to be

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.710 
a crappy car that's not meant to be
driven<00:03:49.950> fat<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.790> car<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:50.970> was<00:03:51.209> not<00:03:51.359> designed

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
driven fat so the car I was not designed

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.930 
driven fat so the car I was not designed
for<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.019> so<00:03:52.470> that's<00:03:53.040> probably<00:03:53.340> why<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:53.669> gain

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
for that so that's probably why you gain

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.420 
for that so that's probably why you gain
an<00:03:54.090> accident<00:03:54.359> in<00:03:54.419> the<00:03:54.450> first<00:03:54.599> place<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.590> one

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
an accident in the first place like one

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.180 
an accident in the first place like one
the<00:03:56.880> tires<00:03:57.180> are<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:57.599> slicky<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:58.680> very

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
the tires are like slicky and like very

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.740 
the tires are like slicky and like very
narrow<00:03:59.609> tire<00:03:59.880> sort<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.150> like<00:04:00.239> easy<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.630> lose

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
narrow tire sort of like easy to lose

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.190 
narrow tire sort of like easy to lose
traction<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.810> steering's<00:04:03.810> probably<00:04:04.109> not

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
traction to the steering's probably not

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.770 
traction to the steering's probably not
on<00:04:04.319> point<00:04:04.560> as<00:04:04.859> in<00:04:05.069> a<00:04:05.160> sports<00:04:05.459> car<00:04:05.780> everything's
