00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.230 
actually until everyone starts getting
it<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.810> course<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.200> got<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:18.650> early<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
it of course I got this early and the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.900 
it of course I got this early and the
reason<00:02:20.600> why<00:02:20.870> i<00:02:20.900> gotta<00:02:21.170> early<00:02:21.530> was<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.460> the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
reason why i gotta early was so that the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.350 
reason why i gotta early was so that the
value<00:02:23.240> will<00:02:23.360> still<00:02:24.080> be<00:02:24.200> high<00:02:24.670> but<00:02:25.670> if<00:02:25.850> i<00:02:26.060> were

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
value will still be high but if i were

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.270 
value will still be high but if i were
to<00:02:26.510> get<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:26.900> when<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.290> sets<00:02:27.680> officially

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
to get it when the sets officially

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.650 
to get it when the sets officially
recent<00:02:28.610> release<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:29.530> don't<00:02:30.530> think<00:02:30.620> that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
recent release I don't think that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.270

profit-wise<00:02:32.660> you'd<00:02:33.170> make<00:02:33.380> money<00:02:33.620> back<00:02:33.830> be

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
profit-wise you'd make money back be

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.130 
profit-wise you'd make money back be
honest<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:35.240> everyone<00:02:35.690> will<00:02:35.810> know<00:02:35.990> about

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
honest because everyone will know about

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.680 
honest because everyone will know about
