00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
and all this anguish and suffering and I

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:38.570 
and all this anguish and suffering and I
think<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.549> most

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
think that's also one of the most

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.059 
think that's also one of the most
appealing<00:01:39.119> aspects<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.289> read<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> poem

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:42.919 
appealing aspects of it I read the poem
and<00:01:41.220> thought<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.580> away<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
and thought right away like that's a

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.359 
and thought right away like that's a
video<00:01:43.080> game<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> make<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.890> video<00:01:44.069> game<00:01:44.250> out

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369

of<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> hell<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.569> our<00:01:45.720> game

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
clearly in the poem we're not going to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.520 
clearly in the poem we're not going to
create<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.349> circle<00:02:01.739> call<00:02:01.950> jealousy<00:02:02.819> or
