00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.370
 hi I'm 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.200
 menegazzo for padova 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.870
 and I want music in this video 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.740
 of a tap-based pattern of steve 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:24.460
 the pattern composed for the occasion 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.040
 in 1984 for the song god bless fidi 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.619
 this pattern operates alcatraz 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.710
 it will then be the basis for further developments 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.570
 for example in the song big babol with 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.880
 david lee roth and ress that me 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:44.620
 culpably also always develops from 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.580
 this main pattern will be 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.960
 also used for improvisations from 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:57.120
 I live extended based on good stages 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.120
 listen to the god bless video leak 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.259
 so we are back in law 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.439
 greater the right hand performs a tap in 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.439
 to the fourteenth key on the various 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:23.890
 ropes and the left hand instead yes 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.110
 engages in fifth position as far as 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.479
 concerns precisely this phrase we have 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.580
 this peculiarity in the 80s the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:36.460
 topping was typically performed in 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.990
 terminated form where the accent of the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.970
 phrase also considers with accent 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.190
 rhythmic steve vai bring this 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:49.110
 innovation that is, he has a number 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.009
 of even or odd notes at will 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.409
 keeping the figuration constant 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.390
 rhythm in this way with this 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.659
 simple ploy he is able to 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.920
 vary the situation of the sentence 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.360
 to do this he also helps himself with 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.009
 a different fingering of the hand 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.000
 right of the left hand as we will see 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.170
 that is, it will change the right hand finger 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.660
 to tap in 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.579
 when a number of figures will appear 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.420
 notes for different strings than 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:23.650
 what is playing for example 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.709
 starting we have a 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.989
 m.rom to the fourteenth key of the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.480
 fourth string on the note followed by a 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.420
 pool off on the seventh key of the fourth 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.799
 rope then mila performed with the middle 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.870
 of the right hand and the middle of the hand 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.769
 left 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.489
 after which change of fingering of the 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.109
 ring right hand on 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.609
 fourteenth key of the second 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.609
 then also a stream skipping rope 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.470
 full of the seventh key of the second 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.640
 rope and pull off on the fifth button of the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:08.020
 second chord hence do sharps does sharps 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.060
 and again a number of even notes for 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.170
 rope so let's go back to using the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.160
 middle finger of the right hand 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:21.220
 fourteenth full third string button 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.560
 of the seventh key of the third string 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.239
 note to follow other string skipping 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:36.550
 to the fourteenth key again 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:37.060
 ring finger of the right hand makes sharp 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.330
 love 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.600
 on the seventh key is full of on the fifth 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:52.420
 key the phrase then develops 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:54.850
 so we have three other notes to follow 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.420
 for chord a note with tap in and two notes 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.010
 with the left hand second string do 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.010
 sharp fourteenth key 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.280
 full of on the F sharp second string 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.730
 seventh key always and full of fifth 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:19.870
 key of the second string on my note 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:22.690
 sentence then becomes so to finish 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.410
 we have tap in al again 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:33.310
 fourteenth key of the third string 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:37.419
 note the full of on the seventh note king 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.919
 button and in this case even off on 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:45.340
 do sharp sixth key of the third string 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.980
 and the next sentence ends here comes 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.030
 repeated cyclically we listen to 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.030
 new very slowly 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.510
 Yup 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.350
 Yes No 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.180
 well and with this I have finished 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.890
