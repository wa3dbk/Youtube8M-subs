I'll be putting in the scelera contact
lenses<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:18.000> halfway<00:00:18.210> through<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.199> if

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
lenses about halfway through so if

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.570 
lenses about halfway through so if
that's<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.710> you're<00:00:19.890> interested<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.550> can

interest in face paints definitely go

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.970 
interest in face paints definitely go
through<00:00:44.670> them<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:46.020> also<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.739> this

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
through them and they also have this

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.790 
through them and they also have this
that<00:00:47.309> sets<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.000> place<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.200> use<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.649> over

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that sets it in place so I use that over

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.510 
that sets it in place so I use that over
top<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.399> face<00:00:51.059> paint<00:00:51.329> whenever<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.719> use<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
top of my face paint whenever I use it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.770 
top of my face paint whenever I use it
then<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> use<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.190> scars<00:00:56.780> so

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
then this is what I use for the scars so

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.400 
then this is what I use for the scars so
I<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.100> base<00:00:59.760> coat<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.719> blue<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> then

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
I put a base coat of the blue and then

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.479 
I put a base coat of the blue and then
this<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.840> then<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> brush<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.220> little

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
this and then the brush and the little

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:16.399 
this and then the brush and the little
pad<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.970> apply<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> let's<00:01:09.869> again

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.260 

I'm<00:01:16.950> probably<00:01:17.249> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.579> speed<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.090> up

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
I'm probably going to speed this up

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
I'm probably going to speed this up
quite<00:01:18.719> a<00:01:18.749> bit<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.289> otherwise<00:01:19.770> you're

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
quite a bit because otherwise you're

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.639 
quite a bit because otherwise you're
going<00:01:20.219> to<00:01:20.340> end<00:01:20.399> up<00:01:20.729> watching<00:01:21.079> an<00:01:22.079> hour-long

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
going to end up watching an hour-long

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.279 
going to end up watching an hour-long
video<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.369> yeah<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.359> think<00:01:24.509> YouTube<00:01:25.020> or

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
video and yeah I don't think YouTube or

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:34.429 
video and yeah I don't think YouTube or
you<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.649> that<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:32.990> just<00:01:33.990> put<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.319> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
you would like that so just put on the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:43.910 
you would like that so just put on the
base<00:01:34.649> coat<00:01:34.979> music

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 

and<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.670> will<00:01:44.790> probably<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.240> smart<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> pull

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and you will probably be smart to pull

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.560 
and you will probably be smart to pull
back<00:01:45.960> my<00:01:46.170> hair<00:01:46.440> at<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.710> point

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:10.720 

I<00:02:06.750> knew

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.400 

so<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.240> what<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:12.810> far<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.380> just

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so this is what we have so far it's just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.570 
so this is what we have so far it's just
a<00:02:13.680> thick<00:02:13.890> base<00:02:14.250> coat<00:02:15.050> now<00:02:16.050> our<00:02:16.350> liquid<00:02:17.010> latex

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
a thick base coat now our liquid latex

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.290 
a thick base coat now our liquid latex
experiment

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.870 

you<00:02:26.960> have<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.200> put<00:02:27.380> this<00:02:27.500> on<00:02:27.710> pretty<00:02:28.100> thick<00:02:28.220> to

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
you have to put this on pretty thick to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.530 
you have to put this on pretty thick to
be<00:02:28.910> able<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.300> make<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.720> scars<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:33.490> typically

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
be able to make the scars and typically

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:47.050 
be able to make the scars and typically
having<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.600> steady<00:02:35.840> hand<00:02:36.080> would<00:02:36.290> help

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.880 

you<00:02:48.060> may<00:02:48.240> have<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.540> do<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.720> couple<00:02:49.110> layers<00:02:49.470> to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you may have to do a couple layers to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:58.030 
you may have to do a couple layers to
get<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.190> thickness<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.480> desire<00:02:51.960> and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.210 

feel<00:02:59.040> free<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.610> what<00:02:59.820> our<00:03:00.030> scarf<00:03:00.630> patterns

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
feel free to do what our scarf patterns

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.840 
feel free to do what our scarf patterns
you<00:03:02.220> want<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:03.350> typically<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.470> do<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.430> basic

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
you want I typically just do the basic

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.200 
you want I typically just do the basic
low-key<00:03:06.390> ones<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:07.050> people<00:03:08.040> do<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> hand<00:03:08.970> hard

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
low-key ones that people do a hand hard

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:22.690 
low-key ones that people do a hand hard
of<00:03:09.390> so

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
everything but this is just a tutorial

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.520 
everything but this is just a tutorial
on<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.770> face<00:06:33.450> maybe<00:06:34.450> at<00:06:34.660> some<00:06:34.930> other<00:06:35.110> point<00:06:35.440> in

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
on the face maybe at some other point in

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.470 
on the face maybe at some other point in
the<00:06:35.590> future<00:06:35.800> we'll<00:06:36.100> do<00:06:36.340> the<00:06:36.460> entire<00:06:36.820> thing<00:06:36.880> for

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
the future we'll do the entire thing for

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.170 
the future we'll do the entire thing for
you<00:06:37.630> of<00:06:38.050> course<00:06:38.800> then<00:06:39.190> even<00:06:39.460> if<00:06:39.580> I<00:06:39.700> sped<00:06:39.970> it<00:06:40.000> up

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
you of course then even if I sped it up

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.820 
you of course then even if I sped it up
it<00:06:40.360> probably<00:06:40.510> still<00:06:40.930> be<00:06:41.050> an<00:06:41.140> hour-long<00:06:41.440> video

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
it probably still be an hour-long video

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.500 
it probably still be an hour-long video
and<00:06:42.810> then<00:06:43.810> I<00:06:43.930> let<00:06:44.140> it<00:06:44.230> dry<00:06:44.260> and<00:06:45.360> usually<00:06:46.360> when
