00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
this is a angelic shimmering or reverb

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.760 
this is a angelic shimmering or reverb
it's<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.150> intended<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.630> bass<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.289> I've<00:00:28.470> got

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
it's not intended for bass but I've got

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.740 
it's not intended for bass but I've got
it<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.460> I'm<00:00:29.610> recording<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> damn<00:00:30.449> thing

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
it here so I'm recording the damn thing

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.350 
it here so I'm recording the damn thing
I'm<00:00:31.619> gonna<00:00:32.040> start<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:32.790> crazy

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
I'm gonna start you out with some crazy

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.780 
I'm gonna start you out with some crazy
noise<00:00:33.660> swells<00:00:34.019> and<00:00:34.379> then<00:00:34.589> we'll<00:00:35.309> play<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
noise swells and then we'll play with a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.619 
noise swells and then we'll play with a
little<00:00:36.000> more<00:00:36.120> traditionally<00:00:36.629> after<00:00:36.900> that<00:00:41.629> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
little more traditionally after that so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.970 
little more traditionally after that so
bass<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:44.040> I'll<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.519> playing<00:00:44.730> this

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.220 

and<00:00:49.510> this

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:02:03.240 

and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.949> hear<00:00:56.070> it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.219 

so<00:02:04.250> that's<00:02:04.430> really<00:02:05.030> showing<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.020> amount

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
so that's really showing you the amount

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.559 
so that's really showing you the amount
of<00:02:06.470> decay<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.220> crazy<00:02:07.549> shimmer<00:02:08.030> sound<00:02:08.390> you

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
of decay and the crazy shimmer sound you

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.180 
of decay and the crazy shimmer sound you
can<00:02:08.720> get<00:02:08.899> out<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.200> it

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
can get out of it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.170 
can get out of it
I'm<00:02:11.180> just<00:02:11.450> strumming<00:02:12.440> with<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:13.670> volume<00:02:14.060> all

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
I'm just strumming with the volume all

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.309 
I'm just strumming with the volume all
the<00:02:14.270> way<00:02:14.360> down<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.690> my<00:02:14.780> bass<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.260> then

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
the way down on my bass and then

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.260 
the way down on my bass and then
swelling<00:02:15.709> into<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.550> get<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.880> kind<00:02:17.090> of

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
swelling into it to get that kind of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.620 
swelling into it to get that kind of
ephemeral<00:02:18.170> sound<00:02:19.120> turning<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.209> down<00:02:20.239> getting

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
ephemeral sound turning it down getting

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.420 
ephemeral sound turning it down getting
some<00:02:21.790> way<00:02:22.790> more<00:02:22.970> traditional<00:02:23.510> reverb<00:02:23.810> sounds

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
some way more traditional reverb sounds

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:38.500 
some way more traditional reverb sounds
start<00:02:25.430> there<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.060> dry<00:02:26.599> bass<00:02:26.780> again

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.300 

and<00:02:39.019> you<00:02:39.200> can<00:02:39.349> mix<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.129> all<00:02:40.310> wet

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.550 

pretty<00:02:47.310> quiet<00:02:47.490> there<00:02:47.880> but<00:02:49.280> facing<00:02:50.280> it

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.949 

and<00:02:53.650> then<00:02:54.340> we've<00:02:54.790> got<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> decay<00:02:55.330> set<00:02:55.599> all<00:02:55.750> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
and then we've got the decay set all the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:04.190 
and then we've got the decay set all the
way<00:02:56.080> down<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.470> if<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.709> crank<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.130> up<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.400> halfway

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:19.570 

getting<00:03:04.800> mixing<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.190> out<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.490> hear<00:03:05.670> it

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.840 

and<00:03:20.580> if<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.940> K<00:03:21.120> gets<00:03:21.390> really<00:03:21.840> sick<00:03:25.520> super<00:03:26.520> long

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
and if the K gets really sick super long

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.490 
and if the K gets really sick super long
it's<00:03:27.750> still<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.080> king

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
it's still the king

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:39.449 
it's still the king
that's<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.370> my<00:03:29.490> note

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.880 

so<00:03:40.359> where<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.599> pedal<00:03:40.870> gets<00:03:41.019> really<00:03:41.379> weird<00:03:41.530> and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
so where the pedal gets really weird and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.890 
so where the pedal gets really weird and
starts<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.579> sound<00:03:42.760> pretty<00:03:43.060> strange<00:03:43.420> on<00:03:43.689> bass

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
starts to sound pretty strange on bass

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.440 
starts to sound pretty strange on bass
in<00:03:44.140> some<00:03:44.549> depending<00:03:45.549> on<00:03:45.700> your<00:03:45.879> playing<00:03:46.180> style

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
in some depending on your playing style

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.149 
in some depending on your playing style
is<00:03:46.840> when<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.079> introduce<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.709> shimmer<00:03:47.950> knob

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
is when you introduce the shimmer knob

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.179 
is when you introduce the shimmer knob
now<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:48.609> is<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.969> chorus<00:03:49.329> of<00:03:49.450> angels<00:03:49.659> sound

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
now this is the chorus of angels sound

00:03:50.189 --> 00:04:05.260 
now this is the chorus of angels sound
let<00:03:51.189> me<00:03:51.280> turn<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.640> down

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.030 

so<00:04:05.840> nice<00:04:06.050> and<00:04:06.260> controlled<00:04:06.590> there

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.930 

this<00:04:11.700> gets<00:04:11.879> weird<00:04:12.090> with<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.390> no<00:04:12.569> D<00:04:12.629> stuff<00:04:12.959> so

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:42.249 

get<00:04:20.940> more<00:04:21.120> angels

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:05:06.420 

sans<00:04:43.259> angels

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.490 

you
