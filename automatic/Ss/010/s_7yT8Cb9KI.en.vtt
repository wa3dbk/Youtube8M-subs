00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.400 

hey<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:02.190> is<00:00:02.340> my<00:00:02.490> arduino<00:00:02.939> Ethernet<00:00:03.360> shield

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:03.410 
hey this is my arduino Ethernet shield

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.820 
hey this is my arduino Ethernet shield
with<00:00:04.410> an<00:00:04.620> LED<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.250> pin<00:00:05.640> 6<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.109> put<00:00:07.470> into

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
with an LED on pin 6 and it is put into

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.030 
with an LED on pin 6 and it is put into
my<00:00:08.040> ethernet<00:00:08.460> modem<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:10.500> also<00:00:10.769> attached

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
my ethernet modem and is also attached

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.310 
my ethernet modem and is also attached
to<00:00:11.250> mr<00:00:11.490> between<00:00:11.759> 0<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.880> villanova<00:00:12.509> which<00:00:13.139> is

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
to mr between 0 to villanova which is

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.240 
to mr between 0 to villanova which is
underneath<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.950> power<00:00:14.759> by<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> 9-volt<00:00:15.360> battery

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
underneath and power by a 9-volt battery

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.870 
underneath and power by a 9-volt battery
now<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.390> send<00:00:19.189> UDP<00:00:20.189> data

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
now this is going to send UDP data

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.230 
now this is going to send UDP data
message<00:00:21.650> to<00:00:23.119> my<00:00:24.289> Ethernet<00:00:25.289> shield<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.240> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
message to my Ethernet shield and that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.830 
message to my Ethernet shield and that
will<00:00:27.570> receive<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.380> turn<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> LED<00:00:29.840> but

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
will receive it and turn on the LED but

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.389 
will receive it and turn on the LED but

standing<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:36.200> LED<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.559> pin<00:00:38.070> 6<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.870> h<00:00:39.870> is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
standing for LED on pin 6 and h is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.229 
standing for LED on pin 6 and h is
standing<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.920> high<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.450> send<00:00:42.750> ow

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
standing for high or you can send ow

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
standing for high or you can send ow
which<00:00:45.239> stands<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.629> low<00:00:46.610> now<00:00:49.039> when<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> press

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
which stands for low now when you press

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.080 
which stands for low now when you press
hitch<00:00:51.079> and<00:00:52.079> send<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:55.170> turns<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> LED

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
hitch and send it it turns on the LED

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.490 
hitch and send it it turns on the LED
and<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.829> press<00:00:58.829> l<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.750> send<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.350> turns

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and you press l and send it and it turns

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.830 
and you press l and send it and it turns
off<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> LED<00:01:02.070> i<00:01:02.280> also<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.510> configured

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
off the LED i also have it configured

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.780 
off the LED i also have it configured
with<00:01:04.379> pwm<00:01:05.570> which<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> pulse<00:01:07.020> width<00:01:07.260> modulation

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
with pwm which is pulse width modulation

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.140 
with pwm which is pulse width modulation
but<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.380> standing<00:01:11.100> for

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.820 

some<00:01:15.150> data<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:16.740> recognize<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.830> set

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
some data that will recognize and set

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.560 
some data that will recognize and set
the<00:01:19.950> pw<00:01:20.100> m<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:23.869> three-digit<00:01:24.869> number<00:01:26.540> 02<00:01:27.540> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the pw m and a three-digit number 02 I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.940 
the pw m and a three-digit number 02 I
think<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:29.329> 240<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.360> something<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
think it's 240 or something that's the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.870 
think it's 240 or something that's the
analog<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:33.290> here<00:01:34.290> les<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.950> 40<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.340> doctrine<00:01:35.729> is

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
analog on here les was 40 on doctrine is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.719 
analog on here les was 40 on doctrine is
like<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.920> send<00:01:38.390> pw<00:01:39.390> m<00:01:39.509> 005<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.490> light

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
like and you send pw m 005 and you light

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.499 
like and you send pw m 005 and you light
it<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:42.140> dimly<00:01:45.229> looks<00:01:46.229> brighter<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> camera

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
it up dimly looks brighter on the camera

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.490 
it up dimly looks brighter on the camera
at<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.689> send<00:01:48.990> pw<00:01:49.829> m<00:01:49.890> 001<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.570> light<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:51.960> even

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
at you send pw m 001 and a light up even

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
at you send pw m 001 and a light up even
dimmer<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> course<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> send<00:01:55.439> PWM<00:01:56.329> 255

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
dimmer and of course if you send PWM 255

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.219 
dimmer and of course if you send PWM 255
that's<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.229> goes<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> 155<00:01:59.719> m<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.930> liked<00:02:01.110> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that's it goes up to 155 m it liked it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.990 
that's it goes up to 155 m it liked it
up<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.799> bright

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.020 

and<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:09.650> arduino<00:02:10.650> Ethernet<00:02:11.250> shield<00:02:12.020> and
