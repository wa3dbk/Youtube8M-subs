particular<00:01:45.570> one<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.229> don't<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.130> if

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
particular one I don't know if it's if

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.429

the<00:06:08.090> only<00:06:08.300> thing<00:06:08.510> is<00:06:08.630> there's<00:06:08.840> no<00:06:08.930> dividers<00:06:09.830> so

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
the only thing is there's no dividers so

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.290 
the only thing is there's no dividers so
you<00:06:10.460> know<00:06:10.550> that's<00:06:10.700> what<00:06:10.820> I<00:06:10.850> wanted<00:06:11.060> to<00:06:11.150> get

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
you know that's what I wanted to get

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.800 
you know that's what I wanted to get
something<00:06:11.660> with<00:06:11.780> a<00:06:11.810> divider<00:06:12.200> and<00:06:12.590> then

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
something with a divider and then

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.990 
something with a divider and then
there's<00:06:14.810> also<00:06:15.080> this<00:06:15.440> little<00:06:15.740> piece<00:06:16.000> this

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
there's also this little piece this

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.300 
there's also this little piece this
knocked<00:06:17.390> up<00:06:17.630> survival<00:06:18.230> kits<00:06:18.440> it's<00:06:18.830> so<00:06:18.950> kind<00:06:19.190> of

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
knocked up survival kits it's so kind of

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.420 
knocked up survival kits it's so kind of
jokes<00:06:19.550> from<00:06:19.760> the<00:06:19.820> movie<00:06:20.530> and<00:06:21.530> I<00:06:22.250> thought<00:06:22.370> I

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
jokes from the movie and I thought I

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.380 
jokes from the movie and I thought I
could<00:06:22.700> use<00:06:22.730> that<00:06:22.850> because<00:06:23.060> there<00:06:23.240> won't<00:06:23.300> be

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
could use that because there won't be

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.180 
could use that because there won't be
any<00:06:23.540> color<00:06:23.720> transfer<00:06:24.140> which<00:06:24.710> will<00:06:24.860> work<00:06:25.040> out

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
any color transfer which will work out

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.810 
any color transfer which will work out
fine

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
fine

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.879 
fine
again<00:06:26.450> but<00:06:26.900> it's<00:06:27.140> just<00:06:27.380> again<00:06:27.950> no<00:06:28.040> divider

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
again but it's just again no divider

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.610 
again but it's just again no divider
he's<00:06:30.189> crying<00:06:30.430> it's<00:06:30.729> okay<00:06:31.300> let<00:06:31.659> me<00:06:31.750> just<00:06:31.780> throw
