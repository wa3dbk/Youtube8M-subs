00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.360 
operatively and 70 patients treated
non-operatively<00:02:19.720> both<00:02:20.140> groups<00:02:20.530> did<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> same

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
non-operatively both groups did the same

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.720 
non-operatively both groups did the same
interestingly<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:23.020> rear<00:02:23.380> up<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:24.010> rate<00:02:24.250> was

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
interestingly the rear up to rate was

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.990 
interestingly the rear up to rate was
almost<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.720> same<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.460> two<00:02:27.640> groups

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
almost the same in the two groups

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.390 
almost the same in the two groups
however<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.780> complication<00:02:29.680> rate<00:02:29.710> is<00:02:30.190> much

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
however the complication rate is much

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.820 
however the complication rate is much
higher<00:02:30.460> in<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.150> operative<00:02:31.900> group<00:02:32.140> why

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
higher in the operative group why

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.440 
higher in the operative group why
because<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.760> surgical

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
because it's surgical

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.210 
because it's surgical
you<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.020> complications<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.920> surgery
