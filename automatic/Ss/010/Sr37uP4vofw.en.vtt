00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.290
 ground 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.270
 m and frankly I was really great 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.869
 happy because it's really the top 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.760
 from the top 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.930
 I do not know if you are the same I 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.880

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.869
 you share it 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.730
 I know that maybe there are some 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.050
 people who already know since 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.780
 they are as curious as me and who 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.700

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.070
 not so I really wanted to share that 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.989
 with you because I find that it is 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.309

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.210
 five minutes but klaus of duvets and 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.800
 just top 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.940
 before it was a chore for me to 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.710
 put two quilts and now 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.539
 we will say it's almost a pleasure to 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.359
 in quotation marks so here I am going to you 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.370

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.170
 show you how to do it you go 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.269
 see it's really very easy 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.969
 there is nothing complicated in it and 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.950
 honestly I'm sure all 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.290
 women will be happy to have this 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.300
 hint so here do not hesitate to 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.700
 share the video like that a maximum of 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.490
 world will be able to see it and I think that 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.259
 it will please many people so 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.460
 here and if you're interested 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.799
 look at the rest I leave you in 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.500
 company of the demon so here I am doing 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.220
 big ones 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.960
 yes right now so here I am again for 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.540
 so do it so you have to 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.390
 take your duvet upside down it's 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.979
 very important to put your cover 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.660
 quilt upside down then you take 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.410
 both edges and you'll put 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.410
 your duvet cover 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.710
 well flat 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.850
 it is very important that it is well flat 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.979
 to really avoid creases and you 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.440
 go you saw that downstairs you have 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.880
 so the edges to take in the quilt 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.790
 Normally that was really good 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.470
 flat then you will take your 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.600
 quilt your quilt 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.560
 what are you going to do is you 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.670
 go put it over again 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.040
 well flat 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.180
 like you're going to put it on top of 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.300
 the duvet cover does it all 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.300
 simply 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.590
 so here you are really putting a role to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.940
 play another demo but you have to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.730
 it is well flat both actually 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.370
 then you take the edge with the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.250
 duvet cover and the duvet and there 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.760
 you will just start at 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.349
 to roll up had to roll to both 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.349
 together simply 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.870
 here you roll well so there you 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.940
 see I have not much room for 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.950
 show you but I'm going to do my 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.650
 better for you to understand how 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.000
 have to do just so I 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.210
 continues until the bottom wanted in 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.210
 made 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.330
 once you're there you saw you 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.660
 have the edges so there you have 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.210
 opening you normally put your 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.350
 duvet cover 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.040
 alas what are you going to do just 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.670
 it's taking on each side and you 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.670
 go completely back the quilt 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.780
 here you go completely the poet 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.780
 on each side 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.180
 and do the same so on the other side 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:54.769
 always with the opening as you 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.769
 see here and you get all that in 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.310
 so here you find yourself 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.010
 then with a big pole at the bottom all 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.640
 simply 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:15.750
 and there you actually start at prices 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:18.269
 and so you have the edge here so here is 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.060
 you see I'm at I got there 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.109
 and suddenly I just begins 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.109
 simply unfold 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.310
 see it's not complicated it's really 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:36.860
 simple is super fast especially so 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.860
 it's really awesome 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.030
 here you just unfold until 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.340
 low 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.850
 a week is to get there 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:56.320
 you take your quilt and taste in 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:59.710
 do and shake your quilt well 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.710
 quite simply 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.790
 and you see there is really no 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:11.220
 just 2 clicks 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.950
 it's great so that after you 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.200
 put your quilt on the link 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.910
 I just wanted to show you 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.080
 how to do the trick because 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.310
 will say that I have not much room 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.650
 to put the quilt 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.419
 two sides so I can not show you 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.919
 passage of way after that is not 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.430
 complicated you just put your 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.320
 quilt on your bed well flat and 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:43.830
 you shake well and then you go 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:46.190
 have your bet very quickly so 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.190
 here 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.000
 so here's this little tip for 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.620
 put your duvet cover you have 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.740
 seen it's in five minutes 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.729
 frankly it's just top honestly 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.349
 that's why I really wanted 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.139
 to share with you so I recap 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:04.720
 for that would not have understood everything 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.460
 maybe with my gestures and all that is 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.380
 so simple so already to start the 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.509
 duvet cover very important the 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:16.690
 put upside down started then you 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:20.770
 put your comforter over and you 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.270
 always wrap the side where there is no 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.860
 no opening you always wind 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.090
 there what duvet languages ​​on the side 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.560
 but to date there is no opening 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.389
 we can not put the comforter back in 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.009
 in fact so you go all the way 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.050
 you want it to the end and once 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.050
 that you have openings down 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.190
 each side you get it all in fact 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.710
 So you come in the duvet cover 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.300
 and the duvet together and then you 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.370
 have just unrolled with your hands 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.380
 delicately for easter and folds and 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.599
 so that the quilt is really put 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.280
 everywhere in fact so that's it 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:50.530
 really not complicated you saw I 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.449
 realized 105 minutes so here I hope 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.830
 that the little trick will please you all 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.120
 do big kisses and then I tell you 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.199
