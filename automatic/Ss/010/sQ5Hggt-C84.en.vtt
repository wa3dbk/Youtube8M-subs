00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:26.739
 Hi I'm in charge of plants at the Wakayama Prefectural Nature Museum 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.210
 I say that I am not a curator 

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:31.899
 Thank you 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.559
 Relax and relax while watching the scenery here 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.030
 In the corner you can 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.880
 Introducing the waterside plants between Wakayama and the stomata of the waterside plants 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.130
 Display 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.510
 Here Ikeya of Wakayama Prefecture 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.640
 Rice field is good 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 Focusing on the 26-year-old plant growing on the waterside 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.970
 is 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.420
 First of all 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 I will introduce you to which I see 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 Although this is a subtropical fern plant 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.549
 Many in the morning of the rice field that went during the period 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.650
 Though it seems like 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.660
 Reduce income in Wakayama Prefecture 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.440
 Even though growth is confirmed only in 23 places, it is very valuable 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 It is a plant 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.890
 Good with firepower 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.460
 In Tanito Wakayama Prefecture 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.830
 The present talk is writing an appetite as smashing to cash in the name 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 But it will be added in winter 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.840
 But when it comes to spring, it looks like that again 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.480
 There is a sprout that has been sprinkled and it spreads the difference again 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.040
 You will be shown a healthy figure every year like this 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.250
 All of you here, there are a lot of four leaf scrubbers. 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.100
 I can hear the sound 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.149
 This is 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.409
 Previous day large 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.690
 Say 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.579
 Flyer will be an individual companion 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.979
 It is said that the electromagnetic touch is famous and added 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.060
 Rice fields There are lots of rice fields 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.030
 What 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.250
 So I felt that the appearance of the vanilla oysters was aboard 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.749
 From where you can see 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.899
 The name was given to reality because of disguising the environment 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.250
 It was a plant that is usually seen in rice fields 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:33.999
 Those 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.979
 Weak in pesticides 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.999
 Unfortunately there is a teacher and this time in Wakayama prefecture 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.729
 I can not see it so much and I'm not extinct 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.729
 It is a plant considered to be kana 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.519
 In this tank 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.950
 Plants really show their war companions in the visible range 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.000
 Seascape is different from Carriso 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.450
 Start from the bottom of one continent 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.249
 Back in the sea again 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.639
 It will be a plant of a little strange person that you said 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.529
 During this war 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:14.809
 Aman too 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:16.029
 Even small rain 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.220
 I am in the sea 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.139
 In addition, after the upper house election 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.139
 We display growing up 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.909
 After all I would like to explain, for example 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.399
 It is raining to see in the back 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.900
 What rise of him 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.729
 Wonderfully 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.680
 In the plant with the sex buds 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.819
 Maybe when I went to the beach 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.819
 You may be able to find 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.900
 Even if there is a difference in the rain pattern seen in the foreground and there are plants, it is also rain 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.320
 This is 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.270
 A musical wave with a shallow depth of water 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.270
 Growing up in something 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.489
 And the market and face of the sedan seen in the foremost 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.539
 I am doing 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.459
 Make it a step 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.209
 It looks very cute how she is expanding SKYPER directly 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.189
 is not it 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.309
 These plants have good leaves with Mario motor 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:24.219
 A very valuable home of small fish and creatures 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:27.340
 I am making an ecosystem 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.289
 Wakayama where such an ecosystem is seen 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.279
 The environment is very limited and will last forever 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.909
 I think it is something I want to leave
