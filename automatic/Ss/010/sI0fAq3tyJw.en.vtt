the stick and then we're just going to
set<00:02:58.840> our<00:02:58.930> module<00:02:59.319> back<00:02:59.560> down<00:03:08.579> we'll<00:03:09.579> take<00:03:09.730> our

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
set our module back down we'll take our

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.360 
set our module back down we'll take our
two<00:03:10.120> screws<00:03:10.420> replace<00:03:11.200> them<00:03:11.620> back<00:03:11.799> in<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.100> LED
