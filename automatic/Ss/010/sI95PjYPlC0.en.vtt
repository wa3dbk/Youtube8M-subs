00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.489
 you choose a water filter can not 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.489
 figure out which one is better 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:09.799
 we will carry out comparative tests 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.579
 take the usual phytor and twitter aquaphor and 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.579
 missed polluted water through them 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.239
 the result is amazing 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.570
 are the filters so different 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.310
 you think this fox definitely 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.090
 but what is the new region of magicians on 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.230
 clean water turns uk 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.240
 filter differ not only design 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.410
 the main and third of the levada himself 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.800
 filtering mod 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.270
 filters not only work differently 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 but also sound differently 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.430
 is this the secret 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.710
 let's look inside the module 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.370
 in the normal filter we see the usual 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.670
 granulated sorbent conman row 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.480
 Tuesday sanctions mixtures 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.500
 bonded with special fiber 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.520
 ak of valencia when flowing through 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.620
 ordinary module water traces bonfire 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.060
 pushes and fastened between 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.630
 sorbent particles and moves 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.950
 on formed channels without due 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.910
 cleaning 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.420
 4 3 from platforms 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.299
 fiber holding the pellet 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.069
 not letting them move and 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.670
 form channels 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.650
 result 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.530
 high-quality cleaning 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.799
 what is this amazing fiber 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:37.790
 were buying 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.620
 alpha years 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.730
 this is modern fibrous all 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.870
 paid and it is excellent material 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.830
 using its filters aqua ford gives 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.930
 four important prefects 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.180
 statistical 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.280
 chemical 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.840
 microbiological 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.730
 synergistic 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.140
 compared to ordinary 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.880
 granulated sorbents 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.770
 from valencia has a huge area 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.490
 surface 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.670
 unique material geometry a 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700
 hence high speed 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.800
 deletion 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.830
 main chemical weapons useful 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.599
 special hill from now on complexes 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.650
 Hill's name is now derived from 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.659
 greek ppc archive superfluous these chemical 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.510
 pickers are specially tuned to 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.439
 grip and hold heavy 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.510
 metals with this selectivity as 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.700
 boots in relation to them 800 times higher than 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.259
 calcium and magnesium 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.159
 therefore, aqua lena recognizes and 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.239
 selectively absorbs heavy 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.679
 metals at any salt concentration 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.299
 stiffness 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.430
 due to special chemical properties 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.729
 aqua lena 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.479
 the original method became possible 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.819
 silver dynamic fixation for 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.019
 gain bactericidal come out 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.819
 silver is rooted here is balenko in the most 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.559
 active and he's all sport 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:52.529
 it allows significantly 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:53.879
 increase efficiency 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.189
 anti bacteria filter 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.419
 at the general decrease in the content of silver 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.949
 what corresponds 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.439
 European sanitary 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.199
 hygiene standards 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.639
 but the main thing is that when you combine the collapse 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.409
 us granular sorbents 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.579
 arises synergistic 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.859
 the effect that is obtained 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.439
 sorption mixtures are unique 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.930
 properties will not bring 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.759
 fi source company 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.589
 in conventional filters there are two problems 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:22.259
 firstly they can not use small 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.849
 sorbent 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.170
 their resistance to water flow too 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.900
 great 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.579
 and the water just won't flow through the filter 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.319
 and secondly never nothing 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.299
 reinforced particles 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.449
 move around like that 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.749
 a channel is formed through which water 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.569
 proceeds without proper stripping 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.289
 all players are aqua ford shadow play mesh from 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.149
 fiber roll off provides 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:46.010
 even distribution of water 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.920
 Indian hydrodynamic 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.840
 resistance 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 it allows you to use more 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.919
 fine sorbent 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.499
 which improves the quality of the report 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.339
 besides, it is the aqua fiber combination 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.979
 tapes and granules powdered 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.849
 success prevents occurrence 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.889
 channel effect 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.689
 fibers felted 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.939
 in the soil securely fix the guard 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.159
 does not allow him to move 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.309
 as a result of cleansing may water contacts 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.789
 from all over the area with Sarkozy 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.519
 summarize 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.479
 in platform filters this 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.029
 lack of channel effect 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.749
 high speed removal brought 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.359
 effective removal of heavy metals with 

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:29.120
 any concentration of hardness salts 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.139
 active silver in accordance with 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.830
 European requirements 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.800
 standards 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.430
 crystal clear water
