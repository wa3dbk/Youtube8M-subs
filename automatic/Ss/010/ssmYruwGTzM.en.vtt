the half hitch to walk it off

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.760 
the half hitch to walk it off
same<00:01:55.070> thing<00:01:55.280> on<00:01:55.370> this<00:01:55.490> side<00:01:57.340> around<00:01:59.770> back

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
your loose ends you're going to come

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.820 
your loose ends you're going to come
over<00:02:08.510> to<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.990> side<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.230> started<00:02:09.710> with

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
over to the side you started with

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.010 
over to the side you started with
because<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.790> purpose<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.330> Swiss<00:02:11.600> seat<00:02:11.810> is

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
because the purpose of a Swiss seat is

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.580 
because the purpose of a Swiss seat is
to<00:02:12.830> tie<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.190> knot<00:02:13.460> away<00:02:13.910> from<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:15.380> side

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
to tie the knot away from the side

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.930 
to tie the knot away from the side
you're<00:02:15.800> going<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.950> be<00:02:16.100> actually<00:02:16.280> rappelling

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
you're going to be actually rappelling

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.180 
you're going to be actually rappelling
with<00:02:17.060> or<00:02:17.300> your<00:02:17.510> brake<00:02:17.780> hand<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.860> going<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.070> be

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
with or your brake hand it's going to be

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.560 
with or your brake hand it's going to be
putting<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.550> rope<00:02:19.790> around<00:02:19.940> at<00:02:20.240> your<00:02:20.300> side

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
putting that rope around at your side

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.450 
putting that rope around at your side
you<00:02:20.810> don't<00:02:21.350> want<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.590> have<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.830> knot<00:02:21.980> on<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
you don't want to have the knot on the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.700 
you don't want to have the knot on the
side<00:02:22.670> with<00:02:22.880> your<00:02:23.000> brake<00:02:23.210> hand<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:24.350> that's<00:02:24.470> why

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
side with your brake hand so that's why

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.760 
side with your brake hand so that's why
we<00:02:24.890> created<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.960> one<00:02:26.960> side<00:02:27.230> being<00:02:27.440> longer

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
we created that one side being longer

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.390 
we created that one side being longer
than<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> other<00:02:28.190> side<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.440> all<00:02:30.770> you're<00:02:31.310> going

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
than the other side so all you're going

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.990 
than the other side so all you're going
to<00:02:31.490> do<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:31.850> side<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.210> tie<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> square<00:02:32.690> knot

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.080 

now<00:02:38.000> once<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.300> have<00:02:38.330> your<00:02:38.570> square<00:02:38.720> knot

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
now once you have your square knot

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.390 
now once you have your square knot
you're<00:02:41.090> going<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.300> lock<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.570> off<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.160> half

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
you're going to lock it off with a half

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:53.010 
you're going to lock it off with a half
hitch<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:44.780> each<00:02:44.900> side

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.980 

once<00:02:53.620> you're<00:02:53.740> square<00:02:54.010> nuts<00:02:54.190> locked<00:02:54.430> off<00:02:54.990> you

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
once you're square nuts locked off you

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.150 
once you're square nuts locked off you
have<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.200> meat<00:02:56.380> of<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.650> rappelling<00:02:57.130> harness

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
have the meat of the rappelling harness

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.080 
have the meat of the rappelling harness
here<00:02:59.220> all<00:03:00.220> that's<00:03:00.370> left<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.610> do<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:00.910> add<00:03:01.060> a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
here all that's left to do is add a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.560 
here all that's left to do is add a
carabiner<00:03:01.620> when<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.710> add<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.950> carabiner

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
carabiner when you add the carabiner

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.880 
carabiner when you add the carabiner
you're<00:03:04.570> going<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.780> come<00:03:04.960> through<00:03:05.230> both<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.710> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
you're going to come through both of the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.890 
you're going to come through both of the
sections<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.430> rope<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:07.150> first<00:03:07.390> part<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.690> you

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
sections of rope the first part that you

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.050 
sections of rope the first part that you
twisted<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.440> start<00:03:08.710> it<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:08.980> then<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.700> second

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
twisted to start it and then the second

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.960 
twisted to start it and then the second
part<00:03:10.180> which<00:03:10.360> wrapped<00:03:10.630> around<00:03:11.670> now<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.700> want

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
part which wrapped around now you want

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.250 
part which wrapped around now you want
the<00:03:13.060> locking<00:03:13.420> portion<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.870> carabiner

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the locking portion of the carabiner

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.920 
the locking portion of the carabiner
facing<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:16.480> when<00:03:16.630> you're<00:03:16.780> actually

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
facing you just so when you're actually

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.590 
facing you just so when you're actually
using<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.620> rope<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.920> rappel<00:03:18.280> from<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.790> rope

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
using the rope to rappel from the rope

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.000 
using the rope to rappel from the rope
doesn't<00:03:19.810> get<00:03:20.050> in<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.260> way<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.680> locking

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
doesn't get in the way of the locking

doesn't get in the way of the locking
portion<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.460> carabiner<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.060> remember<00:03:22.810> to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
portion the carabiner and remember to

portion the carabiner and remember to
screw<00:03:23.170> down<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.800> you<00:03:23.860> don't<00:03:24.010> screw<00:03:24.250> up

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
screw down so you don't screw up

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.320 
screw down so you don't screw up
and<00:03:25.810> there<00:03:25.960> you<00:03:26.110> have<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.730> modified<00:03:27.730> rappelling

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
and there you have a modified rappelling

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.440 
and there you have a modified rappelling
harness<00:03:28.560> or<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.620> swiss<00:03:30.040> see<00:03:30.360> thanks<00:03:31.360> for
