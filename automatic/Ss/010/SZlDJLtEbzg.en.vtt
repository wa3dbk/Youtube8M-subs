00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.720
 DVD review and really good fight 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 choreographer is a modern one 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.160
 Film sometimes sown very few, but 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.450
 especially in the case of today go 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.280
 you should do that pretty much 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.030
 splendid and have me very much 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.379
 blown away 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.379
 this is haywire today 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.260
 haywire tomorrow because the same title and 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.850
 I hope the film does not mean I have 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.160
 but not quite sure is from the year 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.660
 In 2012 and directed by steven 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.950
 soderbergh the among themselves 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.320
 responsible for the 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.879
 Committee movies as well as mondag magic 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.190
 Mike in the cinema tells the story 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.720
 story of the agent mallory kane die 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.070
 not working for a secret service 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.879
 but from a private company 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.830
 hired and at the beginning of the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.300
 Films in a diner descending during 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.409
 another supplements she visits 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.080
 do not really know if the two 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.729
 together for each other 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.290
 it really comes to one 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.210
 not worth seeing exchange 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.799
 manages to escape plays one 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.210
 dare and take a hostage tells the 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.100
 geisel then retroactively the story 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.080
 what happened to her is the movie 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.340
 then later jump back in and now 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.869
 So the story tells one more story 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.390
 very funny chronology here 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.810
 is told and an action 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.159
 Agent thriller their first line 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.630
 this has incredibly good fighting scenes 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.909
 not a main actress gina carano 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.950
 the former martial arts 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.050
 Fighter is and you can see that here 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.910
 which makes for a figure is unique 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.770
 looks authentic and not over the top 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.080
 not too much contrary to physical 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.390
 legitimacy and that's why 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.580
 pretty big class on the other 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.320
 you have to say that's it 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.090
 that's why the best thing about the movie is you 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.560
 from soderbergh disappointed because the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.210
 real action is not so 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.600
 unbelievably exciting when i'm honest 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.430
 am 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.260
 and some scenes or scenes of persecution 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.450
 mars the aim is that in the length 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.520
 I almost lost from fan from above 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.370
 during the film and that 's right 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.050
 that was a pity and therefore more 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.520
 interest really zwiegespalten 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.380
 within this film and that despite 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.240
 a deadly cast to ours 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.130
 actual main actors gina carano 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.509
 is by far the least known 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.909
 because she is still supplemented by 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.709
 actors like ewan mcgregor michael 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.670
 that michael bassier schelling tate 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.610
 on the Internet 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.989
 paxton and some more great cars 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.580
 where you really ask shit 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.200
 Damn it so much out of it 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.209
 can and does not have a film 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.380
 done and thus haywire is a movie of 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.940
 leaves me very disappointed 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.739
 I definitely do not see a second time 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.020
 But I have to say that too 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.810
 each of the good and handmade action 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.459
 wants to see who is really physical and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.370
 without explosion and all the great ones 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.080
 the pattern gets back to the movie 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.660
 grab this because you rarely see it here 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.640
 So incredible strength packed in like that 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.519
 Unfortunately many of God's weaknesses are weakening 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.750
 that this film me agency instead 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.300
 to be honest for me he gets 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.069
 film was too long as an action agent 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.260
 he then as an action thriller world 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.670
 works best after all 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.540
 acceptable six out of ten possible 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.340
 points 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.900
 after all, he still gets 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.580
 a rating that actually ok 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.049
 but it sounds me because as I said one 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.150
 he has not been so disappointed with film 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.830
 really bad but he is too 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.000
 franz far from good and that makes 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.370
 four out of ten possible points 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.480
 Overall , the movie was never heard 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.580
 he just clicks the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.350
 trailer over here tomorrow at 15 o'clock 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.610
 see you again, of course, let me 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.780
 at the mother there if the video right 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.720
 bad economy on facebook over 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.790
 and otherwise I hope you are tomorrow 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.790
 of course again at 3
