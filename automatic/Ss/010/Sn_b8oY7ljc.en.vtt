00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
here's a little sneak peek so we're

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.880 
here's a little sneak peek so we're
playing<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:33.090> headquarters<00:00:33.899> pro<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.410> trailer

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
playing some headquarters pro on trailer

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
playing some headquarters pro on trailer
park<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.520> pretty<00:00:36.239> much<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.630> smallest

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
park which is pretty much the smallest

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.250 
park which is pretty much the smallest
map<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> map<00:00:38.100> pack<00:00:38.600> but<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.660> might<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
map and the map pack but it might be the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
map and the map pack but it might be the
smallest<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.550> probably<00:00:41.940> one

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
smallest one but it's it's probably one

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
smallest one but it's it's probably one
of<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.210> favorites<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.989> think<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.860> it's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
of my favorites it is I think it's it's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.069 
of my favorites it is I think it's it's
a<00:00:44.579> very<00:00:44.730> balanced<00:00:45.180> map<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.660> got<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> lot<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
a very balanced map it's got a lot of

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.889 
a very balanced map it's got a lot of
little<00:00:46.260> tight<00:00:46.620> routes<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:48.270> um<00:00:48.539> it's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
little tight routes and it's um it's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.600 
little tight routes and it's um it's
great<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.230> UMP<00:00:49.680> work<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.070> even<00:00:50.340> great<00:00:50.579> for

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
great for UMP work it's even great for

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
great for UMP work it's even great for
snipers<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.420> sniped<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.410> this

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
snipers I sniped a little bit on this

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.729 
snipers I sniped a little bit on this
map<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.879> pulling<00:00:54.180> off<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.440> kill

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
map and I was pulling off you know kill

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.610 
map and I was pulling off you know kill
feeds<00:00:56.010> left<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> right<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.379> it's<00:00:58.379> just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
feeds left and right and it's just

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.709 
feeds left and right and it's just
really<00:00:58.890> good<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.000> spawn<00:01:00.270> points<00:01:00.600> are

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
really good because the spawn points are

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
really good because the spawn points are
kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> together<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.590> when<00:01:02.550> people<00:01:02.670> spawn

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
kind of together or when people spawn

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.729 
kind of together or when people spawn
they<00:01:03.270> spawn<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.840> area<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.229> close<00:01:04.409> together

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
they spawn in one area it close together

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.429 
they spawn in one area it close together
so<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.610> map<00:01:05.850> once<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> feel

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so this map once I don't know I feel

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
so this map once I don't know I feel
like<00:01:07.500> spawn<00:01:07.979> camping<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.520> gonna<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
like spawn camping is gonna be kind of a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.310 
like spawn camping is gonna be kind of a
threat<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:09.990> game<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> map<00:01:11.700> but

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
threat for this game or for this map but

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
threat for this game or for this map but
so<00:01:13.320> far<00:01:13.560> I've<00:01:13.830> enjoyed<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:15.210> done

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
so far I've enjoyed it and I've done

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.690 
so far I've enjoyed it and I've done
really<00:01:15.960> well<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.890> far<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> really

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
really well on it so far so I really

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
really well on it so far so I really
can't<00:01:17.880> complain<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.920> right<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.070> where<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
can't complain and right there where you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.460 
can't complain and right there where you
saw<00:01:20.520> us<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.790> spawn<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> major<00:01:22.080> spawn

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
saw us all spawn that is a major spawn

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
saw us all spawn that is a major spawn
point<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.950> side<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> map<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.729> I

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
point for that side of the map like I

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
point for that side of the map like I
feel<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.140> there's<00:01:25.140> maybe<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.619> or<00:01:25.740> two<00:01:25.770> spawn

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
feel like there's maybe one or two spawn

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
feel like there's maybe one or two spawn
points<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> main<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.570> major<00:01:27.780> one

points and that's the main the major one

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.469 
points and that's the main the major one

I think this map was perfect for capture
the<00:01:50.490> flag<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.049> I'm<00:01:52.049> not<00:01:52.259> sure<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> know

check out those videos as well because
every<00:02:48.630> map<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.050> different<00:02:49.470> every<00:02:49.740> map<00:02:49.920> has<00:02:50.160> its

every map is different every map has its

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.000 
every map is different every map has its
you<00:02:50.520> know<00:02:50.610> own<00:02:50.850> unique<00:02:51.710> kind<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.740> playing

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
you know own unique kind of playing

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.610 
you know own unique kind of playing
style<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.810> kind<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.870> put<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.230> put

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
style that you can kind of put in put

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.540 
style that you can kind of put in put
forth<00:02:55.890> into<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
forth into it

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.930 
forth into it
and<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:57.360> think<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:57.960> great<00:02:58.140> actually<00:02:58.760> as<00:02:59.760> I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
and I think it's great actually as I

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.720 
and I think it's great actually as I
almost<00:03:00.090> kill<00:03:00.330> myself<00:03:00.690> right<00:03:00.870> here<00:03:00.900> with<00:03:01.140> this

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
almost kill myself right here with this

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.070 
almost kill myself right here with this
that<00:03:02.730> would<00:03:02.850> have<00:03:02.940> been<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> major<00:03:03.360> fail<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.020> I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
that would have been a major fail and I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.110 
that would have been a major fail and I
probably<00:03:04.610> wouldn't<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.700> put<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.000> on

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
probably wouldn't have put that on

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.350 
probably wouldn't have put that on
YouTube<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.750> might<00:03:07.680> think<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.980> right<00:03:08.160> here<00:03:08.520> yeah

at<00:05:42.900> least<00:05:43.080> this<00:05:43.260> one<00:05:43.470> and<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:44.460> started<00:05:44.970> just

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
at least this one and I started just

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.820 
at least this one and I started just
playing<00:05:45.330> really<00:05:45.810> well<00:05:45.930> I<00:05:46.110> started<00:05:46.470> getting<00:05:46.800> a

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
playing really well I started getting a

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.950 
playing really well I started getting a
lot<00:05:46.949> of<00:05:47.010> kill<00:05:47.340> streaks<00:05:47.639> because<00:05:47.789> I<00:05:48.180> knew<00:05:48.810> where

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
lot of kill streaks because I knew where

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.029 
lot of kill streaks because I knew where
they<00:05:49.050> were<00:05:49.139> gonna<00:05:49.229> be<00:05:49.500> here<00:05:49.710> I<00:05:49.740> knew<00:05:49.919> where

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
they were gonna be here I knew where

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.560 
they were gonna be here I knew where
they<00:05:50.130> were<00:05:50.190> coming<00:05:50.490> from<00:05:50.669> ro<00:05:50.970> or<00:05:51.150> I<00:05:51.210> knew

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
they were coming from ro or I knew

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.089 
they were coming from ro or I knew
exactly<00:05:51.720> where<00:05:52.139> they<00:05:52.289> couldn't<00:05:52.620> come<00:05:52.830> from

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
exactly where they couldn't come from

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.460 
exactly where they couldn't come from
because<00:05:53.820> I<00:05:53.880> knew<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.300> knew<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.720> routes<00:05:54.960> and<00:05:55.349> I

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
because I knew I knew the routes and I

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.490 
because I knew I knew the routes and I
kind<00:05:55.710> of<00:05:55.770> knew<00:05:56.010> my<00:05:56.130> position<00:05:56.610> on<00:05:56.699> the<00:05:56.789> map<00:05:56.970> and

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
kind of knew my position on the map and

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.230 
kind of knew my position on the map and
this<00:05:58.500> map<00:05:58.560> is<00:05:58.770> probably<00:05:59.280> larger<00:06:00.000> than<00:06:00.030> you

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
this map is probably larger than you

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.689 
this map is probably larger than you
guys<00:06:00.389> think<00:06:01.010> there's<00:06:02.010> actually<00:06:02.310> some<00:06:02.460> back
