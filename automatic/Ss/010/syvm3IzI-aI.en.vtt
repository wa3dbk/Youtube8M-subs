well me and my crew guys we build these

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.130 
well me and my crew guys we build these
cars<00:00:19.759> in<00:00:19.970> Corona<00:00:20.150> now<00:00:20.720> we<00:00:20.779> have<00:00:20.960> a<00:00:20.989> new

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
cars in Corona now we have a new

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.809 
cars in Corona now we have a new
facility<00:00:21.289> there<00:00:21.800> which<00:00:22.070> is<00:00:22.249> responsible<00:00:22.789> for

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:22.819 
facility there which is responsible for

suspension brakes wheels tires it's a

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.340 
suspension brakes wheels tires it's a
whole<00:00:34.609> new<00:00:34.760> automobile<00:00:35.239> but<00:00:35.870> based<00:00:36.079> on<00:00:36.230> the

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
whole new automobile but based on the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.090 
whole new automobile but based on the
Corvette<00:00:36.500> platform<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:37.879> we<00:00:38.149> retain<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.100> the

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
Corvette platform so we retain the the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.830 
Corvette platform so we retain the the
benefit<00:00:40.489> of<00:00:40.609> starting<00:00:41.149> with<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.449> car<00:00:41.660> that's

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
benefit of starting with a car that's

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.720 
benefit of starting with a car that's
well<00:00:42.050> developed<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:42.739> certified<00:00:43.519> and

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
well developed and certified and

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.270 
well developed and certified and
warrantied<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:44.989> we<00:00:45.079> just<00:00:45.289> make<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:45.469> what<00:00:46.160> we

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
warrantied and we just make it what we

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.619 
warrantied and we just make it what we
think<00:00:46.519> it<00:00:46.609> should<00:00:46.640> be<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:47.089> know<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.269> got<00:00:47.539> to

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
think it should be you know you got to

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.509 
think it should be you know you got to
figure<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.050> Corvette<00:00:48.469> platform<00:00:49.039> is<00:00:49.219> probably

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
figure the Corvette platform is probably

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.579 
figure the Corvette platform is probably
the<00:00:49.670> biggest<00:00:50.000> bang<00:00:50.210> for<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.629> buck<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:51.079> the

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
the biggest bang for the buck on the

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.360 
the biggest bang for the buck on the
planet<00:00:52.129> begin<00:00:52.910> with<00:00:53.179> and<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.170> what<00:00:54.829> sort<00:00:55.249> of

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
planet begin with and so what sort of

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.119 
planet begin with and so what sort of
mods<00:00:55.640> have<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.210> done<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:57.129> supercharged

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
mods have you done to this supercharged

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.889 
mods have you done to this supercharged
well<00:00:58.579> it's<00:00:58.760> supercharged<00:00:59.329> but<00:00:59.480> it's<00:00:59.629> also<00:00:59.780> a

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
well it's supercharged but it's also a

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.989 
well it's supercharged but it's also a
hand-built<00:01:00.440> engine<00:01:00.859> by<00:01:01.190> our<00:01:01.399> facility<00:01:01.909> in

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
hand-built engine by our facility in

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.810 
hand-built engine by our facility in
Connecticut<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.530> it's<00:01:03.679> a<00:01:03.710> 6.2<00:01:04.250> liter<00:01:04.460> but

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
Connecticut so it's a 6.2 liter but

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.570 
Connecticut so it's a 6.2 liter but
lower<00:01:05.510> compression<00:01:05.930> than<00:01:06.350> original<00:01:06.830> forged

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
lower compression than original forged

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.200 
lower compression than original forged
internals<00:01:08.170> forged<00:01:09.170> pistons<00:01:09.970> which<00:01:10.970> allows

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
internals forged pistons which allows

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.670 
internals forged pistons which allows
you<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.390> run<00:01:11.540> more<00:01:11.720> manifold<00:01:12.140> pressure<00:01:12.380> with<00:01:12.650> a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
you to run more manifold pressure with a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.770 
you to run more manifold pressure with a
supercharger<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:13.670> running<00:01:13.850> at<00:01:13.970> about<00:01:14.060> 10<00:01:14.330> psi

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
supercharger so running at about 10 psi

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.030 
supercharger so running at about 10 psi
makes<00:01:15.170> 650<00:01:15.770> horsepower<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:17.680> 600<00:01:18.680> pound<00:01:18.860> feet

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
makes 650 horsepower and 600 pound feet

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.570 
makes 650 horsepower and 600 pound feet
of<00:01:19.070> torque

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
of torque

our<00:01:39.020> facility<00:01:39.470> in<00:01:39.560> Germany

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
our facility in Germany

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.190 
our facility in Germany
it's<00:01:40.520> our<00:01:40.610> third<00:01:40.760> facility<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:41.930> this<00:01:42.050> is

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
it's our third facility so this is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.940 
it's our third facility so this is
International<00:01:43.010> by<00:01:43.160> snow<00:01:43.460> periscope<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.950> so

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
International by snow periscope and so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.860 
International by snow periscope and so
you<00:01:46.010> pick<00:01:46.250> everything<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.910> four<00:01:47.690> months

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
you pick everything and four months

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.180 
you pick everything and four months
later<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.200> get<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.350> car<00:01:48.560> back<00:01:48.770> that's<00:01:49.010> built

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
later you get a car back that's built

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.010 
later you get a car back that's built
for<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.790> it's<00:01:50.240> about<00:01:50.720> as<00:01:50.900> good

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
for you and it's about as good

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.630 
for you and it's about as good
performance<00:01:51.500> as<00:01:51.620> you<00:01:51.680> can<00:01:51.800> get<00:01:51.980> in<00:01:52.160> any<00:01:52.280> street

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
performance as you can get in any street
