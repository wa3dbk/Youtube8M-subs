00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.090
 on the playstation in the back corner 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.730
 There was of course one again 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.440
 savvy the game and yes I would 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.390
 let's just jump in here 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.710
 there is still the game for people 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.480
 does not know the series do not know 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.910
 again no hint to the control 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.670
 Of course, it does not take off so ins 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.440
 game starts and three different ones 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.770
 level are prepared for us here 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.600
 have to look now 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.640
 and I would say we jump clean 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.650
 let's go raymond is back 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.930
 having already been very popular rayman 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.180
 origins is now in the next round 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.210
 raymond legions, like its predecessor 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.440
 a 2d sidescroller adventure football 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.479
 it goes into the deep 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.880
 by the three-dimensionally held 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.800
 backgrounds create new perspectives 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.320
 you even deeper in the frame 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.119
 immerse yourself in the new jump'n'run 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.160
 highlight offers the player as always 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.840
 crisp puzzles a challenge 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.640
 your skill funny 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.000
 music passages and of course 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.860
 Crunchy battles against nasty monsters 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.369
 revelations will be for the ps3 xbox 360 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.240
 wii and playstation vita appear 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.100
 in content, the differences 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.320
 not different versions except that 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.330
 in the vita version a few more levels 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.250
 are included 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.540
 so that was just people on the now 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.920
 level what we just played but 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.610
 There are two more that we have 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 can play 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.530
 once a fat endboss level and 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.030
 a music label that one already has 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 but that's what everyone is looking for 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.390
 I'm hoping for a lot of fun 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.409
 that you just take in this music 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.409
 level will be cool in any case 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.160
 He comes back from the music label 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.900
 mariachis madness has brought me back 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
 but of course hard to get out of this 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.890
 proper timing always apply 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.390
 we're going to the third level right now 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.950
 what you can play with a fat one 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.100
 endboss let's see if we are that far 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.940
 come and go here anyway 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.770
 again neat to the point 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.090
 Here we see again the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.990
 different levels with those here 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.990
 is played so 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:03:04.660
 I'm curious what to expect 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:06.310
 and you're more accurate by the way 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.960
 looks also discovered other unis often 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.460
 play in raymond legends like to 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.960
 Example elements of the splinter cell 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.270
 series crisp site selection fats 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.130
 boss fights tough music and not 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.900
 finally the unmistakable raymond 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.030
 Humor can be as usual in the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.490
 single player or in co-op mode with bis 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.450
 to 4 on the eu also five friends 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.150
 be experienced 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.660
 rayman origins will be released on 29 august 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.590
 this year for ps3 xbox 360 and the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.590
 playstation vita 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.790
 so I'm back outside three levels 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.980
 played through by the new raymond 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.470
 Legends and a lot of fun 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.540
 it has everything the music has 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.370
 I really enjoyed it and also the 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.840
 other mission but one has to say 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.489
 So quite crisp from 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.650
 Schwierigkeitsgrad her so you can with 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.269
 spend a lot of time playing 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.140
 And it is worthwhile in any case one 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.400
 to risk a look 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.400
 the new revelations
