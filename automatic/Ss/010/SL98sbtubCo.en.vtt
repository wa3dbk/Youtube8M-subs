want<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.080> go<00:01:53.170> smoothly<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.860> wanted<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.280> be

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
want to go smoothly I wanted to be

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.000 
want to go smoothly I wanted to be
rugged<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:55.060> throw<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.420> car<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.590> see<00:01:56.830> how

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
rugged and throw the car in to see how

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.630 
rugged and throw the car in to see how
it<00:01:57.160> felt<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:58.620> like<00:01:59.620> that<00:01:59.650> corner<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.310> see<00:02:00.430> da<00:02:00.580> I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
it felt I like that corner you see da I

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.310 
it felt I like that corner you see da I
went<00:02:01.000> off<00:02:01.120> I<00:02:01.300> followed<00:02:01.630> him<00:02:01.690> then<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.080> dirt

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
went off I followed him then the dirt

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.790 
went off I followed him then the dirt
drag<00:02:02.620> me<00:02:02.770> off<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.920> circuit<00:02:04.200> before<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.410> look<00:02:05.650> my

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
drag me off the circuit before I look my

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.490 
drag me off the circuit before I look my
breaks<00:02:06.040> into<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.430> final<00:02:06.700> corner<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.990> again

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
breaks into this final corner and again

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.530 
breaks into this final corner and again
got<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.130> all<00:02:09.310> wrong<00:02:09.340> but<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.030> doesn't<00:02:10.360> matter

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
got that all wrong but it doesn't matter

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.530 
got that all wrong but it doesn't matter
that's<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.080> first<00:02:11.320> lap<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.180> again<00:02:13.180> just

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
that's the first lap and again just

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.630 
that's the first lap and again just
testing<00:02:14.440> each<00:02:14.590> car<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.070> know<00:02:15.190> one<00:02:15.430> thing<00:02:15.580> I

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
testing each car you know one thing I

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.980 
testing each car you know one thing I
have<00:02:15.790> found<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.150> each<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.540> cars<00:02:16.780> do

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
have found is that each of the cars do

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.210 
have found is that each of the cars do
have<00:02:17.200> very<00:02:17.380> different<00:02:17.920> handling

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
have very different handling

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.950 
have very different handling
characteristics<00:02:18.550> they<00:02:19.180> show<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.600> demo

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
characteristics they show on this demo

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.350 
characteristics they show on this demo
so<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.590> might<00:02:20.980> learn<00:02:21.490> breaking<00:02:21.970> points<00:02:22.270> in

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
so you might learn breaking points in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.660 
so you might learn breaking points in
one<00:02:22.540> car<00:02:22.780> go<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.350> another<00:02:23.650> car<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.220> then

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
one car go to another car and then

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.250 
one car go to another car and then
handles<00:02:25.450> completely<00:02:25.780> differently<00:02:26.080> you're

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
handles completely differently you're

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.870 
handles completely differently you're
breaking<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.620> different<00:02:26.860> point<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.550> I'll<00:02:27.760> try

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
breaking a different point so I'll try

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.580 
breaking a different point so I'll try
and<00:02:28.030> resist<00:02:28.270> off<00:02:28.510> again<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.170> trying<00:02:29.470> with

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
and resist off again and trying with

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.490 
and resist off again and trying with
assists<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.130> I'd<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.610> try<00:02:30.760> with<00:02:31.030> both

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
assists on I'd like to try with both

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.220 
assists on I'd like to try with both
just<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.650> see<00:02:32.860> what<00:02:33.360> what<00:02:34.360> experience<00:02:35.020> they

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
just to see what what experience they

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.040 
just to see what what experience they
can<00:02:35.530> offer<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:36.520> know<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.820> turning<00:02:37.660> assists

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
can offer you know the turning assists

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.140 
can offer you know the turning assists
offer<00:02:38.200> obviously<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.190> brings<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.700> game<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:40.000> life

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
offer obviously it brings a game to life

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.240 
offer obviously it brings a game to life
it<00:02:40.390> offers<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:40.810> much<00:02:41.020> more<00:02:41.080> dynamic<00:02:41.470> sort<00:02:42.190> of

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
it offers so much more dynamic sort of

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.310 
it offers so much more dynamic sort of
physics<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.760> handling<00:02:43.120> if<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.360> like<00:02:43.570> turn<00:02:44.170> it

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
physics and handling if you like turn it

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.900 
physics and handling if you like turn it
on<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.770> it's<00:02:45.160> still<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.340> lot<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.489> fun<00:02:45.730> actually

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
on and it's still a lot of fun actually

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.280 
on and it's still a lot of fun actually
I<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.660> meet<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.160> weave<00:02:48.160> assists<00:02:48.520> on<00:02:49.290> it's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
I have to meet the weave assists on it's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.920 
I have to meet the weave assists on it's
a<00:02:50.350> lot<00:02:50.500> more<00:02:50.530> fun<00:02:50.770> than<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:52.209> three<00:02:52.660> build

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
a lot more fun than the the three build

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.870 
a lot more fun than the the three build
which<00:02:53.170> was<00:02:53.350> quite<00:02:53.530> limited<00:02:54.070> for<00:02:54.280> people<00:02:54.670> just

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
which was quite limited for people just

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.680 
which was quite limited for people just
to<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:55.989> as<00:02:56.110> easy<00:02:56.260> as<00:02:56.440> possible<00:02:57.030> ji<00:02:58.030> he<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.480> not

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
to be as easy as possible ji he is not

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.010 
to be as easy as possible ji he is not
complete<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.290> ignore<00:02:59.620> that

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
complete so ignore that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.500 
complete so ignore that
that<00:03:01.650> still<00:03:01.920> were<00:03:02.070> being<00:03:02.370> drive<00:03:02.670> Attard<00:03:03.060> at

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
that still were being drive Attard at

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.470 
that still were being drive Attard at
the<00:03:03.660> moment<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.730> course<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.940> was<00:03:06.060> still

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the moment and of course this was still

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.270 
the moment and of course this was still
you<00:03:06.660> know<00:03:06.690> pretty<00:03:07.140> fresh<00:03:07.440> teen<00:03:07.650> laguna<00:03:08.100> seca

you know pretty fresh teen laguna seca

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.820 
you know pretty fresh teen laguna seca
in<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.610> game<00:03:09.320> actually<00:03:10.320> I've<00:03:10.410> got<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.620> give<00:03:10.710> my

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
in the game actually I've got to give my

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.500 
in the game actually I've got to give my
reflection<00:03:11.220> on<00:03:11.310> gamescom<00:03:11.850> as<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.120> say<00:03:12.300> this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
reflection on gamescom as I say this

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.660 
reflection on gamescom as I say this
I'll<00:03:12.750> put<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.140> together<00:03:13.410> but<00:03:13.920> generally<00:03:14.580> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
I'll put that together but generally the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.460 
I'll put that together but generally the
game<00:03:14.820> looks<00:03:15.000> great<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.480> think<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> prog<00:03:16.170> track

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
game looks great I think the prog track

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.440 
game looks great I think the prog track
looks<00:03:16.620> fantastic<00:03:17.100> but<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:18.090> I'll<00:03:18.210> mention

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
looks fantastic but and I'll mention

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.790 
looks fantastic but and I'll mention
this<00:03:18.690> on<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.050> game<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.680> come<00:03:19.800> round<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
this on the game to come round up is the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.380 
this on the game to come round up is the
the<00:03:22.800> anti<00:03:23.100> elating<00:03:23.580> is<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:24.000> bit<00:03:24.270> more

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
the anti elating is a bit more

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.900 
the anti elating is a bit more
noticeable<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.380> use<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.040> edging<00:03:26.760> and

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
noticeable you use of the edging and

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.630 
noticeable you use of the edging and
stuff<00:03:27.180> are<00:03:27.480> especially<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.400> demo<00:03:29.400> when

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
stuff are especially on the demo when

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.920 
stuff are especially on the demo when
you're<00:03:29.760> looking<00:03:29.970> at<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.180> car<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.810> auto

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
you're looking at the car and the auto

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.240 
you're looking at the car and the auto
visitor<00:03:31.410> section<00:03:32.180> not<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.330> much<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.660> game

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
visitor section not so much in the game

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.620 
visitor section not so much in the game
but<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:35.820> there's<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.060> slight<00:03:36.330> drop<00:03:36.600> in

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
but it's like there's a slight drop in

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.190

just guiding me and where the breaking
points<00:04:11.580> are<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.000> know<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.450> how<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:13.709> drive

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.520 
points are so I know then how to drive
it<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:14.550> certainly<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.360> was<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.530> nice

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
it but certainly it was a nice

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.140 
it but certainly it was a nice
experience<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:17.310> get<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:17.549> there<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.880> audio

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
experience to get on there the audio

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.610 
experience to get on there the audio
that<00:04:18.209> you're<00:04:18.450> hearing<00:04:18.660> is<00:04:18.840> not<00:04:18.989> direct<00:04:19.380> and

that you're hearing is not direct and

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.949 
that you're hearing is not direct and
that's<00:04:19.770> why<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:19.950> haven't<00:04:20.250> done<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.660> no<00:04:21.660> comment

little bit compressed you're not getting

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.740 
little bit compressed you're not getting
all<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.710> base<00:04:28.890> but<00:04:29.130> you<00:04:29.220> oh<00:04:29.280> very<00:04:30.210> nice<00:04:30.450> indeed
