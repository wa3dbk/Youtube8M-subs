00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.370
 if it were possible today for 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 200 euro to build the same quality 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.030
 as for 400 euros 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.430
 that would be beautiful the customer would 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.369
 Happy about it but still today 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.439
 Quality has its price 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.210
 There are several distinguishing features 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.039
 between a kitchen knife one 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.309
 professional mixa on the one hand the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.410
 components the haptic what you feel 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.920
 if you use it or hand it 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.070
 to take 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.470
 there is a difference then to another 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.920
 the clutches the clutch the the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.040
 Power from the engine transfers to the blades 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.680
 which then set the mix in motion 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.750
 This coupling is professional 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.440
 change always made of stainless steel and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.030
 kitchen mixers and mix in the in the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 favorable price segment lie between 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.760
 100 and 200 euros is made of plastic that is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.080
 on the one hand a bit comfortable and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.830
 a bit quieter too, but if she does 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.750
 with claims and want to go there 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.340
 Things also mix a bit harder 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.860
 consistency or approx 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.550
 then the mixa come to her someday 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.780
 border 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.260
 The clutch can no longer use the power 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.510
 transferred because the knives are going through 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.600
 the mixed blocked so that so the 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.280
 Listener effort in the room stands as 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.020
 this mixa can and will someday 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.120
 then the clutch breaks at a 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.280
 with stainless steel clutch one 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.710
 professional mixa you always have the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.500
 security and ensuring that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.020
 a drive there is because a stainless steel 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.460
 Clutch holds many many years and years 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.620
 puts every power that is given to him 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.490
 Her will be given even in performance 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.440
 and the knives begin to rotate 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.100
 the watt number that is given also has 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.770
 not always one hundred percent with 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.250
 the quality of what you do there 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.280
 mix 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.650
 because if you compare two 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.780
 four-cylinder engines with 150 watts of 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.940
 one sprints off at the traffic lights and the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.570
 other is rather to approach because 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.200
 one sees one can also with engines 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.000
 electric motors as they mix in 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.800
 be used different 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.320
 Qualities also produce when both 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.110
 For example, 1000 watts of space is 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.660
 that not equal to 1000 watts you notice 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.900
 this difference only when they 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.060
 two smoothies in the same identical 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.120
 have produced time 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.160
 then you notice the difference because of the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.810
 a music is already creamy and then 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.600
 a nice consistency and the other one 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.360
 it is not yet or he needs 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.790
 longer to start the mixed well too 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.739
 mince because he does not have the power 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.870
 the amount they put in 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.269
 shortest time also to a green 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.700
 smoothie to process 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.850
 Taste and consistency will be on 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.019
 the best tested side by side that is 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.030
 Of course not always that possible 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.440
 I can not understand three mixa 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.280
 Buy and then decide which 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.920
 want to take 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.470
 only so much is said professional 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.590
 Mixa do the job in a very nice way 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.630
 short time and the cheaper mixa 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.900
 usually need a bit of it 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.650
 longer 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.700
 but that also produces unwanted ones 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.920
 oxidation 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.230
 and they may even need a lot 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.930
 longer in order to be reasonably creamy 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.540
 even if he does not quite get it in the end 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.300
 as creamy as she would like him to be 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.340
 are also due to longer torques 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.989
 So by a longer term then too 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.130
 no better results come from tweeting 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.440
 just heat and lose in the end 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.730
 they are nutrients and do not have this 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.860
 the taste experience them 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.860
 can give professional mixer 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.060
 should you plan to buy a mixa? 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.890
 because they only have a green now and then 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.480
 want to make muti then you are 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.940
 claim maybe not that high 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.830
 and a cheaper mixa would be the 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.390
 right choice for you should you 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.130
 several times a week or more 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.950
 maybe even work with it daily 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.810
 the cheaper mixa will be fast 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.810
 brought to their performance limit and the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.010
 regularly to challenge to the end 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.370
 means that this mixa too 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.440
 pretty soon to serve 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.590
 high performance mixa high speed 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.200
 mixa from a price range of 40 euros 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.690
 or above are on permanent use and 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.389
 daily commissioning several times 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.160
 designed so that there as well the security 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.710
 exists over many many years one 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.710
 to make investment worthwhile
