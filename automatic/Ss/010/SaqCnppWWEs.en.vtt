lastly<00:00:07.810> we're<00:00:08.170> going<00:00:08.260> to<00:00:08.320> talk<00:00:08.590> about<00:00:08.620> how<00:00:09.280> a

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549 
lastly we're going to talk about how a

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.209 
lastly we're going to talk about how a
variety<00:00:10.090> of<00:00:10.120> these<00:00:10.480> instruments<00:00:11.219> concepts

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
variety of these instruments concepts

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.640 
variety of these instruments concepts
and<00:00:12.490> techniques<00:00:13.090> can<00:00:13.660> be<00:00:13.690> applied<00:00:13.809> to<00:00:14.530> the

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
and techniques can be applied to the

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.880 
and techniques can be applied to the
drumset<00:00:15.330> I'm<00:00:16.330> going<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:16.990> begin<00:00:17.290> by<00:00:17.680> using

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
drumset I'm going to begin by using

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.100 
drumset I'm going to begin by using
simply<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:18.550> snare<00:00:18.820> drum<00:00:19.119> now<00:00:19.450> the<00:00:19.540> snare<00:00:19.840> drum

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
simply the snare drum now the snare drum

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.779 
simply the snare drum now the snare drum
is<00:00:20.230> certainly<00:00:20.529> an<00:00:20.710> instrument<00:00:21.160> that<00:00:21.279> many<00:00:21.520> of

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
is certainly an instrument that many of

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.639 
is certainly an instrument that many of
your<00:00:21.970> drummers<00:00:22.360> out<00:00:22.540> there<00:00:22.779> have<00:00:23.200> had<00:00:23.439> some

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:23.649 
your drummers out there have had some

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.470 
your drummers out there have had some
experience<00:00:24.160> with<00:00:24.279> and<00:00:24.669> I'm<00:00:24.939> going<00:00:25.149> to<00:00:25.210> take

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
experience with and I'm going to take

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.030 
experience with and I'm going to take
some<00:00:25.809> of<00:00:25.840> these<00:00:26.050> concepts<00:00:26.739> that<00:00:26.860> we<00:00:27.009> learned

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
some of these concepts that we learned

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.920 
some of these concepts that we learned
with<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.550> finger<00:00:27.880> drumming<00:00:28.059> and<00:00:28.419> the<00:00:28.719> palm

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
with the finger drumming and the palm

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.839 
with the finger drumming and the palm
drumming<00:00:29.380> and<00:00:29.529> apply<00:00:30.009> it<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.309> the<00:00:30.399> drum<00:00:30.610> set

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
drumming and apply it to the drum set

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.959 
drumming and apply it to the drum set
also<00:00:31.149> you'll<00:00:31.989> see<00:00:32.320> a<00:00:32.800> new<00:00:33.100> shaker<00:00:33.430> technique

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
also you'll see a new shaker technique

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.930 
also you'll see a new shaker technique
that<00:00:34.149> I'll<00:00:34.239> use<00:00:34.510> to<00:00:35.500> begin<00:00:35.770> with<00:00:35.980> what<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.700> would

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
that I'll use to begin with what I would

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.820 
that I'll use to begin with what I would
like<00:00:37.090> you<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.270> do<00:00:37.600> is<00:00:37.809> to<00:00:38.200> tune<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.620> head

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
like you to do is to tune the head

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.560 
like you to do is to tune the head
perhaps<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.400> little<00:00:39.730> looser<00:00:40.120> than<00:00:40.150> you<00:00:40.390> might

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
perhaps a little looser than you might

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.410 
perhaps a little looser than you might
normally<00:00:40.710> tune<00:00:41.710> it<00:00:41.890> and<00:00:42.070> then<00:00:42.520> with<00:00:43.210> your

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
normally tune it and then with your

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.540 
normally tune it and then with your
right<00:00:43.870> hand<00:00:44.079> with<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.380> stick<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:44.920> left<00:00:45.220> hand

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
right hand with a stick and left hand

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.180 
right hand with a stick and left hand
pressing<00:00:46.300> in<00:00:46.510> just<00:00:47.110> press<00:00:47.350> in<00:00:47.590> a<00:00:47.770> little<00:00:48.040> bit

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
pressing in just press in a little bit

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.740 
pressing in just press in a little bit
and<00:00:48.340> experiment<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:54.760> can<00:00:55.030> experiment<00:00:55.450> for

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
and experiment so you can experiment for

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.319 
and experiment so you can experiment for
yourself<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:56.590> degree<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.270> flexibility<00:00:58.270> that

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
yourself the degree of flexibility that

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.360 
yourself the degree of flexibility that
you<00:00:58.989> can<00:00:59.170> achieve<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.649> different<00:00:59.980> types<00:01:00.190> of

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
you can achieve the different types of

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.790 
you can achieve the different types of
pitches<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.329> varying<00:01:01.690> degrees<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.050> open

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
pitches and the varying degrees of open

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.200 
pitches and the varying degrees of open
tones<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.940> closed<00:01:04.629> tones<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.670> can<00:01:06.700> use<00:01:07.030> this

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
tones and closed tones you can use this

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.520 
tones and closed tones you can use this
technique<00:01:07.689> where<00:01:07.899> you<00:01:07.960> take<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.259> side<00:01:08.500> of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
technique where you take the side of

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.429 
technique where you take the side of
your<00:01:08.890> hand<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.880> learned<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.299> before<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
your hand we learned that before and the

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.590 
your hand we learned that before and the
the<00:01:15.009> knuckle<00:01:15.369> shot<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:18.280> will<00:01:18.429> also<00:01:18.609> work<00:01:18.939> now

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
the knuckle shot that will also work now

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.080 
the knuckle shot that will also work now
one<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.049> strokes<00:01:20.319> I<00:01:20.469> enjoy<00:01:20.920> using<00:01:21.189> is<00:01:21.490> a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
one of the strokes I enjoy using is a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.389 
one of the strokes I enjoy using is a
triplet<00:01:22.780> based<00:01:23.020> stroke<00:01:23.530> where<00:01:23.829> I<00:01:23.859> will<00:01:24.189> play

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
triplet based stroke where I will play

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.819 
triplet based stroke where I will play
two<00:01:24.819> notes<00:01:24.850> with<00:01:25.329> my<00:01:25.450> right<00:01:25.659> hand<00:01:25.689> followed<00:01:26.469> by

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
two notes with my right hand followed by

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.429 
two notes with my right hand followed by
one<00:01:27.130> note<00:01:27.369> with<00:01:27.670> my<00:01:27.850> left<00:01:28.119> finger<00:01:28.630> or<00:01:28.840> hand<00:01:28.869> and

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
one note with my left finger or hand and

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
one note with my left finger or hand and
it<00:01:29.560> goes<00:01:29.709> like<00:01:29.920> this

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.760 

it's<00:01:34.689> a<00:01:34.780> little<00:01:35.020> faster<00:01:36.689> employing<00:01:37.689> a<00:01:38.170> varying

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
it's a little faster employing a varying

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.499 
it's a little faster employing a varying
amounts<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.340> pressure<00:01:39.610> on<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.880> head<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.509> then

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
amounts of pressure on the head and then

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.630 
amounts of pressure on the head and then
if<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.689> take<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:47.079> same<00:01:47.350> pattern<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:48.039> start<00:01:48.520> to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
if I take that same pattern and start to

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.999 
if I take that same pattern and start to
use<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.000> different<00:01:49.390> drums<00:01:49.659> I<00:01:49.960> can<00:01:50.409> achieve<00:01:50.619> an

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
use the different drums I can achieve an

00:01:51.009 --> 00:02:08.410 
use the different drums I can achieve an
even<00:01:51.369> greater<00:01:51.640> degree<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.149> mo<00:01:52.479> autism
