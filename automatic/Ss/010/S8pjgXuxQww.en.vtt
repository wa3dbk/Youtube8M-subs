mint<00:01:35.000> chocolate<00:01:35.800> shake<00:01:36.970> it<00:01:37.970> has<00:01:38.210> little

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
mint chocolate shake it has little

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.140 
mint chocolate shake it has little
pieces<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:39.259> like<00:01:39.680> chocolate<00:01:39.920> chip<00:01:40.520> or<00:01:40.729> cookie

pieces of like chocolate chip or cookie
in<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.200> really<00:01:42.409> should<00:01:42.619> be<00:01:42.650> called<00:01:42.740> mint
