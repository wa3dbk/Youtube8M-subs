00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
hi everyone this is my bike I've been

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.600 
hi everyone this is my bike I've been
riding<00:00:23.700> it<00:00:23.940> for<00:00:24.180> over<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.990> year<00:00:25.110> now<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.740> maybe

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
riding it for over a year now so maybe

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.650 
riding it for over a year now so maybe
it's<00:00:26.820> time<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.270> review

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it's time to do a review

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.360 
it's time to do a review
everything's<00:00:28.260> been<00:00:28.470> holding<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:28.950> and<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.190> not

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
everything's been holding up and I'm not

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.659 
everything's been holding up and I'm not
dead<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.290> obviously<00:00:31.290> I<00:00:31.950> did<00:00:32.220> something<00:00:32.550> right

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
dead so obviously I did something right

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.060 
dead so obviously I did something right
and<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> kids<00:00:33.180> been<00:00:33.300> working<00:00:33.660> really<00:00:33.810> well<00:00:34.070> so

and the kids been working really well so
I<00:00:35.100> got<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.460> bike<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> Costco<00:00:36.420> nemesis

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
I got this bike a Costco nemesis

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.790 
I got this bike a Costco nemesis
infinity<00:00:38.160> don't<00:00:38.580> really<00:00:39.020> uh<00:00:40.020> don't<00:00:40.680> really

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
infinity don't really uh don't really

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.619 
infinity don't really uh don't really
know<00:00:41.070> that's<00:00:41.580> the<00:00:41.670> popular<00:00:42.120> brand<00:00:42.450> name

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
know that's the popular brand name

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.670 
know that's the popular brand name
because<00:00:42.809> I've<00:00:42.930> never<00:00:43.080> heard<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> before

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
because I've never heard of it before

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.590 
because I've never heard of it before
but<00:00:44.129> surprisingly<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.970> actually<00:00:45.330> holding

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
but surprisingly it's actually holding

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260 
but surprisingly it's actually holding
up<00:00:45.720> a<00:00:45.750> white<00:00:45.989> weld<00:00:46.400> so<00:00:47.400> I<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> thousand

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
up a white weld so I have a thousand

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.390 
up a white weld so I have a thousand
watt<00:00:48.800> golden<00:00:49.800> motor<00:00:50.070> rear<00:00:50.730> hub<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:52.400> along

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
watt golden motor rear hub and along

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.330 
watt golden motor rear hub and along
with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.640> external<00:00:53.970> controller<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.130> have

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
with the external controller so I have

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
with the external controller so I have
somewhat<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.150> torque<00:00:57.450> I'm<00:00:57.720> there<00:00:57.930> I've<00:00:58.050> gone

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
somewhat of a torque I'm there I've gone

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.160 
somewhat of a torque I'm there I've gone
through<00:00:58.290> so<00:00:58.770> many<00:00:58.890> different<00:01:00.110> solutions<00:01:01.110> for

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
through so many different solutions for

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.569 
through so many different solutions for
torque<00:01:01.500> arms<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.220> really<00:01:02.370> hard

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
torque arms it was actually really hard

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.450 
torque arms it was actually really hard
to<00:01:02.670> fit<00:01:02.970> anything<00:01:03.210> short<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.080> custom<00:01:04.949> CNC

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to fit anything short of custom CNC

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
to fit anything short of custom CNC
machined<00:01:07.759> type<00:01:08.759> of<00:01:08.910> torque<00:01:09.300> arm<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
machined type of torque arm so I just I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.780 
machined type of torque arm so I just I
don't<00:01:10.530> know<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:10.950> been<00:01:10.979> holding<00:01:11.310> up<00:01:11.550> for

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
don't know this has been holding up for

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
don't know this has been holding up for
a<00:01:11.820> year<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.720> Drive<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> full<00:01:13.950> throttle<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
a year now I Drive a full throttle and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
a year now I Drive a full throttle and
rough<00:01:15.810> starts<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> everything<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.070> sorts<00:01:17.399> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
rough starts and everything all sorts of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.910 
rough starts and everything all sorts of
all-terrain<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.050> it's<00:01:19.229> still

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
all-terrain as you can see it's still

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.050 
all-terrain as you can see it's still
really<00:01:20.070> muddy<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.550> they<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.790> bunch<00:01:20.940> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
really muddy because they do a bunch of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.170 
really muddy because they do a bunch of
off-roading<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:21.810> battery<00:01:22.650> rec<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
off-roading as well battery rec is a

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.690 
off-roading as well battery rec is a
here<00:01:24.260> it's<00:01:25.260> actually<00:01:26.159> been<00:01:26.310> holding<00:01:26.610> up

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
here it's actually been holding up

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.610 
here it's actually been holding up
really<00:01:26.729> well<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.540> thing<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.380> kit

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
really well the one thing is the the kit

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.200 
really well the one thing is the the kit
didn't<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.220> bolt<00:01:29.549> with<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.120> this

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
didn't really have a bolt with for this

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.039 
didn't really have a bolt with for this
so<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.400> used<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.240> couple<00:01:33.479> washers

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so I just kind of used a couple washers

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
so I just kind of used a couple washers
and<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.650> keep<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.580> tight<00:01:35.940> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and I'm not keep that really tight and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.930 
and I'm not keep that really tight and
only<00:01:36.750> once<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.830> had<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.040> bump<00:01:38.310> hard<00:01:38.640> enough

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
only once if I had a bump hard enough

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.850 
only once if I had a bump hard enough
that<00:01:39.000> actually<00:01:39.900> caused<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> wreck<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> go

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that actually caused the wreck to go

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.649 
that actually caused the wreck to go
down<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> bit<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.700> haven't<00:01:41.940> had<00:01:42.210> any<00:01:42.270> trouble

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
down a bit but I haven't had any trouble

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.680 
down a bit but I haven't had any trouble
since<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.080> retightened<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.010> before<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.360> used

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
since I retightened it and before I used

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.170 
since I retightened it and before I used
to<00:01:45.930> before<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> tighten<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.760> suspension

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to before I tighten up my suspension

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.410 
to before I tighten up my suspension
over<00:01:48.510> here<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.930> hit<00:01:49.650> this<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:51.000> kind<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
over here I hit this and it kind of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.429 
over here I hit this and it kind of
popped<00:01:51.659> up<00:01:52.430> um<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.659> yeah<00:01:54.840> everything's<00:01:55.290> been

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
popped up um so yeah everything's been

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.070 
popped up um so yeah everything's been
really<00:01:55.590> solid<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.880> keep<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> controller

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
really solid here I keep the controller

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.950 
really solid here I keep the controller
and<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.380> bag<00:01:58.820> up<00:01:59.820> at<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> front<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and a bag up at the front so I have the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.990 
and a bag up at the front so I have the
controller<00:02:01.350> over<00:02:01.470> here<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.640> extra

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
controller over here and then the extra

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.780 
controller over here and then the extra
cables<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.600> stuff<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> other<00:02:04.170> side<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.400> I

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
cables and stuff on the other side and I

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.660 
cables and stuff on the other side and I
used<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.150> use<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.479> thumb<00:02:06.720> throttle<00:02:07.459> but<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.610> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
used to use the thumb throttle but now I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.979 
used to use the thumb throttle but now I
switched<00:02:08.970> over<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.450> twist<00:02:09.720> throttle

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
switched over to the twist throttle

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.960 
switched over to the twist throttle
because<00:02:10.259> well<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.070> switched<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.549> over<00:02:11.610> during

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
because well I switched it over during

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.850 
because well I switched it over during
