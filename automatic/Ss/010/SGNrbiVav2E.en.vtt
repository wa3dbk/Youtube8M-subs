00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
everything you do in the game should be

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.380 
everything you do in the game should be
just<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.220> series<00:05:53.460> of<00:05:53.640> questions<00:05:54.060> every

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
just a series of questions every

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.750 
just a series of questions every
movement<00:05:54.990> you're<00:05:55.380> asking<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.860> question<00:05:56.280> you're

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
movement you're asking a question you're

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.610 
movement you're asking a question you're
giving<00:05:57.030> an<00:05:57.150> answer<00:05:57.540> based<00:05:57.870> on<00:05:58.140> that<00:05:58.290> question

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
giving an answer based on that question

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.710 
giving an answer based on that question
and<00:05:59.010> that's<00:05:59.490> how<00:05:59.700> you<00:05:59.760> find<00:06:00.000> success<00:06:00.240> in<00:06:00.480> this

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
and that's how you find success in this

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.290 
and that's how you find success in this
game<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.500> you<00:06:02.160> know<00:06:02.280> and<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.730> and<00:06:03.210> that

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
game and you know and I and and that

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.850 
game and you know and I and and that
might<00:06:03.450> seem<00:06:03.660> far-fetched<00:06:03.870> like<00:06:04.350> who<00:06:04.470> has<00:06:04.650> time

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
might seem far-fetched like who has time

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.890 
might seem far-fetched like who has time
to<00:06:05.010> ask<00:06:05.130> all<00:06:05.400> those<00:06:05.520> questions<00:06:06.000> right<00:06:06.360> but

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
to ask all those questions right but

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.090 
to ask all those questions right but
that's<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.200> trick<00:06:07.530> is<00:06:07.710> that<00:06:07.740> you're<00:06:07.980> not

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
that's the trick is that you're not

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.010 
that's the trick is that you're not
literally<00:06:08.850> you<00:06:09.030> know<00:06:09.150> in<00:06:09.300> your<00:06:09.420> mind<00:06:09.480> asking

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
literally you know in your mind asking

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.660 
literally you know in your mind asking
yourself<00:06:10.350> mmm<00:06:10.680> I<00:06:10.770> wonder<00:06:11.010> who's<00:06:11.190> on<00:06:11.340> that<00:06:11.490> roof

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
yourself mmm I wonder who's on that roof

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.570 
yourself mmm I wonder who's on that roof
it's<00:06:11.940> just<00:06:12.240> a<00:06:12.390> signal<00:06:13.080> in<00:06:13.200> your<00:06:13.350> brain<00:06:13.650> that's

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
it's just a signal in your brain that's

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.820 
it's just a signal in your brain that's
going<00:06:14.880> off<00:06:15.000> like<00:06:15.240> that<00:06:15.540> you<00:06:15.810> know<00:06:15.960> hella<00:06:16.470> quick

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
and it's all taking place every question

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.980 
and it's all taking place every question
every<00:06:20.100> logical<00:06:20.850> deduction<00:06:21.210> every<00:06:21.570> answer<00:06:21.900> in

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990

you<00:06:38.790> can<00:06:39.150> take<00:06:39.330> this<00:06:39.480> and<00:06:39.630> apply<00:06:39.870> it<00:06:39.930> to<00:06:40.170> real

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
you can take this and apply it to real

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.420 
you can take this and apply it to real
life

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
life

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.010 
life
situations<00:06:42.240> you<00:06:42.389> know<00:06:42.509> obviously<00:06:42.840> there<00:06:42.960> will

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
situations you know obviously there will

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.570 
situations you know obviously there will
be<00:06:43.110> entirely<00:06:43.410> different<00:06:43.530> sets<00:06:44.040> of<00:06:44.100> questions

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
be entirely different sets of questions

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.280 
be entirely different sets of questions
for<00:06:44.940> different<00:06:45.270> situations<00:06:45.840> and<00:06:46.020> that's<00:06:46.139> the

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
for different situations and that's the

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.710 
for different situations and that's the
same<00:06:46.440> for<00:06:46.500> call<00:06:46.770> of<00:06:46.889> duty<00:06:47.240> but<00:06:48.240> you<00:06:48.330> can<00:06:48.479> apply

same for call of duty but you can apply

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.180 
same for call of duty but you can apply
it<00:06:48.780> to<00:06:48.960> real<00:06:48.990> life<00:06:49.380> because<00:06:49.770> critical

it to real life because critical

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.909 
it to real life because critical
thinking<00:06:50.250> is<00:06:50.820> like<00:06:51.060> a<00:06:51.090> muscle<00:06:51.500> the<00:06:52.500> more<00:06:52.770> you

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
thinking is like a muscle the more you

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:57.409 
thinking is like a muscle the more you
use<00:06:52.949> it<00:06:53.220> the<00:06:53.580> better<00:06:53.759> it<00:06:54.060> will<00:06:54.270> be<00:06:54.770> and<00:06:55.770> so<00:06:56.419> the

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
use it the better it will be and so the
