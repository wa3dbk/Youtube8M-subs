00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.540
 It is a booth of bmw, but bmw 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:14.300
 It appeared in ia and love 3 water 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:18.170
 Two cars of so-called electric drive system of maa are displayed 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.940
 First of all it is ia, but please see everyone 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 Because it is a commercial model itself 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.630
 I feel that the times have changed a little 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.670
 Even though I'm very trapezoidal when you take a look at whether the majority 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.340
 Actually it is not so fat a 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:38.730
 I 'm narrow I 'm contributing to the aerodynamics wearing tires 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 Some parts of the body are also like this 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.310
 That very 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.710
 It is characterized by a high aero-effect design 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.200
 It is around here 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.040
 It looks like it is transparent 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:58.740
 It means that the air flows in a feeling like penetrating 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.090
 That mounted engine is a 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine though 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.370
 In addition to that 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.460
 that 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.300
 It is the so-called have joined the battery and motor 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:14.760
 It is supposed to be a plug-in hybrid model 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.010
 That you take a look at the actual room and is the bmw I of the so-called other is the case of this i at 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.710
 Flow from the model 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:27.320
 You can see that the design has been expanded 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.680
 I like this seat of the rear is very minimal size and this car 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.520
 It tells that it is a sports car 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.060
 And it's a body seal, but it's carbon, so you can see g as it is 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.060
 I understand 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.830
 In a way 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 It is such a car that says that the shell of Garbon is exposed as it is 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.000
 is not it 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:59.820
 It's a ceiling antenna It's also very very 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:04.340
 It's in a pretty shape and looks like it is enhancing that effect 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:09.560
 Yes Well I am 3 meet it is is here. This is a pure and ev 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:13.220
 It is generally said that the distance is about 200 km and it is an option 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:18.910
 By mounting the ne range extended engine 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:24.800
 Up to around 309 I have a wind that I can get a range 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.330
 Has been Inasa This advanced feeling of design it is very Although the room that I'm 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.060
 It is before steering 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.170
 Monitor 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.610
 Though 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:38.670
 It is even more all have been displayed on the monitor 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.670
 The navigation monitor is located separately 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.300
 The switches and so on are very small and simple 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.300
 It feels like 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.230
 And it's behind, but it's behind, as a four-seater car 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:03.720
 The proper size is secured, so it would be a problem if you use it for your own use 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:09.250
 It seems like it's not, and this car too 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:13.090
 It is a characteristic of the body of the Carbo as it is visible 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.110
 I also have a rear design. There are many recent cars, but this is a design. 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.850
 It's a trend 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.850
 It is a distinctive model that is treated to float the roof 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.980
 Now the hatch has just been opened but it is a hatcher 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:36.150
 Though the height of the floor where the batteries are contained is high 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.150
 Well if there is it OJ depth luggage has become a decent nails likely to feel
