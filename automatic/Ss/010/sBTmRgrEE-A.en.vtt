00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the center just kind of raised my hands

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.590 
the center just kind of raised my hands
up<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> life<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.729> body<00:01:47.909> most<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.509> the

up in the life in my body most of the
time<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> might<00:01:49.470> kind<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:49.920> take<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
time there I might kind of take the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
time there I might kind of take the
slack<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:50.880> rain

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
slack out of the rain

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.830 
slack out of the rain
just<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.140> spot<00:01:52.440> or<00:01:52.590> two<00:01:52.800> but<00:01:53.509> he's<00:01:54.509> really

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
just a spot or two but he's really

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.620 
just a spot or two but he's really
looking<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.259> stay<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.679> me<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> lot<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.159> now

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630 

and<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.110> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.440> just<00:02:01.649> again<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
