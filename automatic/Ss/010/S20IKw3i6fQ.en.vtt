let's just open up the messaging or
system<00:00:52.260> messaging<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.190> two<00:00:53.340> three<00:00:53.579> go

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
system messaging here one two three go

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.670 
system messaging here one two three go
oops<00:00:56.360> let's<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.020> two<00:00:58.199> three<00:00:58.410> go

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.429 

game<00:01:01.680> seems<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.430> pretty<00:01:02.579> equal<00:01:03.149> stride<00:01:04.080> one

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
game seems like pretty equal stride one

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.920 
game seems like pretty equal stride one
more<00:01:04.619> time<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.189> iphone<00:01:05.549> was<00:01:05.700> well<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> way

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
quicker there again maybe the nrm of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.380 
quicker there again maybe the nrm of
shell<00:01:31.259> version<00:01:31.619> might<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.400> faster<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:32.909> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
shell version might be faster but you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600 
shell version might be faster but you
know<00:01:33.509> both<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.200> equal<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.460> that
