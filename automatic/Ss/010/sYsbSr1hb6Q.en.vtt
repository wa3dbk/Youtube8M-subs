00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.670
 now very good morning guys girls 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.950
 I hope you are very well today 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.170
 we bring a pretty comparative 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.179
 pretty good enough fought between 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.639
 two devices from the mid-range of the 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.070
 motorola brand as being the new 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.410
 inflaman te motorola motogp against 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.269
 fraser of three of both good as 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.160
 will know the three is not the worst nor is the 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.140
 better therefore it is medium for a range 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.660
 low for its price is also quite 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.509
 accessible the same as the motorcycle gp 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.359
 let's see if they want to see the the 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.309
 comparative complete well taking your 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.309
 I'm going to leave them here on the 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.500
 link of the description so let's 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.270
 start with those with the features 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.480
 external with the phone's hardware 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.180
 we have the dimensions 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.370
 111 6 millimeters thick for the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.720
 motor to motogp against about 9.8 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:57.960
 millimeters of the resort of 3 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.820
 we are 65.9 millimeters wide by 129 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.940
 points 9 millimeters high by vote 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.000
 g and 59 points 8 millimeters wide by 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.400
 119 points 3 millimeters high for the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.830
 of 3 I have a little bit smaller is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 3 and now also for the issue of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 screens 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.060
 and for the issue of use also 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.460
 we have weight of 143 grams for the engine 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.150
 to the bike g and 120 grams for the flexor 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.310
 of stress r I did not expect that 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.479
 we have both gorilla glass 3 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.329
 we have 4.3 in the motogp with 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.020
 4.4 guaranteed update in January 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.630
 next year we have Android 4.1.2 of 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.039
 living in the motorola motokey wine no 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.789
 There is no update that I know of 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:49.119
 let's talk about your processor hardware 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:54.040
 and memory we have a qualcomm processor 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:59.420
 snapdragon 400 in the engine or the motorcycle g 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.790
 and a mediatek mt 65 77 in 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.659
 3 sensor later if you want to see the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.060
 other types 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.330
 the others more detailed can see it already 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.709
 you know in the description we have one thousand 200 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.000
 megas 1.2 giga hertz of quad core in the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.760
 motogp and 12 years also in the geyser 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.430
 of 3 alleged alcohol here an advantage 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.770
 for the motogp because it has twice as many 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.269
 ability although you know they say no 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.780
 all nuclei are always occupied 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.120
 but good is something that we already have 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.860
 music ram on both devices as 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.900
 graphic card we have one which like 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:43.610
 Adriano 305 in the motogp and a powervr 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:46.610
 sgx 531 in the teacher of 3 we have a 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.010
 internal memory of 8 gb in the face sort 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.740
 in the engine or the motorcycle and a memory of 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.900
 4 gb in the resort of 3 that according to me 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.980
 they say only you use could you 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.069
 use 2 449 by the user 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.500
 and here they give as a winner on the page 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.080
 initial motogp for this topic but 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.780
 then I give it to him later he gives it to him 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.060
 also to the manager of three 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.810
 in expandable memory because we have 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.150
 for microsd up to 32gb things that the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.890
 engine or the bike that does not have this 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.110
 is more important than many others 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.190
 things for a buyer and can decide 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.280
 already of a decay the purchase of the moto gene 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.340
 or by not having an expansion well not 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.190
 we have I think what we have micros 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.300
 micro sim we have micro sim in the motogp 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.180
 and a mini sim on the face of 3 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.540
 both are quadband they have the same 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.239
 specifications in the energy short 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.500
 in the geyser of 3 we do not have the chespi 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.519
 plus 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.269
 I think we do not have 4g networks we have a 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.180
 4.5 inch screen on the motogp 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.890
 against a 4-inch screen in the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.800
 geyser of 3 so that's also more 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.209
 we have a resolution of 720 x 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:12.470
 thousand 280 in the motogp what would be hp hd 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:16.280
 forgiveness against 480 x 800 of three 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.169
 fight for a lot of comparison or if something 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.269
 now if you like to have a screen with 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.210
 better quality if it's not a problem for voice 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.120
 it could be could not be so relevant 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.360
 we have a pixel density of 326 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.160
 for the engine of the moto gp and 233 for 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.310
 the 3 sensor 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.160
 we have the cameras here here yes it's going to 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.990
 have also another very decisive point 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.750
 for several users we have 5 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.630
 megapixels for the engine motorola 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.410
 against 8 megapixels of the reviewer of 3 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.230
 the truth is that the 3's is better 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.880
 what I've seen in videos 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.200
 nicolás fishman of his own being has 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.390
 said that the motörhead camera is yes 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.780
 good is good is not the best I think 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.090
 had also said the three was better 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.380
 also for almost obvious reasons we have 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.140
 8 megapixels 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.680
 both have led flash and zoom 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.320
 digital autofocus face detection and 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.900
 they have 1.3 secondary cameras 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.560
 megapixels for the motogp and 1.2 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.610
 megapixels for the face of 3 we have 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.540
 a resolution of 280 280 x 1024 x the 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.760
 motogp against jersey 280 x 960 jersey 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.810
 shore of 3 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:39.580
 if we give according to the page we go 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:42.849
 says he records the 3's do not record hd 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.680
 motogp if we have video recording of 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.939
 the main camera in hd 720 in 30 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.969
 frames per second in both 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:55.030
 devices but in the front camera 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.639
 we have a recordings 7b to 720 in the 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.330
 front camera of the motogp in the 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:04.729
 resolution of him 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:07.860
 geyser of 13 special so that 's 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:11.039
 another issue to keep in mind we have 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.060
 both have and microusb 3 a circle is not 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.060
 compatible with nfc 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:25.480
 Good forgiveness 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:28.600
 it was a vacuum we have a 2000 battery 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.080
 70,000 perez for the engine against one of 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.210
 2000 thousand integers for the 3 sensor 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.520
 both are removable so we're going 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.509
 You can take out our battery 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.819
 and this was the comparison of two 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:45.039
 mid- range devices the engine and 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.270
 his predecessor the freezer of three does not 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.789
 forget to leave me down here in the 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.110
 comments that have seemed the 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.419
 comparative that seems to them in these 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.160
 phones what for what for you 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.260
 what is the winner not why 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.750
 we have several here is leaving us 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.420
 the photo of the points in favor and 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.520
 point against each other so 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.870
 apart draw your conclusions also and 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.090
 I'd like to let him also 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.190
