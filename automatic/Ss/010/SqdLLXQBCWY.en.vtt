00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.609
 hi friends in this video i am telling 

00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:08.879
 about one thing 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.370
 in my opinion almost ingenious appliances 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:16.650
 Sokovarka that simplifies life with 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.730
 hydrogen when that's when it starts to ripen 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 harvest and make it almost anywhere 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.029
 when all this they need to port to this 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.560
 processing 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.710
 Here is this device for protection helps out but I 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 I call it a device here and here komplit 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.290
 pans such here obviously as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.140
 all this means it is arranged here this 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.080
 cumulative capacity for where 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.540
 dripping juice which is obtained in the process 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.270
 the operation of this appliance gate like so 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.040
 we call it a house in which is poured 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.550
 water should be poured as much as possible well 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.850
 that's up to the maximum mark because 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.109
 what was then easier condition for him 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.659
 to smell water 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:15.119
 then inserted means tray for juice 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.630
 on top put this mesh in 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.460
 which means superimposed practically 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.649
 just take out a cream polo 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.380
 even raenet can be there all the small not 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.050
 blame cut that is it a minimum 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.070
 of time 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.070
 walks on all this all closes 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.670
 the gas cap on is first 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:42.210
 handle the maximum reptile opens 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 if not extremely close this one 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:51.580
 to be too active but when 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.410
 juice means that he is still there 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.370
 a level never flows a little 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:01.540
 then the cana will rise for you can open 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:05.380
 in about an hour and a half 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.130
 it leaves already all the berries as seen and 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.630
 which style apples and about after 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.870
 an hour or a half 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.940
 in general, turn off pre 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:25.230
 of course the hospital had to be clean 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.260
 before mission fearing him a little here 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.540
 the process is not finished yet I want to show 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.560
 that it is not finished juice continue 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.700
 flow down flies 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.460
 level in the pan only here if 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.730
 still do not need a little memory plus 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.370
 a little bit there like it 's off again 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.910
 able to continue to drain them 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.220
 this process is so long 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:56.520
 He does not take time has passed to anyone 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.520
 a little bit from here victory there walk by 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.750
 change and he continues 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.910
 flow then into fashion 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.250
 singing fly and clean just 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.100
 put there as parties as noted 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.710
 and still still keep on 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.540
 it can be seen that the juice flows substitute 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.540
 some capacity we need to be able to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.940
 Smaller size there because the smell 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.820
 how would dad have a volume that's when 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.190
 finally defended here it is almost 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.700
 dry remains just thrown in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:35.750
 bucket and thatâ€™s what you can use 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.750
 all the best of luck
