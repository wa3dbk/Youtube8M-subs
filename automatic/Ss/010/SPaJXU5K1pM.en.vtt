00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
Meal, Welcome to the Ride Video Review magazine and the review of

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.850
Oblivion: The Black Hole

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.959
When it comes to roller coasters and then from B &amp; M and a dive coaster

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.810
The Oblivion's

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.830
all think immediately of Alton Towers in England and the prototype

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.689
Dive Coster's B &amp; M

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.759
which in this case but not
right because it is

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.759
a dive coaster from B &amp; M of Oblivion:

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.150
The Black Hole's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.340
and this is precisely in Italy
said

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.480
Directly on Lake Garda

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.780
Gardaland. What we now want to think about it?

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.530
be material found in the Berlin

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.940
Let's guess. The Merlin inerhalb of their own group and parks the names

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.400
recycled

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.720
I do not find so horny

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.910
but

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.230
Names are smoke and mirrors as we all
know

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.400
Oblivion The Black Hole at Gardaland has opened on 28.03.2015

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.069
The B &amp; M Dive Coster has a 566m long Custem layout

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.660
with two investors

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.890
a Tunel a Camelback a
270 ° helix and the hottest

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.940
One Heartline Roll. System has been built by RCS and the synchronous

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.909
with Diabolik

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.670
Invertet Costerim 2km away in Movieland

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.770
In Oblivion, The Black Hole, there are 3 trains with 3 cars per 6 seats per row

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.020
which makes 18 drivers per train

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.900
in each row there in the middle of 2
Big Boss Seats. Pblivion The Black Hole

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.530
Is 42,5m high

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.420
has a maximum inclination of 87 degrees
and a speed of

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.140
up to 100 km / h

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.080
and, with its 566m long haul

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.380
Oblivion: The Black Hole

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.610
one of the longest dive coaster

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.450
for me personally also one of the
. Most A brief story

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.840
It is a mysterious hole at Lake Garda
surfaced

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.620
which is a kind of the portal for a space-time tunnel

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.480
and should be explored and we are the team of researchers

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.710
and set out on a mission

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.930
but the Grafitation around the hole is so extremely sucked all around the hole

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.479
what in the theming very very very
horny

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:18.709
was implemented in my opinion

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.349
very nice

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.939
Unfortunately, we are already on the way to the mission and there is no turning back

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.419
and we must be vertical in
overthrow this black hole

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.229
but this is not easy unprepared
sent on this mission

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:37.219
because before you will be in a
Training Camp in trained and

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.209
tested whether one really

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.599
suitable with this track to
go

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.849
which takes place in the Q-Line

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.860
and so we should also start

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.549
to this path to Talk

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.579
we have a beautiful large impressive entrance area

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.319
and ehmmm ...

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.379
Outside Q-Line Area

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.449
until the next turnstile in the increasingly small groups

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.769
in the large tents in which the training camp

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.789
is the q-line

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.439
all is right

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.549
large and complex of the story for this check on every side from:

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.599
gardalandoblivion.it

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.409
Link in the video description

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.209
because that would definitely now the
Think outside the box

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.270
I think it's a really really
horny well designed and very creative

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.369
and crazy abgespacete

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.939
and unique Q-Line

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.909
There are also shots of it

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.510
likely to be seen right here in the background

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.610
and in the Onride POV Offride Q-Line Video

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.269
here on this channel

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.589
if this training camp behind
brought has passed the test has

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.490
it goes up the stairs on a small
Bridges and into the main building

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.439
Oblivion

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.409
and station building which is very small and cuddly

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.470
and really only room for one car
and provides

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.060
hire and 3 rows for. after one has then taken place

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.359
been inspected all U

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.150
is started and the launch and
you go on mission

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.439
in a slight curve at issue in the
Lift

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.909
reached the top there is the usual
Left turn at Dive Costern

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.379
shortly after landing in the short brake
before departure. I'll tell you ...

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:23.219
in the first row

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.939
if you go down there looks much her only this rotating wind turbine

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.310
The rotating propeller of the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.360
Wind turbine or whatever and the
Tower is the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.300
This may not fit ... That never fits in life

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.110
and then but the brake is released

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.749
It goes downhill into the Black Hole

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.199
very stylish The tunnel is fucking me
long before

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.939
filled with ehm ...

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.139
not so with fog but only with
Water mist

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.870
That was the word I was looking for

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.379
and even special effects with stroboscope

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.539
to get out of the tunnel in the Immelmann to Start

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.900
then with a Near Miss FX

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.849
ends

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.349
and in the Camelback go and Camelback follows a high altitude

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.699
270 ° Helix

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.409
which leads us directly into the Heartline Roll. The sooooo

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:15.780
Horny simply drives

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.930
and then he was already back
Circuit brake ends

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.379
but for a Dive Coster is the hell of a lot layout and route

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.749
a wide right turn brings us then
in the last brake front of the station

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:34.669
and then the big monitor comes with
the countdown of the decontamination

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.919
either the shit made or

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.930
or was it stupid timing time of our visit

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.620
because it runs the countdown down and one is then decontaminated but

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.879
but the nozzles at the side
moisten a water mist

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.289
only work or run only

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.599
from the third row and then some
longer so I guess the timing

00:05:58.599 --> 00:05:59.969
that's not true

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.589
but that's just the penalties
for those who do not dare after vohrne

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:06.369
and sat in the third row
have but I can not imagine

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:09.889
because you have to make some fine tuning on the timing

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.020
or we had on the day pesch

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.050
and as usual after get in
Gardaland

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.349
followed by a shop. The Oblivion Store

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.020
There is everything to Oblivion. TShirt, capping,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.110
Handtüscher, water bottles
with swirl

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.670
and something very awesome since I could not say no and had to buy time mearch

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.060
Is this or is this Geil Horny?

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.060
One sees that good?

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.400
MEGA good or

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.080
I stands out

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.449
So Oblivion has a really cool story and looks fresh with complaisant

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.319
also with the white seemed to fit really well in the corner

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.479
the whole enriches is designed really nice

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.119
the color scheme with white and orange

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.860
is really nice and I personally like very good

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.129
is a ground which makes fun looks good and fits well into gardaland

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.569
The skyline of the Gardaland has new gepregt

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.220
and what shall I say? knaller the way it should be with a new big roller coaster

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.009
So even checked the Onride video of Oblivion

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.770
Subscribed to this channel is nothing more to miss because it is following

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.529
Check the park and other reviews to Gardaland

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:33.919
and that's it from me I'm out of it since the koolsten your Bro Pöys
