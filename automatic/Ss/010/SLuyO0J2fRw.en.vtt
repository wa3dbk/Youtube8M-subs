 we have here back from us good 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.700
 this piece is a metal sculpture of 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.970
 monika sosnowska that is a sculpture 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.410
 Polish and she works mainly with 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.350
 metal in large formats 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.810
 and he comes to spend seasons in Mexico and 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.370
 here select your materials and work 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.350
 in a workshop 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.869
 where do all these pieces 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.150
 and he had an exhibition in the gallery in 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.470
 November and this piece is part of 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.240
 that exhibition was called the garden 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.910
 I also find it very interesting 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.360
 gallery are the stones are pieces of 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.250
 damián ortega and they are pieces that work 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.170
 like a puzzle but a 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.960
 puzzle that would seem to be like very 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.640
 very organic natural and they are really 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.230
 stones that are manufactured that are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.970
 made it would not look like they're like stones 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.060
 that was found today that he was arming but 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.950
 in reality that is the intention not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 if they look very real in truth and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.170
 it seems that like he was finding them 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 well and they were putting together these figures but 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.140
 you do not see that they are made exactly 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.630
 and what he does is like molding 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.880
 the stone while it is fresh 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.560
 material and since it dries then it remains 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 like a puzzle that can be put together 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.670

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.829
