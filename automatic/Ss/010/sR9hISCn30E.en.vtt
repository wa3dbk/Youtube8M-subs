 Hi friends, I greet Mirko Rizzo today 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.450
 let's go to treat a po flour 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.900
 particularly beautiful because there was the 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.029
 in short, the first was the uncle the man who 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.950
 the marina of institutions as usual la 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.730
 Our meal of him as flour 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.099
 very important for the rich of 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.000
 carotenoids also for this derives to the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.300
 yellow sun a very digestible flour 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.090
 rich in proteins and but of which 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.980
 the user is not very unsuitable 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.410
 celiac but still very kind with 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.840
 come on we will go today to prepare this 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 recipe with let's say a high focaccia 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.230
 interaction and for this they will help 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.079
 missing that will make the Yankee 900 grams 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.679
 of water 5 grams of brewer's yeast 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:00.160
 dry 20 grams of salt and about 30 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:03.850
 grams of oil as we start we have 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.800
 our white flour to enter 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:18.600
 immediately both as yeast and with 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:22.140
 salt and let's go to oxygenate we enter 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.140
 almost with all the water 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.960
 we knead by taking always attacking 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.730
 always the flour from the edges of the photo la 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:40.600
 let's go in with the last water 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:47.200
 remained at this point we enter a bit of 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.790
 oil on the ready past we find ourselves with 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.370
 the dough in this way like 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.430
 let's manage this step let's go 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.510
 to take our daughter directly 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.510
 the just a game of oil 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.230
 let's brush it well 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.230
 take our balance 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.420
 with our pan above we find the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.720
 such and we are going to position over the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:20.840
 our meal then for a baking dish 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.989
 of the genus in this subject 15 40 use 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.790
 half a kilo of dough finished about 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.099
 generally the criticisms are found 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.260
 Almost all the casalini are 40 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.900
 perfect 15 meal meal then one 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.019
 baking pan 43 30 you will put a pound of 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.630
 dough then we take a simple one 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:44.620
 from rocco and we are going to level ours 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.459
 our dough once revealed 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.940
 our dough so without too much 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.879
 commitment 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.040
 we bump him into the bible in 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.260
 so that it continues to settle after having 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.150
 revealed let us rest 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.360
 let rise at a temperature 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.299
 constant about 30 ships and now we are 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.120
 in spring the oven would be enough with the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.450
 light on in winter maybe you need to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.790
 play a little with the thermostat e 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.359
 of the oven to a minimum to have these 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.030
 thirty degrees for about three hours after 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.910
 we're going to inform kids well 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.340
 they went about two and a half hours 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.910
 and our focaccia looks like this 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.930
 so let's go now to inform 220 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.650
 degrees at the bottom of our static oven 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.810
 our focaccia in hank is ready 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.530

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.519
 because we are going to season the same visa 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.099
