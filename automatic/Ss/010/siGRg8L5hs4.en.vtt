any<00:02:29.530> other<00:02:29.850> cpu<00:02:30.850> go<00:02:31.660> ahead<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.930> look<00:02:31.990> at<00:02:32.110> the

any other cpu go ahead and look at the
bottom<00:02:32.730> okay<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.390> can<00:02:34.540> see<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:36.160> pin<00:02:36.370> patterns

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
bottom okay you can see the pin patterns

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.340 
bottom okay you can see the pin patterns
are<00:02:36.880> different<00:02:37.360> they're<00:02:37.510> much<00:02:37.690> closer<00:02:37.959> that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
are different they're much closer that

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.500 
are different they're much closer that
is<00:02:38.530> because<00:02:39.090> AMD<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.270> using<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.140> 32<00:02:41.890> nanometer

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
is because AMD is using a 32 nanometer

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
traditional 45 nanometer which gives you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.220 
traditional 45 nanometer which gives you
