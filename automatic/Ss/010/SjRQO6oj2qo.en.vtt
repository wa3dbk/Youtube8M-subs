00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.400

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.629
 good 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.550
 this week a wave vr6 on the dynamometer 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.380
 so that we do here is come to 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.599
 he is for garcia chance one has 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.040
 blessed mileage okay yes he 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.899
 has one another 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.180
 on the plaque yes how insist another 3000 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.920
 to be precise 300 3000 almost indeed 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.470
 a nouwens 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.790
 there will be 174 hp in it but I see 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.260
 you had the statements about a 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.239
 air filter needs that extra power 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.280
 deliver 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.050
 let it be half a week were not like that 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 160 hp delivers then I am long 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.809
 satisfied and after 160 hp we go for it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179
 to 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.460
 hey and gisbert pretty old i have for you 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.810
 regularly 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.150
 yeah the super that remains beautiful vr6 you already 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.980
 sounds sounds just right good at 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.110
 the the exhaust and air filter that make 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.060
 with your balls make the sound just do it 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.250
 who also the with the power you think I 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.140
 do n't think that added a lot 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.450
 finally got it all small 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.190
 bit helps say but given say 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.050
 but the power what he what he delivers 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.690
 then actually one is almost original 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.250
 few paprika nasa but about five 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.680
 percent power and torque 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.800
 a little too low but otherwise yes you do it 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.780
 well you do the engine 30,000 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.430
 kilometer driven overhauled 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.590
 that now also has to do well 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.130
 actually that I am the mileage 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.810
 high 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.250
 only that is the carriage and the engine is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.160
 actually is just fresh 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.720
 who yes look has the container I am has 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.240
 still the first bin is just that 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.310
 already has the best time 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.380
 we indicate it is really there 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.110

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.080
 golf vr6 buy with three bowl on the counter 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.300

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.620
 frankly for lock that outro 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.769
