hi<00:00:00.780> I'm<00:00:00.900> PGA<00:00:01.319> member<00:00:01.439> Jay<00:00:01.770> golden<00:00:01.979> talking

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hi I'm PGA member Jay golden talking

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.820 
hi I'm PGA member Jay golden talking
about<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.210> numbers<00:00:03.629> on<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> golf<00:00:04.200> ball<00:00:04.529> and

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
about the numbers on a golf ball and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.810 
about the numbers on a golf ball and
what<00:00:05.670> they<00:00:05.850> mean<00:00:07.099> first<00:00:08.099> I'll<00:00:08.280> say<00:00:08.490> what<00:00:08.670> they

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
what they mean first I'll say what they

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.419 
what they mean first I'll say what they
don't<00:00:09.120> mean<00:00:09.440> they<00:00:10.440> don't<00:00:10.620> mean<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.219> ball

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
don't mean they don't mean that the ball

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.640 
don't mean they don't mean that the ball
is<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> different<00:00:12.389> weight<00:00:12.630> or<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> different

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
is a different weight or a different

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.220 
is a different weight or a different
size<00:00:13.980> or<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> dimpled<00:00:15.450> pattern<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
size or that the dimpled pattern is

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.400 
size or that the dimpled pattern is
different<00:00:16.800> if<00:00:17.359> it's<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.539> same<00:00:18.810> ball<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.380> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
different if it's the same ball out of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920 
different if it's the same ball out of
the<00:00:19.650> same<00:00:19.890> package<00:00:20.510> they'll<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.720> different

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the same package they'll have different

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.950 
the same package they'll have different
numbers<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.210> basically<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> reason<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
numbers and basically the reason that a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.130 
numbers and basically the reason that a
ball<00:00:25.289> has<00:00:25.800> different<00:00:26.369> numbers<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.930> that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
ball has different numbers is so that

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.179 
ball has different numbers is so that
you<00:00:28.380> know<00:00:28.680> your<00:00:29.099> ball<00:00:29.630> for<00:00:30.630> example<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.380> have

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you know your ball for example I have

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.370 
you know your ball for example I have
two<00:00:32.430> balls<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:33.090> both<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> them<00:00:33.780> made<00:00:34.079> by<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
two balls here both of them made by the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.459 
two balls here both of them made by the
company<00:00:34.739> Swick's<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.120> they<00:00:36.930> both<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
company Swick's on and they both have a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.639 
company Swick's on and they both have a
number<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:39.079> well<00:00:40.079> let's<00:00:40.379> say<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
number one on them well let's say that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.889 
number one on them well let's say that
I'm<00:00:40.950> playing<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.579> someone<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.270> say<00:00:42.629> on

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
I'm playing with someone and I say on

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.830 
I'm playing with someone and I say on
the<00:00:43.050> first<00:00:43.260> tee<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> strix<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the first tee I have a strix on one and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
the first tee I have a strix on one and
he<00:00:46.559> said<00:00:46.800> well<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> also<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> Swick's<00:00:48.059> on

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
he said well I also have a Swick's on

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.930 
he said well I also have a Swick's on
one<00:00:48.590> we<00:00:49.590> would<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.870> whose<00:00:51.870> ball<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.260> who

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
one we would not know whose ball is who

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.660 
one we would not know whose ball is who
unless<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.930> another<00:00:55.370> identifiable<00:00:56.370> mark

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
unless we put another identifiable mark

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.619 
unless we put another identifiable mark
which<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.390> generally<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.469> dot<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.579> two<00:00:59.910> dots<00:01:00.210> on

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
which is generally a dot or two dots on

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.650 
which is generally a dot or two dots on
the<00:01:00.930> ball<00:01:01.579> another<00:01:02.579> reason<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> say<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the ball another reason that you say the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.990 
the ball another reason that you say the
number<00:01:03.840> ball<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.580> say<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> have

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
number ball is that if I say I have

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
number ball is that if I say I have
Astrix<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.170> someone<00:01:07.950> says<00:01:08.159> oh<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.520> also

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
Astrix on one and someone says oh I also

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.000 
Astrix on one and someone says oh I also
have<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> strict<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.409> Swick's<00:01:10.770> on

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
have a strict on but it's a Swick's on

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
have a strict on but it's a Swick's on
three<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:13.350> case<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:14.310> would<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.700> whose

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
three in that case we would know whose

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
three in that case we would know whose
ball<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.540> who<00:01:15.750> because<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.350> hit<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> wrong

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
ball is who because if you hit the wrong

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.870 
ball is who because if you hit the wrong
ball<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.270> two-stroke<00:01:18.780> penalty<00:01:19.880> another

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
ball it's a two-stroke penalty another

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880 
ball it's a two-stroke penalty another
reason<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.600> are<00:01:21.720> numbers<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
reason that there are numbers on the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.090 
reason that there are numbers on the
ball<00:01:23.270> let's<00:01:24.270> say<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.540> hit<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> ball<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.890> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
ball let's say you hit a ball that is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.859 
ball let's say you hit a ball that is
near<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.790> bounds<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> want<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> hit<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
near out of bounds and you want to hit a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.590 
near out of bounds and you want to hit a
provisional<00:01:28.500> ball<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.610> might<00:01:29.850> say<00:01:30.180> well<00:01:30.450> I'm

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
provisional ball you might say well I'm

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.020 
provisional ball you might say well I'm
hitting<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.960> Swick's<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.729> time

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
hitting a Swick's on one but this time

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.010 
hitting a Swick's on one but this time
I'm<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.659> hit<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> Swick's<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.680> three<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
I'm going to hit a Swick's on three and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.330 
I'm going to hit a Swick's on three and
the<00:01:37.020> reason<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.070> same

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the reason you don't want the same

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
the reason you don't want the same
number<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.479> same<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.439> different

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
number on the same on the different

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.950 
number on the same on the different
balls<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.240> one

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
balls is that when you get there if one

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.300 
balls is that when you get there if one
is<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> bounds<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> other

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
is a little out of bounds and the other

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.969 
is a little out of bounds and the other
one<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.610> little<00:01:44.850> inbounds<00:01:45.540> which<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.829> your

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
one is little inbounds which one is your

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.460 
one is little inbounds which one is your
original<00:01:47.189> ball<00:01:47.700> actually<00:01:48.390> according<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
original ball actually according to the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
original ball actually according to the
rules<00:01:49.680> you'd<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.220> declare<00:01:50.579> both<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.090> them

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
rules you'd have to declare both of them

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
rules you'd have to declare both of them
lost<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:52.259> back<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> tee<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> you're

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
lost go back to the tee and you're

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.010 
lost go back to the tee and you're
hitting<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.750> fifth<00:01:55.110> shot<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.479> there's<00:01:57.780> no

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
hitting your fifth shot so there's no

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
hitting your fifth shot so there's no
real<00:01:58.290> reason<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:58.770> numbers<00:01:59.310> except<00:01:59.729> for
