00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.560 
once is you put the signals on the on
the<00:03:06.560> symbols<00:03:07.010> for<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> bass<00:03:08.180> drum<00:03:08.420> when

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
the symbols for the bass drum when

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:19.120 
the symbols for the bass drum when
you're<00:03:08.720> going<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:08.960> double<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.650> snare

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:46.290 

you

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.880 

the<00:03:47.300> drums<00:03:47.540> really<00:03:47.930> cool<00:03:48.140> but<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> idea<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.650> to

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
the drums really cool but the idea is to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.740 
the drums really cool but the idea is to
get<00:03:48.980> comfortable<00:03:49.190> with<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.580> movement<00:03:49.910> itself

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.790 

phrase<00:03:56.750> around<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.140> drums<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:57.560> make<00:03:57.680> it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
phrase around the drums and make it

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.030 
phrase around the drums and make it
really<00:03:57.920> cool<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.550> think<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.120> sounds<00:03:59.239> really

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
really cool I think it sounds really

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.440 
really cool I think it sounds really
interesting<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.610> make<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.120> little<00:04:02.330> ball

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
interesting and make it a little ball

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.320 
interesting and make it a little ball
it's<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:02.870> cool<00:04:03.110> but<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:04.069> simply<00:04:04.310> just<00:04:04.400> you

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
it's so cool but it's simply just you

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.040 
it's so cool but it's simply just you
