00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.060
 a teacher in the history book I see 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.920
 that the homeland was between 1810 and 1816 here 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.110
 says it was a time of indecision 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.400
 policy in which the Creoles after 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.560
 to achieve independence from Spain 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.390
 they sought to agree on the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.420
 best way to govern the new nation 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.060

 there is progress as it is possible that after 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.270
 of so much effort to get the 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.400
 independence in 1810 three years later 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.820
 the criollos are seized as a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.220
 small child centralist generalist of 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.830

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.910
 It happens to me that I chew more gum 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.350
 chontaduro on the donkey but professor 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.510
 it occurred to us that the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.640
 president of that time he will be able to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.610
 tell why they called Boa country 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.520
 so we're going to a date to grill on the 19th 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.770
 November 1811 do not forget to keep 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.900
 turned on its libraries by itself 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.910
 we need more clues of course 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.560
 Professor, we are going to look for some document 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.030
 to help us find answers to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:33.160
 cover them 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:37.660

 Mr. President and with everyone account 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.200
 the presidents of the united provinces 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.630
 from new grenade in outgoing to incoming 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.300
 as well there have already been two presidents 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.760
 since 1810 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.070
 3 after July 20 at the first 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.020
 president I can fuck happy miguel to 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.450
 the nine months they chose don jorge 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.640
 tadeo and five months later he 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.550
 they chose don antonio nariño so many 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.680
 presidents in such a short time and leave 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.660
 back the question of the wave is not because 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.420
 to be gossip but it is that we are turned 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.490
 18 each province wants to have its own 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.769
 constitution and they are also fought 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.600
 each other the record of a brand have 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.000
 a centralist state but those of 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.010
 Cartagena Antioquia and Tuba want to have 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.810
 the capital and they ignore routine 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.880
 brand that say the capital should 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.740
 keep being holy faith with that mess 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.640
 It would not be weird in less than a year 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.160
 there's another president but I called them 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.300
 about the history of presidents 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.790
 we find that the homeland of a 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.530
 there were 16 presidents some of 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.950
 they arrived only weeks in the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.290
 presidency 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.060
 hello I have a good track exceeded in 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.090
 the internet I found that on October 4 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.130
 of 1812 the general congress was held 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.750
 of the united provinces where they treated 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.440
 to reach an agreement to end 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:03.630
 So much fighting was being a girl promptly 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.090
 gentlemen the best for the country is a 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.100
 federalist constitution let's follow the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.410
 example from the north that is from the 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.260
 united states of america each province 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.960
 must be autonomous with its own laws 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.020
 the state should only deal with the 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.210
 customs the army the couriers and the 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.330
 business with other nations is in 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.370
 such way is the state should deal with 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.340
 many more functions than you 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.100
 mentions the best is unity and follow 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.120
 the French example federalism is going 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.880
 to lead to failure federalism the 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.350
 centralism in the interior and professor no 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.139
 I understand why this is what they call it 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:47.580
 congress of the united provinces yes 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:49.770
 are divided by this teacher who 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.949
 happens ant in this book they say that 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.990
 May 26 , 1816, our homeland 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.330
 stopped being independent and we stopped 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.849
 be independent that you have to see 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.100
 tracing the traces of the past with 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.790
 readiness 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.790
 he told me 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.380
 what happens here, look at it, here comes Pablo 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.410
 morillo to the demon the independentistas 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.110
 see him he delivered us from the insurgents and 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.420
 He returned us to the kingdom of Spain 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.220
 he was right is located here they fought 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.290
 between compatriots and the army 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.930
 Realistically, I take the opportunity to resume 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.430
 viceroy I already know why they called this 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.920
 Homeland 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.510
 Well, not so much cheney tambo because 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.250
 In the end all this conflict was 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.410
 for defending the best ideas for 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.230
 form the fatherland but because there are people 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.020
 he called it the foolish homeland the answer the 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.960
 I found in the national library is 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.750
 this 1823 article written by the 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.670
 very antonio nariño and he titled it the 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.900
 motherland leaf and talks about what there was 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.900
 happened at that time 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:02.560
 teacher we have fulfilled 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.090
 and the Spanish conquered us in 1816 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.490
 finally when we achieve independence 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.080
 Well enjoy if we already know that the 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.020
 homeland no fire go during those years 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.940
 as we will now call that period and 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.280
 also prof and centralists and 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.870
 federalists were so fought not 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.790
 there was nothing that they agreed with and 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:23.360
 this seems to be a mission to overcome 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.800
 and the services
