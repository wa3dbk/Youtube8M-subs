and buy an expensive rig you can build

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.950 
and buy an expensive rig you can build
one<00:00:34.950> instead<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.090> let's<00:00:36.270> go<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> workshop

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
one instead so let's go to the workshop

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.530 
one instead so let's go to the workshop
and<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.230> started<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> pole<00:00:39.360> we're

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
and get started this is the pole we're

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.900 
and get started this is the pole we're
gonna<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.140> mount<00:00:40.290> our<00:00:40.530> camera<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.430> extends

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
gonna use to mount our camera it extends

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.900 
gonna use to mount our camera it extends
out<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.059> 24<00:00:42.750> feet<00:00:43.100> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.280> pick<00:00:44.430> these<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.610> at

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
out to 24 feet you can pick these up at

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.440 
out to 24 feet you can pick these up at
any<00:00:45.030> paint<00:00:45.300> store<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.730> most<00:00:47.730> cameras<00:00:48.210> can

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
any paint store and most cameras can

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
any paint store and most cameras can
work<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.140> system<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.039> need<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
work with this system you just need to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.930 
work with this system you just need to
have<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.059> tripod<00:00:51.989> mounting<00:00:52.440> hole<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.940> an

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
have a tripod mounting hole and an

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.630 
have a tripod mounting hole and an
accessible<00:00:54.719> shutter<00:00:55.020> switch<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.219> there's<00:00:56.399> two

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
accessible shutter switch so there's two

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.099 
accessible shutter switch so there's two
things<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.030> our<00:00:57.180> system<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:57.719> need<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> do

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
things that our system will need to do

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.310 
things that our system will need to do
remotely<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:59.449> tilt<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.140> aim

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
remotely one tilt it up and down to aim

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.460 
remotely one tilt it up and down to aim
and<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.370> press<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> shutter<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.170> way<00:01:04.290> we'll

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and to press the shutter the way we'll

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
and to press the shutter the way we'll
do<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.250> radio<00:01:05.580> control<00:01:06.030> system

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
do this is with a radio control system

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.170 
do this is with a radio control system
and<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.689> couple<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.020> servo<00:01:07.409> motors<00:01:07.939> now<00:01:08.939> when

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and a couple of servo motors now when

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.090 
and a couple of servo motors now when
you<00:01:09.330> plug<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.900> regular<00:01:10.320> motor<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.799> just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you plug in a regular motor it just

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.820 
you plug in a regular motor it just
spins<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> servo<00:01:12.659> motor<00:01:12.689> will<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
spins but a servo motor will go to a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.960 
spins but a servo motor will go to a
precise<00:01:14.400> location<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.840> control<00:01:16.970> okay

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
precise location that you control okay

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
precise location that you control okay
let's<00:01:18.450> build<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
let's build it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
let's build it
I'll<00:01:19.470> make<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> rig<00:01:20.100> using<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:21.180> inch<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
I'll make the rig using one inch and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
I'll make the rig using one inch and
half<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.830> inch<00:01:23.009> wood<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> picked<00:01:23.850> up

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
half by one inch wood that I picked up

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
half by one inch wood that I picked up
at<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.150> hobby<00:01:24.390> store<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:25.229> could<00:01:25.439> also<00:01:25.560> use

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
at the hobby store you could also use

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.469 
at the hobby store you could also use
aluminum<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.610> plastic<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.450> built<00:01:28.409> two<00:01:28.680> frames

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
aluminum or plastic I built two frames

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.200 
aluminum or plastic I built two frames
one<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.810> attach<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> pole<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.820> second

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
one to attach to the pole and the second

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.469 
one to attach to the pole and the second
one<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.740> attached<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.979> camera<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:36.119> here's<00:01:36.329> how

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
one I attached the camera now here's how

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.010 
one I attached the camera now here's how
it<00:01:36.600> works

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it works

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.410 
it works
this<00:01:37.530> inner<00:01:37.770> frame<00:01:38.130> will<00:01:38.670> tilt<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.329> down

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this inner frame will tilt up and down

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
this inner frame will tilt up and down
to<00:01:39.720> aim<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> next<00:01:41.189> thing<00:01:41.400> I'll<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.700> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
to aim so the next thing I'll do is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.719 
to aim so the next thing I'll do is
position<00:01:42.570> my<00:01:42.720> camera<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.350> servo<00:01:43.950> inside<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
position my camera and servo inside the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.050 
position my camera and servo inside the
inner<00:01:44.880> frame<00:01:45.770> first<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> mark<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
inner frame first I want to mark the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
inner frame first I want to mark the
tripod<00:01:48.630> hole<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.200> my<00:01:49.259> camera<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.159> where

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
tripod hole on my camera so I know where

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.560 
tripod hole on my camera so I know where
that<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.960> take<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.680> marker<00:01:53.570> okay

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that is just take a little marker okay

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
that is just take a little marker okay
next<00:01:55.049> I'm<00:01:55.170> gonna<00:01:55.290> place<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> frame

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
next I'm gonna place this in the frame

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.030 
next I'm gonna place this in the frame
and<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.840> servo<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> act<00:01:58.770> as

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and this little servo is going to act as

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.859 
and this little servo is going to act as

okay so now I'm gonna set it down and
Mark<00:02:59.299> for<00:02:59.599> a<00:02:59.659> couple<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.079> holes<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:01.659> now<00:03:02.659> I<00:03:02.690> can

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
Mark for a couple of holes and now I can

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.069 
Mark for a couple of holes and now I can
go<00:03:03.019> drill<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.540> project<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:05.959> this

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
go drill it on a project like this

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.479 
go drill it on a project like this
instead<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.709> measuring<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.280> drilling

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
instead of measuring and drilling

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.949 
instead of measuring and drilling
everything<00:03:08.000> at<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.150> beginning<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.810> good

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
everything at the beginning it's a good

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.629 
everything at the beginning it's a good
idea<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.319> put<00:03:09.500> them<00:03:09.560> together<00:03:09.709> one<00:03:10.129> piece<00:03:10.159> at<00:03:10.579> a

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
idea to put them together one piece at a

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:16.000 
idea to put them together one piece at a
time<00:03:13.000> okay<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.209> camera<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.139> the<00:03:15.530> shutter

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
time okay the camera and the shutter

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.220 
time okay the camera and the shutter
servo<00:03:16.459> are<00:03:16.700> ready<00:03:16.909> to<00:03:17.090> go<00:03:17.239> now<00:03:17.689> I<00:03:17.720> have<00:03:18.049> to

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
servo are ready to go now I have to

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.589 
servo are ready to go now I have to
mount<00:03:18.439> this<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.159> other<00:03:19.310> frame<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:20.420> I've

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
mount this in the other frame so I've

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.020 
mount this in the other frame so I've
left<00:03:20.840> some<00:03:21.170> space<00:03:21.319> on<00:03:21.709> one<00:03:21.889> side<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.519> place<00:03:22.790> the

left some space on one side to place the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.170 
left some space on one side to place the
other<00:03:23.150> servo<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.989> will<00:03:24.530> tilt<00:03:24.859> this<00:03:25.129> and<00:03:25.400> I'm

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
other servo that will tilt this and I'm

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.509 
other servo that will tilt this and I'm
also<00:03:26.389> going<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.659> use<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:27.170> bolt<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:28.129> opposite

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
also going to use a bolt on the opposite

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.150 
also going to use a bolt on the opposite
side<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.790> act<00:03:29.209> as<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> pivot<00:03:29.659> point<00:03:30.109> and<00:03:30.409> I'm

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
side to act as a pivot point and I'm

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.409 
side to act as a pivot point and I'm
gonna<00:03:31.280> mount<00:03:31.459> these<00:03:31.669> about<00:03:31.849> an<00:03:32.000> inch<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.389> a

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
gonna mount these about an inch and a

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.659 
gonna mount these about an inch and a
half<00:03:32.449> up<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:33.769> clear<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.340> bottom

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
half up so that I can clear the bottom

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.729 
half up so that I can clear the bottom
all<00:03:35.389> right<00:03:35.599> I'm<00:03:35.780> gonna<00:03:35.900> remove<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.410> camera

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
all right I'm gonna remove the camera

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.289 
all right I'm gonna remove the camera
before<00:03:37.040> this<00:03:37.129> next<00:03:37.370> step<00:03:39.849> I've<00:03:40.849> made<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> couple

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
before this next step I've made a couple

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.180 
before this next step I've made a couple
of<00:03:41.480> marks<00:03:41.780> on<00:03:41.959> my<00:03:42.260> frame<00:03:42.590> for<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:42.889> pivot

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
of marks on my frame for the pivot

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.159 
of marks on my frame for the pivot
points<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:43.849> now<00:03:44.209> I'm<00:03:44.359> going<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.599> attach<00:03:44.900> the

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
points so now I'm going to attach the

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.009 
points so now I'm going to attach the
servo<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.680> one<00:03:46.040> of<00:03:46.129> those<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.629> for<00:03:47.629> that<00:03:47.750> I'll

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
servo to one of those and for that I'll

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.349 
servo to one of those and for that I'll
use<00:03:48.349> this<00:03:48.949> little<00:03:49.159> servo<00:03:49.639> arm<00:03:49.879> these<00:03:50.030> come<00:03:50.239> in

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
use this little servo arm these come in

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.849 
use this little servo arm these come in
different<00:03:50.480> shapes<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.019> sizes<00:03:51.109> I'm<00:03:51.680> using

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
different shapes and sizes I'm using

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.589 
different shapes and sizes I'm using
this<00:03:52.040> round<00:03:52.280> one<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.609> they<00:03:52.699> just<00:03:52.730> pop<00:03:53.090> on<00:03:53.329> and

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
this round one and they just pop on and

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.399 
this round one and they just pop on and
off<00:03:53.750> like<00:03:53.989> that

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
off like that

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.830 
off like that
so<00:03:55.250> I'll<00:03:55.489> set<00:03:55.819> that<00:03:56.000> over<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.329> pivot<00:03:56.599> point

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
so I'll set that over the pivot point

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.659 
so I'll set that over the pivot point
and<00:03:57.019> then<00:03:57.440> I'm<00:03:57.530> going<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.709> tack<00:03:58.159> that<00:03:58.190> in<00:03:58.549> with

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
and then I'm going to tack that in with

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.399 
and then I'm going to tack that in with
a<00:03:58.699> couple<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.030> nails<00:03:59.269> now<00:04:00.019> when<00:04:00.290> you're

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
a couple of nails now when you're

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.869 
a couple of nails now when you're
working<00:04:00.650> with<00:04:00.680> nails<00:04:01.099> this<00:04:01.340> small<00:04:01.639> I<00:04:01.849> think

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
working with nails this small I think

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.099 
working with nails this small I think
it's<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.269> good<00:04:02.389> idea<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.750> hold<00:04:02.930> them<00:04:03.049> with

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
it's a good idea to hold them with

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.960 
it's a good idea to hold them with
pliers<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:03.650> not<00:04:03.769> just<00:04:03.979> smash<00:04:04.340> your<00:04:04.579> fingers

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
pliers and not just smash your fingers

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.110 
pliers and not just smash your fingers
so<00:04:05.720> I'll<00:04:05.930> set<00:04:06.199> this<00:04:06.319> in<00:04:06.530> here<00:04:06.889> and<00:04:07.069> Hammer<00:04:08.000> that

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
so I'll set this in here and Hammer that

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.379 
so I'll set this in here and Hammer that
in<00:04:11.019> okay<00:04:12.019> once<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.379> finish<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:13.180> I'm<00:04:14.180> gonna

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
in okay once I finish that I'm gonna

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:15.819 
in okay once I finish that I'm gonna
drill<00:04:14.659> a<00:04:14.690> hole<00:04:14.930> on<00:04:15.139> the<00:04:15.199> other<00:04:15.349> side<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.769> the

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
drill a hole on the other side of the

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.129 
drill a hole on the other side of the
frame<00:04:16.039> so<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:16.880> can<00:04:17.090> mount<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.510> bolt<00:04:17.870> for

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
frame so that I can mount this bolt for

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.069 
frame so that I can mount this bolt for
the<00:04:18.199> pivot<00:04:19.269> there's<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:20.419> hole<00:04:20.599> for<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.900> bolt

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
the pivot there's the hole for the bolt

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.529 
the pivot there's the hole for the bolt
and<00:04:21.409> I've<00:04:21.739> also<00:04:21.949> drilled<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.729> matching<00:04:23.240> one<00:04:23.389> in

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
and I've also drilled a matching one in

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.899 
and I've also drilled a matching one in
the<00:04:23.630> outer<00:04:23.780> frame<00:04:24.260> I've<00:04:25.159> also<00:04:25.310> mounted<00:04:25.789> my

into<00:05:25.010> so<00:05:25.430> that<00:05:25.460> you<00:05:26.000> know<00:05:26.120> which<00:05:26.300> joystick

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
into so that you know which joystick

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.170 
into so that you know which joystick
will<00:05:27.020> control<00:05:27.380> which<00:05:27.590> action<00:05:28.070> ok<00:05:29.000> this

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
will control which action ok this

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.450 
will control which action ok this
antenna<00:05:29.660> wire<00:05:30.020> here<00:05:30.380> can<00:05:30.530> just<00:05:30.710> hang<00:05:30.919> down<00:05:31.190> and

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
antenna wire here can just hang down and

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.670
