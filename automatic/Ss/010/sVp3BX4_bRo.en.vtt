- you know assert their dominance over

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.940 
- you know assert their dominance over
these<00:01:50.420> freshmen<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.289> makes<00:01:51.590> matters<00:01:51.799> just

these freshmen it makes matters just

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.940 
these freshmen it makes matters just
that<00:01:52.429> much<00:01:52.700> worse<00:01:52.999> because<00:01:53.990> if<00:01:54.439> you're<00:01:54.709> this

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.759 
in my hand this on the first day of high
school<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.540> something<00:04:03.690> that's<00:04:03.989> key<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.260> know<00:04:04.500> I

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
school is something that's key to know I

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.170

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
didn't do it I didn't think it was that

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.020

big<00:04:06.330> of<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.510> deal<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:07.500> was<00:04:07.800> probably<00:04:08.519> gonna<00:04:08.820> be

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
big of a deal so I was probably gonna be

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.060 
big of a deal so I was probably gonna be
late<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.420> every<00:04:09.690> class<00:04:09.959> regardless<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:10.950> the

late to every class regardless but the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.830 
late to every class regardless but the
