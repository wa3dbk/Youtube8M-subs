this cap does not sink fatigue to me it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.240 
this cap does not sink fatigue to me it
was<00:02:55.310> very<00:02:55.550> hard<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.150> blend<00:02:56.570> my<00:02:57.380> leave<00:02:57.650> out<00:02:57.890> with

was very hard to blend my leave out with

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.150 
was very hard to blend my leave out with
it<00:02:58.490> because<00:02:58.970> it's<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.810> loose<00:03:00.200> feel<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:00.980> can

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
it because it's so loose feel like I can

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.770

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.110 
lift it and you guys can see how loose
it<00:03:02.990> is<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.410> most<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.400> times<00:03:04.670> that's<00:03:04.970> why<00:03:05.090> I

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
it is and most of the times that's why I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.020 
it is and most of the times that's why I
like<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.600> get<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.810> petite<00:03:06.350> sort<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.100> took<00:03:07.850> my

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
head a little bit tighter because I did

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.590

not<00:03:09.890> use<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.310> combs<00:03:10.580> because<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.090> feel<00:03:11.420> like

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
you know like I was saying because the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.190 
you know like I was saying because the
weave<00:04:04.430> being<00:04:04.670> so<00:04:04.910> big<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.480> couldn't<00:04:05.750> blend<00:04:06.080> it

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
weave being so big I couldn't blend it

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.380 
weave being so big I couldn't blend it
in<00:04:06.320> stuff<00:04:06.560> like<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.920> needed<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.610> think<00:04:07.910> I<00:04:08.209> did

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
in stuff like I needed to I think I did

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.110 
in stuff like I needed to I think I did
a<00:04:08.420> pretty<00:04:08.510> good<00:04:08.930> job<00:04:10.900> right<00:04:11.900> there

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
a pretty good job right there

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.300 
a pretty good job right there
but<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.330> wig<00:04:14.540> was<00:04:14.840> still<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.560> little<00:04:15.830> too<00:04:16.130> big

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
but the wig was still a little too big

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.330 
but the wig was still a little too big
so<00:04:16.450> it's<00:04:17.450> making<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:18.049> bunch<00:04:18.320> up<00:04:18.530> at<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.979> bank

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
so it's making it bunch up at the bank

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.190 
so it's making it bunch up at the bank
okay<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.000> being<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:20.570> do<00:04:20.630> not<00:04:20.870> use<00:04:21.049> the
