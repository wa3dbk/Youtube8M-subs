00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
i've listed bit nervous about it but I

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.240 
i've listed bit nervous about it but I
was<00:02:08.690> more<00:02:08.870> confident<00:02:09.440> than<00:02:09.470> nervous<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:10.130> was

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
was more confident than nervous it was

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.390 
was more confident than nervous it was
like<00:02:10.400> I<00:02:10.610> knew<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.750> sciences<00:02:11.960> if<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.500> all<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.950> big

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
like I knew the sciences if it all I big

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.070 
like I knew the sciences if it all I big
read<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.730> should<00:02:14.000> work<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:14.630> i<00:02:14.660> did<00:02:14.780> was<00:02:14.870> i

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
read it should work so what i did was i

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.990 
read it should work so what i did was i
heated<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.440> simple<00:02:15.980> syrups<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.550> soft<00:02:16.790> ball

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
heated up simple syrups to the soft ball

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.320 
heated up simple syrups to the soft ball
stage<00:02:17.060> about<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.200> 220<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.400> 250<00:02:20.300> degrees

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
stage about like 220 to 250 degrees

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.840 
stage about like 220 to 250 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.410> then<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.980> pour<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.640> over

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
Fahrenheit and then I pour that over

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.030 
Fahrenheit and then I pour that over
blocks<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.960> cream<00:02:24.080> cheese<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.530> butter<00:02:24.680> and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
blocks of cream cheese and butter and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.650 
blocks of cream cheese and butter and
what<00:02:25.370> happened<00:02:25.730> was<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.330> shipper<00:02:26.540> is

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
what happened was this the shipper is

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.510 
what happened was this the shipper is
pretty<00:02:26.990> hot<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.440> melted<00:02:27.860> down<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.310> butter

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
pretty hot so it melted down the butter

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.580 
pretty hot so it melted down the butter
and<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.850> cream<00:02:28.940> cheese<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.960> good<00:02:30.290> amount<00:02:30.530> so

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.560 

that<00:02:36.590> way<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:36.890> could<00:02:37.040> whisk<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:37.970> mixture<00:02:38.360> up

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
that way I could whisk this mixture up

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.410 
that way I could whisk this mixture up
without<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:39.080> being<00:02:39.290> like<00:02:39.640> unwieldy<00:02:40.640> blocks<00:02:41.060> of

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
without it being like unwieldy blocks of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.330 
without it being like unwieldy blocks of
blogging<00:02:41.930> asst<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.530> plastic<00:02:43.130> pneus

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.290 

what's<00:02:50.340> cool<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.700> like<00:02:50.970> since<00:02:51.210> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
what's cool is that like since the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.510 
what's cool is that like since the
sugars<00:02:51.600> at<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> soft<00:02:52.020> ball<00:02:52.170> stage<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:53.280> more<00:02:53.490> you

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
sugars at a soft ball stage the more you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.690 
sugars at a soft ball stage the more you
aerate<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.360> fluffier<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.050> lighter<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.070> I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
aerate it the fluffier and lighter and I

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.510 
aerate it the fluffier and lighter and I
guess<00:02:57.330> more<00:02:57.660> like<00:02:57.960> tacky<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.800> gets<00:02:59.010> but

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
guess more like tacky like it gets but

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.290 
guess more like tacky like it gets but
when<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.760> combine<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.210> the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
when you combine that with the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.610 
when you combine that with the
creaminess<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.050> cream<00:03:01.290> cheese<00:03:01.320> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
creaminess of the cream cheese and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.620 
creaminess of the cream cheese and
butter<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.490> gets<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.790> almost<00:03:03.060> light<00:03:03.330> airy

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
butter it gets this almost light airy

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.560 
butter it gets this almost light airy
texture<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.770> it's<00:03:05.250> like<00:03:05.550> whipped<00:03:05.970> cream<00:03:06.120> with

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
texture and it's like whipped cream with

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.940 
texture and it's like whipped cream with
a<00:03:06.600> little<00:03:06.690> bit<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.050> Tang<00:03:07.260> eNOS<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.770> cream

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
a little bit of Tang eNOS in the cream

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.560 
a little bit of Tang eNOS in the cream
cheese<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:11.130> thought<00:03:12.060> my<00:03:12.210> back<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.540> that

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
cheese so I thought my back on that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.880 
cheese so I thought my back on that
because<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:12.930> was<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:13.320> probably<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.770> very

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
because that was like probably the very

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.400 
because that was like probably the very
first<00:03:14.250> time<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.460> like<00:03:14.820> my<00:03:15.360> intuition<00:03:16.080> as<00:03:16.350> a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
first time that like my intuition as a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.280 
first time that like my intuition as a
scientist<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.160> Baker<00:03:17.370> really<00:03:18.120> sort<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.080> hit

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
scientist and Baker really sort of hit

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.890 
scientist and Baker really sort of hit
them<00:03:19.440> hit<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.920> mark<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:21.000> was<00:03:21.180> great<00:03:23.900> my

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
them hit the mark and it was great my

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.010 
them hit the mark and it was great my
own<00:03:25.020> little<00:03:25.050> county<00:03:25.590> room<00:03:25.740> there
