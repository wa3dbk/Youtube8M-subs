want to do now is talk you through the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.129 
want to do now is talk you through the
Calder<00:00:14.580> range<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.089> explain<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> different

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
Calder range and explain the different

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.109 
Calder range and explain the different
features<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.529> each<00:00:16.770> hook<00:00:17.039> now<00:00:17.340> all<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.970> hooks

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
features of each hook now all the hooks

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.700 
features of each hook now all the hooks
in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> range<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.660> teflon-coated<00:00:19.080> which

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
in the range of teflon-coated which

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.470 
in the range of teflon-coated which
means<00:00:19.980> they<00:00:20.430> don't<00:00:20.670> reflect<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.119> light<00:00:21.300> as

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
means they don't reflect the light as

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.210 
means they don't reflect the light as
much<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> normal<00:00:22.289> hooks<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> harder<00:00:23.130> for

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
much as a normal hooks of a harder for

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.099 
much as a normal hooks of a harder for
the<00:00:23.340> fish<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.910> they<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.660> rust<00:00:24.900> as

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the fish to see they don't rust as

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.200 
the fish to see they don't rust as
easily<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.830> also<00:00:26.130> they<00:00:26.430> slip<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.939> easier

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
easily and also they slip in easier

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.390 
easily and also they slip in easier
because<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.570> teflon<00:00:27.990> coating<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.070> silky

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
because that teflon coating is so silky

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
because that teflon coating is so silky

moving<00:01:31.200> over<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> long<00:01:31.829> chain<00:01:32.100> X<00:01:32.400> it's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
moving over to the long chain X it's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
moving over to the long chain X it's
exactly<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> same<00:01:33.450> pattern<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.500> one

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
exactly the same pattern but it's one

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.620 
exactly the same pattern but it's one
wire<00:01:34.979> gauge<00:01:35.250> thicker<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> size<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
wire gauge thicker for the size so a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
wire gauge thicker for the size so a

size 8 long shank X is the same

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030 
size 8 long shank X is the same
thickness<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> size<00:01:39.630> 6<00:01:39.960> long<00:01:40.229> shank<00:01:40.530> and

thickness as a size 6 long shank and

thickness as a size 6 long shank and
it's<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> hook<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.700> use<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.150> I'm<00:01:42.270> fishing

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

the Longshanks all the time because they

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
faster than a short shank hook you may

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.319 
faster than a short shank hook you may
have<00:01:59.189> seen<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.430> i've<00:01:59.640> used<00:01:59.820> them<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.119> very

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
have seen that i've used them to very

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.760 
have seen that i've used them to very
good<00:02:00.509> effect<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> underwater<00:02:01.350> films

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
good effect on the underwater films

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.370 
good effect on the underwater films
particularly<00:02:02.250> parts<00:02:02.700> 5<00:02:02.939> &amp;<00:02:03.180> 6<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.960> took<00:02:04.170> fish

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
particularly parts 5 &amp; 6 or I took fish

particularly parts 5 &amp; 6 or I took fish
nearly<00:02:04.770> 40<00:02:05.189> pounds<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> size<00:02:05.939> 10<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
nearly 40 pounds on the size 10 so you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.419 
nearly 40 pounds on the size 10 so you
can<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.140> well<00:02:07.409> strong<00:02:07.770> enough<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.340> if

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
can see there well strong enough and if

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
can see there well strong enough and if
you<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:08.789> need<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> Nick<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> very<00:02:09.629> cute<00:02:09.929> fish

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you just need to Nick a very cute fish

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.260 
you just need to Nick a very cute fish
that's<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.129> pattern<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.550> use<00:02:11.730> now<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> one

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that's the pattern to use now the one

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.699 
that's the pattern to use now the one
situation<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.900> wouldn't<00:02:13.140> use<00:02:13.290> them

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
situation I wouldn't use them

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.770 
situation I wouldn't use them
if<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.430> using<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.760> very<00:02:15.030> very<00:02:15.120> short<00:02:15.540> hook

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
if I was using a very very short hook

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.959 
if I was using a very very short hook
link<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.409> part<00:02:16.769> six<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.189> tried<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.849> it

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
link in part six I tried it and it

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.729 
link in part six I tried it and it
didn't<00:02:18.239> work<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.540> lost<00:02:18.719> the<00:02:18.840> 30<00:02:19.019> pound<00:02:19.409> and<00:02:19.650> we

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
didn't work I lost the 30 pound and we

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.530 
didn't work I lost the 30 pound and we
knew<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:19.980> was<00:02:20.099> 30<00:02:20.310> pound<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.209> saw<00:02:21.420> it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
knew it was 30 pound because we saw it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.970 
knew it was 30 pound because we saw it
on<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.719> underwater<00:02:22.049> cameras<00:02:22.439> picking<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.890> up

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
on the underwater cameras picking it up

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.559 
on the underwater cameras picking it up
so<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.459> you're<00:02:23.579> getting<00:02:23.790> fish<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.329> sort

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
so if you're getting fish in that sort

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.420 
so if you're getting fish in that sort
of<00:02:24.599> situation<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.650> need<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.950> use<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> short

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
of situation you need to use a short

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.559 
of situation you need to use a short
shank<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.819> we've<00:02:26.939> got<00:02:27.090> something<00:02:27.359> perfect

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
shank and we've got something perfect

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.440 
shank and we've got something perfect
for<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.959> job<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.379> wide<00:02:28.739> gape<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.969> wide<00:02:30.180> gape

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
for the job a wide gape the wide gape

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.479 
for the job a wide gape the wide gape
cook<00:02:30.780> took<00:02:31.019> an<00:02:31.170> extremely<00:02:31.739> long<00:02:31.889> time<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.340> get

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
cook took an extremely long time to get

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.280 
cook took an extremely long time to get
right<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.120> Japanese<00:02:33.629> just<00:02:33.930> couldn't

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
right because the Japanese just couldn't

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.569 
right because the Japanese just couldn't
get<00:02:34.439> it<00:02:34.500> how<00:02:34.769> we<00:02:34.829> wanted<00:02:35.280> it

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
get it how we wanted it

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.369 
get it how we wanted it
we<00:02:35.819> wanted<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.239> beats<00:02:36.450> pointed<00:02:36.900> hook<00:02:37.109> because

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
we wanted a beats pointed hook because

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.080 
we wanted a beats pointed hook because
when<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> beat<00:02:37.950> point<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.370> hook<00:02:38.489> goes<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.939> it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
when a beat point it hook goes in it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.599 
when a beat point it hook goes in it
curves<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:40.680> got<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.829> curve<00:02:41.159> out<00:02:41.400> to

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
curves in so it's got a curve out to

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.190 
curves in so it's got a curve out to
come<00:02:41.819> out<00:02:42.030> which<00:02:42.209> means<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.019> most

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
come out which means it's the most

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.229 
come out which means it's the most
secure<00:02:43.560> pattern<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.189> get<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:44.939> we<00:02:45.030> didn't

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
secure pattern you can get but we didn't

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.030 
secure pattern you can get but we didn't
want<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.480> point<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.989> beat<00:02:46.290> because<00:02:46.919> that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
want the point to beat because that

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
want the point to beat because that
means<00:02:47.189> it's<00:02:47.430> facing<00:02:47.639> away<00:02:47.879> from<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.269> flesh

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
means it's facing away from the flesh

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.940 
means it's facing away from the flesh
and<00:02:48.689> it<00:02:48.750> doesn't<00:02:49.019> catch<00:02:49.200> hold<00:02:49.470> very<00:02:49.680> quickly

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and it doesn't catch hold very quickly

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.190 
and it doesn't catch hold very quickly
and<00:02:50.430> what<00:02:50.730> we've<00:02:50.879> eventually<00:02:51.389> got<00:02:51.540> hold<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.989> is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
and what we've eventually got hold of is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.679 
and what we've eventually got hold of is
the<00:02:52.530> perfect<00:02:53.040> combination<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.849> two<00:02:54.090> just

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
the perfect combination of the two just

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.449 
the perfect combination of the two just
a<00:02:54.810> slightly<00:02:55.290> curved<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.769> point<00:02:56.069> which<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.400> very

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
a slightly curved in point which is very

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.089 
a slightly curved in point which is very
very<00:02:56.819> secure<00:02:57.150> once<00:02:57.419> it<00:02:57.540> goes<00:02:57.689> in<00:02:57.989> but<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.769> very

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
very secure once it goes in but is very

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.740 
very secure once it goes in but is very
very<00:02:59.340> sharp<00:02:59.609> as<00:02:59.849> well<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.209> Nick's<00:03:00.480> hold

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
confidence in and the barbless version

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.679 
confidence in and the barbless version
is<00:03:28.919> exactly<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.549> same<00:03:29.729> pattern<00:03:30.000> still<00:03:30.449> a<00:03:30.510> very

obviously no barbed and heavier in the

obviously no barbed and heavier in the

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
wire as well and the reason I've made

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.119 
wire as well and the reason I've made
them<00:03:36.569> heavier<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.139> wire<00:03:37.349> there's<00:03:37.919> no

them heavier in the wire there's no

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.800 
them heavier in the wire there's no
barbed<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.609> get<00:03:38.760> in<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:38.970> way<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.569> if<00:03:39.659> you've

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
barbed to get in the way and if you've

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.179 
barbed to get in the way and if you've
got<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.959> thicker<00:03:40.260> wire<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.889> going<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.069> be

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
got a thicker wire it's going to be

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.189 
got a thicker wire it's going to be
slightly<00:03:41.519> more<00:03:41.790> secure<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.479> that's<00:03:42.959> the

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
slightly more secure and that's the

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.990 
slightly more secure and that's the
reason<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> only<00:03:43.949> barbless<00:03:44.280> hook<00:03:44.459> we<00:03:44.579> do<00:03:44.759> has

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
reason the only barbless hook we do has

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.939 
reason the only barbless hook we do has
got<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.209> curved<00:03:45.479> point<00:03:45.750> because<00:03:46.229> it<00:03:46.379> does<00:03:46.530> curve

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
got a curved point because it does curve

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.309 
got a curved point because it does curve
in<00:03:47.310> I'm<00:03:47.579> thinking<00:03:48.090> back<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.689> last<00:03:49.019> year's

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
in I'm thinking back to last year's

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.869 
in I'm thinking back to last year's
session<00:03:49.739> where<00:03:49.889> I<00:03:49.919> fished<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.280> big<00:03:50.459> lake<00:03:50.669> up

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
session where I fished the big lake up

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.599 
session where I fished the big lake up
maze<00:03:51.060> on<00:03:51.329> 10<00:03:51.989> bites<00:03:52.259> 10<00:03:52.829> fish<00:03:53.099> in<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> net<00:03:53.489> and

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
maze on 10 bites 10 fish in the net and

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.030 
maze on 10 bites 10 fish in the net and
the<00:03:53.669> biggest<00:03:54.030> one<00:03:54.180> was<00:03:54.299> 57<00:03:54.959> pounds<00:03:55.139> so<00:03:55.829> if<00:03:55.919> your

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the biggest one was 57 pounds so if your

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.379 
the biggest one was 57 pounds so if your

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
where I wouldn't use a wide gape hook

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.770 
where I wouldn't use a wide gape hook
and<00:04:11.099> that's<00:04:11.519> if<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:11.729> was<00:04:11.879> using<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.180> very<00:04:12.389> stiff

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780

mono hooklink 25 pounds like you if you

mono hooklink 25 pounds like you if you
