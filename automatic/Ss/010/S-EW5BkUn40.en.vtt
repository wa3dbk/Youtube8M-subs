anywhere but I think for here you need
that<00:03:29.430> balance<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.910> front<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.570> rear<00:03:30.750> grip<00:03:31.280> and

that balance of front and rear grip and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.729 
that balance of front and rear grip and
really<00:03:32.519> turn<00:03:32.730> in<00:03:32.880> because<00:03:33.180> last<00:03:34.140> we<00:03:34.350> need<00:03:34.530> man

this is this is designed to give you
better<00:03:44.670> straight-line<00:03:45.239> speed<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:46.049> if

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
better straight-line speed that if

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.020 
better straight-line speed that if
you're<00:03:46.650> actually<00:03:46.709> struggling<00:03:47.370> more<00:03:47.610> grip<00:03:47.850> and

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
you're actually struggling more grip and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.550 
you're actually struggling more grip and
here<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> recommend<00:03:48.630> actually<00:03:48.959> pen<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:49.410> all

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
here I recommend actually pen it's all

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.740 
here I recommend actually pen it's all
one<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.549> gives<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.820> more<00:03:50.850> grip<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.450> you

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
one so it gives you more grip but you

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.020 
one so it gives you more grip but you
lose<00:03:51.959> out<00:03:52.109> on<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.290> street<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.680> get<00:03:52.859> up<00:03:53.030> and

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
lose out on the street if you get up and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.789 
lose out on the street if you get up and
as<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.269> can<00:03:54.329> see<00:03:54.540> my<00:03:54.660> gearbox<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.320> quite

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
as you can see my gearbox is quite

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.370 
as you can see my gearbox is quite
different<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.220> normal<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.720> gearbox<00:03:58.170> is

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
different to normal and this gearbox is

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.199 
different to normal and this gearbox is
purely<00:03:58.980> designed<00:03:59.340> for<00:03:59.700> traction

litchi<00:04:00.810> as<00:04:01.140> always<00:04:01.590> for<00:04:02.040> traction<00:04:02.430> because

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
litchi as always for traction because

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.970 
litchi as always for traction because
that's<00:04:02.790> all<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.150> need<00:04:03.329> right<00:04:03.570> here<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.989> plus

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
that's all you need right here and plus

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
the seventh gear weighted right you'll

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.210 
the seventh gear weighted right you'll
never<00:04:06.660> get<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.049> it's<00:04:07.260> quite<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.470> short<00:04:07.680> gearbox

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
never get to it's quite a short gearbox

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.340 
never get to it's quite a short gearbox
and<00:04:08.519> for<00:04:08.730> me<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.090> gives<00:04:09.329> me<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.630> best

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
and for me this gives me the best

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.400 
and for me this gives me the best
traction
