00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
a friend as well but i think they paid

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
a friend as well but i think they paid
the<00:01:11.070> price<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.340> trying<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> run<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.420> cars<00:01:12.750> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the price for trying to run for cars I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
the price for trying to run for cars I
mean<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> look<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.070> any<00:01:14.220> other<00:01:14.310> car<00:01:14.700> any<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
mean if you look at any other car any of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
mean if you look at any other car any of
the<00:01:15.240> teams<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.780> running<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.229> two<00:01:16.470> cars

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the teams that are running on two cars

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.570 
the teams that are running on two cars
they<00:01:17.600> struggle<00:01:18.600> from<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.350> time<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
they struggle from time to time and I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.039 
they struggle from time to time and I
think<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.259> expand<00:01:22.259> into<00:01:22.740> four<00:01:23.460> cars<00:01:23.810> it's<00:01:24.810> not

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
think to expand into four cars it's not

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.990 
think to expand into four cars it's not
that<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.619> hard<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> run<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> cars<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.850> hard

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that it's hard to run the cars it's hard

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.429 
that it's hard to run the cars it's hard
to<00:01:27.119> collect<00:01:27.390> all<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> people<00:01:28.049> around<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
to collect all the people around that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.170 
to collect all the people around that
make<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.189> happen<00:01:29.250> properly<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> i<00:01:30.150> think

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
make it all happen properly and i think

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.390 
make it all happen properly and i think
that's<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.439> issue<00:01:31.590> they're<00:01:31.920> having<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> be

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that's the issue they're having to be

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
that's the issue they're having to be
honest<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.880> could<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.110> their<00:01:34.229> cars

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
honest I could see one of their cars

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740 
honest I could see one of their cars
going<00:01:34.710> okay<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> marbles<00:01:36.329> fall

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
going okay if if all the marbles fall

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.840 
going okay if if all the marbles fall
the<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.079> way<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.340> i<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.729> know

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the right way but but i think you know

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.170 
the right way but but i think you know
to<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.720> those<00:01:40.020> races<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.770> four<00:01:41.040> cars<00:01:41.280> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
to go to those races with four cars is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.600 
to go to those races with four cars is
biting<00:01:42.600> off<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:43.020> too<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.409> before<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.250> get<00:01:44.399> to

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.150 
got to make it work on the day and it's
as<00:05:14.350> simple<00:05:14.470> as<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:14.710> very<00:05:15.580> true<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.380> i<00:05:17.380> would

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
as simple as that very true and i would

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.129
