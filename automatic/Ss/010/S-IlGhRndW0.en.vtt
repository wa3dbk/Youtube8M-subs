00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.070
 having installed this torrent then there 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.149

 a very important thing 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.009
 we should cancel the connection 64 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.810
 bit 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.939
 exact even if you have 64 bits and you have to 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.390
 delete it because if for a bug of the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.930
 starting game with 64 bit will start 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.590
 and follow from 32 well once done 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.229
 what we are going to install the patch is the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.720

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.160
 once done, excuse the gods 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:35.500
