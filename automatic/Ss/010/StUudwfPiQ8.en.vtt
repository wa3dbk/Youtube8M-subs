00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.099
 with boxing's 1960 gtx penance 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.930
 people have already done some other 960 too 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.439
 that the box always a standard pny 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.939
 exaggerate in this one, the beast is big 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.890
 here so we'll see how the wave 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.470
 Only that can change that reference. 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.270
 You'll see there later then. 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.270
 that basic even on video and we show 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.020
 here the chips in video games 39 and 50 x 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.960
 12 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.510
 The hp of penance does not have much future 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.810
 of the box here they already made a way 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.150
 for you to see the board already has notion 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:49.610
 talk about milk, right? 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.900
 the xl model xls 8960 of two days then 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.490
 here talking a little more about the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.850
 room is not 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.760
 the technologies that it will get you 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.840
 provide some other bny products 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.740
 doing that old chan nobreaks here 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.189
 also it does not have there only that it plate that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.229
 Come listen already I took because it gives a tone a 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:17.210
 fall reflection 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.540
 Here's what I can do to make a 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.540
 door 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.590
 Bye, bye, I'm watching the goalkeeper a lot. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.390
 well conditioned, then you have 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.780
 always send enough this 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.730
 accessories that wave that mini hdmi 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 will you be able to call me to see already 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.510
 dvd is also what i came in here was 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.130
 plus the little animal has also been the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.310
 salvation but as always we will stop 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.310
 side 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.260
 Certainly the date you are going to buy 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.490
 the video card will no longer be 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.490
 will be more the current driver 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.820
 and here is the door and cycle here is a 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.210
 nvidia reference club nÃ© 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.460
 those certified by them and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.920
 works well, it's not because you do not have 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.080
 more fans and such that it's a bad cooler that 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.030
 the cow will stay warm logic will stay 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.150
 with the temperature is not a little higher 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.790
 that of others is not like it is 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.160
 but if you want nothing in 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.330
 terms of power and durability and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.280
 anything else 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.520
 even if it is a reference to the plate 1 spoon 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.100
 pretty right all black is gonna stay 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.340
 so on the board in a computer of 70 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.600
 remembering that there is no moleque plate here 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.290
 but realizing all black then going 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.989
 stay pretty here you have to see item 3 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.390
 displayport an hdmi video output is 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.790
 more or less a certain connection standard 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.370
 here are six pci express pins 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.380
 500 watt source already ensures 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.880
 quietly of the quality of the galley 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.980
 remembering that the only way we 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.430
 works with the best brands right? 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.080
 so I hope here is the phoenix's excellent 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.030
 a touch is very good, I'm going to leave and also 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.970
 in the video description here 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.220
 the clock in the quantity of bowl as 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.050
 she is in search of the gold for you 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.459
 and as it was people should bring 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.890
 some tests here for you showed 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.840
 a very good card was even who 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.400
 you know that gtx 960 is making a 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.530
 bit of success with board muh has a 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.640
 very good cost benefit wheel in 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.110
 any game of the present time 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.870
 is quietly and cost less than 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.170
 the older sisters of the 1970s and 1980s 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.329
 It is coming in 1980 or that and how 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.519
 you prefer it right then I go 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.750
 being this one that was of a box 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.870
 gt x 960 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.220
 a bny accelerate model neco in high school 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.830
 has concluded 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.180
 beautiful even in my opinion beauty 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.430
 so let's stop here and the guys 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.430
 until the next boxe was Czech
