 capacious oil I will add more 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.590
 mustard into the ground and so for a start we 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.739
 we need our vegetables to sort our cabbage 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.140
 into florets and grate on morkovochku 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.980
 the grater we made out our cabbage on 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.640
 inflorescences finely grated carrot 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.189
 our vegetables we put off the chair and and we will 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.000
 prepare the sauce that we will pour 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.720
 our cabbage 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.350
 for this we take sour cream 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.350
 dates at sound 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.010
 add sour cream about dining room 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:31.369
 spoon adding mustard which with 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:41.020
 seeds of those mountain salt pepper to taste 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:47.750
 and up must add one or two spoons 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:56.420
 semolina and one of hong kong such 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:57.649
 here is incomplete and this is the sauce we 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.990
 mix 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:09.649
 we do not have such a homogeneous 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:12.590
 the consistency of this sauce will help our 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:18.290
 set to look like I would bow 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.350
 casserole such why because somehow 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.329
 by itself it is not caught by them 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.720
 don't use eggs here is our sauce ready 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:34.630
 Now 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:39.650
 preferably this is all we stir to 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:45.160
 every cabbage we had was covered on 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.420
 sponsorship and so we cabbage 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.329
 intermingled with our sauce 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.940
 then we take the form I have enough 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:59.230
 big flat and pour vegetable 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:05.680
 oil you can use naturally 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.680
 some butter 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.900
 and then I will sum you the cabbage 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.810
 distribute in a thin layer and in order 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.810
 she's been good at us 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.190
 then I put our cabbage on 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.960
 preheated oven to about 220 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.930
 degrees while we have 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.030
 she will not get a little light then we 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.190
 we will rub cheese and we will strew and and from above cheese and 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.600
 so here is our cabbage she arrived at 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:01.470
 us oven for about 35 minutes and then we 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.070
 sprinkle it with cheese and order it 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:10.530
 coped and and caused such an appetizing 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:14.480
 crust and further we put further on not 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.370
 more than 10 minutes oven 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.250
 principle there is empty already at this stage 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:27.600
 we are ready if there are on a strict diet 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.920
 Nurtas and we add and so we send 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.310

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.020

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:43.370
