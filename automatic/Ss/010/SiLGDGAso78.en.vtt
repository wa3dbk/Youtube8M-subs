00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:08.340
 Good health to all I want to share 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.559
 with you one of his little experience gear 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.530
 I bought from time to time 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.780
 bananas so i usually don't mean them 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.480
 i use or very rarely they usually 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.570
 go for the preparation of certain dishes 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.300
 mainly drinks it is mostly green 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.750
 cocktail or some other smoothie there 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.050
 yet what nut and then it happens that 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.420
 you buy a ram like a little more 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 not matured even though I know how to choose 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.149
 ripe bananas are worth mature no 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.539
 or another such acronis 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.219
 now I bought brightly almost ripe already 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.289
 but they would have a few more days to stay 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.219
 wait for them to taste 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 how do i keep a banana like this lying in 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.860
 I do not recommend storing bananas 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.740
 because under their weight alone 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.150
 crush themselves and starts 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.100
 spoil is best to use 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.180
 use another way which 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.650
 will show you a second 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.990
 The idea of this need to find in my kitchen 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.920
 I want to show you here on this 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.640
 An example from me is the usual kitchen here 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.880
 the door that we rarely use and I 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.820
 here on this 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.409
 door handle tied can be a friend 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.770
 a place like that cozy cool dark 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.610
 Well, not very cold so I tied here 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.220
 such a rope tied up just in 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.570
 a bunch of ring now show you what 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.570
 I will continue to do 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:15.380
 was seen so on in this ring i 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:18.530
 selling my bananas 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:25.269
 neatly do nothing to harm 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:30.410
 don't break here like this in a second 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:36.079
 lower lower the camera and so and so 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.290
 Now I will raise why and this 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:42.049
 banana position 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.040
 calmly hang here this is a place in 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.940
 bananas are the hardest and with contact 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.609
 safe 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.329
 for him you can hang bans he will 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:57.829
 hang well stored and plus ripen 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.579
 so if you bought green bananas 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.950
 By the way, too, you can do poetry in 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:07.010
 a room in the kitchen or somewhere else friend 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.019
 a place where it is quite warm comfortable 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.940
 rooms temperature and not for a few 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.500
 days will ripen even if they initially 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.480
 will be green here I personally 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.540
 I will use about two or three 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.400
 banana a day that is tomorrow i will do 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.320
 green smoothie from these banana them 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.440
 now here are six pieces ie two 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.520
 days they are enough if two days 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.480
 they will lie just somewhere that is 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.250
 The chance that they will start to deteriorate 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.350
 where they come into contact with 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.800
 surface if they so will 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.530
 hang 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.080
 then without any bad consequences they 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.580
 so can hang 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:55.780
 I think even days 3-5 and they will not 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.550
 spoil only in places where they used to be 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.560
 maybe I hit it here 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.450
 but this is so second here 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.209
 firmly everything therefore I think it was damaged 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.590
 only the peel inside the banana is good 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.380
 somewhere here I saw 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:17.260
 darina has a place and as well as principle 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.330
 the banana light will quietly hang and 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.419
 wait for your fate where he will fall 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.530
 In principle , this is all short if you have 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.240
 have their own ways of storing them bananas 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.030
 which I may not know and a 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.090
 ineffective will be glad to hear in 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.520
 comments leave your options 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.520
 thanks for watching, see you bye
