pieces<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.790> ages<00:00:12.120> 7<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.540> 12<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.170> believe

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
pieces and as ages 7 to 12 I believe

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.019 
pieces and as ages 7 to 12 I believe
this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.580> best<00:00:14.969> sets<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.540> 2010<00:00:16.320> and

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
this is one of the best sets of 2010 and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.880 
this is one of the best sets of 2010 and
arguably<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> best<00:00:18.930> army<00:00:19.470> builders

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
arguably one of the best army builders

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.990 
arguably one of the best army builders
for<00:00:20.580> any<00:00:20.699> army<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.300> time<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
for any army of all time it is the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.320 
for any army of all time it is the
second<00:00:24.000> best<00:00:24.480> droid<00:00:25.050> army<00:00:25.380> builder<00:00:26.330> second

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
second best droid army builder second

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.169 
second best droid army builder second
only<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.890> best<00:00:29.160> battle<00:00:29.640> pack<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.029> all

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
only to the the best battle pack of all

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.920 
only to the the best battle pack of all
time<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.199> droids<00:00:31.560> battle<00:00:31.890> pack<00:00:32.130> from<00:00:33.030> 2007

time the droids battle pack from 2007

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
time the droids battle pack from 2007
and<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.680> believe<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.520> arguably<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> best

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and I believe it is arguably the best

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
and I believe it is arguably the best
battle<00:00:36.510> pack<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:36.840> time<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.770> I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
battle pack of all time because I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
battle pack of all time because I
included<00:00:38.160> three<00:00:38.460> super<00:00:38.700> battle<00:00:38.940> droids<00:00:38.969> which

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
included three super battle droids which

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.799 
included three super battle droids which
we<00:00:39.480> hadn't<00:00:39.750> seen<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.170> over<00:00:40.620> five<00:00:41.070> years<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.809> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
let's go ahead and get started

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.369 
let's go ahead and get started
includes<00:00:52.559> twelve<00:00:53.399> minifigures<00:00:54.230> this<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
includes twelve minifigures this is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.090 
includes twelve minifigures this is
great

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
great

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.459 
great
it's<00:00:56.460> almost<00:00:56.610> $2<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> minifigure<00:00:58.109> although

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's almost $2 a minifigure although

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's almost $2 a minifigure although
most<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> them<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.309> droids<00:00:59.640> which<00:01:00.629> are

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
most of them are droids which are

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.609 
most of them are droids which are
chiefly<00:01:01.140> manufactured<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> yeah<00:01:03.719> let's<00:01:04.530> go

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
chiefly manufactured so yeah let's go

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.600 
chiefly manufactured so yeah let's go
ahead<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:04.920> started<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.309> guess<00:01:05.400> we'll

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
ahead and get started I guess we'll

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.750 
ahead and get started I guess we'll
start<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> best<00:01:06.479> figure<00:01:06.689> oh<00:01:07.729> yeah<00:01:08.729> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
start with the best figure oh yeah I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.990 
start with the best figure oh yeah I
guess<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> best<00:01:09.360> figure<00:01:09.659> um<00:01:10.140> Jar<00:01:10.530> Jar<00:01:10.650> Binks

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
guess the best figure um Jar Jar Binks

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.660 
guess the best figure um Jar Jar Binks
Jar<00:01:12.000> Jar<00:01:12.090> Binks<00:01:12.680> comes<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> handle

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
Jar Jar Binks comes with the handle

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.100 
Jar Jar Binks comes with the handle
thing<00:01:14.850> which<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.240> could<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.659> care<00:01:15.750> less<00:01:15.930> for

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
thing which I could really care less for

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
thing which I could really care less for
and<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.799> no<00:01:17.130> idea<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.640> called<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and I have no idea what it's called so

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
and I have no idea what it's called so
I'm<00:01:18.270> gonna<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.540> pull<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> off<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.830> we're

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
I'm gonna just pull it off and we're

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.219 
I'm gonna just pull it off and we're
gonna<00:01:20.040> forget<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.729> even<00:01:21.119> came<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.750> right

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
gonna forget it even came with it right

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.640 
gonna forget it even came with it right
that's<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.770> thought<00:01:24.290> let's<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.439> get

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that's what I thought let's go get

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.859 
that's what I thought let's go get
closer<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.270> bit<00:01:27.360> easier<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
closer it's a little bit easier and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.929 
closer it's a little bit easier and
let's<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.740> started

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
let's get started

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:39.870 
let's get started
plane<00:01:30.479> dark<00:01:30.900> grey<00:01:31.140> legs<00:01:33.890> torso<00:01:34.890> printing

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.030 

very<00:01:40.510> detailed<00:01:41.140> there<00:01:41.500> in<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.800> torso

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
very detailed there in the torso

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.580 
very detailed there in the torso
printing<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.580> think<00:01:42.790> an<00:01:43.420> even<00:01:43.630> has<00:01:43.900> back<00:01:44.170> torso

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
printing I think an even has back torso

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.040 
printing I think an even has back torso
printing<00:01:44.979> which<00:01:45.190> I<00:01:45.400> really<00:01:46.210> don't<00:01:46.450> get<00:01:46.780> why

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
printing which I really don't get why

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.410 
printing which I really don't get why
they<00:01:47.229> like<00:01:47.890> some<00:01:48.130> figures<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.790> suck<00:01:49.090> and

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
they like some figures just suck and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.000 
they like some figures just suck and
then<00:01:49.510> they<00:01:49.660> do<00:01:49.720> this<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:50.380> other<00:01:50.530> figures

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
then they do this this other figures

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:01.859 
then they do this this other figures
which<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.460> pointless<00:01:51.760> cuz<00:01:59.009> cuz<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.869> mean

best figure in the set is the droid
pilot<00:03:28.480> which<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.650> old<00:03:29.799> one<00:03:30.010> just<00:03:30.040> had<00:03:30.310> a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
pilot which is the old one just had a

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.789 
pilot which is the old one just had a
plain<00:03:30.640> blue<00:03:31.060> body<00:03:31.299> now<00:03:31.630> they<00:03:31.810> puts<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.620> all<00:03:32.769> a

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
plain blue body now they puts it all a

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.190 
plain blue body now they puts it all a
little<00:03:32.980> bit<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.310> tan<00:03:33.519> makes<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.570> look<00:03:34.720> much

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
little bit of tan makes it look much

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.509 
little bit of tan makes it look much
better<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:40.590> yeah<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.950> basically<00:03:42.280> about

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
better and so yeah it's basically about

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.740 
better and so yeah it's basically about
droid<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.620> then<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.340> worst<00:03:46.120> figure<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.630> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
droid and then the worst figure of the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.990 
droid and then the worst figure of the
set<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.290> battle<00:03:47.620> droid<00:03:47.829> which<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.549> really

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
set the a battle droid which I really

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.530 
set the a battle droid which I really
don't<00:03:49.209> think<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:49.630> even<00:03:49.810> need<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.169> show<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:51.540> the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
don't think I even need to show you the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.610 
don't think I even need to show you the
battle<00:03:52.720> droid

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
battle droid

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.059 
battle droid
watch<00:03:53.769> there<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:55.090> yeah<00:03:55.239> um<00:03:56.049> main<00:03:56.590> feature<00:03:56.799> to

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
watch there so yeah um main feature to

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.640 
watch there so yeah um main feature to
set<00:03:57.310> obviously<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.239> Droid<00:03:58.750> carrier<00:03:59.140> which<00:03:59.440> I

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
set obviously the Droid carrier which I

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.369 
set obviously the Droid carrier which I
believe<00:03:59.950> is<00:04:00.129> just<00:04:00.159> a<00:04:00.750> much<00:04:01.750> better<00:04:01.930> remake<00:04:02.349> of

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
believe is just a much better remake of

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.820 
believe is just a much better remake of
the<00:04:02.650> 2001<00:04:03.250> droid<00:04:03.730> carrier<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:05.080> then<00:04:05.530> again

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
the 2001 droid carrier and then again

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.100 
the 2001 droid carrier and then again
the<00:04:06.030> 2007<00:04:07.030> tour<00:04:07.209> carrier<00:04:07.569> which<00:04:07.750> really

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
the 2007 tour carrier which really

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.140 
the 2007 tour carrier which really
wasn't<00:04:08.379> modeled<00:04:08.799> after<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.250> but<00:04:09.670> it's<00:04:09.909> a

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
wasn't modeled after that but it's a

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:19.229 
wasn't modeled after that but it's a
resemblance<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:15.780> yeah<00:04:17.100> um<00:04:18.100> but<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.760> 2001

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
resemblance so yeah um but the 2001

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.610 
resemblance so yeah um but the 2001
droid<00:04:19.449> carrier<00:04:19.750> was<00:04:19.900> definitely<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.440> model

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
droid carrier was definitely a model

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.420 
droid carrier was definitely a model

are very clumsy and hard to put into
places<00:04:54.850> I<00:04:55.000> guess<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:56.169> he<00:04:56.350> goes<00:04:56.500> in<00:04:56.680> there<00:04:56.860> and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
places I guess so he goes in there and

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.529 
places I guess so he goes in there and
then<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:57.430> can<00:04:57.550> put<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.789> other<00:04:57.820> one<00:04:58.090> back<00:04:58.120> here

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
then you can put the other one back here

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:06.140 
then you can put the other one back here
which<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.470> don't<00:05:00.280> see<00:05:00.400> any<00:05:00.520> point<00:05:00.729> in<00:05:00.910> but<00:05:03.180> yeah

very good design that they did here for

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.440 
very good design that they did here for
a<00:06:08.330> little<00:06:08.450> carrying<00:06:09.020> part<00:06:09.580> very<00:06:10.580> compact<00:06:11.030> in

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
a little carrying part very compact in

hard to break the droids if you have the

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.700 
hard to break the droids if you have the
MTT<00:06:16.670> it<00:06:16.850> goes<00:06:17.030> great<00:06:17.450> with<00:06:17.570> the<00:06:17.810> MTT<00:06:18.200> this<00:06:18.500> set

MTT it goes great with the MTT this set
does<00:06:19.030> if<00:06:20.030> you<00:06:20.150> lost<00:06:20.390> your<00:06:20.540> droids<00:06:20.810> you<00:06:21.020> go<00:06:21.140> out

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
does if you lost your droids you go out

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.970 
does if you lost your droids you go out
buy<00:06:21.560> this<00:06:21.620> and<00:06:22.040> you<00:06:22.100> got<00:06:22.310> your<00:06:22.460> droids<00:06:22.700> back<00:06:23.980> so
