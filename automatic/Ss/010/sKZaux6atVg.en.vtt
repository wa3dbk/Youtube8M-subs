which I have not done any yet so but
this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> coolest<00:00:27.210> thing<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.630> wanted

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
this is just the coolest thing I wanted

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.839 
this is just the coolest thing I wanted
you<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> see<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.380> because<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.220> very<00:00:29.279> light

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
you to see it because it's very light

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.490 
you to see it because it's very light
and<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:30.990> put<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:32.600> tripod<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.200> then

this is what you did pull down this

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.540 
this is what you did pull down this
front<00:01:00.300> part<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.899> carries<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.550> canvases

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550

when<00:01:03.239> they're<00:01:03.449> dry<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.589> even<00:01:04.949> when<00:01:05.250> they're

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
when they're dry and even when they're

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.980 
when they're dry and even when they're
wet<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> problem

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
wet because you know that's the problem

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.890 
wet because you know that's the problem
with<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.470> painting<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.450> hard<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
with all painting is that it's hard to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
with all painting is that it's hard to
transport<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.650> because<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.460> wet

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
transport it because it's wet

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.690 
transport it because it's wet
so<00:01:12.720> I'll<00:01:13.619> open<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.159> open<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so I'll open it up open it like this and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.990 
so I'll open it up open it like this and
then<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.500> put<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.619> canvas<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.369> either<00:01:20.729> way

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
then you put your canvas on either way

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
then you put your canvas on either way
you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.580> this<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:24.080> it's<00:01:25.080> got<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> spring

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you can go this way it's got a spring

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.690 
you can go this way it's got a spring
water<00:01:26.009> things<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:27.470> can't<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:29.040> or

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
water things there can't go this way or

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.149 
water things there can't go this way or
that<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:34.320> right<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.740> pull<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
that way so then all right you pull that

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.460 
that way so then all right you pull that
down<00:01:36.380> pull<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.590> across<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.470> then
