the<00:00:28.160> first<00:00:28.369> game<00:00:28.490> yeah<00:00:28.640> I<00:00:28.669> was<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:29.599> peaks<00:00:29.960> and

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
the first game yeah I was the peaks and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.170 
the first game yeah I was the peaks and
bands<00:00:30.289> were<00:00:30.439> really<00:00:30.710> bad<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.130> then<00:00:31.789> even<00:00:32.060> the

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
bands were really bad and then even the

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.660 
bands were really bad and then even the
way<00:00:32.300> we<00:00:32.330> play<00:00:32.630> wasn't<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.020> vessel<00:00:33.440> it's<00:00:34.219> it

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
way we play wasn't the vessel it's it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.490 
way we play wasn't the vessel it's it
was<00:00:34.789> a<00:00:34.820> bit<00:00:35.480> of<00:00:35.570> everything<00:00:35.960> not<00:00:36.079> just<00:00:36.200> pick

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
was a bit of everything not just pick

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.959 
was a bit of everything not just pick
somebody<00:00:36.680> who<00:00:36.890> ya<00:00:37.039> when<00:00:37.520> i<00:00:37.550> was<00:00:37.700> talking<00:00:37.940> to

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
somebody who ya when i was talking to

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.400 
somebody who ya when i was talking to
high<00:00:38.149> after<00:00:38.390> because<00:00:38.870> you<00:00:38.989> picked<00:00:39.199> her<00:00:39.320> in

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
high after because you picked her in

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.650 
high after because you picked her in
exon<00:00:39.739> versus<00:00:40.129> kassadin<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:40.760> i<00:00:41.390> actually

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
exon versus kassadin and i actually

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.240 
exon versus kassadin and i actually
thought<00:00:41.960> that<00:00:42.199> next<00:00:42.829> one<00:00:42.920> would<00:00:42.980> do<00:00:43.100> pretty

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
thought that next one would do pretty

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.100 
thought that next one would do pretty
well<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:43.579> I<00:00:43.699> said<00:00:43.940> no<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.360> was<00:00:44.660> pretty<00:00:44.840> sure<00:00:45.079> I

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
well and I said no I was pretty sure I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.189 
well and I said no I was pretty sure I
was<00:00:45.199> going<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:45.559> beat<00:00:45.680> him<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:46.960> think<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.109> will

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
was going to beat him I think it will

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.439 
was going to beat him I think it will
have<00:00:48.379> equal<00:00:48.680> work<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.370> lot<00:00:49.489> better<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:49.910> the

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
have equal work a lot better but the

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.270 
have equal work a lot better but the
problem<00:00:50.780> is<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:50.989> didn't<00:00:51.350> practice<00:00:51.949> it<00:00:52.039> enough

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
problem is I didn't practice it enough

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.180 
problem is I didn't practice it enough
and<00:00:52.550> i<00:00:53.030> will<00:00:53.750> need<00:00:53.899> cyanide<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.680> come<00:00:54.890> meet<00:00:55.039> a

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
and i will need cyanide to come meet a

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.619 
and i will need cyanide to come meet a
lot<00:00:55.309> more<00:00:55.519> because<00:00:55.820> i<00:00:56.059> think<00:00:56.090> we<00:00:56.300> can<00:00:56.420> kill<00:00:56.600> him

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629
