00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.519 
pool let me tell you the story about a
top-level<00:00:24.060> pool<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.570> entered<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.990> redstone

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
top-level pool I entered a redstone

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.890 
top-level pool I entered a redstone
competition<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.369> reddit<00:00:26.760> now<00:00:27.330> mind<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.720> it's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
competition on reddit now mind you it's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.169 
competition on reddit now mind you it's
writes<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.279> thinking<00:00:29.550> it's

writes down right I'm thinking it's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.659 
writes down right I'm thinking it's
gonna<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.660> technical<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> way<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.340> what

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
gonna be like technical in a way so what

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.790 
gonna be like technical in a way so what
do<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> use<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.809> world's<00:00:34.290> smallest<00:00:34.440> t

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
do I use I use the world's smallest t

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.220 
do I use I use the world's smallest t
flip-flop<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> still<00:00:35.850> claim<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
flip-flop that I still claim is the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.630 
flip-flop that I still claim is the
smallest<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.980> made<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
smallest and then I made because I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.420 
smallest and then I made because I
modified<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> found<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.219> beat

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
modified one that I found and what beat

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.799 
modified one that I found and what beat
me<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.790> our<00:00:41.940> global<00:00:42.239> pool<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
me at our global pool like are you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.290 
me at our global pool like are you
freaking<00:00:43.350> kidding<00:00:43.379> me<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.000> this

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
freaking kidding me so this is it this

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.580 
freaking kidding me so this is it this
is<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:48.989> everything<00:00:49.289> gets<00:00:49.440> all

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
is it you know everything gets all

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
is it you know everything gets all
smooth<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.879> pool<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
smooth down then you have pool and you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
smooth down then you have pool and you
can<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.750> ahead<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.280> my

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
can go ahead and I go in there with my

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
can go ahead and I go in there with my
carryon<00:00:53.910> whatnot<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.809> turn<00:00:55.050> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
carryon whatnot and then like turn it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
carryon whatnot and then like turn it
off<00:00:55.289> okay<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.460> extremely<00:00:57.449> simple

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
off okay now this is extremely simple

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.860 
off okay now this is extremely simple
extremely<00:00:58.320> simple<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.660> wiring<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
extremely simple at the wiring on the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.529 
extremely simple at the wiring on the
Pistons<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> full<00:01:02.190> floor<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.699> pistons<00:01:03.239> on

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
Pistons like a full floor of pistons on

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.230 
Pistons like a full floor of pistons on
it's<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.379> tricky<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.790> involved

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's not tricky it's just more involved

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
it's not tricky it's just more involved
than<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.479> would<00:01:06.630> imagine<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.710> red

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
than you would imagine because the red

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.469 
than you would imagine because the red
Sun<00:01:08.070> has<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> get<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> every<00:01:09.030> pissed<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
Sun has to get to every pissed in the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.020 
Sun has to get to every pissed in the
middle<00:01:09.780> ones<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> basically

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
middle ones and all of that so basically

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
middle ones and all of that so basically
low<00:01:12.210> bow<00:01:12.420> dr<00:01:12.600> exact<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:13.979> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
low bow dr exact one that I have there I

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.920 
low bow dr exact one that I have there I
did<00:01:14.430> our<00:01:14.640> 8<00:01:14.939> x<00:01:15.150> 6<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.689> Pistons<00:01:16.310> 1<00:01:17.310> 2<00:01:17.580> 3<00:01:17.610> 4<00:01:18.030> 5<00:01:18.630> 6

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
did our 8 x 6 on the Pistons 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.969 
did our 8 x 6 on the Pistons 1 2 3 4 5 6
7<00:01:19.110> 8<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.439> place<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> bunch<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
7 8 and I then just place a bunch of

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.090 
7 8 and I then just place a bunch of
redstone<00:01:23.250> torches<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.470> then<00:01:25.470> place<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
redstone torches like so then place a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
redstone torches like so then place a
block<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:27.740> like<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:30.780> repped<00:01:31.049> on

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
block here like that and then repped on

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.179 
block here like that and then repped on
torches<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.650> here<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.799> mean<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> reason

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
torches here and here I mean the reason

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.649 
torches here and here I mean the reason
I<00:01:35.400> went<00:01:35.549> 6<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.600> just

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659

I went 6 with it is because I just
wanted<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.590> section<00:01:38.040> twice<00:01:38.430> that's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
wanted to do this section twice that's

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
you can do a bunch more up to you guys

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.249 
you can do a bunch more up to you guys
alright<00:01:45.180> basically<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.720> placing<00:01:46.079> blocks

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
alright basically just placing blocks

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.550 
alright basically just placing blocks
above<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.860> side<00:01:47.340> torches<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.560> right

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
above the side torches like that right

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.620 
above the side torches like that right
here<00:01:49.619> we're<00:01:49.799> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> put<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.899> repeaters

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
here we're going to put some repeaters

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.590 
here we're going to put some repeaters
redstone<00:01:54.630> dust<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.360> then<00:01:57.360> right<00:01:57.570> here

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
redstone dust here and then right here

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.350 
redstone dust here and then right here
going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> put<00:01:58.170> some<00:01:58.200> more<00:01:58.740> redstone<00:01:59.130> dust<00:01:59.759> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
going to put some more redstone dust and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.280 
going to put some more redstone dust and
then<00:02:01.229> some<00:02:01.469> more<00:02:01.740> repeaters<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
then some more repeaters here and in the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.550 
then some more repeaters here and in the
same<00:02:04.469> process<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.250> these<00:02:05.880> blocks<00:02:06.409> with<00:02:07.409> some

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
same process of these blocks with some

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.980 
same process of these blocks with some
redstone<00:02:07.740> torches<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.459> those<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.420> that

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
redstone torches on those like that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.910 
redstone torches on those like that
all<00:02:11.950> right<00:02:12.250> Bam<00:02:12.880> Bam<00:02:12.930> Bam<00:02:13.930> Bam<00:02:14.350> Bam<00:02:14.560> Bam<00:02:14.770> and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
all right Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.770 
all right Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam and
then<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:16.260> torches<00:02:17.260> again<00:02:17.500> here<00:02:18.660> torches<00:02:19.660> on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
then I torches again here torches on

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.770 
then I torches again here torches on
side<00:02:20.080> torches<00:02:20.800> everywhere<00:02:21.460> some<00:02:22.300> mass<00:02:22.510> amount

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
side torches everywhere some mass amount

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.240 
side torches everywhere some mass amount
of<00:02:22.840> torches<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.320> don't<00:02:23.800> know<00:02:23.890> there's<00:02:24.160> an

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
of torches I don't know there's an

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.890 
of torches I don't know there's an
easier<00:02:24.580> way<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.760> do<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.420> know<00:02:25.750> that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
easier way to do this I just know that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.540 
easier way to do this I just know that
this<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> way<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.560> I've<00:02:26.710> known<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.310> how

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
this is the way that I've known of how

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.880 
this is the way that I've known of how
to<00:02:27.610> do<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.330> know<00:02:28.450> like<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.630> platform<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.590> these

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
to do you know like a platform of these

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.550 
to do you know like a platform of these
things<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:31.390> as<00:02:31.480> long<00:02:31.630> as<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.870> can<00:02:31.930> remember<00:02:32.050> so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
things for as long as I can remember so

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.980 
things for as long as I can remember so
this<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.950> one<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.310> used<00:02:33.780> from<00:02:34.780> there

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
this is the one that I used from there

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.770 
this is the one that I used from there
on<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.350> node<00:02:35.620> 6<00:02:35.980> 6<00:02:36.250> by<00:02:36.400> 8<00:02:36.580> piston<00:02:37.360> piston

Mitchell<00:02:45.970> our<00:02:46.060> new<00:02:46.240> now<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.720> bunch<00:02:46.900> of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
Mitchell our new now just a bunch of

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.450 
Mitchell our new now just a bunch of
sticky<00:02:47.200> pistons<00:02:47.530> gotta<00:02:47.740> be<00:02:47.860> sticky<00:02:48.130> pistons

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
sticky pistons gotta be sticky pistons

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.040 
sticky pistons gotta be sticky pistons
obviously<00:02:48.850> got<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.090> pull<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.300> blocks<00:02:49.540> back<00:02:49.750> I

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
obviously got to pull the blocks back I

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.290 
obviously got to pull the blocks back I
was<00:02:50.650> told<00:02:50.860> once<00:02:51.160> in<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.460> tutorial<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.150> need

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
was told once in a tutorial that I need

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.790 
was told once in a tutorial that I need
to<00:02:52.390> specify<00:02:52.630> when<00:02:53.080> it's<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.260> sticky<00:02:53.590> piston

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
to specify when it's a sticky piston

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.010 
to specify when it's a sticky piston
like<00:02:54.370> look<00:02:54.610> look<00:02:55.000> buddy<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.480> it's<00:02:55.660> pulling<00:02:55.990> the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
like look look buddy if it's pulling the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.050 
like look look buddy if it's pulling the
block<00:02:56.320> back<00:02:56.560> clearly<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.520> sticky<00:02:57.880> piston

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
block back clearly it's a sticky piston

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.530 
block back clearly it's a sticky piston
all<00:02:58.960> right<00:02:59.140> I'm<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.280> floor<00:03:00.610> level<00:03:00.940> will

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
all right I'm in the floor level will

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.560 
all right I'm in the floor level will
make<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.900> blue<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:06.390> mean<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.510> is

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
make it blue like so I mean this is

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.510 
make it blue like so I mean this is
simple<00:03:08.050> it's<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:08.590> really<00:03:08.920> really<00:03:09.160> simple

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
simple it's like really really simple

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.240 
simple it's like really really simple
just<00:03:09.940> repetitive<00:03:10.390> on<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.140> red<00:03:11.620> stone<00:03:11.860> itself

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
just repetitive on the red stone itself

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.950 
just repetitive on the red stone itself
that's<00:03:12.730> all<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:12.910> is<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:13.450> it's<00:03:13.600> really<00:03:13.840> really

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
that's all it is but it's really really

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.880 
that's all it is but it's really really
easy<00:03:14.520> from<00:03:15.520> here<00:03:15.580> on<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.540> water<00:03:16.780> okay<00:03:17.740> let's

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
easy from here on the water okay let's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.700 
easy from here on the water okay let's
extend<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.430> let's<00:03:18.790> extend<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.360> for<00:03:19.540> now<00:03:19.710> now

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
extend it let's extend it for now now

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.050 
extend it let's extend it for now now
I'm<00:03:20.800> not<00:03:20.920> going<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.100> put<00:03:21.190> like<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> button<00:03:21.820> so

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
I'm not going to put like a button so

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.580 
I'm not going to put like a button so
that<00:03:22.090> it's<00:03:22.300> got<00:03:22.420> like<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.600> tea<00:03:22.780> flip<00:03:23.080> flop<00:03:23.380> or

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
that it's got like a tea flip flop or

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.980 
that it's got like a tea flip flop or
none<00:03:23.740> of<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:23.920> mess<00:03:24.190> right<00:03:24.430> now<00:03:24.900> then<00:03:25.900> the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
none of that mess right now then the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.300 
none of that mess right now then the
water<00:03:26.170> would<00:03:26.380> be<00:03:26.590> at<00:03:26.860> this<00:03:27.190> level<00:03:27.430> right<00:03:27.640> here

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
water would be at this level right here

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.720 
water would be at this level right here
so<00:03:30.420> then<00:03:31.420> we'll<00:03:31.540> build<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.100> surrounding<00:03:33.100> just

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
so then we'll build the surrounding just

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.900 
so then we'll build the surrounding just
basically<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.060> ring<00:03:34.450> all<00:03:34.690> around<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:35.230> that's<00:03:35.410> it

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
basically a ring all around it that's it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.890 
basically a ring all around it that's it
yeah<00:03:36.910> I'm<00:03:37.030> not<00:03:37.150> doing<00:03:37.330> like<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.450> button<00:03:37.810> or

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
yeah I'm not doing like a button or

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.660 
yeah I'm not doing like a button or
anything<00:03:38.170> like<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:38.530> guys<00:03:38.620> can<00:03:38.860> add<00:03:39.520> all

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
anything like that you guys can add all

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.310 
anything like that you guys can add all
that<00:03:39.850> stuff<00:03:40.240> on<00:03:40.450> your<00:03:40.570> own<00:03:40.630> time<00:03:40.990> basically

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
that stuff on your own time basically

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.380 
that stuff on your own time basically
just<00:03:41.530> showing<00:03:41.770> you<00:03:41.830> how<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.010> get<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.430> platform

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
just showing you how to get the platform

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.150 
just showing you how to get the platform
up<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.720> down<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:43.960> to<00:03:44.530> get<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.920> water

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
up and down and to get the water

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.440 
up and down and to get the water
basically<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.760> come<00:03:45.970> come<00:03:46.480> on<00:03:46.630> come<00:03:47.290> on<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:49.000> go

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
basically to come come on come on to go

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.530 
basically to come come on come on to go
ahead<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.750> just<00:03:49.900> be<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.860> pool<00:03:51.160> pretty<00:03:51.610> much<00:03:51.790> i'm

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
ahead and just be a pool pretty much i'm

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.080 
ahead and just be a pool pretty much i'm
just<00:03:52.660> going<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.870> use<00:03:52.930> some<00:03:53.050> glass<00:03:53.410> here<00:03:54.090> like

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
just going to use some glass here like

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.410 
just going to use some glass here like
that<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:57.130> glasses<00:03:57.610> where<00:03:57.760> your<00:03:57.910> water<00:03:58.210> is

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
that on the glasses where your water is

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.170 
that on the glasses where your water is
going<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.660> go<00:04:01.410> there<00:04:02.410> we<00:04:02.950> go<00:04:02.980> alright<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:04.000> then

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
going to go there we go alright and then

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.480 
going to go there we go alright and then
a<00:04:04.210> bucket<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:05.560> put<00:04:05.680> source<00:04:05.920> blocks<00:04:06.190> on<00:04:06.340> all

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
a bucket I just put source blocks on all

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.760 
a bucket I just put source blocks on all
of<00:04:06.610> these<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.209> completely<00:04:07.540> honest<00:04:07.990> I'm

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
of these to be completely honest I'm

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.290 
of these to be completely honest I'm
indented<00:04:09.280> without<00:04:09.610> all<00:04:09.820> of<00:04:09.850> these<00:04:10.090> mean

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
indented without all of these mean

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.760 
indented without all of these mean
source<00:04:10.600> blocks<00:04:10.870> I'm<00:04:11.050> sure<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.380> an<00:04:11.440> extender

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
source blocks I'm sure to an extender

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.900 
source blocks I'm sure to an extender
you<00:04:11.860> probably<00:04:12.070> don't<00:04:12.220> need<00:04:12.370> all<00:04:12.610> source

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
you probably don't need all source

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.500 
you probably don't need all source
blocks<00:04:13.240> that's<00:04:14.110> just<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.320> way<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.709> do<00:04:14.830> it

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
blocks that's just the way that I do it

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.729 
blocks that's just the way that I do it
alright<00:04:16.510> it's<00:04:16.720> missing<00:04:17.140> a<00:04:17.230> couple<00:04:17.380> blocks

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
alright it's missing a couple blocks

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.670 
alright it's missing a couple blocks
here<00:04:18.220> there<00:04:19.060> we<00:04:19.150> go<00:04:19.239> there<00:04:19.570> we<00:04:19.600> go<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.930> know

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
here there we go there we go I know

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.320 
here there we go there we go I know
again<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.400> would<00:04:21.520> imagine<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.940> this<00:04:22.150> would

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
again you would imagine that this would

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.770 
again you would imagine that this would
be<00:04:22.360> in<00:04:22.540> case<00:04:22.780> because<00:04:23.200> in

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
be in case because in

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.870 
be in case because in
you<00:04:23.840> want<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.200> be<00:04:24.320> like<00:04:24.470> toggleable<00:04:24.980> I<00:04:25.340> hate

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
you want it to be like toggleable I hate

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.050 
you want it to be like toggleable I hate
that<00:04:26.090> word<00:04:26.240> toggleable<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:28.220> like<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.030> know

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
that word toggleable and like you know

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.360 
that word toggleable and like you know
appearing<00:04:29.510> that<00:04:29.660> there<00:04:29.870> is<00:04:29.990> no<00:04:30.230> pool<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:31.250> then

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
appearing that there is no pool but then

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.900 
appearing that there is no pool but then
eventually<00:04:31.460> there<00:04:31.910> will<00:04:32.090> be<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.270> pool<00:04:33.910> alright

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
eventually there will be a pool alright

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.900 
eventually there will be a pool alright
perfect<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:36.169> don't<00:04:36.980> know<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.160> mean<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.820> to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
perfect and I don't know I mean and to

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.000 
perfect and I don't know I mean and to
wire<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.360> just<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.020> know<00:04:39.139> just<00:04:39.350> get<00:04:39.800> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
wire this is just you know just get the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.500 
wire this is just you know just get the
signal<00:04:40.370> down<00:04:40.639> that's<00:04:41.540> pretty<00:04:41.840> much<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:43.510> get

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
signal down that's pretty much it get

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.190 
signal down that's pretty much it get
the<00:04:44.630> signal<00:04:44.960> down<00:04:45.139> to<00:04:45.320> interact<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:45.830> this

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
the signal down to interact with this

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.770 
the signal down to interact with this
let's<00:04:48.200> see<00:04:48.500> again<00:04:49.490> now<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.360> going<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.690> be

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
let's see again now this is going to be

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.750 
let's see again now this is going to be
like<00:04:50.930> really<00:04:51.230> dependent<00:04:51.770> on<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.100> height<00:04:52.310> that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
like really dependent on the height that

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.480 
like really dependent on the height that
your<00:04:52.940> ads<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.450> know<00:04:53.480> keep<00:04:53.810> that<00:04:54.020> in<00:04:54.169> mind<00:04:54.490> so

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
your ads you know keep that in mind so

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.250 
your ads you know keep that in mind so
you<00:04:55.880> know<00:04:56.000> if<00:04:56.060> you're<00:04:56.210> trying<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.900> just<00:04:57.110> do

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
you know if you're trying to just do

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.400 
you know if you're trying to just do
this<00:04:57.500> like<00:04:57.800> exactly<00:04:58.430> as<00:04:58.520> I'm<00:04:58.669> doing<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.410> keep

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
this like exactly as I'm doing it keep

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.300 
this like exactly as I'm doing it keep
that<00:05:00.680> in<00:05:00.830> mind<00:05:01.930> oops<00:05:02.930> because<00:05:03.919> then<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.190> know

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
that in mind oops because then you know

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.980 
that in mind oops because then you know
the<00:05:04.460> way<00:05:04.580> that<00:05:04.760> you<00:05:04.880> wire<00:05:05.090> your<00:05:05.330> redstone<00:05:05.660> on

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
the way that you wire your redstone on

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.840 
the way that you wire your redstone on
downwards<00:05:06.710> or<00:05:06.890> upwards<00:05:06.950> it's<00:05:07.490> going<00:05:07.640> to<00:05:07.700> make

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
downwards or upwards it's going to make

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.430 
downwards or upwards it's going to make
a<00:05:07.910> difference<00:05:08.210> but<00:05:08.510> you<00:05:08.690> know<00:05:08.780> just<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:09.169> torch

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
a difference but you know just a torch

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.980 
a difference but you know just a torch
tower<00:05:09.740> thing<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.270> used<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.750> get<00:05:11.870> the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
tower thing that I used to get the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.950 
tower thing that I used to get the
signal<00:05:12.320> up<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.590> down<00:05:12.740> get<00:05:13.550> your<00:05:13.700> lever<00:05:13.960> water

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
signal up and down get your lever water

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.600 
signal up and down get your lever water
comes<00:05:15.229> out<00:05:15.410> gets<00:05:15.680> all<00:05:15.860> strain<00:05:16.160> down<00:05:16.400> and

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
comes out gets all strain down and

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.030 
comes out gets all strain down and
smooth<00:05:16.850> and<00:05:17.090> then<00:05:17.930> you<00:05:18.020> pull<00:05:18.260> it<00:05:18.410> in<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.890> water

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
smooth and then you pull it in the water

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.280 
smooth and then you pull it in the water
