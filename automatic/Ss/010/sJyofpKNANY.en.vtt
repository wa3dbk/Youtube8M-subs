00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.390
 well currently with a workshop we are 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.040
 addressing those particularly is 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.780
 works hard with ethnic dances 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.440
 malinké that are from the cells 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:38.019
 predominant as for example the rhythm 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.960
 house that is a rhythm but it is also a 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:44.340
 event 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.899
 that we can in the church accompanies the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.899
 men who work in the field 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.320
 we are also working with rhythms of 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.250
 vague energy such as solsona 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.970
 solsonès is a mask that is during 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.630
 all year saved in a village in the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.149
 jungle 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.280
 and it's brought about two or three times 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.220
 per year it is brought 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.440
 to the village to thank him and also 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.530
 to ask for health feasibility for the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.530
 children 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.740
 we are working with amber the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.480
 particularity of the matrix is a ritual 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.250
 that I created with the brightness that 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.540
 glasses are like very characters 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.850
 important in what is culture 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.930
 malinké because they are like the managers 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.670
 to convey the history of the people 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.769
 and obviously the transmission 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:43.909
 it is always through the word already 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:47.030
 through music classes are 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.709
 rituals that's what I feel and that's 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.079
 what I think happens is like a 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.659
 space in which one is limited 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.569
 can come into contact with something that 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.459
 that generally in society there is no 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.209
 it's a way to purge neurosis 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.209
 clearly 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.310
 and it also seems like an opportunity 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.850
 wonderful to forget a while 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.850
 oneself 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.349
 and that which prevails volleyball group 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.049
 it really is how you rest from the same 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.150
 you saw rests of your blacks and your and 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.609
 of your go and nothing and that's it 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.670
 important is what is happening there 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:27.319
 really feel in the body that me 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.319
 It seems that this has a great value
