very good pull the paper out ooh the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.320 
very good pull the paper out ooh the
print<00:00:19.859> looks<00:00:20.039> nice<00:00:20.340> now<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.210> do

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
print looks nice now what we have to do

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.660 
print looks nice now what we have to do
is<00:00:21.449> keep<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.320> from<00:00:22.529> developing<00:00:22.740> any<00:00:23.250> more<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
is keep it from developing any more and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.599 
is keep it from developing any more and
getting<00:00:23.820> any<00:00:24.090> darker<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> we're

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
getting any darker so to do that we're

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
getting any darker so to do that we're
gonna<00:00:26.699> soak<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.390> water<00:00:27.599> first<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.260> first

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
gonna soak it in water first the first

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.370 
gonna soak it in water first the first
step<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:29.460> take<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.849> off<00:00:30.029> put<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.539> some

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
step to take that off put it in some

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.200 
step to take that off put it in some
water<00:00:31.410> let's<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> water<00:00:32.309> falling<00:00:32.700> first

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.170 

is<00:00:38.719> to<00:00:38.960> hear<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.350> instructions<00:00:39.890> right<00:00:40.100> here

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
is to hear the instructions right here

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.950 
is to hear the instructions right here
do<00:00:41.180> these<00:00:42.910> take<00:00:43.910> a<00:00:43.969> second<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.540> read<00:00:44.719> those

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
do these take a second to read those

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.520 
do these take a second to read those
instructions<00:00:46.750> no<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:47.930> can<00:00:48.079> turn<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.379> water

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
instructions no you can turn the water

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.060 
instructions no you can turn the water
off<00:00:48.739> now<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.220> put<00:00:49.370> that<00:00:49.519> print<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:50.059> their<00:00:51.070> face

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
off now and put that print in their face

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.950 
off now and put that print in their face
up<00:00:52.100> is<00:00:52.489> good<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.989> get<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:57.260> under<00:00:57.470> water<00:00:58.960> and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
up is good and get it under water and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.990 
up is good and get it under water and
start<00:01:00.680> rocking<00:01:01.129> it<00:01:01.280> back<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.790> forth<00:01:07.000> just

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
start rocking it back and forth just

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.940 
start rocking it back and forth just
lift<00:01:08.240> up<00:01:08.390> one<00:01:08.570> end<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.229> then<00:01:09.470> let<00:01:09.649> it<00:01:09.680> down

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
lift up one end and then let it down

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.090 
lift up one end and then let it down
lift<00:01:10.340> up<00:01:10.460> one<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:10.850> let<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.240> go<00:01:11.390> that's<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:12.100> and

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
lift up one in let it go that's it and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.400 
lift up one in let it go that's it and
some<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.759> solution<00:01:14.479> may<00:01:14.630> come<00:01:14.899> off<00:01:15.080> into

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
some of the solution may come off into

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.230 
some of the solution may come off into
the<00:01:15.530> water<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:15.950> we'll<00:01:16.130> change<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.850> water<00:01:17.090> if

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
the water and we'll change the water if

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.490 
the water and we'll change the water if
it<00:01:17.330> gets<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.630> little<00:01:17.810> cloudy<00:01:19.869> then<00:01:20.869> after<00:01:21.380> we've

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
it gets a little cloudy then after we've

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.680 
it gets a little cloudy then after we've
done<00:01:21.649> that<00:01:21.800> for<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.100> while<00:01:22.160> we're<00:01:23.060> gonna<00:01:23.149> fix<00:01:23.539> it

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
done that for a while we're gonna fix it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.560 
done that for a while we're gonna fix it
we're<00:01:23.840> gonna<00:01:23.929> add<00:01:24.170> some<00:01:24.200> fixer<00:01:25.090> in<00:01:26.090> place<00:01:26.330> of

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
we're gonna add some fixer in place of

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.529 
we're gonna add some fixer in place of
the<00:01:26.660> water<00:01:26.840> here's<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.440> picture<00:01:27.770> right<00:01:28.039> here

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.840 

and<00:01:32.539> that'll<00:01:33.440> darken<00:01:33.860> up<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:33.979> print<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:34.580> fix

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
and that'll darken up the print and fix

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.639 
and that'll darken up the print and fix
it<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.149> keep<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.390> from<00:01:35.509> changing<00:01:36.259> any<00:01:36.380> more

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
it and keep it from changing any more

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.040 
it and keep it from changing any more
then<00:01:36.860> we'll<00:01:37.009> rinse<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.490> fixer<00:01:37.850> off<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.899> the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
then we'll rinse the fixer off in the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.420 
then we'll rinse the fixer off in the
last<00:01:39.289> step<00:01:44.409> once<00:01:45.409> we<00:01:45.530> get<00:01:45.649> a<00:01:45.710> finished<00:01:46.100> print

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
last step once we get a finished print

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.170 
last step once we get a finished print
will<00:01:47.180> dry<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:47.600> with<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:47.990> fan<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:49.670> will<00:01:50.920> then<00:01:52.180> dry

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
will dry it with a fan and will then dry

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.160 
will dry it with a fan and will then dry
it<00:01:53.590> between<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.860> blotter<00:01:55.159> over<00:01:55.579> here<00:01:56.170> pieces

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
it between the blotter over here pieces

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.539 
it between the blotter over here pieces
of<00:01:57.350> paper<00:01:57.560> we<00:01:57.890> make<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.070> little<00:01:58.250> sandwich

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
of paper we make a little sandwich

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.510 
of paper we make a little sandwich
between<00:01:59.409> cardboard<00:02:00.409> blotting<00:02:00.950> paper<00:02:01.189> and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
between cardboard blotting paper and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.100 
between cardboard blotting paper and
newspaper<00:02:02.950> put<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.130> print<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:04.610> there<00:02:05.110> and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
newspaper put the print in there and

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.800 
newspaper put the print in there and
then<00:02:08.079> squeeze<00:02:09.079> a<00:02:09.110> sound<00:02:10.000> right<00:02:11.000> overnight<00:02:11.510> and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
then squeeze a sound right overnight and

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.650 
then squeeze a sound right overnight and
it's<00:02:11.989> ready<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.320> mount
