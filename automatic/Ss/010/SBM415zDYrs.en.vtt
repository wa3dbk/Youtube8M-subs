support<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:42.899> begin<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
support we have can actually begin to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
support we have can actually begin to
reverse<00:01:44.009> not<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.579> prevent<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.090> actually

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
reverse not just prevent but actually

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.480 
reverse not just prevent but actually
reverse<00:01:45.810> chronic<00:01:46.799> illnesses<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.280> heart

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
reverse chronic illnesses like heart

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.910 
reverse chronic illnesses like heart
disease<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.409> found<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
disease and so on and we found that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
disease and so on and we found that
almost<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:51.030> than<00:01:51.149> 82<00:01:51.420> percent<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
almost more than 82 percent of the

almost more than 82 percent of the
people<00:01:52.259> who<00:01:52.380> made<00:01:52.560> these<00:01:52.710> changes<00:01:52.950> as

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
people who made these changes as

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
people who made these changes as
President<00:01:53.820> Clinton<00:01:53.880> indicated<00:01:54.540> we're

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
President Clinton indicated we're

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
President Clinton indicated we're
actually<00:01:55.140> able<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> reverse<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.280> disease<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
actually able to reverse the disease so

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
actually able to reverse the disease so
getting<00:01:56.969> rather<00:01:57.270> than<00:01:57.420> getting<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.750> quick<00:01:58.500> fix

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
getting rather than getting a quick fix

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
like a bypass or Stan does which doesn't

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
like a bypass or Stan does which doesn't
treat<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> underlying<00:02:01.770> cause<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> little

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
treat the underlying cause it's a little

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.910 
treat the underlying cause it's a little
like<00:02:03.119> mopping<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> floor<00:02:04.320> around<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.649> sink

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
that particular one I think the Omega

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.020 
that particular one I think the Omega
studies<00:04:43.920> have<00:04:44.070> shown<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.310> just<00:04:44.700> three<00:04:44.940> or

your incidence of sudden cardiac death

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.600

IQ<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.750> so<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:57.900> think<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.290> evidence<00:04:58.620> there<00:04:58.800> is

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.070 
IQ and so I think the evidence there is
pretty<00:04:59.070> compelling<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.670> take<00:04:59.910> fish<00:05:00.150> oil<00:05:00.300> doctor

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
pretty compelling I take fish oil doctor

fish<00:05:06.419> oil<00:05:06.630> we<00:05:06.780> have<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.110> much<00:05:07.260> that<00:05:07.500> is<00:05:07.650> in

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
fish oil we have so much that is in

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.170 
fish oil we have so much that is in
common<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.280> we're<00:05:08.370> striving<00:05:08.610> together<00:05:09.000> to

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
common and we're striving together to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.390 
common and we're striving together to
really<00:05:09.360> make<00:05:09.419> up<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:10.230> basic<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.770> basic<00:05:10.800> point

really make up the basic the basic point

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.450 
really make up the basic the basic point
here<00:05:11.660> really<00:05:12.660> is<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:13.380> by<00:05:13.950> eating<00:05:14.160> these

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
here really is that by eating these

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.280 
here really is that by eating these
whole<00:05:14.820> foods<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.510> getting<00:05:15.900> away<00:05:16.080> from

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
whole foods and getting away from

incredible how powerful the body can be

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.420 
incredible how powerful the body can be
and<00:05:27.960> if<00:05:28.230> we're<00:05:28.380> going<00:05:28.530> to<00:05:28.590> have<00:05:28.740> a<00:05:28.800> seismic

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
and if we're going to have a seismic

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.640 
and if we're going to have a seismic
revolution<00:05:29.970> of<00:05:30.120> health<00:05:30.330> in<00:05:30.570> this<00:05:31.260> country

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
revolution of health in this country

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.070 
revolution of health in this country
which<00:05:31.890> has<00:05:32.040> really<00:05:32.370> right<00:05:32.550> at<00:05:32.669> our<00:05:32.760> fingertips

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
which has really right at our fingertips

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.110 
which has really right at our fingertips
when<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.460> major<00:05:37.250> behavior<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.729> has<00:05:38.940> to

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
when the major behavior that has to

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.120 
when the major behavior that has to
change<00:05:39.390> is<00:05:39.690> interestingly<00:05:40.020> enough<00:05:40.530> our<00:05:40.830> food

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
change is interestingly enough our food

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.580 
change is interestingly enough our food
that<00:05:41.460> is<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.180> absolutely<00:05:42.840> key<00:05:43.140> card<00:05:43.440> it

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
that is the absolutely key card it

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.070 
that is the absolutely key card it
trumps<00:05:43.890> everything<00:05:44.010> I<00:05:44.810> agree<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:45.870> let<00:05:45.990> me

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
trumps everything I agree and let me

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.270 
trumps everything I agree and let me
just<00:05:46.140> say<00:05:46.410> this<00:05:46.620> you<00:05:46.650> know<00:05:46.860> when<00:05:47.010> you<00:05:47.100> make

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
just say this you know when you make

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.980 
just say this you know when you make
these<00:05:47.460> changes<00:05:47.729> because<00:05:48.300> these<00:05:48.479> mechanisms

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
these changes because these mechanisms

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.230 
these changes because these mechanisms
are<00:05:49.290> so<00:05:49.500> dynamic<00:05:49.740> your<00:05:50.490> brain<00:05:50.760> gets<00:05:51.030> more

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
are so dynamic your brain gets more

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.640 
are so dynamic your brain gets more
blood<00:05:51.479> you<00:05:51.510> think<00:05:51.900> more<00:05:52.050> clear<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.410> you<00:05:52.470> have

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
blood you think more clear that you have

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.860 
blood you think more clear that you have
more<00:05:52.800> energy<00:05:52.979> your<00:05:53.790> skin<00:05:54.120> gets<00:05:54.330> more<00:05:54.510> blood<00:05:54.720> so

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
more energy your skin gets more blood so

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.210 
more energy your skin gets more blood so
you<00:05:54.900> don't<00:05:55.110> age<00:05:55.290> as<00:05:55.500> quickly<00:05:55.890> even<00:05:56.010> your

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
you don't age as quickly even your

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.770 
you don't age as quickly even your
sexual<00:05:56.580> organs<00:05:56.910> get<00:05:57.030> more<00:05:57.210> blood<00:05:57.390> in<00:05:57.510> the<00:05:57.600> same

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
sexual organs get more blood in the same

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.719 
sexual organs get more blood in the same
way<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.050> viagra<00:05:58.530> works<00:05:58.710> so<00:05:59.340> yeah<00:05:59.520> you'll

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
way that viagra works so yeah you'll

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.460 
way that viagra works so yeah you'll
probably<00:05:59.760> live<00:06:00.210> longer<00:06:00.510> but<00:06:01.200> you'll<00:06:01.320> also

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
probably live longer but you'll also

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.440 
probably live longer but you'll also
feel<00:06:01.890> better<00:06:02.160> and<00:06:02.340> what's<00:06:02.640> sustainable<00:06:03.300> is

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
feel better and what's sustainable is

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.630 
feel better and what's sustainable is
joy<00:06:03.750> and<00:06:03.780> pleasure<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:04.500> freedom<00:06:04.919> and<00:06:05.130> when

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
joy and pleasure and freedom and when

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.280 
joy and pleasure and freedom and when
you<00:06:05.729> make<00:06:05.910> these<00:06:06.060> changes<00:06:06.120> most<00:06:06.750> people<00:06:07.050> find

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
you make these changes most people find

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.620 
you make these changes most people find
they<00:06:07.440> feel<00:06:07.620> so<00:06:08.250> much<00:06:08.280> better<00:06:08.640> so<00:06:09.000> quickly<00:06:09.390> it

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
they feel so much better so quickly it

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.230 
they feel so much better so quickly it
reframes<00:06:10.320> the<00:06:10.470> reason<00:06:10.890> for<00:06:11.040> change<00:06:11.340> from<00:06:11.940> fear

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
reframes the reason for change from fear

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.610 
reframes the reason for change from fear
of<00:06:12.270> dying<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:12.780> joy<00:06:12.990> of<00:06:13.140> living<00:06:13.290> and<00:06:13.560> that's

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
of dying to joy of living and that's

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.070 
of dying to joy of living and that's
what's<00:06:13.890> sustainable
