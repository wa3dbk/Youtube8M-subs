00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
 or not 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.960
 good guys every time you need less to 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.110
 that the new generation of consoles 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.810
 playstation 4 and xbox wang get to 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.610
 our homes the reserves for 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.189
 first units have been completed in 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.919
 several establishments and it seems that the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.750
 General reception will be good but there 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.730
 studies that doubt the success of 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.450
 new platforms and prefer 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.750
 stay on the sidelines until you see what happens 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.820
 One konami as you will remember then 2014 no 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.940
 will have at first a version for 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.880
 xbox one or play station 4 leaving 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.340
 fifa 14 without competition in the next well 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.460
 an error or they have missed the time 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.430
 over no sites 2014 does not reach 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.890
 playstation 4 and xbox wang is because the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.410
 study has preferred to wait and see how 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.990
 the market adapts to them and if 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.329
 there really will be at first a 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.369
 mass of users enough to 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.840
 that it's worth developing the game 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.970
 for them 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.390
 Konami has assured that in no case 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.840
 will make a port dp 2014 from the versions 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.179
 of playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.579
 this would be according to declares one of his 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.890
 responsible to fall back into the error 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.560
 that years ago brought them to a situation 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.719
 of deep criticism when I did what 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.219
 same in the playstation 2 transition 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:35.679
 playstation 3 now responsible for 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.429
 konami prefer to be cautious and leave the 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.929
 development of pes 2014 for later 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.819
 if they launch the corresponding version 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.369
 for the new generation it will be 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.679
 developed from scratch and guaranteeing 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.270
 the quality that any user demands 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.849
 from one of the two new platforms 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.849
 What do you think about the decision of konami? 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.280
 ah
