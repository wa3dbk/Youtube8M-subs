this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.129> Jim<00:00:02.399> Leishman<00:00:02.610> i'm<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.389> show

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
this is Jim Leishman i'm going to show

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.440 
this is Jim Leishman i'm going to show
you<00:00:03.629> my<00:00:03.929> newest<00:00:04.259> creation<00:00:04.290> i<00:00:04.970> have<00:00:05.970> built<00:00:06.240> a

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
you my newest creation i have built a

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.919 
you my newest creation i have built a
ACF<00:00:07.379> plane<00:00:07.680> it's<00:00:08.280> an<00:00:08.690> ACF<00:00:11.389> like<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> bomber

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
ACF plane it's an ACF like a bomber

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.300 
ACF plane it's an ACF like a bomber
model<00:00:13.230> plane<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:15.440> it's<00:00:16.440> quite<00:00:16.680> large<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
model plane but it's quite large and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.260 
model plane but it's quite large and
it's<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.000> quite<00:00:18.990> slow<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:20.039> not<00:00:20.220> very

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
it's a quite slow and it's not very

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.769 
it's a quite slow and it's not very
maneuverable<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:22.140> only<00:00:22.320> uses<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:23.070> CF<00:00:23.779> finto

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
maneuverable but it only uses a CF finto

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.820 
maneuverable but it only uses a CF finto
and<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:26.760> hydraulics<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.570> steering<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.619> fins

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and the hydraulics for steering the fins

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.750 
and the hydraulics for steering the fins
and<00:00:31.340> well<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.370> three

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and well that's it so I have three

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:47.480 
and well that's it so I have three
engines

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:57.210 

by<00:00:48.090> around

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.380 

that<00:00:57.340> you<00:00:57.430> can<00:00:57.640> be<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:58.030> pain

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.930 

CFN<00:01:02.380> but<00:01:02.680> not<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.160> thrusters<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.909> course

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
CFN but not the thrusters but of course

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.020 
CFN but not the thrusters but of course
when<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:07.750> are<00:01:08.080> not<00:01:08.770> using<00:01:08.830> thrusters<00:01:09.729> it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
when you are not using thrusters it's

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
when you are not using thrusters it's
hard<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.750> get<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.260> very<00:01:11.530> good<00:01:11.650> maneuverability

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
hard to get a very good maneuverability

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.219 
hard to get a very good maneuverability
because<00:01:14.550> up<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:15.940> down<00:01:16.119> is<00:01:16.450> quite<00:01:16.690> easy<00:01:16.720> but

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
because up and down is quite easy but

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.700 
because up and down is quite easy but
the<00:01:17.520> sideways<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.790> very<00:01:19.060> hard<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.540> rotate<00:01:20.530> it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
the sideways is very hard to rotate it

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.359 
the sideways is very hard to rotate it
and<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.970> you<00:01:22.119> see<00:01:22.330> an<00:01:22.570> engine<00:01:23.380> pod<00:01:23.590> and

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
and here you see an engine pod and

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.700 
and here you see an engine pod and
there's<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.090> other<00:01:25.210> engine<00:01:25.780> pods<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.259> have<00:01:26.530> two

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
there's the other engine pods I have two

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.690 
there's the other engine pods I have two
small<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.280> one<00:01:27.520> large<00:01:27.729> in<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.330> middle<00:01:28.570> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
small and one large in the middle and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.650 
small and one large in the middle and
for<00:01:30.700> this<00:01:30.820> I<00:01:31.030> use<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:31.540> petrol<00:01:32.200> engine<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:33.660> I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
for this I use this petrol engine and I

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.800 
for this I use this petrol engine and I
have<00:01:34.930> two<00:01:35.259> other<00:01:36.100> models<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:39.390> petrol<00:01:40.390> engines

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
have two other models of petrol engines

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
have two other models of petrol engines
in<00:01:41.050> these<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:43.000> can<00:01:43.149> see<00:01:43.360> by<00:01:43.990> quite<00:01:44.289> similar

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
in these as you can see by quite similar

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.029 
in these as you can see by quite similar
actually<00:01:45.039> but<00:01:45.490> it's<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.390> bit<00:01:46.539> different<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.320> i

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
actually but it's a bit different and i

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.859 
actually but it's a bit different and i
use<00:01:49.320> CVT<00:01:50.369> gearboxes<00:01:51.369> so<00:01:52.330> i<00:01:52.360> don't<00:01:52.479> have<00:01:52.720> to

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
use CVT gearboxes so i don't have to

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.120 
use CVT gearboxes so i don't have to
change<00:01:53.259> gear<00:01:53.619> myself

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
change gear myself

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:03.350 
change gear myself
it's<00:01:55.490> quite<00:01:55.700> nice

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.130 

to<00:02:03.660> fly<00:02:03.870> around<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
to fly around with a

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.760 
to fly around with a
ACF<00:02:06.210> carplay<00:02:07.210> because<00:02:08.050> it's<00:02:08.319> more<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.710> a

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
ACF carplay because it's more of a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.120 
ACF carplay because it's more of a
challenge<00:02:09.720> though<00:02:10.720> recently<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.380> noticed<00:02:11.950> that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
challenge though recently I noticed that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.360 
challenge though recently I noticed that
the<00:02:13.060> jet<00:02:13.360> engines<00:02:13.930> stopped<00:02:14.530> working<00:02:15.069> so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
the jet engines stopped working so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.370 
the jet engines stopped working so
therefore<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.480> built<00:02:16.810> with<00:02:17.080> other

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
therefore I have built with other

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.300 
therefore I have built with other
engines<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.220> jet<00:02:19.120> Anwen<00:02:19.540> engines<00:02:20.080> are<00:02:20.380> quite

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
engines as jet Anwen engines are quite

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.130 
engines as jet Anwen engines are quite
good<00:02:21.340> for<00:02:22.500> planes<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.800> all<00:02:24.490> you<00:02:24.760> who<00:02:25.240> know<00:02:25.570> ACF

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
good for planes and all you who know ACF

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.460 
good for planes and all you who know ACF
already<00:02:26.860> know<00:02:27.070> this<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:27.340> I'd<00:02:27.640> health<00:02:27.850> anyways

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
already know this but I'd health anyways

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.640 
already know this but I'd health anyways
jet<00:02:29.470> engines<00:02:30.070> in<00:02:30.310> ACF<00:02:30.940> does<00:02:31.900> not<00:02:32.260> work<00:02:32.620> like

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
jet engines in ACF does not work like

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.190 
jet engines in ACF does not work like
thrusters<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.860> any<00:02:36.160> engine

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
thrusters it's it's just like any engine

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.490 
thrusters it's it's just like any engine
that<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.980> connect<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.489> some<00:02:39.700> kind<00:02:39.940> of

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that you have to connect to some kind of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.500 
that you have to connect to some kind of
propeller<00:02:42.060> for<00:02:43.060> them<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.580> well<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.790> tested<00:02:46.360> my

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
propeller for them and well I tested my

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.470 
propeller for them and well I tested my
guns<00:02:46.780> but<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.350> lagged<00:02:47.830> some<00:02:50.190> but<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:52.269> was
