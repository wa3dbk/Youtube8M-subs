00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.710
 but 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.210
 yea 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 O 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.570
 near the goal but not the people and today I will announce to you like the sound 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.089
 my 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.920
 the raid 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.030
 the high form penalty 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.130
 and it is exactly with the supernatural only the most dedicated pedals to the south of the 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.030
 form 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.320
 I'm going to rest for a little bit. 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.320
 of the sound possibilities that it has 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.000
 First of all this new tie-break the dr. 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.890
 or here is the crack button 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.780
 almost without money 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.780
 and the coauthors of hue their made 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.480
 even worse 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.030
 there came the third goal 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.320
 it's a little bit more 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.909
 they show the places where the user in my team 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.060
 I wanted 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.630
 I called directly 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.630
 mourning 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 she 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 O 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.290
 helps to relax in the chains 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.629
 trade volume with 4 we exported it 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.949
 what to do 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.259
 as of average adults 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
 widely used in bread 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.419
 it was the 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.129
 That's because Mexico 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.999
 captain of the team but without gravity he added 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.159
 face 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.159
 along the day 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.859
 one day 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.619
 there 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.619
 but 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.899
 How can you say that you have 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.489
 many grilagens bother a little button win conditions 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.180
 ney 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.180
 interpreted by other works are 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.210
 O 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.800
 O 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.440
 he also said these and other dozens were observed by the state until the 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.320
 next 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.800
