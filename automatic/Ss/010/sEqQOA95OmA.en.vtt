okay<00:00:02.160> guys<00:00:02.370> well<00:00:02.670> here<00:00:02.790> we<00:00:02.910> go<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:04.040> managed<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
okay guys well here we go I managed to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.499 
okay guys well here we go I managed to
get<00:00:05.430> all<00:00:05.759> those<00:00:05.970> boxing<00:00:06.980> it<00:00:07.980> worked<00:00:08.219> out

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:08.509 
get all those boxing it worked out

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.609 
get all those boxing it worked out
really<00:00:09.509> well<00:00:11.929> now<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.049> kind<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.320> looks<00:00:13.530> like

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:13.619 
really well now it kind of looks like

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.890 
really well now it kind of looks like
that's<00:00:13.980> maybe<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.549> little<00:00:14.759> complicated<00:00:15.480> it's

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that's maybe a little complicated it's

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.999 
that's maybe a little complicated it's
not<00:00:16.139> one<00:00:17.070> thing<00:00:17.310> once<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.730> find<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> angle

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
not one thing once you find the angle

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.589 
not one thing once you find the angle
all<00:00:20.009> the<00:00:20.250> pieces<00:00:20.429> you<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.670> call<00:00:20.939> them<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.179> five

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
all the pieces you can call them on five

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.870 
all the pieces you can call them on five
minutes<00:00:21.890> because<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> angle<00:00:23.310> doesn't<00:00:23.490> change

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
minutes because the angle doesn't change

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.820 
minutes because the angle doesn't change
right<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.660> only<00:00:24.810> thing<00:00:24.929> that<00:00:25.050> changes<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
right the only thing that changes is the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.460 
right the only thing that changes is the
length<00:00:26.449> this<00:00:27.449> angle<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:27.960> same<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.349> this

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
length this angle is the same as this

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.470 
length this angle is the same as this
angle<00:00:28.679> all<00:00:29.039> right<00:00:29.130> let's<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.820> longer<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
angle all right let's get longer I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.470 
angle all right let's get longer I
placed<00:00:31.470> them<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.430> sides<00:00:32.670> of<00:00:32.910> where<00:00:33.330> you

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
placed them on the sides of where you

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
placed them on the sides of where you
weld<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.440> came<00:00:35.360> remember<00:00:36.360> my<00:00:36.510> string<00:00:37.040> okay<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
weld you came remember my string okay I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.640 
weld you came remember my string okay I
keep<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.730> string<00:00:38.970> in<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> middle<00:00:39.590> I'm<00:00:40.590> going

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
keep that string in the middle I'm going

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.340 
keep that string in the middle I'm going
to<00:00:40.800> show<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.310> I<00:00:41.840> stuffed<00:00:42.840> little<00:00:43.170> pieces

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
to show you here I stuffed little pieces

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.520 
to show you here I stuffed little pieces
of<00:00:43.500> wood<00:00:43.740> here<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.610> hold<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.150> string<00:00:45.530> off

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
of wood here just to hold the string off

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
of wood here just to hold the string off
the<00:00:46.980> pipe<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.000> don't<00:00:48.180> want<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the pipe because I don't want to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.820 
the pipe because I don't want to
touching<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.810> pipe<00:00:49.050> otherwise<00:00:49.440> they'll<00:00:49.680> give

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
touching the pipe otherwise they'll give

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.270 
touching the pipe otherwise they'll give
me<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.980> false<00:00:50.190> reading

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
me a false reading

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.770 
me a false reading
so<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:53.430> blocks<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.940> cut<00:00:54.090> into<00:00:54.240> pairs<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so these blocks are cut into pairs you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.850 
so these blocks are cut into pairs you
have<00:00:54.810> left<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.740> they

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
have left and right there they

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.600 
have left and right there they
absolutely<00:00:56.640> identical<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:58.190> went<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.280> far<00:00:59.460> as

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
absolutely identical I went as far as

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.640 
absolutely identical I went as far as
marking<00:01:00.060> them<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.360> knife<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.380> I<00:01:01.440> had

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
marking them with a knife just so I had

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.280 
marking them with a knife just so I had
that<00:01:01.770> perfect<00:01:02.100> crisp<00:01:02.550> edge<00:01:02.790> to<00:01:03.030> cut<00:01:03.230> on<00:01:04.230> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that perfect crisp edge to cut on a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
that perfect crisp edge to cut on a
miter<00:01:04.589> box<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.940> started<00:01:06.180> caught<00:01:06.390> in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
miter box so I just started caught in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.790 
miter box so I just started caught in
pairs

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
pairs

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.010 
pairs
I<00:01:07.830> took<00:01:08.730> a<00:01:09.000> measurement<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.780> here

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I took a measurement from here to here

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.110 
I took a measurement from here to here
figured<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.830> know<00:01:10.950> close<00:01:11.550> enough<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
figured it was you know close enough to

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.830 
figured it was you know close enough to
the<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> weld<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.910> can<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.270> adjusting

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the to the weld you can little adjusting

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.649 
the to the weld you can little adjusting
but<00:01:16.020> once<00:01:16.230> this<00:01:16.470> goes<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.480> guarantee<00:01:18.480> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
but once this goes in I guarantee this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.710 
but once this goes in I guarantee this
one<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.260> is<00:01:20.070> perfect<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:21.300> you<00:01:21.510> were<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
one here is perfect if you were to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
one here is perfect if you were to
measure<00:01:21.930> from<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.770> rate<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> that's<00:01:23.370> really

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
measure from this rate and that's really

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.490 
measure from this rate and that's really
what<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.120> do<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.870> met<00:01:25.050> you<00:01:25.260> know

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
what you have to do you met you know

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
what you have to do you met you know
that<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.100> installed<00:01:26.490> perpendicular<00:01:27.180> so

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that this was installed perpendicular so

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
that this was installed perpendicular so
if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.510> measure<00:01:27.690> from<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.230> to<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.790> it's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
if you measure from here to here it's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
if you measure from here to here it's
the<00:01:29.940> same<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.800> be

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the same as here to here it has to be

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.580 
the same as here to here it has to be
it's<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:32.940> how<00:01:33.060> angles<00:01:33.450> work<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:34.229> once<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it's just how angles work well once you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.420 
it's just how angles work well once you
have<00:01:34.800> that<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.020> throw<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> level<00:01:37.800> on<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
have that you can throw a level on it

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
have that you can throw a level on it
and<00:01:38.600> remember<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.750> distance<00:01:40.260> as<00:01:40.440> long<00:01:40.680> as

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and remember this distance as long as

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
and remember this distance as long as
this<00:01:41.729> distance<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.810> side<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.350> identical

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
this distance on this side is identical

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.420 
this distance on this side is identical
to<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.760> you<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.810> level<00:01:46.080> is<00:01:46.440> gonna

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
to here you know your level is gonna

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.100 
to here you know your level is gonna
read<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.060> crooked<00:01:48.270> obviously

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
read right if it's crooked obviously

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.170 
read right if it's crooked obviously
you'll<00:01:49.440> never<00:01:49.650> get<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> good<00:01:50.070> reading<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:51.090> if

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
you'll never get a good reading but if

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.770 
you'll never get a good reading but if
it's<00:01:51.330> straight<00:01:51.890> which<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:54.330> kept

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it's straight which it is I just kept

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
it's straight which it is I just kept
leveling<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.320> whole<00:01:55.530> thing<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.070> kept

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
leveling this whole thing I just kept

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.460 
leveling this whole thing I just kept
moving<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.580> up<00:01:56.760> moving<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.570> blah<00:01:57.869> blah<00:01:58.170> blah

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470
