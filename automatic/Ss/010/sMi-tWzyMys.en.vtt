park off the pavement and the one thing

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.020 
park off the pavement and the one thing
that<00:00:36.879> I<00:00:37.090> found<00:00:37.300> is<00:00:37.660> that<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.890> really<00:00:39.370> likes<00:00:39.610> to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
that I found is that it really likes to

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.970 
that I found is that it really likes to
do<00:00:40.360> wheel<00:00:40.660> landings<00:00:41.140> not<00:00:41.410> three-point

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
do wheel landings not three-point

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.040 
do wheel landings not three-point
landings<00:00:42.400> still<00:00:43.090> having<00:00:43.390> problems<00:00:43.720> with<00:00:43.839> nose

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
landings still having problems with nose

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.759 
landings still having problems with nose
overs<00:00:44.440> on<00:00:44.620> takeoffs<00:00:45.129> and<00:00:45.339> landings<00:00:46.769> moving

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
overs on takeoffs and landings moving

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.500 
overs on takeoffs and landings moving
the<00:00:47.860> battery<00:00:48.280> back<00:00:48.580> to<00:00:48.909> the<00:00:49.000> position<00:00:49.180> that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
the battery back to the position that

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.299 
the battery back to the position that
showed<00:00:49.750> in<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.930> first<00:00:50.229> video<00:00:50.470> helped<00:00:50.949> some

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
showed in the first video helped some

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.100 
showed in the first video helped some
but<00:00:51.820> that<00:00:51.970> it<00:00:52.059> feels<00:00:52.269> kind<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.600> tail<00:00:52.839> heavy

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
but that it feels kind of tail heavy

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.119 
but that it feels kind of tail heavy
heavy<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.790> putting<00:00:55.420> battery<00:00:56.409> back<00:00:56.620> up<00:00:56.650> into

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
heavy so putting battery back up into

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.369 
heavy so putting battery back up into
the<00:00:57.460> nose<00:00:57.670> it's<00:00:58.390> better<00:00:58.690> but<00:00:58.960> you<00:00:59.049> just<00:00:59.199> got<00:00:59.350> to

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
the nose it's better but you just got to

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.640 
the nose it's better but you just got to
take<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.710> slow<00:01:00.070> ramp<00:01:00.760> up<00:01:01.059> on<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.570> throttle<00:01:02.379> on

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
take it slow ramp up on the throttle on

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.950 
take it slow ramp up on the throttle on
takeoff<00:01:03.220> so<00:01:03.900> overall<00:01:05.130> good<00:01:06.130> flying<00:01:06.490> plane

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
takeoff so overall good flying plane

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.270 
takeoff so overall good flying plane
difficult<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.200> land<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.799> have<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.010> come<00:01:09.130> in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
difficult to land you have to come in

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.940 
difficult to land you have to come in
with<00:01:09.310> quite<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.760> bit<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.060> power<00:01:10.710> takeoffs<00:01:11.710> can

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
with quite a bit of power takeoffs can

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.710 
with quite a bit of power takeoffs can
be<00:01:12.070> able<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.250> challenge<00:01:12.610> into<00:01:13.030> I'm<00:01:13.240> gonna<00:01:13.450> try

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
be able to challenge into I'm gonna try

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.410 
be able to challenge into I'm gonna try
it<00:01:13.780> here<00:01:14.140> off<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.979> short<00:01:15.250> field<00:01:15.430> again<00:01:15.790> at

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
it here off the short field again at

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.000 
it here off the short field again at
some<00:01:16.660> point<00:01:16.690> and<00:01:16.960> hopefully<00:01:17.140> get<00:01:17.530> some<00:01:17.680> video

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
some point and hopefully get some video

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.610 
some point and hopefully get some video
for<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.780> just<00:01:19.960> thought<00:01:20.140> I'd<00:01:20.290> give<00:01:20.530> you

these guns these long guns tend to tend
to<00:01:33.400> catch<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.730> little<00:01:33.880> bit<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.950> they've

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
to catch a little bit and they've

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.470 
to catch a little bit and they've
actually<00:01:36.220> ripped<00:01:36.640> out<00:01:36.790> at<00:01:37.000> me<00:01:37.120> a<00:01:37.150> couple<00:01:37.390> times

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480

as far as prop is concerned now I had
some<00:01:42.820> problems<00:01:43.180> I<00:01:43.480> thought<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:43.750> was<00:01:43.870> bad<00:01:44.020> pack

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980

some problems I thought it was bad pack
I<00:01:45.220> tried<00:01:45.460> flying<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.880> on<00:01:45.970> four<00:01:46.270> sub<00:01:46.570> packed<00:01:46.900> and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
I tried flying it on four sub packed and

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.810 
I tried flying it on four sub packed and
it<00:01:47.620> flew<00:01:47.920> terrific<00:01:48.610> but<00:01:49.510> I<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:51.430> about<00:01:51.550> three

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
it flew terrific but I got about three

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.760 
it flew terrific but I got about three
minutes<00:01:51.940> into<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.390> flaker<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.620> power

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
minutes into the flaker so in the power

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.680 
minutes into the flaker so in the power
just<00:01:54.100> died<00:01:54.370> so<00:01:54.730> I<00:01:54.760> had<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.000> bring<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.300> in<00:01:55.420> for<00:01:55.570> an

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
just died so I had to bring it in for an

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.520 
just died so I had to bring it in for an
emergency<00:01:56.050> landing

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
emergency landing

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.320 
emergency landing
tried<00:01:56.740> another<00:01:56.980> pack<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.550> it<00:01:57.610> did<00:01:57.820> exactly

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
tried another pack and it did exactly

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.840 
tried another pack and it did exactly
the<00:01:58.750> same<00:01:58.780> thing<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.190> thought<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.490> had<00:02:00.670> two

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
the same thing and I thought I had two

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.230 
the same thing and I thought I had two
bad<00:02:01.030> packs<00:02:01.980> on<00:02:02.980> one<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.370> my<00:02:03.640> landings<00:02:04.060> I

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
bad packs on one of my landings I

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.570 
bad packs on one of my landings I
chipped<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.600> prop<00:02:05.050> up<00:02:05.230> pretty<00:02:05.470> badly<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:06.010> I

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
chipped the prop up pretty badly so I

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.830 
chipped the prop up pretty badly so I
replaced<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.330> prop<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:08.349> stock<00:02:08.679> is<00:02:09.039> an<00:02:09.840> 11-7

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
replaced the prop the stock is an 11-7

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.729 
replaced the prop the stock is an 11-7
and<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.620> also<00:02:11.950> had<00:02:12.310> was<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> 97<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.930> put<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
and I also had was a 97 so I put the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.920 
and I also had was a 97 so I put the
ninth<00:02:14.920> sub<00:02:15.190> nine<00:02:15.400> put<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.239> four<00:02:16.420> assault<00:02:16.720> pack

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
ninth sub nine put the four assault pack

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.489 
ninth sub nine put the four assault pack
back<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.640> ran<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.689> up<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.290> pack

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:20.499 
back in and ran it up and the pack

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:21.530 
back in and ran it up and the pack
seemed<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:21.010> be<00:02:21.129> fun

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
seemed to be fun

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.270 
seemed to be fun
at<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.959> point<00:02:22.260> they<00:02:22.530> weren't<00:02:22.829> dropping<00:02:23.159> off

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
at that point they weren't dropping off

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.399 
at that point they weren't dropping off
or<00:02:23.489> anything<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.030> I'm<00:02:24.480> actually<00:02:24.689> thinking<00:02:24.959> now

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
or anything so I'm actually thinking now

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.429 
or anything so I'm actually thinking now
that<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.799> USC<00:02:26.219> I<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.549> over<00:02:26.819> over<00:02:27.359> amping<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
that the USC I was over over amping the

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.720 
that the USC I was over over amping the
ESC<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.689> it<00:02:30.689> was<00:02:31.010> dying<00:02:32.010> out<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.310> mean<00:02:32.670> it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
ESC and it was dying out I mean it

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.520 
ESC and it was dying out I mean it
didn't<00:02:33.000> burn<00:02:33.209> out<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:33.810> maybe<00:02:34.140> he<00:02:34.290> was<00:02:34.319> getting

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
didn't burn out but maybe he was getting

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.160 
didn't burn out but maybe he was getting
hot<00:02:34.859> and<00:02:35.069> causing<00:02:35.579> some<00:02:35.790> problems<00:02:35.909> so<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.599> don't

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
hot and causing some problems so I don't

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.220 
hot and causing some problems so I don't
know<00:02:37.349> if<00:02:37.469> it's<00:02:37.620> gonna<00:02:37.769> fly<00:02:38.040> yeah<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.230> 97

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230

prop with a forceout pack but I'm gonna
give<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.159> try<00:02:44.280> I'll<00:02:44.640> let<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.879> know<00:02:44.909> what<00:02:45.120> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
give it a try I'll let you know what I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.449 
give it a try I'll let you know what I

better on the forceout I'm hoping with

better on the forceout I'm hoping with
this<00:02:54.720> prop<00:02:55.200> combo<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:56.040> stay<00:02:56.250> under<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.670> 30

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
this prop combo we stay under that 30

hopefully it will still deliver more

power than three cell packs so anyways
there<00:03:06.599> you<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.049> I'm<00:03:07.139> gonna<00:03:07.260> wrap<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.680> up
