 guitar hero where are we going to play this time 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.190
 with another one of my songs this time limbo 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.349
 where I really want to see how 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.650
 it will be that everything that would be 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.660
 the notes because like a song 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.699
 slow later on the strong then the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.699
 part that over the mouth I want to see how 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.009
 the blows will be conformed 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.410
 that is going to give and calls me for attention 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.820
 really so stay put we give to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.820
 nova and we started playing 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 starting only slowly obviously 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.880
 Let's see 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.520
 or 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.570
 not quiet there are no black bears 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.570
 Grab is eyes 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.100
 the darkness of the night the torment of 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.160
 loneliness sinister feelings that 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.120
 It runs through my chest when it opens my eyes and 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 find me 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.660
 to see the pavement that has finished 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.710
 with me 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:23.930
 in the hype of the box and what treated and 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:32.240
 continuous but the noise is a lot 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:34.579
 nothing to lose not being so slow 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.040
 but because of me you are 2 she in the 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.079
 limbo 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.700
 you must continue running clean the 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.070
 world fears that it becomes watch 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.070
 comandancia I've seen you I'm going there 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.829
 sometimes you must find death knows 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.290
 what happens when you die understanding 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.540
 now that spirit 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.400
 it reduces everyone to see at this moment 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.430
 all my condition is to end up drowning 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.240
 Aluminum accepts your destiny as everything 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.770
 the rest 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.770
 I'm sorry to say there is no there maybe not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.150
 the game is terrific what runs through 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 my chest when I open my eyes and find myself 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.890
 the torment since we will tell you is very 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.390
 slow and there I can go molding to see 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.549
 what can I do the next move 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.549
 and find me 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.040
 heaven to me waiting for me with my 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.560
 lost sister no matter how much 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.900
 obstacle put me in the middle overcome 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.450
 this is pacis before the cemetery 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.459
 send me whoever they are, they can not kill me 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.170
 I can feel very afraid but my 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.840
 ambition is great of dead more 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.640
 accidents but this life tells us that 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.590
 the other life that I always had in 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.080
 mind 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.760
 that base noise a strong 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.220
 because it's beautiful background is to take as 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.660
 a test that is more difficult to nothing 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.000
 let me stop I was in it 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.880
 let's go but finally in my destiny 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.069
 I will achieve the only thing I want to break 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.069
 the crystal that separates this world 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.069
 doing research 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.900
 goodbye 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.680
 really 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.680
 the witness 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.510
 three hundred fifty two thousand 800 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.799
 points surpass that 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.799
 exceed that 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.720
 and from now on I will be 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.209
 just a game because it gave me 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.590
 like I'm living in retention of 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.120
 the audience and when I'm in the area 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.709
 part of that almost all close the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.750
 video because I already saw it day and 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.159
 true the truth or a game and 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.079
 half as they are already waiting for the 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.099
 next so basically but that 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.810

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.989

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.920

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.180

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.370
 eye that there are many that I already played unless 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.919
 that they ask me a lot that was one of return 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.359

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.639
