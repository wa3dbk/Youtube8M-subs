00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
later today and apparently it's very

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.380 
later today and apparently it's very
emotional<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.619> didn't<00:01:25.619> agree<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.390> but

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
emotional one I didn't agree to this but

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
really dark like I don't think I've

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.550

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
anyway I animated it so it's like

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.020 
anyway I animated it so it's like
floating<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.739> it's<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.940> down

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
floating and it's like going up and down

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.220 
floating and it's like going up and down
and<00:02:15.600> i<00:02:16.590> made<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.370> another<00:02:18.060> background<00:02:18.840> i

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and i made like another background i

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.960 
and i made like another background i
made<00:02:19.830> another<00:02:19.980> layer<00:02:20.580> behind<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.970> would

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
made another layer behind it so it would

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.180 
made another layer behind it so it would
kind<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:24.840> was<00:02:24.989> overlapping<00:02:25.590> going

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
kind of like there was overlapping going

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.729 
kind of like there was overlapping going

do research and stop and I tried and it
was<00:02:48.060> not<00:02:48.329> easy<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:48.989> kind<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.650> like

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
was not easy so I kind of just like

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.370 
was not easy so I kind of just like
opened<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.430> into<00:02:50.730> Photoshop<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.900> Irish

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
opened it into Photoshop and like Irish

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.960 
opened it into Photoshop and like Irish
the<00:02:52.680> background<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.459> every<00:02:53.730> 30<00:02:54.000> frames<00:02:54.739> so

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.740 
the background for every 30 frames so
yeah<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.900> was<00:02:58.140> kind<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.710> long<00:02:58.890> task<00:02:59.370> but<00:02:59.850> if

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
yeah it was kind of a long task but if

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.320
