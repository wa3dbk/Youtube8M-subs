00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
actually made this before as just a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.470 
actually made this before as just a
regular<00:00:37.200> game<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.710> pc<00:00:38.100> game<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.210> didn't

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
regular game like pc game but it didn't

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720 
regular game like pc game but it didn't
have<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:40.079> vibe<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.160> made<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> VR

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
have the right vibe so they made it VR

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
have the right vibe so they made it VR
and<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.149> makes<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.660> amazing<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and what makes it so amazing is the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
and what makes it so amazing is the
concept<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.100> game<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.820> you're

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
concept of this game is that you're

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.200 
concept of this game is that you're
racing<00:00:45.629> other<00:00:46.170> drivers<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
racing other drivers but you have to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
racing other drivers but you have to
text<00:00:48.629> while<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:49.050> racing<00:00:49.170> exactly<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.219> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
text while you're racing exactly and so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760 
text while you're racing exactly and so
this<00:00:50.789> game<00:00:51.059> becomes<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.079> kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this game becomes actually a kind of a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
this game becomes actually a kind of a
challenge<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.480> since<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> VR

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
challenge because since you have a VR

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
challenge because since you have a VR
headset<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.500> you're<00:00:56.039> racing<00:00:56.520> and

game is the narrator which has it's like

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.929 
game is the narrator which has it's like
super<00:01:37.950> robotic<00:01:38.369> voice<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
super robotic voice I think you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
super robotic voice I think you
described<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.200> portal

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
described as kind of like the portal

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.050 
described as kind of like the portal
nervous

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
nervous

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.420 
nervous
this<00:01:44.060> is<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.210> very<00:01:44.390> dangerous<00:01:45.229> concept<00:01:46.159> that

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
this is a very dangerous concept that

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.340 
this is a very dangerous concept that
they've<00:01:46.670> done<00:01:47.119> in<00:01:47.299> such<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.510> light-hearted<00:01:48.200> way

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
they've done in such a light-hearted way

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.040 
they've done in such a light-hearted way
and<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:49.010> think<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.490> it's<00:01:49.790> just<00:01:50.050> incredibly

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
and I think that it's just incredibly

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.380 
and I think that it's just incredibly
memorable<00:01:51.380> because<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:52.190> that<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.729> do<00:01:53.119> think

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
memorable because of that I do think

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.090 
memorable because of that I do think
there's<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.570> long<00:01:54.260> way<00:01:54.409> for<00:01:54.560> them<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.680> go<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
there's a long way for them to go in the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.280 
there's a long way for them to go in the
development<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.820> think<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:56.119> is<00:01:56.290> something

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
development I think this is something

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.020 
development I think this is something
that's<00:01:57.470> just<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.740> fantastic<00:01:58.100> idea<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.940> they

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
that's just a fantastic idea and they

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.670 
that's just a fantastic idea and they
knew<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.210> they<00:01:59.509> had<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.750> run<00:01:59.930> with<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.530> of

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
knew that they had to run with it and of

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.920 
knew that they had to run with it and of
course<00:02:00.710> I'm<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.460> was<00:02:01.820> absolutely<00:02:02.060> awful<00:02:02.570> this

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.540
