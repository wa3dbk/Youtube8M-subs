00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
so inside there we also have a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.000 
so inside there we also have a
microfiber<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:36.269> experience<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.050> kept<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.530> stuff

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
microfiber to experience I kept a stuff

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.580 
microfiber to experience I kept a stuff
so<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:38.910> guess<00:02:39.239> it's<00:02:39.510> nothing<00:02:39.989> else<00:02:40.140> then<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
so I guess it's nothing else then it

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.199 
so I guess it's nothing else then it
feels<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.190> anything<00:02:41.640> else<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
feels like this anything else in the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.380 
feels like this anything else in the
