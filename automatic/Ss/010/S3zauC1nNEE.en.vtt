00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.480
 How about friends and I am André and I think so 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.310
 we have come to present you with two themes that are the tigers of asia and nazca 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.199
 and let's stop so many detours and start 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.779
 the tigers of asia 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.980
 In recent years a generation of new countries has emerged 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 industrial in mind even and locate in asia 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.360
 they are known as Asian tigers or four wagons of Asia makes reference to 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.410
 the economies of john with 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.780
 Singapore 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.240
 South Korea 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.730
 and taiwan 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.000
 between 1960 and 1990, these countries have stood out for maintaining high rates of 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.040
 growth and industrialization 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.680
 besides becoming important recipients of foreign investment 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.960
 everything is located in Southeast Asia 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.320
 where important multinational companies have their headquarters 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 to illustrate better let's take Seoul as an example 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.560
 where are samsung 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.940
 the surgeon 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.130
 hyundai 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.870
 and kia motors 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.870
 the four tigers share a range of characteristics with other economies 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.300
 Asians such as China and Japan 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.880
 the tigers of Southeast Asia emerged between 1945 and 1990 in the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.510
 context of the cold war 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.930
 part of the success of these countries has been based on 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 one 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.580
 the abundance of labor 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.640
 2 low wages with long hours of work 3 lack of rights 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.570
 labor 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.950
 4 the creation of port free zones where companies are 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.400
 exempt from taxes 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.700
 These factors have contributed to the relocation of many companies and 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.790
 concentrated industries in developed countries that did not need 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.650
 qualified work so they have moved their headquarters to these places 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.630
 in the 21st century 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.999
 already recovered from the financial crisis of 1997 the manufactured products 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.709
 in these countries they have firmly positioned themselves in the international market 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.569
 even though 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.340
 the tension has been shifting more and more to other economies 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.999
 Asian 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.379
 who are currently experiencing economic transformation 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.199
 the dominant differences 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:31.010
 include initial levels of education and access to markets 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.979
 world 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.399
 in terms of infrastructure 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:36.919
 Of transport 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:41.569
 and have access to navigable coasts and rivers which are essential 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.019
 After a long process, other southeastern countries begin to develop 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.200
 Asian 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.290
 the so-called minor tigers or small dragons who started late 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.599
 your road to industrialization 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.499
 rescuing the industrialized economies as a model they are 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.499
 malaysia indonesia thailand and philippines 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.709
 they form part among others of the Association of Southeastern Nations 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.159
 asian asean 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.629
 good friends that was my subject I hope you liked them left with francisco 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.040
 dyn 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.770
 how about my son's friends and to explain the nafta issue let's start 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.629
 the North American Free Trade Agreement 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.869
 also known as tlc or naphtha is a commercial block between states 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.859
 United Canada and Mexico 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.239
 which entered into force on January 1, 1994 and establishes a free zone 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.999
 Commerce 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.509
 the tlc 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:50.589
 It was signed by the three countries on December 17, 1992 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:57.339
 in 1993 the tlc was approved by the assemblies of canada mexico and states 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.589
 United 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:03.139
 the first of January of 1994 the tlc in the region 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.200
 The main objectives are 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.780
 still mention borders to market and crossing the borders of the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.840
 movement of services between the territories of the member countries 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.269
 promote conditions of competition in the area of ​​free trade 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:24.929
 will provide direction and application of intellectual rights in each country 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.860
 still substantially lament investment opportunities in the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.409
 territories of the parties 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.460
 Naphtha in Mexico 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.080
 fundamentally to consolidate the process of economic opening 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.330
 Mexico has grown by 67% 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.869
 the unemployment rate has decreased, your trade has increased, etc. 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.539
 Naphtha in the United States 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.559
 There is a need to consider new markets for their products. Mexico is 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:59.550
 one of them also mexico is important for participation in the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.059
 development of a new international policy agenda therefore the 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.059
 US motivation is more political than economic 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.809
 born in canada 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:14.479
 it is a fundamentally defensive reason 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.330
 On the one hand, there is a need to preserve the free trade agreement 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.889
 which came into force in 1989 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.400
 secondly by making sure that Canada would continue to be a place 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.360
 attractive for foreign investment and in third place being much less 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.970
 important to gain access to the Mexican market for your goods and services 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.039
 well that was my topic I hope you liked it 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.309
