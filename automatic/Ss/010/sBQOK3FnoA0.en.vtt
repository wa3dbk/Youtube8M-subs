this<00:00:50.620> will<00:00:50.800> be<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.920> significant<00:00:51.879> upgrade<00:00:53.940> now

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
this will be a significant upgrade now

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.420

that I'm putting it in it's as simple as

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.520 
that I'm putting it in it's as simple as
just<00:00:57.489> putting<00:00:57.940> in<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.300> light<00:00:58.510> bulb<00:00:58.839> socket

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
just putting in a light bulb socket

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.670 
just putting in a light bulb socket
itself<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:01.150> screws<00:01:01.659> will<00:01:01.900> actually<00:01:02.260> hold<00:01:02.530> it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
itself the screws will actually hold it

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.200 
itself the screws will actually hold it
in<00:01:02.890> place<00:01:03.070> right<00:01:03.189> up<00:01:03.699> against<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:05.220> lens<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:06.610> I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
in place right up against the lens so I

00:01:07.210 --> 00:02:15.990 
in place right up against the lens so I
can't<00:01:07.570> quite<00:01:08.140> do<00:01:08.439> this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:43.140 

look<00:02:22.599> so<00:02:23.599> far<00:02:23.840> looks<00:02:24.050> decent

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.770 

keep<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.299> one

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.580 

so<00:02:50.900> that's<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:52.670> purchase<00:02:53.270> price<00:02:53.590> about

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
so that's that the purchase price about

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.660 
so that's that the purchase price about
$70<00:02:55.280> on<00:02:55.400> Amazon<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.530> not<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> niche<00:02:57.860> not<00:02:58.280> cheap

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
$70 on Amazon so not a niche not cheap

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.699
