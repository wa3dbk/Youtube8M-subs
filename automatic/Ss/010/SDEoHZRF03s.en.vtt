00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:09.090
 meanwhile you have seen the puteggio loses 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.370
 well 177 77 49 for women technician 70 02 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.540
 of program components there was the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.910
 deduction is therefore 118 and 35 but now 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.580
 let's follow together after an airy one 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.580
 with his sorcerer's apprentice 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.520
 he celebrated his own 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.660
 return to the races already with the medal of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.660
 bronze skate canada 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.830
 then two protons nothing to do 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.090
 with triple axel 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.770
 other good 3 thanks signs golden petri 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.580
 special triple toe loop 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.380
 certainly in the second half 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.940
 beat the inmates 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.819
 only 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.090
 save 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.970
 it took a lot less fixed point 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.580
 I did a great program 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.939
 sin only for me is an honor 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.789
 framework with salt and then resumed 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.830
 fine but extraordinary questori 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.110
 nobunari oda taranto sense of this 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.729
 sorcerer's apprentice this music of the 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.939
 fantasy walt disney movie 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:43.310
 that is if even a lot of gaza and he is played 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:47.270
 to his physical way of interpreting a lot 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.159
 suitable fine technical content I have to 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.199
 then say how you pointed out so many 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.199
 so many leaps are in the second one 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.000
 half of the program 5 as many as five 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.509
 men do not have seven jumping elements 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.419
 but 8 remember they have two sequences of 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.879
 pass the first one is judged with i 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.949
 so the second levels of difficulty 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:10.099
 na coreographic sequence and therefore only 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:13.759
 as it is choreographic about music 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:16.520
 at the base value 3 spinning tops, however, he 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:18.500
 really very very good too 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.960
 very well trained the first sin 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.939
 framework did not have full rotation 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.659
 it didn't go up right then in the end not 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.360
 he did it 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:31.060
 but then, however, as if nothing had happened 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.060
 own is triple azzi 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.560
 great elevation 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.420
 but 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.720
 good tops too but then you said 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.510
 well I liked the real choreography 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.790
 fun for a lot here fits 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.480
 really this because then nice engine 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.480
 return to the races 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.700
 pity that yesterday was wrong 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.580
 why 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.160
 I do n't see myself on the show because he sees me in 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:17.520
 eighth position with 63 of that what of it 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:20.119
 you think you chat and first at 85 44 yes 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:25.529
 but now in the free here 

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:28.110
 the positions can be varied we see 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:31.020
 surely today he can be satisfied 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:34.020
 I did a great job afraid it 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:39.139
 we remember child mayor who was born l 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:43.439
 8 for the righteous from jesi then someone 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:49.409
 76.70 48 components not very high no 

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:51.409
 minus one with 54 74 has no problems 

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:53.639
 obviously to take the first position 

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:55.949
 true not so high that if you think that 

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:57.659
 held that among other things in the complex 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:03.800
 really made a program in short 

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:03.800
