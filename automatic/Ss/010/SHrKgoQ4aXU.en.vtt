yesterday<00:00:13.469> may<00:00:13.980> finally<00:00:14.519> start<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> coalesce

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
yesterday may finally start to coalesce

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.050 
yesterday may finally start to coalesce
into<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.049> pattern<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.650> makes<00:00:16.859> sense<00:00:17.340> today

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
into a pattern that makes sense today

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.870

planet<00:00:21.240> pulse<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:22.289> Monday<00:00:22.740> January

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
planet pulse on this Monday January

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.099 
planet pulse on this Monday January
thirteenth<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> moon<00:00:24.600> that's<00:00:24.869> still

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
thirteenth we have the moon that's still

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
thirteenth we have the moon that's still
in<00:00:25.260> Gemini<00:00:25.740> our<00:00:26.250> ideas<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.119> thoughts<00:00:27.300> are

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
in Gemini our ideas and thoughts are

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019 
in Gemini our ideas and thoughts are
bouncing<00:00:28.109> around<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.980> today's<00:00:29.279> Gemini<00:00:29.849> moon

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
bouncing around but today's Gemini moon

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.479 
bouncing around but today's Gemini moon
actually<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.019> part<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.890> more<00:00:32.070> complex

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
actually is part of a more complex

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.069 
actually is part of a more complex
pattern<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.480> gives<00:00:33.660> us<00:00:33.809> an<00:00:33.960> ability

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
pattern that I think gives us an ability

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.160 
pattern that I think gives us an ability
to<00:00:34.620> actually<00:00:35.070> make<00:00:35.910> product<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.809> something

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
to actually make product to do something

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
to actually make product to do something
that's<00:00:37.320> real<00:00:37.590> that's<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.610> there's<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
that's real that's because there's a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.840 
that's real that's because there's a
degree<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.510> integration<00:00:39.960> today<00:00:40.790> Gemini<00:00:41.790> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
degree of integration today Gemini is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.000 
degree of integration today Gemini is
just<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:42.480> data<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.500> doesn't

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
just about data and it doesn't

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.799 
just about data and it doesn't
necessarily<00:00:44.250> concern<00:00:45.239> itself<00:00:45.660> with

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
necessarily concern itself with

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.680 
necessarily concern itself with
connecting<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.710> piece<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.760> another<00:00:48.090> but

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
connecting one piece to another but

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.529 
connecting one piece to another but
today<00:00:49.079> mercury<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.010> key<00:00:50.309> ruling<00:00:50.879> planet<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
today mercury the key ruling planet of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.500 
today mercury the key ruling planet of
the<00:00:51.570> sign<00:00:51.930> gemini<00:00:52.640> forms<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.879> creative

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the sign gemini forms a creative

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.139 
the sign gemini forms a creative
quintile<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.559> structuring<00:00:56.280> saturn<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
quintile with structuring saturn and the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.080 
quintile with structuring saturn and the
moon<00:00:57.870> hits<00:00:58.260> both<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.890> those<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.609> gives

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
moon hits both of those which gives

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.479 
moon hits both of those which gives
structure<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.070> concepts<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.309> been

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
structure to concepts that have been

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.549 
structure to concepts that have been
just<00:01:02.699> floating<00:01:03.359> around<00:01:03.480> yeah<00:01:03.989> i<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
just floating around yeah i think the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.130 
just floating around yeah i think the
beauty<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.040> today's<00:01:05.369> pattern<00:01:05.939> i've<00:01:06.840> talked

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
beauty of today's pattern i've talked

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.840 
beauty of today's pattern i've talked
about<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> pattern<00:01:08.189> before<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.760> if

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
about this kind of pattern before but if

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.179 
about this kind of pattern before but if
you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.090> imagine<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.659> five<00:01:09.869> pointed<00:01:10.350> star<00:01:10.409> we

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you can imagine a five pointed star we

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.219 
you can imagine a five pointed star we
have<00:01:11.310> mercury<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.939> saturn<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.780> points<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
have mercury and saturn on two points of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.020 
have mercury and saturn on two points of
the<00:01:13.409> five<00:01:13.590> pointed<00:01:14.040> star<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.549> next<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> each

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the five pointed star right next to each

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
the five pointed star right next to each
other<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> moon<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> opposite

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
other with the moon on the opposite

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
other with the moon on the opposite
point<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.060> symmetry<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
point it's a it's a symmetry it's a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
point it's a it's a symmetry it's a
harmony<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.670> taking

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
harmony that has to do with taking

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
harmony that has to do with taking
things<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.570> are<00:01:21.689> beautiful<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.650> case

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
things that are beautiful in this case

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.370 
things that are beautiful in this case
the<00:01:23.130> ideas<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:23.880> mercury<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.750> ideas<00:01:25.200> are

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the ideas that's mercury the ideas are

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.679 
the ideas that's mercury the ideas are
beautiful<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.009> using<00:01:26.640> Saturn<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.299> make<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
beautiful and using Saturn to make it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
beautiful and using Saturn to make it
real<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.229> bring<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:28.740> reality<00:01:29.460> there's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
real to bring them into reality there's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
real to bring them into reality there's
some<00:01:30.090> real<00:01:30.270> magic<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.020> pattern<00:01:31.409> i<00:01:31.619> think

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
some real magic in this pattern i think

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
some real magic in this pattern i think
it's<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.090> building<00:01:33.900> something

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it's it's not just building something

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560 
it's it's not just building something
according<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> plan<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:36.119> seeing

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
according to a plan it's seeing

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.240 
according to a plan it's seeing
something<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.290> mind's<00:01:37.650> eye<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> being

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
something in your mind's eye and being

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.280 
something in your mind's eye and being
able<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.610> make<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> happen<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.479> i'd<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:39.900> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
able to make it happen and i'd like to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.969 
able to make it happen and i'd like to
recommend<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> viewers<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
recommend to the to the viewers that you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.060 
recommend to the to the viewers that you
don't<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.750> put<00:01:46.649> together

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
don't have to have it all put together

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.030 
don't have to have it all put together
on<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> final<00:01:47.970> form<00:01:48.479> there's<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.079> coalescing

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
on a final form there's a coalescing

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
on a final form there's a coalescing
going<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.880> evening<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.630> around

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
going on in this evening at around

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.810 
going on in this evening at around
seven-thirty<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> east<00:01:52.979> coast<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> US

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
seven-thirty in the east coast of the US

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.749 
seven-thirty in the east coast of the US
the<00:01:54.630> Moon<00:01:54.960> moves<00:01:54.990> into<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> sign<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.430> cancer

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the Moon moves into the sign of cancer

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.899 
the Moon moves into the sign of cancer
cancer<00:01:57.719> gathers<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.619> an<00:01:58.829> emotional<00:01:59.100> level<00:01:59.460> so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
cancer gathers on an emotional level so

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.450 
cancer gathers on an emotional level so
I<00:01:59.939> think<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.079> begin<00:02:01.680> some

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
I think that if we just begin some
