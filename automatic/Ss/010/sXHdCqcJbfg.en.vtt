00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 starting to get acquainted with the individual 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.750
 elements of opposition to one group 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.660
 of these elements is blocking 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.760
 when trying to apply 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.150
 hitting the top priority in this job 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.390
 will not stop arms with arms and themes 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.750
 no longer banal pulling to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.660
 Unfortunately, this option is the most 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.949
 distributed as it is 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.489
 the natural reaction of our nervous 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.840
 systems upon hit 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.180
 armed hands blocking 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.420
 need to crank the point 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.250
 contact and deploy the weapon on the cutting 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.610
 edge 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:54.739
 with one-sided sharpening knife after 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.160
 this action hand pulls up to the body 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.780
 this way we get the following 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.150
 if our attack did not succeed 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.360
 backing off we don't just jump away from 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.850
 enemy and inflicts affecting 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.820
 the action turns the hand at the point of contact 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.250
 should be carried out without stress in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.740
 otherwise, the action will be 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.680
 performed too slowly afterwards 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.240
 we start to increase the processing speed 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.240
 actions to the maximum 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.610
 having worked the action with one opponent 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.760
 go to work with two 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.040
 the action remains the same except 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.340
 the fact that we add training 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.970
 peripheral vision ability to carry 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.369
 attack from one opponent to another not 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.369
 stop an armed action 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.259
 the movement of the site partners must 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.150
 be chaotic 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:16.209
 to create a primary combat model 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.390
 the main task remains the implementation 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.709
 quick cranking of an armed hand in 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.709
 point and and blocking
