00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.150
 so let's continue to deal with 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.150
 sparkles just in case I inform you that 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.279
 This is the second part of the 33 lesson whose topic 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.260
 sparkles if you didn't watch the first part 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.880
 and pause and look first and 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.000
 and here we will deal with 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.470
 new ideas on sparkles on 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.599
 The next day I was inspired by the show 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.119
 Chanel we need not even 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.790
 sparkles and something between sparkles 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.980
 and sequins are such large 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.149
 sequins trip what type of course I have 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.770
 you have no green on the arrow 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.480
 green simple we made literally 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.980
 just now let's take here 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.989
 so golden here we are 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.030
 need and force by the way about me 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.920
 the village actually is not necessary and 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.750
 not only fastening means 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.940
 between the skin sparkles without it also 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.219
 fits cream shade retainers for 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.050
 makeup and even glue for eyelashes can 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.789
 even on the base under the shade to put sparkles 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.890
 but they will unfortunately be such a rack 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.289
 here I will put an aysil like that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.210
 here's a silicone spatula actually 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.880
 she even close is not necessarily and just 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.070
 cool I put a wider line on 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:16.440
 contour upper eyelashes now dial 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.440
 I will go gold chik and I spread them 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 I spread them on the contour of the eyelashes and 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.350
 movable eyelid 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:44.730
 here we create the effect of such a sprinkled 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.730
 glitter eyes also pull the arrow 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.740
 I 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.869
 to better form an arrow can 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:10.420
 here and in the brush move we take 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.140
 more golden spangles of such countries shining 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.330
 finger on those areas where we have not yet 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.030
 dried means if dried add 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.060
 we put sequins straight we completely cover 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.099
 movable eyelid these sparkles specifically 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.180
 penny honestly bought in the subway 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.739
 Frunze 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.790
 when they were still open 30 rubles not 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.100
 empty new year worn so radiant 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.480
 Makeup is a great reason I even give you 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.430
 I will say more to many even 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.319
 only want to immediately mark one 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.110
 very important fact and this makeup technique 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.030
 only an eye if you perform such 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.610
 make up take care that you have 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.620
 completely tonal coating is good 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.250
 blush face correction, I do add 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:04.019
 at least in the forest for lips and still black 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.019
 I will stroke the contour 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.770
 I remind you that New Year's Eve that 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.960
 a holiday that the whole world shines and you 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.520
 should not be left behind but here is one thing very 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.760
 important rule let's agree so 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.860
 if you use glitter in makeup 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.270
 shiny dresses are no longer needed by color 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.520
 glitter is chosen exactly the same as 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.220
 shadows if you can't decide on 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.110
 color take gold they just go 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.750
 all and best use them on 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.700
 eyes because on the lips they are Indian and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.940
 most likely u flow to you in the Olivier and 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.980
 more about the finished products for example 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.990
 glitter stroke this story 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.300
 which you can immediately throw it at all 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.010
 doesn't even work at all 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.510
 so a little bit about this thing you can 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.520
 immediately for being the only option 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.380
 to change here such a thing only 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.150
 pay attention to the color of the sequins 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.010
 your eyeliner match the color 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.870
 glitter on the eyes otherwise turn out porridge 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.250
 so well that with Cleopatra we say goodbye and 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.470
 move on so you're here i barely barely 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.120
 Cleopatra washed off previous spangles 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.070
 so to speak tightly I want 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.840
 show another trick for shy 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.420
 connections to whom it is weakly direct to shine and shine 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.230
 but by plus to I would like to paint 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.570
 eyelashes 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.380
 here I just see ac because they 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.650
 I have already made up any eyebrow gel 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.419
 transparent gel applied directly offensively 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:30.370
 eyelashes first one eye then second and 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:32.110
 using a brush we put glitter here i 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.590
 took the same gold sparkles as on 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.590
 Cleopatra 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.150
 we 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.310
 very well communicate sequins which 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.629
 super straight cleave strongly to clean the skin 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.060
 mascara brush 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:05:01.300
 it is for the eyebrows here we have such 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.009
 shiny turned cilia and eyes 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.780
 no rush and the holiday atmosphere is not 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.500
 lost master so to speak 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.139
 note and another significant moment 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.539
 I'm not wasting my lips now, let's 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.530
 I will show you one of my favorites 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.190
 holiday options in red 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.190
 draw around the contour 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:35.250
 feather the cotton swab and put 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.010
 red lipstick and a beris zhirnenky 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.920
 I'll take here such a color about 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.900
 here is this box someone very much 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.710

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.510
 palette i go there ruthlessly new fudge 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.150

00:05:51.150 --> 00:06:00.830
 accessories and now in this our fudge I 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.830
 I print gold spangles on the center 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.520
 after that I still take the transparent shine and 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.749
 I cover very carefully my lip along with 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.080
 Sparkles look so they do not 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.080
 mixed up 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.890

 impossible to wipe off with just water or 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.610
 ordinary makeup remover 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.980
 There are some very good options. 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.930
 This makeup remover milk
