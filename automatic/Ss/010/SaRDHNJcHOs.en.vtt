up<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> water<00:00:34.649> tank<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:36.530> think<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:37.920> like

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
up the water tank I think it was like

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.190 
up the water tank I think it was like
120<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.090> her<00:00:39.210> 40<00:00:41.390> tubing's<00:00:42.390> nothing<00:00:42.960> big

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
120 and her 40 tubing's nothing big

fittings or a buck or so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.490 
fittings or a buck or so
all<00:00:46.440> right<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.670> pump<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.989> probably

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
all right here is the pump it's probably

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.080 
all right here is the pump it's probably
a<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:50.690> overkill<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:53.309> thing<00:00:53.579> good<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
a little overkill on this thing good to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
a little overkill on this thing good to
go<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> smaller<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.710> puts

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
go on with a smaller but it really puts

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.219 
go on with a smaller but it really puts
out<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> pressure<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.590> since<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.090> 12-volt

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
out the pressure and since it is 12-volt

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:10.160 
out the pressure and since it is 12-volt
direct<00:01:04.229> current<00:01:06.470> all's<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.860> did<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.990> went

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
direct current all's I did was I went

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.530 
direct current all's I did was I went
and<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.010> battery<00:01:12.260> that's<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.439> 12<00:01:13.710> volts

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
and got the battery that's at 12 volts

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
and got the battery that's at 12 volts
because<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> would<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.900> been<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> real<00:01:16.290> pain

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
because it would have been a real pain

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.960 
because it would have been a real pain
to<00:01:16.830> try<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.280> convert<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.850> over<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:21.080> I

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
to try and convert it over so that I

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.370 
to try and convert it over so that I
could<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.090> plugged<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.320> do

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
could have just plugged it in like I do

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.230 
could have just plugged it in like I do
the<00:01:25.619> water<00:01:25.799> heater<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.320> then<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:29.240> just

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the water heater and then I just

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.450 
the water heater and then I just
attached<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:31.079> alligator<00:01:32.009> clip<00:01:32.280> ease

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
attached some little alligator clip ease

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.630 
attached some little alligator clip ease
to<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
to it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.110 
to it
negative<00:01:37.810> run<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.440> course<00:01:42.650> once<00:01:43.120> the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
negative run and of course once the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.340 
negative run and of course once the
stops<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:44.870> stops<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:47.780> can't<00:01:48.050> wash

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
stops it stops and and you can't wash

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.350 
stops it stops and and you can't wash
your<00:01:48.380> hands<00:01:48.950> all<00:01:49.100> day<00:01:49.280> long<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:49.880> wear<00:01:50.210> out

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
your hands all day long and wear out

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.820 
your hands all day long and wear out
that<00:01:50.390> battery<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.050> then<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.200> just<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.800> a

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
