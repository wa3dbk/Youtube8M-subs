quality<00:01:22.380> device<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:24.780> weighs<00:01:25.049> 200<00:01:25.530> grams<00:01:25.590> which

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
quality device it weighs 200 grams which

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.140 
quality device it weighs 200 grams which
is<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.479> light<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.490> big<00:01:29.790> phone

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
is not so light but you get a big phone

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.800 
is not so light but you get a big phone
so<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.799> should<00:01:31.860> expect<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
so this is what you should expect the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
so this is what you should expect the
battery<00:01:34.170> behind<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.979> cover<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.310> removable

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
battery behind this cover is removable

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.819 
battery behind this cover is removable
it<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.530> 3,300<00:01:37.530> milliamp<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:39.210> big<00:01:40.049> which

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
it is 3,300 milliamp I was big which

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.350 
it is 3,300 milliamp I was big which
should<00:01:41.070> last<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.610> about<00:01:41.869> one<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.049> two<00:01:43.079> days<00:01:43.229> I

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
should last you about one to two days I

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.170 
should last you about one to two days I
think<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.229> also<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.189> 16<00:01:47.579> gigabyte<00:01:47.759> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
think so also we get a 16 gigabyte of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.679 
think so also we get a 16 gigabyte of
internal<00:01:48.990> memory<00:01:49.140> which<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:50.210> upgraded<00:01:51.210> by

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
internal memory which can be upgraded by

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.830 
internal memory which can be upgraded by
micro<00:01:52.110> SD<00:01:52.470> cards<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.729> talked<00:01:54.149> about<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
micro SD cards and I talked about the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.140 
micro SD cards and I talked about the
camera<00:01:55.200> some<00:01:55.380> seconds<00:01:55.770> ago<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.759> got

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
camera some seconds ago and so it got

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.710 
camera some seconds ago and so it got
a<00:01:57.180> dark<00:01:57.900> box<00:01:58.230> right<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.820> which<00:01:59.820> showcases

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
a dark box right here which showcases

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.980 
a dark box right here which showcases
with<00:02:00.960> pixel<00:02:01.230> master<00:02:01.500> technology<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.400> if<00:02:02.520> we

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
with pixel master technology so if we

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.530 
with pixel master technology so if we
put<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.230> camera<00:02:04.770> lens<00:02:05.700> through<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.240> hole

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
put the camera lens through this hole

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.590 
put the camera lens through this hole
here<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.830> can<00:02:07.980> see<00:02:08.250> i'm<00:02:09.030> filming<00:02:09.270> filming

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
here as you can see i'm filming filming

it's possible to see right inside we'll

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.160 
it's possible to see right inside we'll
have<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> quick<00:02:23.490> look<00:02:23.520> at<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.910> photos<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.900> just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
took so as you can see it definitely is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.199 
took so as you can see it definitely is
past<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.660> where<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:32.340> fellow<00:02:32.580> over<00:02:32.820> here

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
past and where is this fellow over here

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.420 
past and where is this fellow over here
is<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.080> sideways<00:02:34.470> box<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.070> camera

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
is in the sideways box and the camera

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.880 
is in the sideways box and the camera
off<00:02:35.520> lumia<00:02:35.910> 1020<00:02:36.060> couldn't<00:02:36.660> see<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.590> one

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
off lumia 1020 couldn't see but this one

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400 
off lumia 1020 couldn't see but this one
were<00:02:38.340> 30<00:02:39.030> mega<00:02:39.300> pixels<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.840> pixel<00:02:39.900> master

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
were 30 mega pixels and pixel master

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.440 
were 30 mega pixels and pixel master
technology<00:02:40.890> could<00:02:41.400> do<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.300> a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
technology could do that so this is a

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.780 
technology could do that so this is a
sony<00:02:42.780> sensor<00:02:43.290> inside<00:02:43.620> which<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.160> definitely

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
sony sensor inside which is definitely

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.080 
sony sensor inside which is definitely
high<00:02:45.480> quality<00:02:46.020> imaging<00:02:46.770> sensor<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.400> we<00:02:47.910> also

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
high quality imaging sensor and we also

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.880 
high quality imaging sensor and we also
get<00:02:48.390> some<00:02:48.630> nice<00:02:48.870> images<00:02:49.320> here<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.770> example

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
get some nice images here for example

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.510 
get some nice images here for example
from<00:02:50.220> an<00:02:50.370> angry<00:02:50.640> birds<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.270> be<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.620> sharp<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
from an angry birds can be a sharp a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.750 
from an angry birds can be a sharp a
little<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.300> noise<00:02:54.450> course<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:55.830> for<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
little bit of noise course but for a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.190 
little bit of noise course but for a
smartphone<00:02:57.060> camera<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.810> actually

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
smartphone camera this is actually

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.949 
smartphone camera this is actually
pretty<00:02:58.410> decent<00:02:59.450> especially<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.780> price
