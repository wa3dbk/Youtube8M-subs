00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.820
 yes 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.039
 and I do not want you running around 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.160
 of that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.870
 patxi classic virtual headquarters yesterday 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.790
 in front of racing for the rain is the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.239
 true that ends up being a party 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.220
 a horrible game obviously that by 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.440
 the climatic conditions the court 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.579
 I was 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.680
 It's very bad so good as it looked 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 in a horrible match playing at 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.260
 ball but good we take a small 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.320
 difference that I hope you can keep the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.299
 concession juan se is the now that is already 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 before starting match it seemed that no 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.199
 he ran the ball could not play but 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.149
 I think we always have the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.890
 will to play it and the other term 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.960
 what happened in the locker room he told the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.360
 Basque did give them some tips to get out 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.009
 to play better with the rain and if also 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.450
 they had to change I imagine the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.770
 team because he is heavy bunch already 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.600
 it was cold on most of the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.280
 kids moved us all 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.159
 clothing because this one was more 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.140
 heavy with wet clothes and not Basque 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.550
 why he told us we had 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.190
 got what was harder than 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.649
 was to turn in the situation how 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.560
 there was the field and nothing to be smart 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.050
 try not to not fail or not to risk 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.960
 but to go and search because neither 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.750
 there was a lot to be played 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.400
 and well I think we kept that after 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.260
 of knowing suspended party for it 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.270
 we have that advantage that is important 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.190
 they did a light job and so at 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.830
 You do not look so tired 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.180
 after the rain yesterday we did well 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.070
 a fairly light job with bathrooms 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.750
 cold heat to relax a bit like that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.490
 that I did not end up tired the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.899
 training any anecdote or some 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
 when the match is over 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.180
 yesterday the rain that was half blooper 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.430
 also unplayable the party I know if by 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.519
 moment of misery the ball was water 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.000
 for every side makes a ball that is left 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.430
 stuck they arrive like 5 or 6 of all of 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.710
 all whole two teams were kilos very 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.190
 serious 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.590
 the game was playable in the game 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.900
 up and that sergio wants one that 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.840
 threw me to the floor that arrived mid afternoon 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 that skated that if it 's that I'm not from 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.530
 goodbye and so many kicks but 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.360
 they go after in just one time against the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.700
 bench of substitutes also to move that 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.020
 We were three and it was a true neighborhood 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.550
 that you could not even see where level is 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.950
 the ball can not clear anything but 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.370
 well be within everything came a 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.560
 cute party and we are winning 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.629
 of the things that happened was the first 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.819
 time in a ball that they threw me that 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.290
 I went to look for it and since it was not possible to lie 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.900
 to the floor without realizing that it's going to 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.599
 give away and spend long I got to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.180
 inside the poster and nothing good but 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.239
 after saying the impossible most of 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.680
 the plays were very worked then 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.220
 most of the guys determined 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.769
 falling and it was very complicated because 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.720
 between victory and had water agreement 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:25.349
 well well the truth that good is 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.349
 happy for the win the goal 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.510
 agreement 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.439
 how was the game good 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.000
 when playing 60 minutes we are together 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.030
 better than they did 90 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.440
 with layers that harms us the day of 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.360
 tomorrow but I think today we are 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.900
 recovering today without some jobs 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.600
 nor does it come from regenerative recovery 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.520
 for for good if it's okay for couple in 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.440
 Thursday yes I think it 's important the 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.450
 rest you have to rest well me 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.450
 it seems fine the judge is fine
