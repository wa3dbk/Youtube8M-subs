doing the home GP at the end it could be

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.350 
doing the home GP at the end it could be
an<00:00:09.780> advantage<00:00:10.130> or<00:00:11.130> not<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.580> depends<00:00:11.849> about<00:00:12.150> our

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
an advantage or not it depends about our

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.440 
an advantage or not it depends about our
position<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.080> class<00:00:13.290> mint<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.269> do<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.330> do

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
position in the class mint and do you do

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.599 
position in the class mint and do you do
the<00:00:15.570> logistics<00:00:16.080> I'd<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.320> prefer<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.279> as<00:00:17.580> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
the logistics I'd I prefer to do it as a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.519 
the logistics I'd I prefer to do it as a
first<00:00:17.910> race<00:00:18.240> because<00:00:18.810> then<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.170> don't<00:00:19.199> think

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
first race because then you don't think

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.260 
first race because then you don't think
any<00:00:19.680> more<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.010> your<00:00:20.189> own<00:00:20.340> GP<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:21.090> it's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
any more to your own GP because it's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.420 
any more to your own GP because it's
really<00:00:21.390> special<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:21.930> us<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> lot<00:00:23.400> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
really special for us we have a lot of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.599 
really special for us we have a lot of
guests<00:00:23.970> sponsor<00:00:24.600> public<00:00:25.320> fans<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.400> come

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
guests sponsor public fans that come

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.060 
guests sponsor public fans that come
over<00:00:26.820> there<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> see<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> race<00:00:27.800> on<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> other

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
over there to see the race on the other

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.500 
over there to see the race on the other
side<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> think<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> end<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
side I think that at the end of the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.299 
side I think that at the end of the
season<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.170> even<00:00:31.590> stronger<00:00:31.859> than<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
season we can be even stronger than a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.610 
season we can be even stronger than a
beginning<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.090> probably<00:00:33.960> could<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.410> better

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
beginning so probably could be better

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.490 
beginning so probably could be better
that<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> last<00:00:35.280> race<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.149> well<00:00:36.960> organized

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that is the last race is well organized

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.940 
that is the last race is well organized
we<00:00:38.309> always<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.730> little<00:00:38.969> bit<00:00:39.059> scary<00:00:39.420> when<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.320> saw

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
we always a little bit scary when we saw

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
we always a little bit scary when we saw
last<00:00:41.190> year<00:00:41.460> fair<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> calendar<00:00:42.660> but

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
last year fair more in the calendar but

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.560 
last year fair more in the calendar but
then<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> fantastic<00:00:44.100> track<00:00:44.610> very<00:00:45.270> nice

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
then was a fantastic track very nice

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.650 
then was a fantastic track very nice
with<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.320> jumps<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.730> good<00:00:48.890> here<00:00:49.890> more

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
with your jumps and very good here more

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.700 
with your jumps and very good here more
last<00:00:51.660> year<00:00:51.840> I've<00:00:51.960> been<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.500> watching

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
last year I've been I'm just watching

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.459 
last year I've been I'm just watching
because<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.219> had<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.969> GD<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> presidency

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
because I had a GD from the presidency

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.670 
because I had a GD from the presidency
guess<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.789> fact<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.360> looking<00:00:58.020> really<00:00:58.350> good

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
guess so in fact was looking really good

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.520 
guess so in fact was looking really good
pretty<00:00:59.280> good<00:00:59.520> but<00:00:59.750> still<00:01:00.750> nominee<00:01:01.140> watching

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
pretty good but still nominee watching

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.110 
pretty good but still nominee watching
the<00:01:01.649> veneration<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:02.910> different

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the veneration it is really different

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.260 
the veneration it is really different
when<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> track<00:01:06.680> then<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.890> will

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
when you get on the track then you will

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.179 
when you get on the track then you will

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
see the check complete different then

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.789 
see the check complete different then
