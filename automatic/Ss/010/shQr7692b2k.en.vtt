00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
three weeks so and that's not even doing

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.080 
three weeks so and that's not even doing
it<00:00:40.410> every<00:00:40.620> day<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:41.129> anybody<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.820> knows

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it every day because anybody that knows

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
it every day because anybody that knows
me<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.320> bit<00:00:43.500> absent-minded

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
me I can be a little bit absent-minded

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.790 
me I can be a little bit absent-minded
so<00:00:44.520> there<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> few<00:00:45.629> days<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> missed<00:00:46.379> in

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
so there was a few days that I missed in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.619 
so there was a few days that I missed in
between<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:50.329> that<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> right

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
between so you can see that the right

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.799 
between so you can see that the right
eye<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:52.550> noticeably<00:00:53.629> puffier<00:00:54.629> than<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.649> left

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
i have been itching to try this i really

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.050 
i have been itching to try this i really
wanted<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.940> because<00:03:02.579> who<00:03:03.579> doesn't<00:03:03.610> want<00:03:04.030> to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
wanted to because who doesn't want to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.720 
wanted to because who doesn't want to
look<00:03:04.120> younger<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.959> definitely<00:03:05.440> do<00:03:05.769> if<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.519> say

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
look younger I definitely do if you say

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.699 
look younger I definitely do if you say
you<00:03:06.790> don't<00:03:07.030> check<00:03:07.959> your<00:03:07.989> pants<00:03:08.620> because

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
you don't check your pants because

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:24.120 
you don't check your pants because
they're<00:03:08.980> probably<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.430> fire<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.980> let's<00:03:12.190> see

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:38.900 

not<00:03:24.790> seeing<00:03:25.120> difference<00:03:25.630> yet

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.130 

sorry<00:03:39.910> for<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.180> awkward<00:03:40.540> silence<00:03:40.750> I'm

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
sorry for the awkward silence I'm

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:58.660 
sorry for the awkward silence I'm
waiting<00:03:41.440> for<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:46.260> work

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:11.010 

let's<00:03:59.330> make<00:03:59.510> sure<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.690> didn't<00:03:59.990> miss<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.140> step

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.610 

ok

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
ok

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:24.830 
ok
and<00:04:17.239> dry<00:04:18.239> now

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.659 

so<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.680> can<00:04:25.919> see<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.190> difference<00:04:26.550> this<00:04:26.880> is

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
so you can see the difference this is

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.760 
so you can see the difference this is
probably<00:04:29.669> about<00:04:30.320> two<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.500> half<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.740> three

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
probably about two and a half to three

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.240 
probably about two and a half to three
weeks<00:04:32.220> with<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.730> uplift<00:04:33.150> eye<00:04:33.330> serum<00:04:34.250> from

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
weeks with the uplift eye serum from

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.969 
weeks with the uplift eye serum from
unique<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.530> then<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.620> can<00:04:37.740> see<00:04:37.889> the

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
unique and then you can see the

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.040 
unique and then you can see the
noticeable<00:04:38.370> difference<00:04:38.850> there's<00:04:39.120> no<00:04:39.330> bag<00:04:39.630> a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
noticeable difference there's no bag a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.330 
noticeable difference there's no bag a
little<00:04:40.919> bit<00:04:41.070> but<00:04:41.900> that's<00:04:42.900> only<00:04:43.169> about<00:04:43.949> two<00:04:44.250> and

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
little bit but that's only about two and

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.150 
little bit but that's only about two and
half<00:04:44.400> three<00:04:44.699> weeks<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:45.060> use<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:46.160> the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
half three weeks of use and the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.420 
half three weeks of use and the
instantly<00:04:47.940> ageless<00:04:48.330> did<00:04:49.139> not<00:04:49.380> get<00:04:49.800> rid<00:04:50.040> of<00:04:50.070> my

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430

instantly ageless did not get rid of my
bag<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:56.270> not<00:04:57.270> quite<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:57.750> instant<00:04:59.720> anyways<00:05:00.720> if

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470
