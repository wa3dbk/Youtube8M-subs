you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.159> play<00:01:11.520> multiple<00:01:11.729> keys<00:01:12.240> at<00:01:12.569> the<00:01:12.630> same

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
you can play multiple keys at the same

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.199 
you can play multiple keys at the same
time<00:01:13.109> but<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> horn<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.639> only<00:01:14.759> create

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:15.209 
time but with a horn you can only create

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:21.820 
time but with a horn you can only create
one<00:01:15.479> pitch<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> time

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.580 

I<00:01:21.860> like<00:01:22.160> to<00:01:22.190> think<00:01:22.730> of<00:01:23.120> it<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.900> very<00:01:24.080> playful

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
I like to think of it it's very playful

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.630 
I like to think of it it's very playful
you<00:01:24.830> know<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:24.950> think<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.370> work<00:01:25.520> is

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
you know I think that the work is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.190 
you know I think that the work is
playful<00:01:26.090> too<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.450> hope<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:26.930> comes

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
playful too I hope that that comes

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.900 
playful too I hope that that comes
through<00:01:27.500> in<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.680> work<00:01:27.800> most<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.460> my<00:01:28.610> paintings

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
through in the work most of my paintings

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.590 
through in the work most of my paintings
each<00:01:29.360> panel<00:01:29.960> has<00:01:30.170> at<00:01:30.380> least<00:01:30.560> 30<00:01:31.360> layers<00:01:32.360> of

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
each panel has at least 30 layers of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.200 
each panel has at least 30 layers of
paint<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:33.110> use<00:01:33.350> white<00:01:33.650> blue<00:01:34.190> yellow<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:34.940> red

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.110 
paint I use white blue yellow and red
and<00:01:35.480> so<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:35.990> mix<00:01:36.320> all<00:01:36.560> my<00:01:36.710> color<00:01:36.950> layer<00:01:37.700> upon

and so I mix all my color layer upon
layer<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.720> would<00:01:39.080> do<00:01:39.230> photography<00:01:39.470> without

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
layer I would do photography without

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.490 
layer I would do photography without
cameras<00:01:40.610> I'll<00:01:40.850> just<00:01:41.470> mentally<00:01:42.790> go<00:01:43.790> in<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.500> put

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.050 
without a camera without lights but
still<00:01:58.880> recording<00:01:59.360> little<00:01:59.600> bits<00:01:59.780> of

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
still recording little bits of

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
still recording little bits of
systematic<00:02:02.060> information<00:02:02.660> and<00:02:02.780> try<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.930> hold

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
systematic information and try to hold

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.960 
systematic information and try to hold
that<00:02:03.200> together<00:02:03.350> my<00:02:03.860> process<00:02:04.280> really<00:02:04.460> starts

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
that together my process really starts

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.390 
that together my process really starts
with<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.020> material<00:02:06.530> I've<00:02:06.830> been<00:02:07.010> working

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
with the material I've been working

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.280 
with the material I've been working
primarily<00:02:07.640> with<00:02:08.000> vinyl<00:02:08.360> for<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.810> while<00:02:08.990> now

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
primarily with vinyl for a while now

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.699 
primarily with vinyl for a while now
it's<00:02:10.130> I'm<00:02:10.580> just<00:02:10.820> really<00:02:11.060> attracted<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.660> on<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
it's I'm just really attracted to on the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.220 
it's I'm just really attracted to on the
paradox<00:02:13.190> that's<00:02:13.580> kind<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:13.880> imbued<00:02:14.720> into<00:02:15.050> what

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
paradox that's kind of imbued into what

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.670 
paradox that's kind of imbued into what
it<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:17.120> also<00:02:17.270> has<00:02:17.420> great<00:02:17.750> sculptural

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it is and it also has great sculptural

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.650 
it is and it also has great sculptural
qualities<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.430> think<00:02:19.700> my<00:02:19.850> work<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.150> inseparable

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
qualities I think my work is inseparable

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.330 
qualities I think my work is inseparable
from<00:02:20.690> its<00:02:21.200> process<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.740> mean<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.950> think<00:02:22.130> that's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
from its process I mean I think that's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.910 
from its process I mean I think that's
actually<00:02:22.880> where<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.300> art<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
actually where the art is the the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.130 
actually where the art is the the
objects<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.820> are<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.269> museum<00:02:26.660> or<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:26.959> a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
objects that are in the museum or in a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.140 
objects that are in the museum or in a
gallery<00:02:27.380> or<00:02:27.620> just<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.280> points<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.670> exchange

gallery or just the points of exchange

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.380 
gallery or just the points of exchange
and<00:02:29.570> generally<00:02:30.350> those<00:02:30.620> objects<00:02:31.610> get<00:02:32.000> recycled

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
and generally those objects get recycled

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.660 
and generally those objects get recycled
they<00:02:32.840> get<00:02:33.080> brought<00:02:33.920> back<00:02:33.950> into<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.459> studio

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
they get brought back into the studio

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.759 
they get brought back into the studio
after<00:02:35.060> an<00:02:35.300> exhibition<00:02:35.870> they<00:02:35.989> get<00:02:36.170> cut<00:02:36.410> up<00:02:36.440> they

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
after an exhibition they get cut up they

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.190 
after an exhibition they get cut up they
get<00:02:36.920> used<00:02:37.190> again<00:02:37.790> for<00:02:37.820> something<00:02:38.360> else<00:02:38.510> so

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
get used again for something else so

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.890 
get used again for something else so
that<00:02:39.470> whole<00:02:39.920> mentality<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.940> converting

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
that whole mentality of converting

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.860 
that whole mentality of converting
material<00:02:42.620> into<00:02:43.100> form<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.489> meaning<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:44.209> really

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
material into form and meaning is really

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.500 
material into form and meaning is really
what<00:02:45.110> happens<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:45.739> my<00:02:45.920> studio<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.480> me

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
what happens in my studio and that to me

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.690 
what happens in my studio and that to me
is<00:02:47.750> where<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.260> artwork<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.519> whole

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
is where the artwork is the whole

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.870 
is where the artwork is the whole
concept<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.989> idea<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.890> always<00:02:52.220> starts<00:02:52.310> first

it only comes from for myself from

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.680 
it only comes from for myself from
making<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.680> up<00:03:51.799> so<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.340> have<00:03:52.819> like<00:03:53.000> drawers<00:03:53.390> and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
making it up so I have like drawers and

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.910 
making it up so I have like drawers and
drawers<00:03:53.900> full<00:03:54.319> of<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:55.700> stuff<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:57.290> collected

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
drawers full of this stuff I collected

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.759 
drawers full of this stuff I collected
over<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.220> 30-plus<00:03:58.910> years<00:03:59.600> which<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.440> knew

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
over the 30-plus years which I knew

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.600 
over the 30-plus years which I knew
eventually<00:04:02.080> there's<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.140> need<00:04:03.410> for<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:04.220> I
