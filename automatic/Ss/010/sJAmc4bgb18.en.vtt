 point in the asset taking off center airport 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:15.930
 degree reduces the level 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.769
 local lore 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.769
 makes the world a little cleaner 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.769
 but the first lady made a st 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.939

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.720
 For starters, this is a Russian word 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.710

 for us in first class this kind 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.060
 it seems that it is the Japanese version 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 movie calls 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.280
 and I didn't like why the parents of it 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.689
 the child left him alone 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:27.400
 at the monitor 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.350

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.350
 I know where 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.520
 when it's a long time ago I wanted to do this 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.980
 video review review but did not have time again 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.910

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.540

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.870

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.210

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.210
 that arthur looks like this 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.109

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.979
 this child skipped classes 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:33.499
 mathematics 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.569
