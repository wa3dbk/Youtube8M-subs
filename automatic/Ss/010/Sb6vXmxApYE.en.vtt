and once it did the veteran quarterback
made<00:01:52.470> his<00:01:52.680> adjustments<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.369> exploited<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
made his adjustments and exploited the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.679 
made his adjustments and exploited the
vulnerable<00:01:55.020> area<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:56.219> fell<00:01:56.579> into<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.969> showed

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
vulnerable area we fell into it showed

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.929 
vulnerable area we fell into it showed
our<00:01:57.869> hand<00:01:58.140> early<00:01:58.680> which<00:01:59.070> I'm<00:01:59.219> sure<00:01:59.460> will<00:01:59.700> look

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
our hand early which I'm sure will look

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.490 
our hand early which I'm sure will look
back<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.119> tape<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> say<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.110> shouldn't

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
back on tape and say we shouldn't

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
back on tape and say we shouldn't
figured<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> out<00:02:02.159> earlier<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> defense

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
figured it out earlier so the defense

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.510 
figured it out earlier so the defense
recognizes<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> mistakes<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.009> made<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
recognizes the mistakes it made and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.580 
recognizes the mistakes it made and
they're<00:02:06.090> looking<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.450> correct<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
they're looking to correct it this is a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.559 
they're looking to correct it this is a
learning<00:02:07.950> process<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.729> let's<00:02:09.030> remember

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
learning process and let's remember

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.690 
learning process and let's remember
regardless<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> struggles<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> defense

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
regardless of the struggles the defense

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.220 
regardless of the struggles the defense
has<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.239> season<00:02:12.720> it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
has this season it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.410 
has this season it
still<00:02:13.470> looks<00:02:13.890> way<00:02:14.250> better<00:02:14.459> than<00:02:14.790> last<00:02:15.030> year

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
still looks way better than last year

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.000 
still looks way better than last year
these<00:02:15.780> guys<00:02:15.989> are<00:02:16.200> actually<00:02:16.290> making<00:02:16.739> some

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
these guys are actually making some

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.580 
these guys are actually making some

can<00:02:19.769> eliminate<00:02:20.159> those<00:02:20.489> penalties<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.209> not

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
can eliminate those penalties and not

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.420 
can eliminate those penalties and not
expose<00:02:22.049> their<00:02:22.260> hand<00:02:22.530> prior<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> snap
