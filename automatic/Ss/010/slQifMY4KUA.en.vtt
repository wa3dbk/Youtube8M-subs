00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
lights from them I just well I can use

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.370 
lights from them I just well I can use
it<00:00:50.800> every<00:00:51.130> year<00:00:51.370> I<00:00:51.760> think<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.840> lights<00:00:53.170> behind

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
it every year I think the lights behind

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.590 
it every year I think the lights behind
me<00:00:53.710> are<00:00:53.770> like<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.040> year<00:00:54.400> old<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.940> they're<00:00:55.210> still

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
me are like a year old and they're still

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.660 
me are like a year old and they're still
like<00:00:56.079> really<00:00:56.680> good<00:00:56.829> condition<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.430> lights

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
like really good condition the lights

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
have not dimmed of it but they still

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.280 
have not dimmed of it but they still
work<00:00:59.620> perfectly<00:00:59.980> fine<00:01:00.910> I've<00:01:01.810> like<00:01:01.989> five

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
work perfectly fine I've like five

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.960 
work perfectly fine I've like five
different<00:01:02.440> sizes<00:01:02.739> that<00:01:02.980> you<00:01:03.220> can<00:01:03.399> get<00:01:03.579> in<00:01:03.790> like

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
different sizes that you can get in like

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.270 
different sizes that you can get in like
4<00:01:04.210> different<00:01:04.299> colors<00:01:04.780> I<00:01:04.960> don't<00:01:05.950> know<00:01:06.070> what

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
4 different colors I don't know what

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.069 
4 different colors I don't know what
colors<00:01:06.640> they<00:01:06.729> have<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:07.090> just<00:01:07.119> know<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.600> get<00:01:07.930> the

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
colors they have I just know I get the

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.920 
colors they have I just know I get the
warm<00:01:08.380> white<00:01:08.680> lights<00:01:09.009> and<00:01:09.369> I<00:01:10.210> have<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.689> few

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
warm white lights and I have a few

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.200 
warm white lights and I have a few
different<00:01:11.259> sizes<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.680> just<00:01:11.860> depends<00:01:12.280> on<00:01:12.399> how

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
different sizes it just depends on how

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.420 
different sizes it just depends on how
large<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.659> area<00:01:14.259> is<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:14.979> you<00:01:15.100> won't<00:01:15.189> put

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
large the area is that you won't put

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.770 
large the area is that you won't put
fairy<00:01:15.640> lights<00:01:15.880> up<00:01:16.090> they're<00:01:16.390> just<00:01:16.570> regular

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
fairy lights up they're just regular

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.600 
fairy lights up they're just regular
fairy<00:01:17.320> lights<00:01:17.620> one<00:01:17.860> people<00:01:18.100> asked<00:01:18.370> me<00:01:18.430> if

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
fairy lights one people asked me if

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.580 
fairy lights one people asked me if
they're<00:01:18.790> like<00:01:19.000> specific<00:01:19.570> like<00:01:19.930> hanging<00:01:20.380> ones

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
they're like specific like hanging ones

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.330 
they're like specific like hanging ones
or<00:01:20.830> if<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.159> place<00:01:21.909> them<00:01:22.180> like<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.540> on<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.810> wall

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
or if I place them like that on the wall

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.130 
or if I place them like that on the wall
all<00:01:24.340> I<00:01:24.400> used<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.880> stick<00:01:25.090> them<00:01:25.270> up<00:01:25.420> are<00:01:25.659> push

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
all I used to stick them up are push

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.380 
all I used to stick them up are push
pins<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:26.770> I'll<00:01:26.979> just<00:01:27.190> take<00:01:27.400> some<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:27.909> them<00:01:28.150> and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
pins so I'll just take some of them and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.810 
pins so I'll just take some of them and
I'll<00:01:28.510> just<00:01:29.080> pin<00:01:29.320> them<00:01:29.470> all<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.280> top<00:01:30.549> of<00:01:30.729> the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
I'll just pin them all on the top of the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.660 
I'll just pin them all on the top of the
wall<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.330> then<00:01:31.840> parallel<00:01:32.500> I'll<00:01:32.979> do<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.460> same

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
wall and then parallel I'll do the same

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.850 
wall and then parallel I'll do the same
thing<00:01:33.869> across<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:34.990> bottom<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.560> make<00:01:35.680> sure

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
thing across the bottom and make sure

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.460 
thing across the bottom and make sure
they<00:01:36.040> are<00:01:36.070> parallel<00:01:36.640> like<00:01:37.000> aligned<00:01:37.630> from<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
they are parallel like aligned from the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.469 
they are parallel like aligned from the
top<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.860> bottom<00:01:39.010> so<00:01:39.400> I'll<00:01:39.760> just<00:01:39.970> have<00:01:40.210> pins

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
top to the bottom so I'll just have pins

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.000 
top to the bottom so I'll just have pins
on<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.840> top<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.320> bottom<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.710> our<00:01:41.830> wall

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
on the top and the bottom of our wall

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.830 
on the top and the bottom of our wall
and<00:01:42.220> then<00:01:42.340> what<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.640> will<00:01:42.880> do<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.510> I<00:01:43.659> was

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
and then what I will do this is I was

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.289 
and then what I will do this is I was
doing<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.650> lights<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.549> out<00:01:45.729> of<00:01:46.000> all<00:01:46.150> the

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
doing the lights in and out of all the

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.719 
doing the lights in and out of all the
pins<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.990> I'll<00:01:47.110> usually<00:01:47.470> go<00:01:47.710> over<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.520> top<00:01:48.700> of

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
pins and I'll usually go over the top of

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.300 
pins and I'll usually go over the top of
two<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.420> then<00:01:49.630> down<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.290> then<00:01:50.380> down<00:01:50.740> through

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
two and then down and then down through

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.270 
two and then down and then down through
the<00:01:52.000> bottom<00:01:52.150> of<00:01:52.360> two<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.840> then<00:01:52.960> up<00:01:53.140> again<00:01:53.320> if

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
the bottom of two and then up again if

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.609
