obviously<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.310> said<00:03:20.519> before<00:03:20.670> it's

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
obviously like I said before it's

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.080 
obviously like I said before it's
natural<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.959> happens<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.709> all<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.070> us<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.760> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
natural it happens to all of us but it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.660 
natural it happens to all of us but it
is<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.630> comes<00:03:24.870> back<00:03:25.109> to<00:03:25.170> how<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.739> react<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.430> it

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
is it comes back to how we react to it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.449 
is it comes back to how we react to it
