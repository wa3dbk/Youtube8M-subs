00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:09.530
 Hi alienated the party should this time be determined for St. Zeno 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.860
 I'm told by loosening the attack saw the cow never be less that of Cao Cao 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:20.789
 0.2 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.2 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:23.520
 There is a big histogram bowl with a couple of parks on it. 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 So we're all here . 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:32.489
 The units are now shifting their three enemies from the number of people . 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.899
 0.05 0.1 0.2 in this way so each fit 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.219
 The gag is also suitable for the source to match the source. 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.789
 I did. 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:47.579
 It's easy. And then the last time we did , so the synthesis of the width of the rectangle 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:53.249
 He must also be the general mall of the rectangle. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:57.299
 So one streetlights are still rattling the size of the same rank 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:01:00.659
 Granny Rectangular Hothouse 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:06.650
 The horizontal size doeneungeogo 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.650
 In addition to that , 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.550
 If you buy it , you will be able to find out who has one car that is one car wide, 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.479
 The rectangle becomes a dog. 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.420
 Now, the next time when you get the entire width of the original to rest when I put money in 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:27.060
 When I was writing, I did not get the total number of degrees . 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:33.660
 In Figure 2, the aggregate as a whole is likewise surprised to see that all bar graphs 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.670
 Then beg the full extent of the gag Beck raising the total destruction of people of equal numbers 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.140
 Contain 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.710
 When you write, you use the total of 2 reps and 3 reps. 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.259
 Coming 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.020
 Gopado happened but put the information we have learned is the total sum spent three dogs 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.560
 How much is always 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.640
 The sum of the Holy Land Ross 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.640
 I learned to work. 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.620
 Eventually gotta take this match 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:09.920
 Yogeo rectangular adding all enemies what extent the size of its total width class 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.030
 You have to ask for multiplication or something. 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:19.430
 Now here's the d . 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.870
 I had more direct experience than I had to do if the size of the intervention was 12 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.680
 About Us 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.660
 5 15 won without following Bodum arc a10 to do some significant properly 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.930
 At 10 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.000
 People do not draw a graph naohdeun 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:38.750
 Size is also indicative capped era to the one above because the size of the intervention 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.890
 If you're an Open 20 class 20 exceeded the keugil 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.190
 The dogs themselves are largely integrated in the breadth of the Bob Ross graph 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.190
 right 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.790
 Then the full Shut 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:57.230
 The last time we distribute the frequency, it means that 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.900
 Absolutely countries where more and where one 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.409
 If you take a blind spot 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.189
 This came out to vote but yoreotge eopeoseoyo 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:12.959
 Because the left and right are pierced, I want to keep it nice. 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:16.500
 Haejumyeon connections take to learn of the space behind the front of the long column 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.250
 Yireoni did so it comes out into the same 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.549
 End of school when dudung unfair beaker ago They look so alike 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.840
 But the same is true of January. It's equally important. 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.730
 Here is a picture of a mountain with a blue sky , 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.850
 I know it's the same. 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.800
 As a laugh 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:41.570
 The width of the ear made him a star also just the extremely So it'll sell 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.880
 Extent to do so under the blue part also did a comedy What Just coming 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:52.740
 I think by the size more rattling Vegas 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:57.660
 And then the next three words of Soul's that I'm looking forward to 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.420
 What's it going beyond even a little room so the last time so fast in the night 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.500
 Try symbols 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:07.190
 Now I popped neunge same material 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.840
 It is equally so watering plum letting the original place 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:16.230
 That's the same number as an accessory here ttajimyeo the professor was 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.560
 And then he bailed it three. 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.240
 So the book spore spoiler has * got the picture 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.840
 When I draw a picture of a tea store, the length of the bar is median Tamiya 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:33.120
 I bet you here. 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:35.250
 So two three Oya end key 3 as the height comes up that much 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.580
 The height went up by five. 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.660
 What do you mean that 3 books 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.609
 To say that there is not three years 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.279
 Approaching the total number of people 

00:04:44.609 --> 00:04:51.929
 The labor is hiding. 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:54.029
 If the same number is three times will also be three small Suse 10 * munhwamyeon 

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:58.079
 Ten times the administrative capacity. 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:05:03.629
 Now thou it does what the relationship should also lives transept 

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:07.139
 The maintenance is the maintenance of the time it was like this. 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:09.779
 Two more concepts around cure and repair 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:15.449
 When you are 100 times bigger , Innotek is full. 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:20.229
 It is maintenance, so the ratio of 2 to 3 in dou 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:24.100
 Against the State become equally been held together for three or fares 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:27.430
 I mean, if you draw a bar graph 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.449
 Histograms also show two to three generations 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.800
 I see two to three in the graph in the three businesses 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:39.580
 If you compare two and compare them very much 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:45.070
 Did the same in the coming eunikka skin alike did it right 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:50.050
 Now why three column graph showing that he currently steak, bar graph 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:56.169
 The bar was painted with his wealth or with a polygon 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:06:00.219
 Histogram and control is also a huge concept did in the eyes and thin than 2 minutes start dates 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:03.939
 It's the same as gom movie . 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:08.139
 Yes, it's a little bit of a source. 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:09.759
 But Matt just draw enough frequency that corresponds to the class that the bar graph 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:13.900
 Yeah, well, then . 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.919
 If you connect it with a point-and-shoot like a half-life than money , 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.189
 Too 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:24.900
 When the width of three leaks in the hotter 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:24.900
 3 3 more days because the sum of its Panamanian one that is self-size comedian 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:38.560
 It seems to be widely combined with bars or the width of a blue polygon 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:44.919
 And there are two things, King Doors, who have equal numbers , 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:51.219
 The Link Efran outline has the same approximate shape. 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:57.960
 When you get inside a lot, you've got all of your opponents done. 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:57.960
 So, next time, I'll draw a graph with an invariant number.
