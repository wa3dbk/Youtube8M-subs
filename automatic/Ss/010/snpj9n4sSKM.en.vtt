00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
there we go good news so I think I went

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.170 
there we go good news so I think I went
ahead<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.810> got<00:01:21.650> jug<00:01:22.100> open<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:22.640> time<00:01:22.909> I

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
ahead and got jug open this time I

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.469 
ahead and got jug open this time I
believe<00:01:23.979> because<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.520> decided<00:01:25.760> at<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.210> jug

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
believe because I decided at the jug

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.050 
believe because I decided at the jug
because<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:27.170> lazy<00:01:27.440> to<00:01:27.740> do<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:27.890> without<00:01:28.060> is

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
because of lazy to do it without is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.460 
because of lazy to do it without is
possible<00:01:29.570> without<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.080> don't<00:01:30.290> worry<00:01:30.409> about

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
possible without so don't worry about

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.870 
possible without so don't worry about
that<00:01:31.240> also<00:01:32.240> with<00:01:32.450> this<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:32.869> get<00:01:33.409> the

and my main idea was getting eat one of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.330 
and my main idea was getting eat one of
the<00:02:06.740> ions<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.460> in<00:02:08.030> one<00:02:08.479> through<00:02:08.779> eight<00:02:09.069> one<00:02:10.069> of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
the ions so in one through eight one of

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.120 
the ions so in one through eight one of
the<00:02:10.609> ray<00:02:10.789> guns<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.359> required

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
the ray guns is required

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.830 
the ray guns is required
because<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.580> have<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.970> use<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.330> on<00:02:13.570> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
because you have to use it on the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.920 
because you have to use it on the
fountain<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.310> able<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.520> do<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.570> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
fountain to be able to do this and the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.220 
fountain to be able to do this and the
other<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:18.010> quick<00:02:18.460> access<00:02:18.750> would<00:02:19.750> be<00:02:19.990> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
other is quick access would be the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.290 
other is quick access would be the
parallel<00:02:20.620> paralyzed<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.790> not<00:02:21.940> required

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
parallel paralyzed is not required

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.770 
parallel paralyzed is not required
however<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:24.580> does<00:02:24.880> show<00:02:25.090> helps<00:02:25.390> get<00:02:25.600> over

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
however it does show helps get over

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.050 
however it does show helps get over

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
jump down and you'll get a giant or full

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.949 
jump down and you'll get a giant or full
frag<00:04:08.560> grenades<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:09.070> one<00:04:09.340> at<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.490> time<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:09.970> as

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
frag grenades in one at a time and as

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.699 
frag grenades in one at a time and as
already<00:04:11.380> got<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.870> obvious<00:04:13.870> table<00:04:14.140> built<00:04:14.350> it's

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
already got the obvious table built it's

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.340 
already got the obvious table built it's
already<00:04:15.100> built<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.670> put<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.270> garden<00:04:16.480> which

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
already built so I put in a garden which

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.140 
already built so I put in a garden which
from<00:04:17.620> bars<00:04:17.920> i<00:04:18.070> believe<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.549> then<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.570> think<00:04:19.959> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
from bars i believe and then I think the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.310 
from bars i believe and then I think the
meteor<00:04:22.150> piece<00:04:22.360> should<00:04:22.630> be<00:04:22.780> around<00:04:23.169> here

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
meteor piece should be around here

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.580 
meteor piece should be around here
somewhere

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
somewhere

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.250 
somewhere
felt<00:04:24.980> there<00:04:25.250> i<00:04:25.520> believe<00:04:26.300> so<00:04:26.389> i<00:04:26.540> can't<00:04:26.900> quite

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
felt there i believe so i can't quite

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.500 
felt there i believe so i can't quite
remember<00:04:27.440> kids<00:04:27.980> are<00:04:28.190> very<00:04:28.310> built<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.790> but<00:04:29.030> it

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
remember kids are very built it but it

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.350 
remember kids are very built it but it
should<00:04:29.660> be<00:04:29.780> about<00:04:29.870> them<00:04:30.199> and<00:04:30.380> then<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:32.030> should

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
should be about them and then it should

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.469 
should be about them and then it should
skip<00:04:32.720> here<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.650> Rory<00:04:34.520> open<00:04:34.639> previously<00:04:35.300> and

skip here to Rory open previously and

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.540 
skip here to Rory open previously and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
socially three parts here and then once

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.040 
socially three parts here and then once
