00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
visceral and or EA could possibly do as

the time lost from the DLC being let's

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.860 
the time lost from the DLC being let's
say<00:03:48.069> broken<00:03:48.670> for<00:03:48.910> now<00:03:49.030> I'm<00:03:49.299> not<00:03:49.510> worried<00:03:49.660> too

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
say broken for now I'm not worried too

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.319 
say broken for now I'm not worried too
sure<00:03:50.530> what<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:50.859> would<00:03:51.069> expect<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.090> don't

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
sure what I would expect I I don't

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.729 
sure what I would expect I I don't
expect<00:03:52.690> them<00:03:53.139> to<00:03:53.530> give<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:53.859> monetary<00:03:54.609> refund<00:03:55.180> I

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
expect them to give a monetary refund I

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.020 
expect them to give a monetary refund I
just<00:03:56.739> don't<00:03:56.920> think<00:03:57.130> they<00:03:57.250> would<00:03:57.370> do<00:03:57.609> it<00:03:57.790> so

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
just don't think they would do it so

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.270 
just don't think they would do it so
it's<00:03:58.180> not<00:03:58.359> worth<00:03:58.540> expecting<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.350> but<00:03:59.470> maybe

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
it's not worth expecting it but maybe

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.849 
it's not worth expecting it but maybe
some<00:04:00.609> kind<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:01.090> something<00:04:01.900> else<00:04:02.079> exclusive

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
some kind of something else exclusive

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.680 
some kind of something else exclusive
I'm<00:04:03.100> not<00:04:03.310> entirely<00:04:03.609> sure<00:04:03.850> hell<00:04:04.510> I'll<00:04:04.660> even
