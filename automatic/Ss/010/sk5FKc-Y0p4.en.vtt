course<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.490> made<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> calibrations<00:04:33.930> while<00:04:34.140> I

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
course I made the calibrations while I

was<00:04:34.350> in<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.530> pantry<00:04:34.910> does<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.030> work<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.570> just

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
was in the pantry does it work I just

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.890 
was in the pantry does it work I just
tested<00:04:37.380> it<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:38.160> definitely<00:04:38.490> responds<00:04:39.300> but

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
tested it and it definitely responds but

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.170 
tested it and it definitely responds but
the<00:04:40.020> best<00:04:40.230> i<00:04:40.440> can<00:04:40.620> do<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.340> sound<00:04:41.730> beginning

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
the best i can do is a sound beginning

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.200 
the best i can do is a sound beginning
not<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.660> radar<00:04:43.110> sound<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.580> shorter<00:04:45.090> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
not the radar sound the shorter the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.170 
not the radar sound the shorter the
interval<00:04:45.630> between
