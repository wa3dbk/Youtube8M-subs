know working for firaxis we're all fans
of<00:01:11.290> squad-based<00:01:12.100> turn-based<00:01:12.729> strategy<00:01:13.000> so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
of squad-based turn-based strategy so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.130 
of squad-based turn-based strategy so
I've<00:01:14.860> played<00:01:15.220> just<00:01:15.400> about<00:01:15.549> every<00:01:16.030> turn<00:01:16.869> based

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
I've played just about every turn based

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.200 
I've played just about every turn based
strategy<00:01:17.229> game<00:01:17.650> out<00:01:18.009> there<00:01:18.040> I<00:01:18.460> think<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:19.090> all

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
strategy game out there I think we all

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.330 
strategy game out there I think we all
had<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.780> lot<00:01:20.049> of<00:01:20.080> ideas<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.860> things<00:01:21.070> that<00:01:21.220> we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
had a lot of ideas and things that we

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.800 
had a lot of ideas and things that we
wanted<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.700> do<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.000> things<00:01:22.210> we<00:01:22.390> liked<00:01:22.630> about

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
wanted to do and things we liked about

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.270 
wanted to do and things we liked about
all<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.350> games<00:01:23.530> that<00:01:23.650> we<00:01:23.829> played<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.220> the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
all of the games that we played in the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.940 
all of the games that we played in the
past<00:01:24.490> I'm<00:01:25.329> just<00:01:25.630> really<00:01:25.840> finding<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.710> fun

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
past I'm just really finding the fun

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.649 
past I'm just really finding the fun
things<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.549> eliminating<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.240> things<00:01:28.450> that

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
things and eliminating the things that

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.970 
things and eliminating the things that
you<00:01:28.870> know<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.140> didn't<00:01:29.380> really<00:01:29.409> care<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:29.920> much

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
you know we didn't really care so much

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.560 
you know we didn't really care so much
for<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.640> we<00:01:30.760> start<00:01:31.000> with<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.120> original<00:01:31.510> game

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
for so we start with the original game

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.630 
for so we start with the original game
and<00:01:32.020> we<00:01:32.080> play<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.560> we<00:01:32.650> say<00:01:32.830> okay<00:01:33.010> well<00:01:33.430> we

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
and we play it and we say okay well we

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.910 
and we play it and we say okay well we
find<00:01:33.909> that<00:01:34.060> new<00:01:34.420> players<00:01:34.720> or<00:01:35.050> even<00:01:35.320> us<00:01:35.560> old

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
find that new players or even us old

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.860 
find that new players or even us old
diehards<00:01:36.790> like<00:01:36.940> we<00:01:37.060> find<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.390> concept<00:01:37.810> we

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
diehards like we find this concept we

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.450 
diehards like we find this concept we
can<00:01:37.990> improve<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.470> little<00:01:38.680> bit<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.070> one<00:01:39.370> of

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
can improve this a little bit and one of

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.130 
can improve this a little bit and one of
the<00:01:39.520> first<00:01:39.760> things<00:01:39.880> we<00:01:40.180> looked<00:01:40.390> at<00:01:40.540> was<00:01:40.750> time

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
the first things we looked at was time

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.450 
the first things we looked at was time
units<00:01:41.500> when<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.740> idea<00:01:42.010> is<00:01:42.159> that<00:01:42.190> your

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
units when the idea is that your

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.250 
units when the idea is that your
soldiers<00:01:42.940> had<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.330> certain<00:01:43.720> number<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.990> time

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
soldiers had a certain number of time

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.080 
soldiers had a certain number of time
units<00:01:44.620> to<00:01:44.860> move<00:01:45.040> around<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> battlefield<00:01:45.640> to

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
units to move around the battlefield to

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.940 
units to move around the battlefield to
perform<00:01:46.570> abilities<00:01:47.020> take<00:01:47.260> shots<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.800> things

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
perform abilities take shots and things

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.980 
perform abilities take shots and things
like<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.490> actually<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.510> worked<00:01:49.720> great

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
like that and actually it worked great

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.230 
like that and actually it worked great
in<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.380> sense<00:01:50.620> that<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:50.920> had<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:51.610> resource

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
in the sense that you had this resource

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.090 
in the sense that you had this resource
that<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.780> were<00:01:52.930> hoarding<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.010> had

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
that you were hoarding and that you had

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.649 
that you were hoarding and that you had
to<00:01:54.159> be<00:01:54.250> careful<00:01:54.280> because<00:01:54.880> when<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.240> spent<00:01:55.510> too

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
to be careful because when you spent too

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.350 
to be careful because when you spent too
many<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.020> could<00:01:56.200> find<00:01:56.409> yourself<00:01:57.090> exposed<00:01:58.090> and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
many you could find yourself exposed and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.700 
many you could find yourself exposed and
in<00:01:58.479> dangerous<00:01:58.840> situations<00:01:59.049> so<00:01:59.470> there<00:01:59.620> was

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
in dangerous situations so there was

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.420 
in dangerous situations so there was
this<00:01:59.740> great<00:02:00.010> risk<00:02:00.280> reward<00:02:00.460> mechanic

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.460 

you<00:02:08.430> said<00:02:08.610> okay<00:02:08.880> how<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.180> we<00:02:09.570> simplify<00:02:10.020> that

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you said okay how can we simplify that

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.710 
you said okay how can we simplify that
and<00:02:10.740> sort<00:02:11.070> of<00:02:11.190> free<00:02:11.520> up<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.180> headspace

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and sort of free up all that headspace

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.450 
and sort of free up all that headspace
that<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.200> takes<00:02:13.440> up<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.860> players<00:02:14.100> head

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
that that takes up in the players head

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.840 
that that takes up in the players head
we<00:02:15.000> sort<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.390> turned<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.410> time<00:02:17.100> units<00:02:17.460> into<00:02:17.820> a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
we sort of turned the time units into a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.790 
we sort of turned the time units into a
simplified<00:02:18.600> version<00:02:18.630> where<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> player<00:02:19.530> has

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
simplified version where the player has

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.710 
simplified version where the player has
a<00:02:19.830> number<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.400> moves<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.000> they<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.540> perform

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
a number of moves that they can perform

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.140 
a number of moves that they can perform
per<00:02:22.320> turn<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.950> they<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.580> choose<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.970> move

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
per turn and they can choose to move

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.700 
per turn and they can choose to move
they<00:02:24.450> can<00:02:24.630> choose<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.930> move<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.290> shoot<00:02:25.470> they

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
they can choose to move and shoot they

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.830 
they can choose to move and shoot they
can<00:02:25.860> choose<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.010> move<00:02:26.280> really<00:02:26.580> far<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.720> then

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
can choose to move really far and then

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.540 
can choose to move really far and then
based<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.380> different<00:02:28.800> abilities<00:02:29.280> their

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
based on different abilities their

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.100 
based on different abilities their
soldiers<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.150> maybe<00:02:30.420> they<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.840> use<00:02:30.960> those

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
soldiers have maybe they can use those

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.570 
soldiers have maybe they can use those
abilities<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.650> do<00:02:31.770> different<00:02:32.100> things<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:32.520> it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
abilities to do different things but it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.190 
abilities to do different things but it
still<00:02:32.970> has<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.390> great<00:02:33.600> risk<00:02:34.020> reward

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
still has that great risk reward

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080 
still has that great risk reward
mechanic<00:02:34.860> look<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.100> need<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.400> run<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.760> far

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
mechanic look I need to run really far

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.210 
mechanic look I need to run really far
this<00:02:36.270> time<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.170> when<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.010> you're

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
this time but when you do that you're

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.800 
this time but when you do that you're
always<00:02:38.370> taking<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.820> cost<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.420> you're<00:02:39.720> not

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
always taking the cost that you're not

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
always taking the cost that you're not
going<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.020> be<00:02:40.110> able<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.320> shoot<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.770> then

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
going to be able to shoot and then

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.870 
going to be able to shoot and then
you're<00:02:40.980> going<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.130> find<00:02:41.340> yourself<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
you're going to find yourself in the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.610 
you're going to find yourself in the
difficult<00:02:42.300> tactical<00:02:42.840> position<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:49.410> other

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
difficult tactical position the other

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.980 
difficult tactical position the other
big<00:02:50.160> thing<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.550> think<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.970> we<00:02:51.090> did<00:02:51.270> was<00:02:51.450> was<00:02:51.870> we

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
big thing I think that we did was was we

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.080 
big thing I think that we did was was we
added<00:02:52.110> cover<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.830> game<00:02:52.980> now<00:02:53.370> tactically

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
added cover to the game now tactically

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.520 
added cover to the game now tactically
you<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.330> lot<00:02:54.510> more<00:02:54.660> important<00:02:55.080> decisions

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
you have a lot more important decisions

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.470 
you have a lot more important decisions
to<00:02:55.680> make<00:02:55.800> based<00:02:56.100> off<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.370> being<00:02:56.850> in<00:02:56.970> low<00:02:57.150> cover

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
to make based off of being in low cover

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.710 
to make based off of being in low cover
and<00:02:57.720> high<00:02:57.900> cover<00:02:58.400> flanking<00:02:59.400> aliens<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.390> in

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
and high cover flanking aliens so in

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.390 
and high cover flanking aliens so in
some<00:03:01.200> ways<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.530> feel<00:03:01.709> like<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:01.950> made<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.280> game

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
some ways we feel like we made the game

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.880 
some ways we feel like we made the game
more<00:03:03.020> tactical<00:03:04.020> won<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> advantage<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.860> think

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
more tactical won the advantage I think

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.220 
more tactical won the advantage I think
we<00:03:05.070> have<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.520> turn-based<00:03:05.760> game<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:07.110> we

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
we have is a turn-based game is that we

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.390 
we have is a turn-based game is that we
can<00:03:07.380> move<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> camera<00:03:07.770> around<00:03:07.890> wherever<00:03:08.190> we

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
can move the camera around wherever we

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.090 
can move the camera around wherever we
want<00:03:08.610> if<00:03:09.450> you're<00:03:09.630> making<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.020> game<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.770> has

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
want if you're making a game that has

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.280 
want if you're making a game that has
real-time<00:03:11.459> response<00:03:11.930> players<00:03:12.930> get<00:03:13.110> really

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
real-time response players get really

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
real-time response players get really
upset<00:03:13.410> when<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.800> take<00:03:13.950> control<00:03:14.040> away<00:03:14.190> from

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
upset when you take control away from

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.040 
upset when you take control away from
them<00:03:14.580> well<00:03:14.970> we<00:03:15.300> do<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.540> every<00:03:15.630> other<00:03:15.780> turn

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
them well we do that every other turn

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.570 
them well we do that every other turn
there's<00:03:16.620> been<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.830> very<00:03:17.010> cinematic<00:03:17.370> approach

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
there's been a very cinematic approach

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.060 
there's been a very cinematic approach
to<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:17.970> game<00:03:18.000> we're<00:03:18.330> making<00:03:18.600> now<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.680> wasn't

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
to the game we're making now that wasn't

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.220 
to the game we're making now that wasn't
available<00:03:20.130> then<00:03:20.780> simply<00:03:21.780> cuz<00:03:21.900> we<00:03:21.989> can<00:03:22.110> move

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
available then simply cuz we can move

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.300 
available then simply cuz we can move
the<00:03:22.320> camera<00:03:22.500> around<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.800> take<00:03:22.920> advantage<00:03:23.250> of

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
the camera around to take advantage of

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.070 
the camera around to take advantage of
fact<00:03:23.489> we<00:03:23.610> have<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.760> 3d<00:03:24.150> game<00:03:24.180> we're<00:03:24.810> still

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
fact we have a 3d game we're still

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.560 
fact we have a 3d game we're still
leveraging<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.100> 3d<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.180> tech<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.480> we

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
leveraging the 3d and the tech that we

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.860 
leveraging the 3d and the tech that we
have<00:03:27.690> available<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.340> make<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.880> much

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
have available now to to make it a much

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.910 
have available now to to make it a much
more<00:03:31.050> compelling<00:03:31.320> experience<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.890> think

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
more compelling experience I think

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.580 
more compelling experience I think
visually<00:03:32.910> than<00:03:33.570> they<00:03:33.810> were<00:03:33.870> able<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.110> do<00:03:34.200> back

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
visually than they were able to do back

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.220 
visually than they were able to do back
then<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:35.130> glam<00:03:35.370> cam<00:03:35.580> was<00:03:35.790> our<00:03:35.940> way<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.390> kind<00:03:37.080> of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
then the glam cam was our way of kind of

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.370 
then the glam cam was our way of kind of
making<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.980> turn<00:03:38.610> based<00:03:38.820> strategy<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.510> sexy<00:03:40.230> it

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
making a turn based strategy and sexy it

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.710 
making a turn based strategy and sexy it
was<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> way<00:03:40.650> for<00:03:40.680> us<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.980> take<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.090> camera<00:03:42.510> and

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
was a way for us to take the camera and

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.530 
was a way for us to take the camera and
put<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.769> put<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.459> environment<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.060> a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
put it put it in the environment in a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.630 
put it put it in the environment in a
way<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.930> kind<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.650> got<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.100> out<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.580> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
way that kind of got you out of the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.070 
way that kind of got you out of the
normal<00:03:47.880> gameplay<00:03:48.120> mode<00:03:48.540> but<00:03:48.750> let<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.959> see

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
normal gameplay mode but let you see

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.060 
normal gameplay mode but let you see
things<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.350> little<00:03:49.470> clearer<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.890> little

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
things a little clearer and a little

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.530 
things a little clearer and a little
more<00:03:50.130> up<00:03:50.250> close<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.760> feel<00:03:51.300> like<00:03:51.330> you're<00:03:51.510> a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
more up close and feel like you're a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.540 
more up close and feel like you're a
little<00:03:51.570> more<00:03:51.840> part<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.140> action<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.220> idea

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
little more part of the action the idea

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.580 
little more part of the action the idea
is<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.730> when<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.510> soldier<00:03:54.930> goes<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.380> take<00:03:55.560> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
is that when your soldier goes to take a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.310 
is that when your soldier goes to take a
cool<00:03:55.920> shot<00:03:56.280> then<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.390> camera<00:03:57.690> can<00:03:57.840> drop<00:03:58.110> in

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
cool shot then the camera can drop in

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
cool shot then the camera can drop in
and<00:03:58.440> we've<00:03:58.530> got<00:03:58.650> these<00:03:58.800> great<00:03:59.040> dramatic

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
and we've got these great dramatic

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.729 
and we've got these great dramatic
scenes<00:04:00.090> where<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.720> know<00:04:00.810> your<00:04:00.959> snipers<00:04:01.440> line

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
scenes where you know your snipers line

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.710 
scenes where you know your snipers line
up<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:02.070> super<00:04:02.730> long<00:04:02.910> shot<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.420> you'll<00:04:03.510> see

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
up this super long shot and you'll see

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.240 
up this super long shot and you'll see
it<00:04:03.810> fall<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.230> right<00:04:04.410> down<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.769> barrel<00:04:04.950> and

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
it fall it right down the barrel and

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.270 
it fall it right down the barrel and
what<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:06.030> does<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.959> allows<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.830> little

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
what that does is it allows a little

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.620 
what that does is it allows a little
more<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.489> an<00:04:08.610> intimate<00:04:08.880> connection<00:04:09.150> between

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
more of an intimate connection between

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.690 
more of an intimate connection between
you<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.230> your<00:04:10.320> soldiers<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.280> course<00:04:11.519> it

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
you and your soldiers and of course it

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.400 
you and your soldiers and of course it
increases<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.209> drama<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> actual

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
increases the drama of the actual

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.949 
increases the drama of the actual
comment<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.430> glam<00:04:14.670> cam<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.630> great

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
comment and the glam cam is is a great

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.270 
comment and the glam cam is is a great
way<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.200> do<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.560> that's<00:04:16.739> just<00:04:16.859> one<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
way to do that that's just one of the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.830 
way to do that that's just one of the
ways<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.670> we<00:04:17.730> sort<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.000> get<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.209> camera<00:04:18.660> down

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
ways that we sort of get the camera down

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.930 
ways that we sort of get the camera down
there<00:04:19.139> so<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.410> player<00:04:19.650> can<00:04:19.889> sort<00:04:20.100> of<00:04:20.160> see

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
there so the player can sort of see

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.300 
there so the player can sort of see
combat<00:04:21.780> from<00:04:21.959> their<00:04:22.110> soldiers<00:04:22.500> perspective

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.680 

the<00:04:26.310> base<00:04:26.490> was<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.730> really<00:04:26.970> unique<00:04:27.090> challenge

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
the base was a really unique challenge

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.290 
the base was a really unique challenge
for<00:04:27.900> us<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.140> design<00:04:28.550> when<00:04:29.550> we<00:04:29.670> started<00:04:30.030> on<00:04:30.150> it

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
for us to design when we started on it

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.940 
for us to design when we started on it
it<00:04:30.450> was<00:04:30.570> flat<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.020> more<00:04:31.200> like<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.350> level<00:04:31.590> in<00:04:31.770> the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
it was flat and more like a level in the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.040 
it was flat and more like a level in the
game<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.610> we<00:04:33.300> really<00:04:33.510> want<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.750> have<00:04:33.840> base

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
game and we really want to have base

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.510 
game and we really want to have base
building<00:04:34.320> but<00:04:34.770> we<00:04:34.800> render<00:04:35.160> some<00:04:35.280> really

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
building but we render some really

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.700 
building but we render some really
difficult<00:04:36.120> challenges<00:04:36.780> on<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:37.200> being<00:04:37.380> flat

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
difficult challenges on it being flat

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.890 
difficult challenges on it being flat
and<00:04:38.040> working<00:04:39.030> more<00:04:39.180> like<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> level<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:39.870> a

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
and working more like a level and a

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.470 
and working more like a level and a
certain<00:04:40.860> point<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.340> couple<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.000> my<00:04:42.090> guys<00:04:42.240> had

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
certain point a couple of my guys had

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.820 
certain point a couple of my guys had
come<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.780> they<00:04:42.960> said<00:04:43.200> you<00:04:43.350> know<00:04:43.470> what<00:04:43.680> we

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
come in and they said you know what we

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.020 
come in and they said you know what we
keep<00:04:43.950> talking<00:04:44.130> about<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:44.550> as<00:04:44.700> an<00:04:44.790> ant<00:04:44.940> farm

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
keep talking about this as an ant farm

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.690 
keep talking about this as an ant farm
why<00:04:45.660> don't<00:04:45.810> we<00:04:45.900> make<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.740> like<00:04:46.860> an<00:04:47.010> ant<00:04:47.160> farm<00:04:47.250> it

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
why don't we make it like an ant farm it

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700 
why don't we make it like an ant farm it
is<00:04:48.030> very<00:04:48.210> much<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:48.870> know<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.140> GI<00:04:49.320> Joe<00:04:49.410> base

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
is very much you know the GI Joe base

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.170 
is very much you know the GI Joe base
that<00:04:49.890> ever<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.250> kid<00:04:50.460> down<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.790> street<00:04:50.820> had

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
that ever the kid down the street had

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.970 
that ever the kid down the street had
that<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.260> didn't<00:04:52.500> have<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.800> got<00:04:52.890> to

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
that you you didn't have that you got to

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.140 
that you you didn't have that you got to
play<00:04:53.130> with<00:04:53.250> everyone<00:04:53.670> so<00:04:53.760> well<00:04:53.880> if<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.030> went

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
play with everyone so well if you went

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.710 
play with everyone so well if you went
to<00:04:54.210> his<00:04:54.300> house<00:04:54.420> so<00:04:55.020> when<00:04:55.470> we<00:04:55.560> when<00:04:55.860> we<00:04:55.890> made<00:04:56.190> it

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
to his house so when we when we made it

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.460 
to his house so when we when we made it
that<00:04:57.720> was<00:04:57.810> one<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.020> things<00:04:58.200> I<00:04:58.320> think

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
that was one of the things I think

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.200 
that was one of the things I think
really<00:04:58.770> really<00:04:59.130> stands<00:04:59.610> out<00:04:59.760> it<00:04:59.910> I<00:04:59.970> think<00:05:00.090> it's

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
really really stands out it I think it's

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.910 
really really stands out it I think it's
a<00:05:00.270> really<00:05:00.510> unique<00:05:00.750> features<00:05:01.200> to<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.410> game<00:05:01.590> it

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
a really unique features to the game it

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.590 
a really unique features to the game it
allows<00:05:02.370> us<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.670> lot<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:02.970> flexibility<00:05:03.390> for

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
allows us a lot of flexibility for

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.900 
allows us a lot of flexibility for
optimization<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.740> for<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.550> player<00:05:05.730> to<00:05:05.790> be

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
optimization and for the player to be

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.270 
optimization and for the player to be
able<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.090> build<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.720> expand<00:05:07.290> and<00:05:07.590> it's<00:05:08.130> and

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
able to build and expand and it's and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.490 
able to build and expand and it's and
it's<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.490> really<00:05:08.730> different<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:09.480> haven't<00:05:10.380> seen

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
it's a really different I haven't seen

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.920 
it's a really different I haven't seen
represented<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.100> way<00:05:11.390> really<00:05:12.390> ever<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:12.840> on

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
represented that way really ever and on

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.720 
represented that way really ever and on
top<00:05:13.140> of<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:13.380> they're<00:05:13.680> actually<00:05:13.950> expanding

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
top of that they're actually expanding

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.000 
top of that they're actually expanding
the<00:05:14.850> structure<00:05:15.360> customizing<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.410> facilities

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
the structure customizing the facilities

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.800 
the structure customizing the facilities
that<00:05:17.250> their<00:05:17.550> that<00:05:17.970> they're<00:05:18.090> adding<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.660> their

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
that their that they're adding to their

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.080 
that their that they're adding to their
base<00:05:18.990> we<00:05:19.320> want<00:05:19.620> them<00:05:19.890> to<00:05:19.920> be<00:05:20.130> able<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.610> see

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
base we want them to be able to see

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.520 
base we want them to be able to see
their<00:05:21.270> soldiers<00:05:21.660> interacting<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.410> their

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
their soldiers interacting and their

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.550 
their soldiers interacting and their
scientists<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.240> think<00:05:24.420> it's<00:05:25.260> this

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
scientists and and so I think it's this

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.530 
scientists and and so I think it's this
really<00:05:25.590> neat<00:05:26.310> moment<00:05:26.700> where<00:05:27.090> you<00:05:27.180> get<00:05:27.360> into

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
really neat moment where you get into

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.180 
really neat moment where you get into
the<00:05:27.660> game<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.230> you<00:05:28.380> have<00:05:28.620> this<00:05:28.919> physical

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
the game and you have this physical

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.310 
the game and you have this physical
structure<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:29.970> you've<00:05:30.090> customized<00:05:30.780> and

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
structure that you've customized and

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.290 
structure that you've customized and
you've<00:05:31.860> made<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.280> decisions<00:05:32.730> about<00:05:32.880> what<00:05:33.180> you

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
you've made the decisions about what you

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.090 
you've made the decisions about what you
want<00:05:33.480> to<00:05:33.570> focus<00:05:33.750> on<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:34.320> then<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.620> can<00:05:34.800> see

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
want to focus on and then you can see

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.310 
want to focus on and then you can see
your<00:05:35.490> soldiers<00:05:36.330> that<00:05:36.480> you've<00:05:36.660> leveled<00:05:36.900> up<00:05:37.140> and

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
your soldiers that you've leveled up and

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.600 
your soldiers that you've leveled up and
you've<00:05:37.440> grown<00:05:37.650> attached<00:05:37.980> to<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.310> can<00:05:38.460> see

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
you've grown attached to you can see

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.190 
you've grown attached to you can see
them<00:05:38.790> interacting<00:05:39.480> and<00:05:39.660> it's<00:05:39.870> something<00:05:40.080> that

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
them interacting and it's something that

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.540 
them interacting and it's something that
I<00:05:40.350> think<00:05:40.410> we're<00:05:40.650> really<00:05:40.860> proud<00:05:41.100> of<00:05:41.160> really

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
I think we're really proud of really

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:53.559 
I think we're really proud of really
excited<00:05:41.970> for<00:05:42.090> people<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.360> see

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.629
