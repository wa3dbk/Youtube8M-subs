personal<00:02:00.060> from<00:02:00.450> some<00:02:00.659> people<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.290> like

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
personal from some people and it's like

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.950 
personal from some people and it's like
oh<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:02.009> gosh<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.759> heart<00:02:03.060> sometimes<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.780> feel
