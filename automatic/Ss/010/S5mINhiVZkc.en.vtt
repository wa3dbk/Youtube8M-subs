we'll plug that in and we're ready to go
okay<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.049> we're<00:01:07.140> gonna<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.560> we're

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
okay what we're gonna do now is we're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.450 
okay what we're gonna do now is we're
gonna<00:01:07.890> set<00:01:08.070> our<00:01:08.189> flash<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.729> manual<00:01:09.119> mode<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
gonna set our flash to manual mode and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
gonna set our flash to manual mode and
then<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.760> power<00:01:12.180> we're<00:01:12.510> gonna<00:01:12.600> set<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> 128

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
then the power we're gonna set to 128

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
then the power we're gonna set to 128
power<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> flash<00:01:14.610> days<00:01:14.880> only<00:01:15.119> live

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
power that way the flash days only live

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
power that way the flash days only live
for<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> suggestive<00:01:16.740> barely<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> second

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
for just a suggestive barely of a second

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.130 
for just a suggestive barely of a second
I<00:01:17.580> think<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.820> 110<00:01:18.090> thousandths<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.659> second

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
I think it's 110 thousandths of a second

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.590 
I think it's 110 thousandths of a second
that<00:01:19.259> allows<00:01:19.950> us<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.189> capture<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.150> water

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that allows us to capture the water

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690 
that allows us to capture the water
balloon<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.290> breaking<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> capture<00:01:23.670> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
balloon as it's breaking and capture a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.060 
balloon as it's breaking and capture a
very<00:01:23.909> crisp<00:01:24.330> photograph<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.680> had<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.979> up

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
very crisp photograph if I had it up

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
very crisp photograph if I had it up
here<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:27.030> flash<00:01:27.270> stays<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.689> too<00:01:27.900> long<00:01:28.140> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
here the flash stays on too long and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
here the flash stays on too long and
will<00:01:28.799> cause<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> totally<00:01:29.490> different<00:01:29.820> effect<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
will cause a totally different effect it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.640 
will cause a totally different effect it
will<00:01:30.270> cause<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> water<00:01:30.689> blur<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.350> bit

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
will cause the water blur a little bit

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
will cause the water blur a little bit
but<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.040> want<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.340> tight<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.759> crisp<00:01:33.000> shot<00:01:33.360> so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
but I want to tight to crisp shot so

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
but I want to tight to crisp shot so
I'll<00:01:34.020> set<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> 120th<00:01:34.799> power<00:01:34.950> we're<00:01:35.640> gonna

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I'll set it to 120th power we're gonna

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.730 
I'll set it to 120th power we're gonna
be<00:01:35.880> shooting<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.299> long<00:01:36.509> exposure<00:01:36.960> we're<00:01:37.650> gonna

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
be shooting on long exposure we're gonna

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.670 
be shooting on long exposure we're gonna
set<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> camera<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.490> manual<00:01:39.090> mode<00:01:39.119> most<00:01:40.079> DSLRs

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
set the camera on manual mode most DSLRs

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
set the camera on manual mode most DSLRs
have<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> manual<00:01:41.400> modes<00:01:41.579> designated<00:01:42.210> by<00:01:42.299> the

the<00:01:48.630> image<00:01:48.869> onto<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> film<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.430> shoot

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the image onto the film I like to shoot

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.160 
the image onto the film I like to shoot
at<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.850> 10<00:01:51.119> seconds<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.020> water

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
at about 10 seconds and for water

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.230 
at about 10 seconds and for water
balloons<00:01:52.500> I'll<00:01:52.740> shoot<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.130> about<00:01:54.259> 7.1<00:01:55.259> or<00:01:55.770> so

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
balloons I'll shoot that about 7.1 or so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.340 
balloons I'll shoot that about 7.1 or so
depending<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.329> what<00:01:57.479> kind<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.960> image<00:01:58.200> I'm

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
depending on what kind of image I'm

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
depending on what kind of image I'm
looking<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.340> would<00:01:59.520> give<00:01:59.640> us<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.000> nice

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
looking for this would give us a nice

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.440 
looking for this would give us a nice
clear<00:02:00.840> crisp<00:02:01.200> shot<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.149> then<00:02:03.149> we'll<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.360> from

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
clear crisp shot and then we'll go from

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.940 
clear crisp shot and then we'll go from
there

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
there

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.959 
there
okay<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.250> we've<00:02:05.369> got<00:02:05.520> everything<00:02:05.759> set

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
okay now that we've got everything set

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.429 
okay now that we've got everything set
up<00:02:06.180> we've<00:02:06.420> got<00:02:06.570> our<00:02:06.689> flash<00:02:06.899> where<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.200> want<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
up we've got our flash where we want it

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.380 
up we've got our flash where we want it
we've<00:02:07.590> got<00:02:07.710> camera<00:02:08.129> where<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
we've got camera where we want it the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.669 
we've got camera where we want it the
next<00:02:09.599> thing<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.929> take<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> control<00:02:10.560> shot

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
next thing to do is take a control shot

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.660 
next thing to do is take a control shot
and<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> usually<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.849> on<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.209> take

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
and what I usually do on that is take

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.240 
and what I usually do on that is take
paper<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.810> get<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.080> wet<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.860> reason<00:02:15.160> for

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
paper and I get it wet the reason for

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.190 
paper and I get it wet the reason for
getting<00:02:15.459> too<00:02:15.520> wet<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.420> when<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.750> see

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
getting too wet is so that when I see

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.680 
getting too wet is so that when I see
the<00:02:17.470> BB<00:02:17.980> or<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.250> bullet<00:02:18.550> hit<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.180> know<00:02:19.480> that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
the BB or the bullet hit it I know that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.839 
the BB or the bullet hit it I know that
it's<00:02:20.020> beyond<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.620> piece<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.890> paper<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:21.489> before

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
it's beyond the piece of paper or before

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:22.949 
it's beyond the piece of paper or before
the<00:02:21.970> piece<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.239> paper<00:02:22.360> especially<00:02:22.630> when<00:02:22.930> I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
the piece of paper especially when I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.540 
the piece of paper especially when I
take<00:02:23.140> my<00:02:23.290> control<00:02:23.620> shot<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.010> that's<00:02:24.160> extremely

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
take my control shot so that's extremely

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.130 
take my control shot so that's extremely
important<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.060> know<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.720> other<00:02:25.840> thing<00:02:26.020> that's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
important to know the other thing that's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.229 
important to know the other thing that's
important<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> know<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.030> speed

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
important to know is it's that the speed

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.030 
important to know is it's that the speed
of<00:02:28.270> sound<00:02:28.360> travels<00:02:28.989> at<00:02:29.050> about<00:02:29.260> 1,000<00:02:29.890> feet<00:02:29.920> per

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
of sound travels at about 1,000 feet per

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.430 
of sound travels at about 1,000 feet per
second<00:02:30.640> or<00:02:30.760> about<00:02:30.819> one<00:02:31.270> foot<00:02:31.510> per<00:02:31.540> millisecond

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
second or about one foot per millisecond

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.010 
second or about one foot per millisecond
that's<00:02:32.920> really<00:02:33.400> important<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.819> know<00:02:34.020> because

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
that's really important to know because

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.240 
that's really important to know because
that<00:02:35.140> depends<00:02:35.590> where<00:02:35.709> we're<00:02:35.800> gonna<00:02:35.890> put<00:02:36.160> our

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
that depends where we're gonna put our

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.520 
that depends where we're gonna put our
sound<00:02:36.489> sensor<00:02:36.819> for<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.150> strike<00:02:37.989> finder<00:02:38.290> elite

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
sound sensor for the strike finder elite

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:51.720 
sound sensor for the strike finder elite
so<00:02:39.069> let's<00:02:39.550> go<00:02:39.610> ahead<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.760> control<00:02:40.390> shots<00:02:50.730> okay

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
so let's go ahead and control shots okay

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.400 
so let's go ahead and control shots okay
so<00:02:51.790> now<00:02:52.090> we're<00:02:52.239> just<00:02:52.330> gonna<00:02:52.510> do<00:02:52.750> our<00:02:52.900> control

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
so now we're just gonna do our control

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.270 
so now we're just gonna do our control
shot<00:02:53.700> turn<00:02:54.700> out<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.880> lights

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
shot turn out the lights

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.039 
shot turn out the lights
hit<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> camera<00:02:58.980> and<00:03:00.239> fire<00:03:03.720> we'll<00:03:04.720> give<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
hit the camera and fire we'll give it a

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.550 
hit the camera and fire we'll give it a
second<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:06.760> should<00:03:06.790> have<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> image<00:03:07.299> we<00:03:07.420> want

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
second we should have the image we want

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.650 
second we should have the image we want
so<00:03:10.560> now<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:10.800> we've<00:03:10.980> saw<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.250> little<00:03:12.180> pellet

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
so now that we've saw the little pellet

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.420 
so now that we've saw the little pellet
and<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> spray<00:03:13.200> beyond<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.800> we<00:03:13.950> know<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:14.370> we

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and the spray beyond that we know now we

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.190 
and the spray beyond that we know now we
got<00:03:14.730> our<00:03:14.880> proper<00:03:15.240> distance<00:03:15.630> we're<00:03:15.780> about<00:03:15.990> two

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
got our proper distance we're about two

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.870 
got our proper distance we're about two
feet<00:03:16.380> away<00:03:16.500> from<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.830> sensor<00:03:17.220> from<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.670> sound

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
feet away from the sensor from the sound

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.850 
feet away from the sensor from the sound
trigger<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.720> we<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.020> put<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.290> bet<00:03:19.470> into<00:03:19.740> the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
trigger and we can put the bet into the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.860 
trigger and we can put the bet into the
barrel<00:03:20.190> about<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.730> know<00:03:20.820> at<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.060> point<00:03:21.390> we

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
barrel about you know at this point we

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.360 
barrel about you know at this point we
can<00:03:21.990> get<00:03:22.110> really<00:03:22.290> creative<00:03:22.530> if<00:03:22.980> we<00:03:23.070> want<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
can get really creative if we want the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.040 
can get really creative if we want the
pellet<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.730> be<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> little<00:03:24.210> bit<00:03:24.300> beyond<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.960> we

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
pellet to be a little bit beyond and we

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.450 
pellet to be a little bit beyond and we
want<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.320> capture<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.740> pellet<00:03:26.010> over<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.280> this

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
want to capture the pellet over on this

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.190 
want to capture the pellet over on this
side<00:03:26.520> or<00:03:26.850> maybe<00:03:27.030> we<00:03:27.120> want<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.360> get<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.570> just<00:03:27.600> as

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
side or maybe we want to get it just as

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.780 
side or maybe we want to get it just as
it's<00:03:28.380> hitting<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> Ballon<00:03:28.890> we<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.610> really

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
it's hitting the Ballon we can really

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.300 
it's hitting the Ballon we can really
experiment<00:03:30.300> with<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.570> by<00:03:30.750> our<00:03:31.310> approximate

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
experiment with that by our approximate

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.070 
experiment with that by our approximate
distance<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.240> right<00:03:33.630> now<00:03:33.750> we're<00:03:33.960> shooting

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
distance so right now we're shooting

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.840
