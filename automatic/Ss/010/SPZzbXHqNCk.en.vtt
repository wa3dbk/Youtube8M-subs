than the back of my hand but I actually

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.130 
than the back of my hand but I actually
like<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.400> for<00:02:30.939> when<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.209> covering<00:02:31.930> up

like that for when it's covering up
blemishes<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.709> stuff<00:02:33.780> I'm<00:02:34.780> one<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.200> those

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
blemishes and stuff I'm one of those

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.660 
blemishes and stuff I'm one of those
people<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.680> likes<00:02:35.799> lighter<00:02:36.370> concealer

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
people that likes lighter concealer

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.330 
people that likes lighter concealer
under<00:02:37.329> my<00:02:37.360> eyes<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.079> darker<00:02:38.560> concealer<00:02:38.769> for

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
under my eyes but darker concealer for

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.220 
under my eyes but darker concealer for
other<00:02:39.519> things<00:02:39.849> so<00:02:40.180> then<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:40.450> kind<00:02:40.689> of<00:02:40.750> recedes

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
other things so then it kind of recedes

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.140 
other things so then it kind of recedes
into<00:02:41.409> the<00:02:41.590> face<00:02:41.920> instead<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.489> kind<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.940> popping

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
into the face instead of kind of popping

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.170 
into the face instead of kind of popping
out<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.629> face<00:02:43.870> more<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.280> medium<00:02:45.700> has<00:02:45.970> been

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
out of the face more so medium has been

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.729 
out of the face more so medium has been
really<00:02:46.480> good<00:02:46.629> for<00:02:46.870> me<00:02:48.900> but<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:49.959> think<00:02:50.110> if<00:02:50.590> you're

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
really good for me but I think if you're

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.380 
really good for me but I think if you're
a<00:02:50.769> little<00:02:50.950> bit<00:02:51.220> lighter<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.819> might<00:02:52.060> want<00:02:52.299> to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
a little bit lighter you might want to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.960 
a little bit lighter you might want to
mix<00:02:52.629> it<00:02:52.900> with<00:02:53.769> something<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.430> lighten<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.849> up

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
mix it with something to lighten it up

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.390 
mix it with something to lighten it up
and<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.659> is<00:02:55.689> a<00:02:55.840> little<00:02:56.109> bit<00:02:56.290> more<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:57.010> kind

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
and it is a little bit more on the kind

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.130 
and it is a little bit more on the kind
of<00:02:57.489> peachy<00:02:58.090> tone<00:02:58.540> side<00:02:58.989> I<00:03:00.900> don't<00:03:01.900> know<00:03:01.959> if<00:03:02.049> you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
of peachy tone side I don't know if you

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.229 
of peachy tone side I don't know if you
can<00:03:02.290> kind<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.560> see<00:03:02.769> that<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.609> it<00:03:03.819> blends<00:03:04.090> out

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
can kind of see that but it blends out

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.319 
can kind of see that but it blends out
really<00:03:04.690> nice<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.139> smooth<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.950> then<00:03:06.239> do<00:03:07.239> you

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980

see how even though it's oil-based
there's<00:03:09.700> there's<00:03:10.299> no<00:03:10.480> shine<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.409> it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
there's there's no shine to it

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.369 
there's there's no shine to it
whatsoever<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:15.250> it's<00:03:15.459> not<00:03:15.730> oily<00:03:16.150> by<00:03:16.720> any<00:03:16.930> means

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
whatsoever so it's not oily by any means

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.309 
whatsoever so it's not oily by any means

and it's actually really smooth finish
and<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:22.690> doesn't<00:03:23.079> does<00:03:23.590> not<00:03:23.769> settle<00:03:24.159> into<00:03:24.400> the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
lines like the fine lines the back of my

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.180 
lines like the fine lines the back of my
hand<00:03:28.379> so<00:03:29.379> that's<00:03:29.680> great<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:32.680> yeah<00:03:32.829> so<00:03:33.069> I've

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
hand so that's great but yeah so I've

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.339 
hand so that's great but yeah so I've
really<00:03:33.220> been<00:03:33.669> enjoying<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:34.359> concealer<00:03:34.870> for

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
really been enjoying this concealer for

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.210 
really been enjoying this concealer for
kind<00:03:35.680> of<00:03:35.799> right<00:03:36.040> now<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.810> think<00:03:38.560> it<00:03:39.069> would

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
kind of right now and I think it would

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.819 
kind of right now and I think it would
last<00:03:39.400> any<00:03:39.940> individual<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.930> really<00:03:41.379> really<00:03:41.560> long

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
last any individual a really really long

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.890 
last any individual a really really long
time<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.669> even<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:43.389> can't<00:03:43.629> buy<00:03:43.870> it

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
time so even if you can't buy it

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.629 
time so even if you can't buy it
individually<00:03:44.709> if<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:44.949> comes<00:03:45.129> in<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.370> kit<00:03:45.579> I

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
individually if it comes in a kit I

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.449 
individually if it comes in a kit I
think<00:03:45.940> it's<00:03:46.090> worth<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.480> because<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:47.650> you

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
think it's worth it because this you

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.659 
think it's worth it because this you
only<00:03:48.760> need<00:03:49.180> such<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.139> small<00:03:50.560> amount<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:51.310> cover<00:03:51.489> a

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
only need such a small amount to cover a

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.229 
only need such a small amount to cover a
huge<00:03:52.299> amount<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.840> area<00:03:53.129> so<00:03:54.129> i<00:03:54.160> would<00:03:54.489> also<00:03:54.760> kind

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
huge amount of area so i would also kind

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.800 
huge amount of area so i would also kind
of<00:03:55.299> highly<00:03:55.660> recommend<00:03:56.109> this<00:03:56.260> as<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.530> concealer

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
of highly recommend this as a concealer

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030
