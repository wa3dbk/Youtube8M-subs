without<00:01:46.369> even<00:01:46.729> getting<00:01:46.850> any<00:01:47.090> cocomos<00:01:47.570> off<00:01:47.810> on

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
without even getting any cocomos off on

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.039 
without even getting any cocomos off on
it<00:01:48.610> yeah<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:49.820> oh<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.420> has<00:01:50.539> Giga<00:01:50.869> Drain

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
it yeah so oh so it has Giga Drain

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.600 
it yeah so oh so it has Giga Drain
instead<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:53.500> instead<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.560> an<00:01:54.799> iron<00:01:55.189> head<00:01:55.369> so

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
instead of a instead of an iron head so

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.130 
instead of a instead of an iron head so
it's<00:01:55.759> going<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:55.970> have<00:01:56.030> my<00:01:56.780> guess<00:01:56.960> would<00:01:57.080> be

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
it's going to have my guess would be

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.279 
it's going to have my guess would be
giga<00:01:57.500> drain<00:01:58.000> holy<00:01:59.000> sword<00:01:59.420> or<00:01:59.630> sacred<00:01:59.810> sword<00:02:00.170> or

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
giga drain holy sword or sacred sword or

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.990 
giga drain holy sword or sacred sword or
whatever<00:02:00.500> wow<00:02:00.830> that's<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> lot<00:02:01.580> more<00:02:01.759> than<00:02:01.820> I

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
whatever wow that's it a lot more than I

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.149 
whatever wow that's it a lot more than I
thought<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.210> would<00:02:02.799> that's<00:02:03.799> okay<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:06.069> think<00:02:07.069> a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
thought it would that's okay I think a

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.639 
thought it would that's okay I think a
wild<00:02:07.490> bolt<00:02:07.729> would<00:02:07.880> kill<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.269> I'm<00:02:08.600> pretty<00:02:09.440> sure

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.589 
got really good a rock fighting is
really<00:03:52.980> good<00:03:53.130> coverage<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:53.819> again<00:03:54.330> if<00:03:54.480> you

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
really good coverage so again if you

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.550 
really good coverage so again if you
need<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.900> wow<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.430> very<00:03:56.610> convenient<00:03:57.560> um

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
need it wow that is very convenient um

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.430 
need it wow that is very convenient um
so<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.760> i'm<00:04:00.209> gonna<00:04:00.420> guess<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:00.959> got<00:04:01.290> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
so it's i'm gonna guess it's got the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.729 
so it's i'm gonna guess it's got the
same<00:04:01.590> pattern<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.989> vengeance<00:04:03.989> helping<00:04:04.500> hand

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
same pattern of a vengeance helping hand

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.960 
same pattern of a vengeance helping hand
sacred<00:04:05.489> sword<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.120> i<00:04:07.430> think<00:04:08.430> its<00:04:08.519> fourth<00:04:08.760> move

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
sacred sword and i think its fourth move

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.449 
sacred sword and i think its fourth move
might<00:04:09.150> be<00:04:09.239> like<00:04:09.359> rock<00:04:09.660> sliders<00:04:10.220> something<00:04:11.220> i

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
might be like rock sliders something i

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.830 
might be like rock sliders something i
don't<00:04:12.180> know<00:04:12.299> what's<00:04:12.510> rahman<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.230> would<00:04:13.350> be

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
don't know what's rahman it would be

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.960 
don't know what's rahman it would be
power

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
power

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.190
