you in a second when you bind bronzer
for<00:02:01.020> contouring<00:02:01.860> make<00:02:02.490> sure<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.750> not

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170

shimmer<00:02:05.060> because<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.869> would<00:02:07.079> apply<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
shimmer because if we would apply with a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.520 
shimmer because if we would apply with a
triangular<00:02:08.940> technique<00:02:09.660> here<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.349> would

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
triangular technique here and it would

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.710 
triangular technique here and it would
shine<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.640> will<00:02:11.819> get<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.209> different

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
shine we will get a different

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.450 
shine we will get a different
result<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.470> would<00:02:13.650> balance<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.160> line

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
result because it would balance the line

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.000 
result because it would balance the line
and<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.510> wouldn't<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.960> ashamed<00:02:16.080> which<00:02:16.740> would

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and it wouldn't be ashamed which would

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.700 
and it wouldn't be ashamed which would
cover<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.640> face<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.210> but<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.290> would<00:02:19.500> actually

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
cover the face in but it would actually

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.790 
cover the face in but it would actually
make<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.700> cheap<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.530> this

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
make it cheap like this not like this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.160 
make it cheap like this not like this
but<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.580> this

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
but like this

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.500 
but like this
right<00:02:25.170> lots<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.370> times<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.180> hear<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:29.480> buy<00:02:30.480> a

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
right lots of times you hear that buy a

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.140 
right lots of times you hear that buy a
blush<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.290> mean<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> bronzer<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:33.000> you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
blush I mean a bronzer and then you

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.590 
blush I mean a bronzer and then you
build<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.380> buy<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> dark<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.210> think

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
build it up so buy a dark one I think

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.070 
build it up so buy a dark one I think
this<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.290> very<00:02:37.620> very<00:02:38.100> dangerous<00:02:38.430> because<00:02:39.080> when

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
this is very very dangerous because when

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.170 
this is very very dangerous because when
you're<00:02:40.290> making<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.800> at<00:02:40.950> home<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.610> front<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
you're making it at home in front of the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.480 
you're making it at home in front of the
mirror<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.900> don't<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.350> nice<00:02:43.680> light<00:02:44.070> oh

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
see if you applied it well that's why I

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
don't need to build up so doesn't matter

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.320 
don't need to build up so doesn't matter

paler<00:03:49.049> color<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:51.350> doesn't<00:03:52.350> matter<00:03:52.440> how<00:03:52.860> much

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
because if you smudge the line you make

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.320 
because if you smudge the line you make
a<00:04:00.180> nice<00:04:00.860> gradient<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.299> will<00:04:03.540> look<00:04:03.750> amazing

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330

if<00:04:24.240> we<00:04:24.900> would<00:04:25.140> want<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.530> propagate<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:26.940> make

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
if we would want to propagate it to make

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.820 
if we would want to propagate it to make
it<00:04:27.540> long<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:29.960> would<00:04:30.960> apply<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:33.020> bronzer<00:04:34.020> like

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
it long I would apply a bronzer like

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.140 
it long I would apply a bronzer like
this<00:04:35.720> from<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.870> upper<00:04:37.350> part<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:38.330> her<00:04:39.330> ear<00:04:41.150> down

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
this from the upper part of her ear down

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.860 
this from the upper part of her ear down
to<00:04:42.750> her<00:04:42.960> mouth<00:04:43.260> like<00:04:44.160> this<00:04:44.370> not<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.390> long<00:04:45.690> but

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
to her mouth like this not so long but

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.030 
to her mouth like this not so long but
somewhere<00:04:46.530> here<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:49.050> need<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.410> think<00:04:49.800> about

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
somewhere here you need to think about

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.150 
somewhere here you need to think about
how<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:50.790> light<00:04:51.360> would<00:04:51.660> fall<00:04:52.140> if<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.830> falls

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
how the light would fall if it falls

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.540 
how the light would fall if it falls
from<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.730> upper<00:04:54.150> part<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:55.500> light<00:04:55.740> hits<00:04:56.130> here

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
from the upper part the light hits here

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.710 
from the upper part the light hits here
and<00:04:57.390> cannot<00:04:58.020> go<00:04:58.950> on<00:04:58.980> further<00:04:59.610> here<00:05:00.120> that's<00:05:00.390> why

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
and cannot go on further here that's why

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.180 
and cannot go on further here that's why
this<00:05:00.780> part<00:05:01.610> here<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.450> shade<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.440> this<00:05:05.040> is

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
this part here is a shade and this is

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.220 
this part here is a shade and this is
what<00:05:05.370> we're<00:05:05.580> making<00:05:05.820> we're<00:05:06.210> making<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.720> natural

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
what we're making we're making a natural

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.370 
what we're making we're making a natural
shape<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:08.610> part<00:05:09.030> here<00:05:09.150> already<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.320> a

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
shape and this part here already is a

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.340 
shape and this part here already is a
bit<00:05:10.680> more<00:05:10.980> up<00:05:11.160> so<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:12.270> light<00:05:12.570> would<00:05:12.870> hit<00:05:13.170> it

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
bit more up so the light would hit it
