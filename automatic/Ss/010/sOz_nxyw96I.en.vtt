00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.629
Okay, in this example here, I'm doing a negative
pre-exhaust set, where I

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:35.629
first start off by doing a real slow 20-second
negative chin-up, like you

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:36.629
see me doing now.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.629
Then, I'm going to do ten regular bicep curls
to finish

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.629
the set to give me a good bicep workout.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:39.629
All right, in this example here, I'm doing
a negative pre-exhaust set,

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.629
where I first start off by do a real slow
20-second negative shoulder press

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.629
by slowly lowering the weight down like this.

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:42.629
Then, I'm going to do ten
regular dumbbell shoulder presses to finish

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:43.629
off my set, to give me a good
overall shoulder workout.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:44.629
Okay, in this example here, I'm doing a negative
pre-exhaust set, where I

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:45.629
first start off by doing a real slow 20-second
negative dip by coming down

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:46.629
slowly, like you see me doing now.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.629
Then, I'm going to do ten regular close
grip push-ups to finish off my set, and give

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:48.629
me a good arm or tricep
workout.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.629
But usually, what I do is something like tricep
extensions or

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.629
light close grip bench presses, which will
give you a better arm workout.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.629
But for the sake of this example, I'm just
going to do close grip pushups.

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:52.629
Okay, in this final example here, I'm doing
a negative pre-exhaust set,

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:53.629
where I first start off by doing a really
slow, 20-second negative pec fly

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.629
by letting weights back slowly, like you see
me doing now.

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.629
Then, after I do
that, I'm going to do ten push-ups to finish

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.640
off the set, to give me a good
overall chest workout.
