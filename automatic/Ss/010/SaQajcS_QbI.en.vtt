this is the center console and again you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.050 
this is the center console and again you
can<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.159> there's<00:01:14.400> an<00:01:14.490> aux<00:01:14.670> port<00:01:14.939> it's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
can see that there's an aux port it's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.460 
can see that there's an aux port it's
connected<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> system<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.110> also

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
connected here the system is also

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.050 
connected here the system is also
Bluetooth<00:01:16.680> enabled<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.670> pair<00:01:17.939> your

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
if it's a 2 DP or not but I think it is
