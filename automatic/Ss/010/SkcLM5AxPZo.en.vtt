00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.420 
any any issue with hearing me they said
it<00:03:48.930> was<00:03:48.959> very<00:03:49.260> clear<00:03:49.709> there<00:03:50.099> wasn't<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> whole

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
it was very clear there wasn't a whole

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.069 
it was very clear there wasn't a whole
heck<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.090> lot<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.389> background<00:03:51.569> noise<00:03:52.019> so

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
heck of a lot of background noise so

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.619 
heck of a lot of background noise so
that<00:03:52.560> was<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> good<00:03:53.069> thing<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:54.060> hear<00:03:54.209> from<00:03:54.449> them

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
that was a good thing to hear from them

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.839 
that was a good thing to hear from them
as<00:03:54.840> well<00:03:55.109> so<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.769> think<00:03:56.099> that<00:03:56.310> they're<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.579> very

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
as well so I think that they're a very

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.240 
as well so I think that they're a very
good<00:03:56.970> ear<00:03:57.299> bud<00:03:57.479> for<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.319> type<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.709> an<00:03:58.949> air<00:03:59.069> bed

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
good ear bud for this type of an air bed

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.539 
good ear bud for this type of an air bed
and<00:03:59.519> this<00:03:59.790> range<00:04:00.919> again<00:04:01.919> they're<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.310> little

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
and this range again they're the little

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.659 
and this range again they're the little
jams<00:04:03.030> by<00:04:03.269> monster<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.139> I<00:04:05.069> definitely<00:04:05.370> get<00:04:05.549> my

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
jams by monster and I definitely get my

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.170 
jams by monster and I definitely get my
