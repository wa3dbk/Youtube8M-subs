00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 three major brand launches for the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 line 2014 gay march berg director 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.930
 commercial when a little bit for us 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.910
 Let's start with the make and 150 that I imagine 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.329
 which is a very important product for 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.370
 you to 2014, which represents the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.610
 entry of a product into that category of 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.699
 150 utilities for you is not the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
 most important segment of the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.090
 it means people are participating in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.739
 more than 25 percent of what is sold 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.390
 market with a category that people 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.070
 there was nothing we did not have 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.600
 150 cc motorcycle 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.220
 we really wanted to get in with the foot 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.229
 Right, we made a motorcycle. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.119
 developed in partnership with Japan a 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.000
 Fantastic bike with super design 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.560
 aggressive a supermodern panel one 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.110
 rear that you will be able to observe 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.240
 How beautiful is this bike that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.130
 visually draws much attention is very 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.770
 and it has all the attributes of 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.080
 she is economical and comfortable 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.909
 walks well has a great autonomy then 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.530
 so a bike that can be used both 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.820
 to day to day how much for that guy 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.340
 who wants to walk a little at the end of 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.159
 week she is fulfilling this function well 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 total of utility with day to day 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.409
 to develop the 150th fair you already 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.659
 had a very strong reference in the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.420
 market for many years 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.850
 You in her involvement have sought 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.220
 one had focus on some feature 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.500
 something that you wanted to overcome 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.420
 a product that was already a reference 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.040
 I do not think we people what we 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.439
 real want is just to deliver 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.909
 consumer as our new slogan says 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.649
 we want to deliver something to 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.420
 more than what he 's waiting for 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.399
 I'm sure anyone who walks will 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.470
 find bike more comfortable than 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.220
 I was waiting, I'll find the bike very 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.870
 more delicious to walk 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.070
 autonomy and consumption of 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.350
 fuel will see that the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.730
 characteristics are going to surpass 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.960
 what he was expecting so I 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.550
 I think we got it right 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.890
 product for what the consumer 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.210
 really needs and wishes we will 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.080
 surprise the consumer with this 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.180
 product 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.610
 another great launch of yours is the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.290
 scooter temax 530 that starts to be 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.360
 sold in December 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.720
 why choosing a scooter from a 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.280
 higher cylinder capacity is direct before 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.110
 maybe even to love to bring to Brazil 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.630
 a 250 300 scooter is why 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.340
 scooter choices have a an image 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.650
 very much related to sportsmanship in 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.320
 so much is that he is the scooter that the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.420
 Valentino Rossi wears on the exact day to day is 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.800
 the listener he uses day-to-day and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.860
 He has a very 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.200
 related to both sportsmanship and 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.720
 to an exclusive process then 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.459
 Who wants to work because of the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.180
 transit in large centers, everything that 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.600
 happens 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.370
 you have a pretty comfortable option 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.470
 where you do not get dirty you can 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.880
 I work with a suit everything I am myself 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.590
 crazy to start working with 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.870
 mine not to take so much traffic 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.640
 so it is a product that as in the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.140
 Europe, we do not want people, we do not 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.170
 bringing the audience is bringing a 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.360
 temax europe when you look what the 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.140
 people think they feel that way. 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.580
 product 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.989
 No one said I have a scout I 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.970
 I have a bike I have a maxi is 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.709
 different because it has all the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.040
 characteristics of a motorcycle and it has 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.080
 a clothing then discuss is is a product 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.090
 unique and that is why our 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.459
 option to bring it to create a 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.410
 to bring new customers to the 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.739
 brand and to serve that consumer 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.930
 who needs an exclusive good product 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.850
 and that he did not have a choice he did not 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.769
 had nothing that the trend then is the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.209
 what we want is to cover all these 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.370
 product holes to meet the 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.650
 increasingly better consumer and was a 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.320
 surprise to us also find out that 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.590
 You guys are going to import yamaha to see 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.340
 max who is an icon of the beloved's past 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.680
 of the 80's that was renewed and now 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.479
 You decided to import to Brazil. 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.489
 limited quantity 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.530
 also imagine that the price contributes 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.770
 for this 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.010
 in nine thousand reais because of the decision by 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.320
 v max is also a matter of reinforcing 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.320
 a little more branding than really 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.810
 to reach a large volume for sale 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.120
 sure I think that's how it is 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.889
 people are talking and it's our new motto 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.930
 does not want to exceed the expectations of 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.910
 customers and has a number of customers who 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.139
 they were looking for us and asking us to 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.820
 we bring the bike 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.430
 officially so they could have 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.200
 an iconic product from yamaha a product 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.030
 differentiated and what we did 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.310
 exactly this to meet this consumer 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.230
 demanding who wants something exclusive 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.210
 so even an amount 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.490
 limited motorcycle so that he really 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.210
 have this exclusivity be treated as 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.210
 a differentiated way 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.840
 guys to say never and was not looking and 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.660
 here later 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:17.009
 during the 70 days that causes me the most 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.509
 I want to see nobody is nobody's 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.509
 nor the supper 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.509
 bunch
