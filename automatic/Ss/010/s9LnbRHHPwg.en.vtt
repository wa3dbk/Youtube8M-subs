acquired<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.340> don't<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:44.540> I'd<00:01:45.540> go

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
acquired in there I don't think I'd go

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.999 
acquired in there I don't think I'd go
through<00:01:45.899> phases<00:01:46.140> where<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.829> just
