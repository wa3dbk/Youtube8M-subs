useless Singlish a burnished Ram cable

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.130 
useless Singlish a burnished Ram cable
will<00:01:13.939> last<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.659> eventuate<00:01:15.990> kink<00:01:16.290> up

yet<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.170> printer<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.250> copper<00:01:20.610> crimps

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
yet you printer with with copper crimps

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
yet you printer with with copper crimps
and<00:01:23.180> it's<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.979> recommend<00:01:25.979> using<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.460> above

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and it's I recommend using it above

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
and it's I recommend using it above
everything<00:01:27.119> else<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.140> lot<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> people

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
everything else now a lot of people

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.730 
everything else now a lot of people
think<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.549> very<00:01:29.759> superstitious<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.500> think

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
think are very superstitious and I think

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
think are very superstitious and I think
all<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.220> Sharks<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.700> biting<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:33.329> they

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
all the Sharks are biting because they

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450 
all the Sharks are biting because they
can<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> cable<00:01:34.409> well<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
can see the cable well and they want to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.120 
can see the cable well and they want to
model<00:01:35.880> well<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.380> happens<00:01:38.009> sometimes

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
model well that this happens sometimes

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.480 
model well that this happens sometimes
but<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:39.689> know<00:01:39.810> lots<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> times<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.340> just

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
but you know lots of times that just

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.800 
but you know lots of times that just
means<00:01:41.729> there's<00:01:41.880> no<00:01:41.939> sharks<00:01:42.210> around<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.520> mono

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
means there's no sharks around so mono

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.149 
means there's no sharks around so mono
some<00:01:45.810> guys<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> use<00:01:46.439> model<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.009> their

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
some guys like to use model on their

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.359 
some guys like to use model on their
rigs<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:48.470> not<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:49.799> don't<00:01:49.950> catch<00:01:50.130> many

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
rigs but not they don't catch many

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
rigs but not they don't catch many
sharks<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:51.030> they<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
sharks because they like and have a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.289 
sharks because they like and have a
tendency<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> fight<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> mono<00:01:53.670> mono<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
tendency to fight to the mono mono is

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.370 
tendency to fight to the mono mono is
made<00:01:54.479> out<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> plastic<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.990> pretty

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
made out of plastic and it can be pretty

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.399 
made out of plastic and it can be pretty
much<00:01:58.560> cut<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> sharp<00:01:59.820> butter<00:02:00.060> knife

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
much cut with the sharp butter knife

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.520 
much cut with the sharp butter knife
it's<00:02:01.409> good<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:02.479> tunas<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
it's good for tunas and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
it's good for tunas and
a fish<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.070> small<00:02:05.369> teeth<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:06.150> sharks

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
a fish that have small teeth but sharks

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.010 
a fish that have small teeth but sharks
I<00:02:07.399> would<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.550> recommend<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.450> good<00:02:09.720> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
I would not recommend it it's good to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.440 
I would not recommend it it's good to
put<00:02:10.229> above<00:02:10.920> cable<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.910> cable<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
put above cable if you have a cable in a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.350 
put above cable if you have a cable in a

hook section and you know you can put

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.690 
hook section and you know you can put
one<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> brush<00:02:16.140> your<00:02:16.319> section<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.800> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
one up the brush your section and you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.160 
one up the brush your section and you
know<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.150> shark<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.480> still<00:02:18.690> jump<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.020> plate

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
is just wrap around this is very heavy

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.880 
is just wrap around this is very heavy
single<00:02:49.019> train<00:02:49.170> you'll<00:02:49.350> need<00:02:49.470> at<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.680> heavy
