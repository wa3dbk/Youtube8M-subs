00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.460 
let's get straight to the review
initially<00:00:20.760> looking<00:00:21.030> at<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.360> size<00:00:21.570> design<00:00:22.200> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
initially looking at the size design and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.680 
initially looking at the size design and
build<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.430> phone<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:24.240> got<00:00:24.420> very<00:00:24.630> good

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
build of the phone it's got very good

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.870 
build of the phone it's got very good
build<00:00:25.140> quality<00:00:25.230> does<00:00:25.770> it<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.130> very<00:00:26.550> premium

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
build quality does it for very premium

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
build quality does it for very premium
and<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.600> like<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.050> look<00:00:28.440> of<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and I really do like the look of the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.010 
and I really do like the look of the
phone<00:00:29.160> comparing<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> something<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.690> the

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
phone comparing it to something like the

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.560 
phone comparing it to something like the
s4<00:00:31.529> similar<00:00:32.250> width<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.120> slightly

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
s4 similar width but it is slightly

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.950 
s4 similar width but it is slightly
shorter<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.610> 139<00:00:35.610> grams<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.600> bad<00:00:36.750> at<00:00:36.930> all

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
shorter and 139 grams so not bad at all

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.049 
shorter and 139 grams so not bad at all
one<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.440> these<00:00:37.649> slight<00:00:38.220> issues<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> had

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
one of these slight issues that I had

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.389 
one of these slight issues that I had
was<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.570> fact<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.260> camera<00:00:40.470> lens<00:00:40.770> does

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
was the fact that the camera lens does

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.130 
was the fact that the camera lens does
come<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> little<00:00:41.970> bit<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.809> also

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
come out a little bit and it's also

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
come out a little bit and it's also
towards<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.559> middle<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.100> when<00:00:44.280> holding<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
towards the middle so when holding the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.940 
towards the middle so when holding the
device<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.540> did<00:00:45.780> sort<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.020> coming<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
device it did sort of coming my way and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.290 
device it did sort of coming my way and
it<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.550> bit<00:00:47.700> uncomfortable<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it was a little bit uncomfortable to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
it was a little bit uncomfortable to
hold<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.780> would<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.200> liked<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> camera<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.040> be

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
hold I would have liked the camera to be

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
hold I would have liked the camera to be
a<00:00:50.160> bit<00:00:50.520> higher<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.629> lots<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
a bit higher like it is with lots of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
a bit higher like it is with lots of
other<00:00:52.350> devices<00:00:52.710> now<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.399> screen<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.149> 4.5

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
much processing power so personally I

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.499 
much processing power so personally I
didn't<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.520> any<00:01:32.700> problems<00:01:33.150> with

didn't have any problems with
performance<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> did<00:01:34.590> seem<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.830> perform

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130

of<00:02:12.389> usage<00:02:12.719> out<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.109> it

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
of usage out of it

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
of usage out of it
problems<00:02:13.890> whatsoever<00:02:14.220> again<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.940> think<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
problems whatsoever again I think it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.910 
problems whatsoever again I think it
comes<00:02:15.540> down<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.320> Windows<00:02:16.650> interface

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
comes down to the Windows interface

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.670 
comes down to the Windows interface
which<00:02:17.550> isn't<00:02:17.820> too<00:02:18.150> power-hungry<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.990> because

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
which isn't too power-hungry and because

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530 
which isn't too power-hungry and because
it<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> 720p<00:02:20.430> screen<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.210> going<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> be

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
it is a 720p screen it's not going to be

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.540 
it is a 720p screen it's not going to be
requiring<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.530> much<00:02:22.710> power<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.220> there<00:02:23.430> are

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
requiring that much power and there are

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.250 
requiring that much power and there are
a<00:02:23.580> lot<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.910> blacks<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.780> Windows<00:02:25.230> user

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
a lot of blacks in the Windows user

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.440 
a lot of blacks in the Windows user
interface<00:02:26.040> which<00:02:26.580> means<00:02:26.820> they<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.120> not<00:02:27.240> lit

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
interface which means they are not lit

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.670 
interface which means they are not lit
up<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:27.900> they<00:02:27.990> don't<00:02:28.140> take<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.500> much

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
up so they don't take up that much

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.500 
up so they don't take up that much

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
think that Nokia and Windows need to

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.659 
think that Nokia and Windows need to
