00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
to be used so if it's a share will use

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.530

always be a chance of being peak aid but

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.260 
always be a chance of being peak aid but
chance<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.840> always<00:02:23.290> extremely<00:02:23.740> though<00:02:24.310> so

Dragon<00:02:40.000> Isle<00:02:40.180> now<00:02:40.750> I'm<00:02:41.020> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.260> put<00:02:41.410> a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
Dragon Isle now I'm going to put a

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.590 
Dragon Isle now I'm going to put a
picture<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.100> screen<00:02:42.550> right<00:02:42.580> about<00:02:43.000> now<00:02:43.300> and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
picture on screen right about now and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.480 
picture on screen right about now and
then<00:02:44.020> those<00:02:44.260> are<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.590> three<00:02:44.800> spots<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.250> have

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
then those are the three spots I have

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.370 
then those are the three spots I have
them<00:02:45.730> circled<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.690> if<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.900> guys<00:02:47.080> actually

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
them circled so if you guys actually

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.130 
them circled so if you guys actually
want<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.010> go<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.490> go<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.330> those<00:02:49.510> spots<00:02:49.870> without

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
want to go and go to those spots without

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.160 
want to go and go to those spots without
using<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.830> taxi<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.670> can<00:02:51.940> example<00:02:52.810> if<00:02:52.990> you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
using the taxi you can example if you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.020 
using the taxi you can example if you
already<00:02:53.320> have<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.620> lava<00:02:53.890> Titan<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.850> don't

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
already have a lava Titan and you don't

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.170 
already have a lava Titan and you don't
feel<00:02:55.210> like<00:02:55.240> waiting<00:02:55.570> for<00:02:56.200> everybody<00:02:56.530> else<00:02:57.180> so

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
feel like waiting for everybody else so

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.970 
feel like waiting for everybody else so
once<00:02:58.510> you're<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.960> camp<00:02:59.260> there<00:02:59.590> will<00:02:59.830> be<00:02:59.860> a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
once you're in the camp there will be a

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.890 
once you're in the camp there will be a
bunch<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.430> weird<00:03:00.700> stuff<00:03:00.970> going<00:03:01.030> on<00:03:01.360> i<00:03:01.420> highly

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
bunch of weird stuff going on i highly

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.930 
bunch of weird stuff going on i highly
recommend<00:03:02.290> don't<00:03:02.500> even<00:03:02.710> doing<00:03:02.950> anything<00:03:03.160> just

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
recommend don't even doing anything just

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.850 
recommend don't even doing anything just
sitting<00:03:04.330> there<00:03:04.360> until<00:03:05.080> everything<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.800> done

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
sitting there until everything is done

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.100 
sitting there until everything is done
and<00:03:06.280> then<00:03:06.760> there<00:03:06.910> will<00:03:07.000> only<00:03:07.150> be<00:03:07.360> three<00:03:07.900> out<00:03:08.080> of

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
and then there will only be three out of

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.260 
and then there will only be three out of
the<00:03:08.380> five<00:03:08.620> certain<00:03:09.340> things<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.880> want<00:03:10.060> so

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
the five certain things that you want so

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.870 
the five certain things that you want so
maybe<00:03:10.480> it'll<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:10.930> maybe<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.680> want<00:03:11.860> mining<00:03:12.430> but

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
maybe it'll be maybe you want mining but

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.570 
maybe it'll be maybe you want mining but
mining<00:03:13.390> isn't<00:03:13.720> there<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:14.980> choose

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
mining isn't there so you choose

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.460 
mining isn't there so you choose
something<00:03:15.850> else<00:03:16.030> or<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.660> actually<00:03:17.080> do<00:03:17.320> not

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
something else or you actually do not

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.500 
something else or you actually do not
have<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:17.890> do<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.280> then<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.520> can<00:03:18.760> just<00:03:18.970> wait

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
have to do it and then you can just wait

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.240 
have to do it and then you can just wait
until<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.990> next<00:03:20.020> one<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.620> then<00:03:20.740> it<00:03:20.830> has<00:03:20.950> for

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
until the next one and then it has for

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.660 
until the next one and then it has for
me<00:03:21.400> or<00:03:22.330> mining<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.410> case<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.830> personally
