00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
I found like a I've had a little Hollow

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
I found like a I've had a little Hollow
of<00:01:51.960> some<00:01:52.140> sort<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> bunch<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
of some sort and then a bunch of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.679 
of some sort and then a bunch of
skeletons<00:01:53.430> came<00:01:53.880> at<00:01:54.060> me<00:01:54.180> too<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.570> they

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
skeletons came at me too and they

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.060 
skeletons came at me too and they
started<00:01:54.960> shooting<00:01:55.140> bows<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.619> arrows<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:55.950> them

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
started shooting bows and arrows at them

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.289 
started shooting bows and arrows at them
so<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> hit<00:01:56.430> them<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.640> face<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.060> mace

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
so I hit them in the face with a mace

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.880 
so I hit them in the face with a mace
and<00:01:57.659> they<00:01:57.840> definitely<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.530> guess<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.829> were
