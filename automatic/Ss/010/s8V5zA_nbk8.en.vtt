00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.510 
show us how to put this on when you're
in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> water<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.049> first<00:01:32.040> thing<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
in the water so first thing you want to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.789 
in the water so first thing you want to
do<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.909> basically<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.049> inside<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
do is basically have the inside of the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
do is basically have the inside of the
PFD<00:01:35.070> facing<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.659> Mike's<00:01:36.900> doing

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
PFD facing up which is what Mike's doing

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.929 
PFD facing up which is what Mike's doing
right<00:01:37.350> now<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.979> want<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> open<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
right now you want to open it up so that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
right now you want to open it up so that
the<00:01:39.210> arms<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the arms are out and you have the the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.999 
the arms are out and you have the the
neck<00:01:41.310> area<00:01:41.549> facing<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.649> next<00:01:43.649> thing<00:01:43.799> Mike's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
neck area facing you next thing Mike's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.830 
neck area facing you next thing Mike's
going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> put<00:01:44.460> his<00:01:44.579> arms<00:01:44.850> through<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.540> holes

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
going to put his arms through the holes

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
going to put his arms through the holes
and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.649> he's<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> flip<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> PFD

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and then he's going to flip the PFD

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.910 
and then he's going to flip the PFD
right<00:01:48.420> over<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> top<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.290> his<00:01:49.530> head

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.250 

and<00:01:52.040> then<00:01:52.640> put<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:52.940> on<00:01:53.030> that<00:01:53.210> way<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.870> lot<00:01:54.229> of

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
and then put it on that way so a lot of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.570 
and then put it on that way so a lot of
people<00:01:54.590> would<00:01:54.680> probably<00:01:54.770> try<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.250> put<00:01:55.400> one

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
people would probably try and put one

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.399 
people would probably try and put one
arm<00:01:55.790> in<00:01:55.940> through<00:01:56.240> through<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.870> hole<00:01:57.170> first

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
arm in through through the hole first

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.750 
arm in through through the hole first
and<00:01:57.650> then<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.830> other<00:01:57.979> arm<00:01:58.159> like<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:58.490> would<00:01:58.640> do

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
and then the other arm like you would do

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.550 
and then the other arm like you would do
on<00:01:58.790> shore<00:01:59.210> but<00:01:59.690> in<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.900> water<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.320> can<00:02:00.440> be

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
on shore but in the water that can be

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.690 
on shore but in the water that can be
pretty<00:02:00.770> difficult<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.369> do<00:02:01.460> when<00:02:01.580> you're

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
pretty difficult to do when you're

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.250 
pretty difficult to do when you're
trying<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.909> keep<00:02:02.060> your<00:02:02.119> head<00:02:02.390> above<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.110> water

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
trying to keep your head above the water

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.469 
trying to keep your head above the water
so<00:02:03.710> well<00:02:04.190> it's<00:02:04.369> recommended<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.119> do<00:02:05.330> be

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
so well it's recommended that you do be

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.090 
so well it's recommended that you do be
wearing<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.900> when<00:02:06.050> you're<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.320> boat<00:02:06.560> but<00:02:06.860> you

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
wearing it when you're on a boat but you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.560 
wearing it when you're on a boat but you
know<00:02:07.190> it's<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:07.670> some<00:02:07.850> reason<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.209> don't<00:02:08.390> have

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
know it's for some reason you don't have

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.389 
know it's for some reason you don't have
it<00:02:08.750> on<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.649> would<00:02:09.770> be<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.979> method<00:02:10.130> to

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
it on then that would be the method to

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.370 
it on then that would be the method to
get<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:10.759> safely<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.450> as<00:02:11.780> quickly<00:02:11.810> as

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
get it on safely and as quickly as

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.860 
get it on safely and as quickly as
possible<00:02:12.440> once<00:02:12.980> you're<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.250> water<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:14.270> you

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
possible once you're in the water so you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.180 
possible once you're in the water so you
know<00:02:15.140> we've<00:02:15.290> been<00:02:15.320> talking<00:02:15.500> about<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:15.980> being

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
know we've been talking about this being

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.890 
know we've been talking about this being
