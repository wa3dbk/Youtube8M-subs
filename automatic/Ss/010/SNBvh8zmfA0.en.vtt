the<00:03:21.470> angular<00:03:21.860> wash<00:03:22.040> great<00:03:22.459> for<00:03:22.730> supporting<00:03:22.880> my

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
the angular wash great for supporting my

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.250 
the angular wash great for supporting my
hand<00:03:24.970> but<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.000> can<00:03:26.239> use<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.540> as<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.690> blending

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260

hand but I can use it as a blending
brush<00:03:27.500> notice<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.760> delivers<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.420> flat

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080

so<00:03:32.630> I'm<00:03:32.780> not<00:03:32.959> having<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.500> work<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:34.070> brush

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
so I'm not having to work that brush

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.479 
so I'm not having to work that brush
like<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.269> little<00:03:35.600> bit

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
like that this is a little bit

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.490 
like that this is a little bit
uncharacteristic<00:03:37.489> for<00:03:38.000> an<00:03:38.239> arm<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:39.019> angle

uncharacteristic for an arm the angle

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.160 
uncharacteristic for an arm the angle
lets<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.830> arm<00:03:40.010> stay<00:03:40.310> at<00:03:40.459> its<00:03:40.610> regular<00:03:40.910> place

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
lets the arm stay at its regular place

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.270 
lets the arm stay at its regular place
and<00:03:43.300> deliver<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.390> wash<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.170> work<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.160> in

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
and deliver that wash and work it in

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.180 
and deliver that wash and work it in
where<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.489> want<00:03:46.870> lucky<00:03:47.870> for<00:03:48.050> me<00:03:48.200> I'm<00:03:48.470> using

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
where you want lucky for me I'm using

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.610 
where you want lucky for me I'm using
the<00:03:49.310> liquid<00:03:49.519> pencil<00:03:50.050> permanent<00:03:51.050> so<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.590> I

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
the liquid pencil permanent so that I

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.220 
the liquid pencil permanent so that I
can<00:03:51.860> go<00:03:52.010> back<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.519> do<00:03:52.820> these<00:03:53.030> color<00:03:53.360> overages

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
can go back and do these color overages

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.800 
can go back and do these color overages
without<00:03:54.890> removing<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.489> if<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.150> was<00:03:56.330> using<00:03:56.480> the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
without removing it if I was using the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.990 
without removing it if I was using the
non<00:03:56.989> permanent<00:03:57.320> liquid<00:03:58.010> pencil<00:03:58.220> that

non permanent liquid pencil that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.040 
non permanent liquid pencil that
wouldn't<00:03:59.300> be<00:03:59.590> possible

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
wouldn't be possible

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.280 
wouldn't be possible
let's<00:04:03.050> introduce<00:04:03.260> another<00:04:03.680> color<00:04:04.010> in<00:04:04.190> here<00:04:04.400> a

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
let's introduce another color in here a

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.080 
let's introduce another color in here a
little<00:04:06.290> titanium<00:04:06.680> white<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:09.590> course<00:04:10.090> fast

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
little titanium white and of course fast

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.120 
little titanium white and of course fast
fantastic<00:04:11.930> for<00:04:12.080> watercolors<00:04:12.620> but<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.010> this

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
fantastic for watercolors but in this

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.830 
fantastic for watercolors but in this
case<00:04:13.340> we're<00:04:13.580> using<00:04:13.610> acrylics<00:04:14.300> today<00:04:14.540> I<00:04:16.840> wanted

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
case we're using acrylics today I wanted

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.060 
case we're using acrylics today I wanted
to<00:04:17.900> find<00:04:18.140> some<00:04:18.440> space<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:19.130> line<00:04:19.519> I<00:04:20.890> could<00:04:21.890> apply

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
to find some space a line I could apply

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.330 
to find some space a line I could apply
it<00:04:22.190> with<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:23.650> again<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:24.860> love<00:04:25.160> these

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
it with that again I love these

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.570 
it with that again I love these
