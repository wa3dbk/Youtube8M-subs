00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.300 
taking the dough and i canta from all
the<00:02:55.150> corners<00:02:55.330> can<00:02:56.320> really<00:02:56.650> like<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.130> base

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
the corners can really like and the base

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.199 
the corners can really like and the base
and<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.870> gets<00:02:59.560> needed<00:02:59.950> on<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.790> way<00:03:01.030> also

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
and I do it gets needed on that way also

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.110 
and I do it gets needed on that way also
so<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.170> will<00:03:02.350> not<00:03:02.530> take<00:03:02.709> much<00:03:02.739> time<00:03:03.190> as<00:03:03.489> we<00:03:03.700> it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
so it will not take much time as we it

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.070 
so it will not take much time as we it
