00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello everyone here we are again in 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.620
 the witch's recipes are said 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.719
 continuously we eat few 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.030
 legumes and it's true because in general 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.939
 because if you have to do them you have to 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.890
 put them in soak than if they can soak 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.290
 almost the glass so today we are going to 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.750
 make some lentils a little too is 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.349
 because vegetables are always associated with 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.599
 chorizo fat pork and all that and not 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.669
 it's always like this because salads 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.370
 legumes are very good today we are going to 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.070
 other kitchens a super lentils 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.469
 light we're going to put a little bit 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.969
 of meat cut into small squares 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.130
 so you do not have to cut them 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.520
 you can simply eat as is 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.660
 the theme of meat with vegetables 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.580
 they always say that legumes with 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.280
 vegetables is enough but if for your 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.140
 bronzes regime you eat meat and a 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.090
 little bit of legume and the rest with the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.770
 break down with a little bit of meat for 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.780
 I give him some meat because 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.010
 I often do regime and that subject 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.360
 I do very well 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.360
 today we have the meat cut brandy 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.370
 then we put onion 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.530
 with you want as more is more 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.890
 easy our most complicated topics the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.760
 life green pepper also cut like 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.010
 hunt is a little garlic optional 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.290
 but he gives a touch I always put him 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.620
 as it will make quite a while there 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.710
 problem 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.710
 It's worth a little salt to taste 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.590
 pepper this is decimated by that of 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.470
 color and cough 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.210
 but why does it come out and then we're going to 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.070
 put a few teaspoons of tomato 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.290
 fried tomato fried when the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.960
 summer we will make a fried tomato day goes to 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.990
 see me see how easy it is and how 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.450
 difference is brutal this one that is of a 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.670
 lady of a town that does it to me and the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.140
 it is true that it is very good we return 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.140
 to 6 teaspoons 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.230
 then meanwhile here we have the 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.450
 lentil pardina that is the little one and the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.990
 let's soak while we cook 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.990
 the meat 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.720
 and here we are going to cover it with a liter of 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.250
 water we will put it in the fire tapadito and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.250
 that is making its structure shift 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.350
 of the room more or less 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.350
 here we have everything right 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.170
 then when we put the lentils what 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.300
 we will control salt and we will put a 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.370
 little white wine because like everything 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.220
 this is a little sweet the white wine will 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.680
 it gives that little bit of acid that makes 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.020
 is so rich in agreement as I come 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.400
 to take them for an hour the fourth and 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.099
 we come back so far 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.439
 Well, we have meat here with the 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.480
 already cooked vegetables when the time of 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:03.180
 childbirth as we said then now you 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.799
 let's put the little wine 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.799
 we explain the cement factories 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.579
 prepared from a job more than 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.740
 enough for the time that we have 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.900
 dice 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.820
 and then now what we will do to 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.000
 approve of salt because it is the time 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.020
 correct to put on the fire and almond 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.020
 for 10 minutes 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.470
 it lacks salt 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.290
 We will control every 10 minutes 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.050
 because they are soaked a bit 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.970
 the games are done very fast, not us 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.640
 we lose consciousness and it will remain as a cure 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.160
 instead of as lentils aller or 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.040
 to the fire 10 minutes and I return with 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.260
 you agree well guys already 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.860
 we have our inmates here with 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.200
 superfamilies super rooms you'll see what 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.840
 good if we let them rest are more 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.220
 good but if I have no problem 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 they freeze superbly they do not have 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.440
 even a retinue and we're already 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.200
 facilitating that as always and if you 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.360
 like what we do 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.820
 by connecting our channel to the 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.820
 next day 12
