year you feel like you've gained his

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.510 
year you feel like you've gained his
trust<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.750> confidence<00:00:26.169> I'm<00:00:26.739> trying<00:00:27.279> to<00:00:27.340> camp

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
trust the confidence I'm trying to camp

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.190 
trust the confidence I'm trying to camp
we<00:00:27.669> have<00:00:27.820> preached<00:00:28.119> to<00:00:28.150> go<00:00:28.390> in<00:00:28.509> deep<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:28.810> lot<00:00:28.840> and

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
we have preached to go in deep a lot and

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.290 
we have preached to go in deep a lot and
I<00:00:29.349> made<00:00:29.710> I<00:00:29.950> made<00:00:30.220> some<00:00:30.520> big<00:00:30.640> plays<00:00:30.820> in<00:00:30.849> training

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
I made I made some big plays in training

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.450 
I made I made some big plays in training
camp<00:00:31.329> so<00:00:31.599> I<00:00:31.689> guess<00:00:31.900> that<00:00:32.079> um<00:00:32.259> aren't<00:00:33.130> a<00:00:33.220> lot<00:00:33.340> of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
camp so I guess that um aren't a lot of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.740 
camp so I guess that um aren't a lot of
trust<00:00:33.640> and<00:00:33.790> bless<00:00:34.030> his<00:00:34.180> chemistry<00:00:34.450> off<00:00:34.630> the

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
trust and bless his chemistry off the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.600 
trust and bless his chemistry off the
field<00:00:34.989> may<00:00:35.230> have<00:00:35.380> a<00:00:35.410> real<00:00:35.680> close<00:00:35.890> go<00:00:36.430> out<00:00:36.520> to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
field may have a real close go out to

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.639 
field may have a real close go out to
eat<00:00:36.730> a<00:00:36.760> lot<00:00:37.000> so<00:00:37.210> he's<00:00:37.510> just<00:00:37.899> trusting

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
eat a lot so he's just trusting

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:47.130 
eat a lot so he's just trusting
chemistry<00:00:38.980> overall<00:00:44.399> they<00:00:45.399> did<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.940> I<00:00:46.510> think

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
chemistry overall they did and I think

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.439 
chemistry overall they did and I think
we<00:00:47.260> made<00:00:47.410> strides<00:00:47.679> as<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.179> running<00:00:49.179> back<00:00:49.210> group

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
we made strides as a running back group

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.939 
we made strides as a running back group
and<00:00:49.660> dolphins<00:00:50.350> line<00:00:50.559> did<00:00:50.769> as<00:00:50.859> well<00:00:52.859> it's<00:00:53.859> been

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
and dolphins line did as well it's been

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.200 
and dolphins line did as well it's been
the<00:00:54.039> biggest<00:00:54.250> difference<00:00:54.460> for<00:00:54.789> you<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.059> two

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
the biggest difference for you to two

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.639 
the biggest difference for you to two
games<00:00:55.449> because<00:00:55.870> from<00:00:56.410> what<00:00:56.589> you<00:00:56.679> expected

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
games because from what you expected

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.540 
games because from what you expected
just<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.739> speed<00:00:59.949> of<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.100> game<00:01:00.249> and

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
just the speed of the game and

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.310 
just the speed of the game and
definitely<00:01:01.449> getting<00:01:01.809> used<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:01.989> speed<00:01:02.230> the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
definitely getting used to speed the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.470 
definitely getting used to speed the
game<00:01:02.350> stuff<00:01:02.739> like<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.129> but<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.999> know<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.269> came

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
game stuff like that but you know I came

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.880 
game stuff like that but you know I came
in<00:01:04.570> early<00:01:04.839> so<00:01:05.019> I've<00:01:05.230> kind<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.470> got<00:01:05.620> used<00:01:05.770> to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
in early so I've kind of got used to

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.040 
in early so I've kind of got used to
that<00:01:06.040> already<00:01:06.400> but<00:01:07.120> I'm<00:01:07.540> just<00:01:07.720> looking

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
that already but I'm just looking

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.840 
that already but I'm just looking
forward<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.409> going<00:01:08.500> Oklahoma<00:01:09.010> along<00:01:09.640> those

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
forward to going Oklahoma along those

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.160 
forward to going Oklahoma along those
lines<00:01:10.060> was<00:01:10.240> just<00:01:10.420> more<00:01:10.600> comfortable<00:01:10.810> than

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
lines was just more comfortable than

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.780 
lines was just more comfortable than
last<00:01:11.350> week<00:01:11.590> I<00:01:11.830> mean<00:01:12.040> just<00:01:12.190> have<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.310> different

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
last week I mean just have a different

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.490 
last week I mean just have a different
one

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
one

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.790 
one
I<00:01:13.730> thought<00:01:14.730> thing<00:01:14.910> we<00:01:15.000> play<00:01:15.180> well<00:01:15.360> today<00:01:15.600> and

I thought thing we play well today and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.050 
I thought thing we play well today and
but<00:01:16.800> we<00:01:16.920> definitely<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.730> make<00:01:17.910> more

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
but we definitely have to make more

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
but we definitely have to make more
strides<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.720> Oklahoma<00:01:19.190> work<00:01:20.190> is<00:01:20.310> what

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
strides going to Oklahoma work is what

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
strides going to Oklahoma work is what
your<00:01:20.640> thoughts<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.480> depth<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.990> guys<00:01:22.170> have

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
your thoughts the depth you guys have

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.320 
your thoughts the depth you guys have
there<00:01:22.590> may<00:01:22.800> be<00:01:22.860> lost<00:01:23.220> upon<00:01:23.370> early<00:01:24.000> today

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
there may be lost upon early today

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.510 
there may be lost upon early today
you<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.720> still<00:01:24.990> had<00:01:25.170> enough<00:01:25.380> people<00:01:25.520> coming

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you know still had enough people coming

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
you know still had enough people coming
to<00:01:26.700> make<00:01:26.820> big<00:01:26.970> place<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.450> opposed<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> last

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to make big place as opposed to last

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
to make big place as opposed to last
year<00:01:28.140> I've<00:01:28.320> been<00:01:28.490> losing<00:01:29.490> sweat<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.760> that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
year I've been losing sweat like that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.430 
year I've been losing sweat like that
have<00:01:30.150> been<00:01:30.300> much<00:01:30.720> bigger<00:01:30.870> deal<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.320> was

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
have been much bigger deal he was

have been much bigger deal he was
talking<00:01:31.650> about<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.920> depth<00:01:33.290> cozy<00:01:34.290> guess<00:01:34.500> was

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
talking about the depth cozy guess was

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.780 
talking about the depth cozy guess was
already<00:01:34.770> mentally<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.310> physically

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
