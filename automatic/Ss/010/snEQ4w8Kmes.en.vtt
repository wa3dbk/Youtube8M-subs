00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is more like a 1 or 1 B but i really

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.480 
is more like a 1 or 1 B but i really
like<00:01:18.750> these<00:01:18.960> headbands<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.950> only<00:01:20.250> thing<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
like these headbands the only thing is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.120 
like these headbands the only thing is
that<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.540> bit<00:01:21.780> tight<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that they are a little bit tight so this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
that they are a little bit tight so this
right<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.390> giving<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
right now is kind of giving me like a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
right now is kind of giving me like a
headache<00:01:25.560> from<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> tightness<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
headache from the tightness of the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.840 
headache from the tightness of the
headband<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.680> after<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> while<00:01:29.580> they<00:01:29.789> do

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
headband but after a while they do

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.930 
headband but after a while they do
stretch<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:30.840> become<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.410> comfortable

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
stretch out and become more comfortable

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.570 
stretch out and become more comfortable

now<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:41.039> from<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> ones<00:01:42.149> that<00:01:42.300> I've<00:01:42.390> tried<00:01:42.720> they

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
now I from the ones that I've tried they

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.680 
now I from the ones that I've tried they
usually<00:01:43.710> last<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.399> pretty<00:01:44.610> long<00:01:44.820> time<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.600> they

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
usually last a pretty long time and they

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.900 
usually last a pretty long time and they
don't<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.050> tangle<00:01:46.649> too<00:01:46.800> much<00:01:47.009> or<00:01:47.369> anything

don't really tangle too much or anything

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.300 
don't really tangle too much or anything
the<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:48.899> does<00:01:49.200> share<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.190> bit

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the way does share just a little bit

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.859 
the way does share just a little bit
when<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.850> run<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.300> fingers<00:01:51.630> through<00:01:51.660> the
