00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.640
 hello to all and fabien I present to you 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 how to get out of the seat map of two 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.540
 different ways optimized with the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.920
 naive method the age and the mastodon 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.840
 you can see that I'm trying to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 to give a simple knife stab 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640
 takes off in height not in length and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.899
 that's not allowing me to get out of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 the map or do something 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.969
 else 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.680
 well I presented you this method 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 when your teammate is equipped with a 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.960
 behemoth give you simply 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.699
 a stab 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.690
 and there you see the result you 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.980
 take off clearly higher is 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.199
 far further you have two 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.460
 different ways of being able to get out of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.870
 this map so the first one is from 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.699
 fall in the same place as me on the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 video so in this case you can 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.369
 do the same path I am in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.080
 doing to be able to get out 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.460
 so this is the hardest exit 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.960
 of the two so-called difficult games she is 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 not really difficult but she is 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.409
 still more complicated than the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760
 second we make you the same way 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.020
 that I care about you there is 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.390
 little ones help the small ledge to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.009
 follow well along the way if 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.720
 never shift a little too much towards the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.460
 right you will fall into the water is 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.220
 seen above is not textures and well 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.049
 what are you going through and seeing that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.820
 when you go in usually in 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.990
 under a map you take a 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.810
 debt barriers and so you'll get me 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.310
 so suddenly the glitch will stop there 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.360
 so that's very simple course for 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.220
 go out of the map 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.509
 I also want to clarify that this 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.000
 method with the mastodon she is 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.350
 much simpler than the one with the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.020
 half in addition to that the fastest 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.060
 given that a web a hit of kmc 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.680
 25 elimination a meaning juggernaut and 10 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.630
 and if in addition you take the records 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.909
 the killstreaks under dassault 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.040
 pardon you can make yourself two 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.630
 mastodons in 11 elimination or take 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.610
 mastodon of normal mastodon whip 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.689
 and you have 2 and more of that 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.729
 when you give yourself a shot of 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.050
 heart on a mastodon he does not die 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.820
 directly you have to give one 10 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.560
 so they die so that's it 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.090
 frankly gives a lot of tests to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.470
 able to realize then if ever 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.720
 you do with the klm strike you 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.490
 make a stroke and get screwed 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.200
 these fairs and you have 25 elimination 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.120
 at the bottom you have to redo it and in 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.890
 more of that so the last thing is 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.990
 that a detail but it's always without 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.480
 your vision will not be orange and being 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.470
 given that you will not call from 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.330
 two strikes of coësmes will not you 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.660
 not the ugly orange radiation on the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.280
 map 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.740
 so see that the second reason pope he 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.910
 looks a lot like the one we 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.140
 could do with the typing of coësmes 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.880
 it's just a little different there is a 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.380
 little bigger way to go 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.790
 so I hope it's him of you will have 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.930
 more is the case do not hesitate to let go 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.130
 a layman and I find myself at very 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.700
 soon for next videos to 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.700
 help on everyone
