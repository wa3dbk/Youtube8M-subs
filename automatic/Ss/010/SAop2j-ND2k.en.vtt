I'm<00:04:24.360> regular<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:24.810> I<00:04:24.840> probably<00:04:25.230> will<00:04:26.150> that's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
I'm regular so I probably will that's

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.909 
I'm regular so I probably will that's
just<00:04:27.330> how<00:04:27.419> I<00:04:27.450> do<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:33.440> that's<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> story<00:04:34.830> of

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
just how I do and that's the story of

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.860 
just how I do and that's the story of
how<00:04:35.100> Bexon<00:04:35.580> got<00:04:35.760> trashed<00:04:36.060> he<00:04:36.330> was<00:04:36.450> like<00:04:36.600> one<00:04:36.780> of

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
how Bexon got trashed he was like one of

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.420 
how Bexon got trashed he was like one of
the<00:04:36.930> easiest<00:04:37.290> silhouettes<00:04:37.800> probably<00:04:38.130> second

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
the easiest silhouettes probably second

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.370 
the easiest silhouettes probably second
easiest<00:04:38.550> only<00:04:39.419> reason<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.690> say<00:04:39.840> second<00:04:40.290> is

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
easiest only reason I say second is

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.470 
easiest only reason I say second is
because<00:04:40.770> um<00:04:42.110> zexion<00:04:43.110> had<00:04:43.320> no<00:04:43.500> health<00:04:43.710> but<00:04:44.480> you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
because um zexion had no health but you

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.840 
because um zexion had no health but you
know<00:04:45.630> he's<00:04:46.470> not<00:04:46.500> too<00:04:46.919> bad<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.280> data<00:04:47.490> battle

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
except for that one thing where he

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.870 
except for that one thing where he
brings<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.620> ice<00:04:49.770> cubes<00:04:50.160> all<00:04:50.370> around<00:04:50.760> or
