00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
little chunkier here's one of the things

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.980 
little chunkier here's one of the things
I<00:01:02.410> was<00:01:02.559> able<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.890> do<00:01:03.070> with<00:01:03.219> Harley<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:06.810> was<00:01:07.810> able

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
I was able to do with Harley I was able

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.540 
I was able to do with Harley I was able
to<00:01:08.170> do<00:01:08.380> with<00:01:08.530> Harvey<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.039> make<00:01:09.190> them<00:01:09.340> work

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
to do with Harvey to make them work

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.740 
to do with Harvey to make them work
better<00:01:09.759> I<00:01:10.119> was<00:01:11.049> able<00:01:11.260> to<00:01:11.470> take<00:01:11.770> off<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.270> halo

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
better I was able to take off the halo

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.859 
better I was able to take off the halo
that<00:01:13.960> hangs<00:01:14.229> him<00:01:14.470> up<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.939> this<00:01:16.360> actually

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
that hangs him up and this actually

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.609 
that hangs him up and this actually
opens<00:01:16.900> up<00:01:17.409> two<00:01:17.950> spaces<00:01:18.869> where<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.020> sound<00:01:20.320> can

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
opens up two spaces where the sound can

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:21.749 
opens up two spaces where the sound can
get<00:01:20.799> through<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.369> makes<00:01:21.549> them<00:01:21.729> more

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
get through and makes them more

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.560 
get through and makes them more
effective<00:01:22.180> now<00:01:23.080> I<00:01:23.110> have<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.530> admit<00:01:23.619> Harvey<00:01:24.280> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
effective now I have to admit Harvey is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.210 
effective now I have to admit Harvey is
heavier<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.900> even<00:01:26.680> though<00:01:26.799> he's<00:01:27.040> the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
heavier and even though he's the

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.980 
heavier and even though he's the
original<00:01:27.700> Pete<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.090> parrot<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.479> we<00:01:28.750> own

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
original Pete the parrot that we own

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.890 
original Pete the parrot that we own
he's<00:01:29.770> certainly<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.990> higher<00:01:31.990> quality<00:01:32.710> parrot

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
he's certainly a higher quality parrot

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.870 
he's certainly a higher quality parrot
oddly<00:01:34.900> enough<00:01:35.049> he<00:01:35.439> was<00:01:35.650> actually<00:01:36.009> cost<00:01:36.549> less

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
oddly enough he was actually cost less

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.649 
oddly enough he was actually cost less
than<00:01:37.060> Pete<00:01:37.360> about<00:01:37.630> four<00:01:38.619> years<00:01:38.890> ago<00:01:42.420> okay<00:01:43.420> now

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
than Pete about four years ago okay now

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.039 
than Pete about four years ago okay now
we're<00:01:43.869> back<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:44.079> Pete<00:01:44.470> so<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.549> key<00:01:45.759> here<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:46.060> is

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
we're back to Pete so the key here is is

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.530 
we're back to Pete so the key here is is
to<00:01:47.140> put<00:01:47.500> something<00:01:47.979> under<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.430> so<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.240> sound

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
to put something under this so the sound

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.780 
to put something under this so the sound
can<00:01:49.869> get<00:01:50.020> into<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.409> hole<00:01:50.619> I'm<00:01:51.250> using<00:01:51.640> a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
can get into the hole I'm using a

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.210 
can get into the hole I'm using a
container<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.320> second<00:01:53.740> thing<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.070> might

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
container and the second thing you might

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.120 
container and the second thing you might
try<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.549> do<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:55.149> to<00:01:55.780> get<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.110> halo<00:01:56.530> out<00:01:56.740> like<00:01:56.979> I

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
try to do is to get this halo out like I

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.120 
try to do is to get this halo out like I
did<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:57.369> Harvey<00:01:58.170> unless<00:01:59.170> you're<00:01:59.409> used<00:01:59.680> unless

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
did on Harvey unless you're used unless

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.649 
did on Harvey unless you're used unless
you're<00:02:00.340> hanging<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.790> pirate<00:02:01.180> up<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.420> really

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
you're hanging the pirate up you really

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.719 
you're hanging the pirate up you really
won't<00:02:01.810> need<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:02.950> if<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.130> get<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.399> halo

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
won't need that so if you get the halo

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.340 
won't need that so if you get the halo
out<00:02:03.969> there'll<00:02:04.180> be<00:02:04.210> two<00:02:04.479> additional<00:02:04.630> holes

out there'll be two additional holes

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.710 
out there'll be two additional holes
where<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.460> sound<00:02:06.729> can<00:02:07.030> get<00:02:07.240> in<00:02:09.420> let<00:02:10.420> us<00:02:10.540> know
