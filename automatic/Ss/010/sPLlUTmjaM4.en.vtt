00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:10.360
 So whether Well newly say all the things around or that such a peripheral align yourself 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.450
 Do you buy or use what you used until now? 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.110
 There is a need to prepare went so 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:23.140
 So I would say in my own environment 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:29.380
 Here 's the benq monitor I introduced last time. 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 Well , I'm going to use this one, and other peripherals, but yeah yeah 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:37.100
 My house is here The first PC purchased in Japan for the first time more than 10 years ago 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.670
 It was a culture of Sony 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:46.850
 Well, of course I am not using it now 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:52.039
 Really more than 105 years in the house Well because Mexico is to dispose I'm going to disposal 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:57.120
 It's Well has been attached to this I'd such things are not all the time the crust without use 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:00.120
 I can still use the keyboard, so I think I will use that keyboard 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.270
 Here is the previous vaio 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.570
 Well, I have no problem with the keyboard 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.860
 I still hit it at all for a while 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 I think there is no particular feeling that the button is crushed 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.250
 Of course these priorities are of course yes, so unless you have a problem 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.290
 I think I will use 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.860
 Yes, I'm going to go mouse, but I 've used it for mice 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.570
 It is this mouse which we put on notebook computer 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:37.130
 It is the moon of the radio, but I think I will continue to use this 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.270
 Well I I I went to Ma Bic Camera in Well If you leave once introduced Elecom mouse 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.609
 That's the most fecal and sloppy mouse 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.310
 Just N It Is the wind of I feel it 's how to use here also not bad and even after more than one year 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:51.630
 I can use it without any problems now 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.829
 Its Maybe Well I think that for the time being kana Let's use it is this two 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.060
 I'm thinking about a little better keyboard or mouse 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:05.789
 I think the kana Let's use the hereabouts of peripheral devices if there is no time being a problem 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.330
 And later on 8 McQueen, because it has to be projected on the video monitor 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.280
 I'm doing coffee 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:17.050
 I'm shooting on the LCD screen of a cat, but that hdmi cable 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.040
 Such a that in such a cable is not even come with in accessories, so their 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.660
 Well hdmi cables need to be lined up 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.319
 Once in respect to myself this is also I'd think is going Taso buy later 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.299
 of ps 4 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:37.819
 I 've pulled the hdmi cable so it looks like this 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:42.799
 It seems like the peripheral device is somehow at hand. 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.629
 That's right, right now I'm saying this mac mini from now on peripheral devices 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.720
 By connecting all and 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:52.010
 I want to start it 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.960
 I did all the installation now for saying that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.960
 I think that I want to put immediately by say 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.960
 I think that I could not hear that the egg was going to be here for a while now 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.960
 I heard the startup sound of mac 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.410
 I wonder if this will come 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.810
 It was the moon 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.530
 I can not see this screen for a moment 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.530
 I will change the lens once again 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.580
 It looks like it was okay. 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:48.920
 We were able to the point where you start by saying Hi Well 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.450
 How many times it feels strange 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:58.400
 Well, I just waited for about 5 minutes for the keychain just before 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:02.450
 If I'm not good, I've got a defect and it's been a while for a while, but I can start normally 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.940
 It was good today and today it is here that yes 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.910
 It is a model of 2014, and it is here to start connecting maintenance of the Mac 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.030
 I went there 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.030
 It was such a feeling of moving Well called
