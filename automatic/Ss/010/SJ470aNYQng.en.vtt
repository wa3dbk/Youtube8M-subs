00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 Y 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.120
 hello everyone in this video we can see 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.889
 how to tune your guitar 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.950
 is my guitar an electric guitar 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.279
 but driver 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.020
 it's a cheap land 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.370
 I bought it a year ago 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.420
 but well, a way of activating the 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:32.390
 guitar is the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.390
 for example my guitar has 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.860
 built-in tuner 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.860
 until 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.890
 another way is that 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.380
 often amplifier 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.750
 amplifiers that have their own 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.240
 swimmer like this 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.310
 just to activate we leave it personal 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.180
 I feel one 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.180
 is active 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.050
 it's something else 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:28.560
 another way is a clip tuner only 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.560
 we do this 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810
 it's okay 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:45.670
 good but now I'm going to show you how 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.670
 at the end your guitar with a good ear 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.220
 to tune your guitar from ear have 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.360
 make sure that the first the sixth 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.360
 rope is this 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.359
 that is well tuned 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.670
 for example mine is tuned to 440 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.560
 then to tune the next string 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.959
 they have to press the 5 fret of the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.239
 string number 6 and it has to sound 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.239
 exactly the same as the fifth string 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.250
 and the same thing is done when the fifth 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.660
 string is tuned and the same with the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.830
 fourth string always pressing the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.830
 fifth string on the fret 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.630
 then when the rope is already 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.760
 well tuned 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.450
 pressing on the fifth fret of the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.450
 fourth rope 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.120
 but 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.650
 now this is important in the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.370
 third string you have to press the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.370
 fourth fret 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.300
 that always has to sound like the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.300
 second 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.500
 that is the only agreement in which there is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.730
 that press the agreement after the others 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.730
 strings are always always 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.980
 the stop stop in to the guitar 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.370
 Y 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.940
 Y 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.230
 i 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.590
 you can try tuning whenever 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.590
 they are like that 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.420
 then doubts are the ways to tune 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.780
 a guitar I hope you liked it 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.519
 and always subscribe and give me I like that 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.519
 this motivates me to continue uploading videos
