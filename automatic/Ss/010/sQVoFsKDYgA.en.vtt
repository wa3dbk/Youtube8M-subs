 Come on

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.780
 state and from dania it starts 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.350
 it will be that in the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.410

 then counted as passed if the 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.559
 complete shell so the complete 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.559
 sausage is eaten 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.640

 alex such times the milk are looking here 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.510
 regularly between 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.189
 now separates 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.600
 2 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:49.489
 this is for my trips me so 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:49.489
 small piece of super favored heroes 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.860
 men stopped short as what and so 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.010
 to picture that guys from all over 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.390
 body became very dizzy and has 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.800
 I also put aside the sanity 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.360
 I should be sitting first 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.360
 yes you should at up to limits its 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:31.430
 the sunglasses on 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.620
 I did not realize it was there 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.540
 he is the circulation because it is easy 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.800
 dodgy and so and there I have me 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.150
 he thought I stop before I then 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.580
 somewhere else we have a collapse cancer 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.120
 we ate 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.680
 andreas grill and I have there too 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.210
 participated and that is the sauce had to 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.510
 because I no longer felt my fingers 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.510
 have 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:33.800
 and that 's just about the last 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:36.830
 piece what awaits the two now 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.980
 finalists alex around stephan merz here what 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:45.140
 she is now expecting a capsaicin liquid 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:49.850
 extract of pure capsaicin dissolved with 18 6 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:58.490
 million scoville the better win 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:05:06.940
 wanted to survive the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.940
 the very last lap would rather not 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.560
 everything here is incredible this 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:30.970
 man really absolutely respected alex 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:30.970
 has managed the sharpness further 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.650
 There are now three drops of the sauce 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:46.210
 That's what we mean on every slice 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.210
 have the dose tripled the same time 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:54.370
 incredibly the hottest 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.240
 1 Stephan now the last piece 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.900
 had eaten then there are two 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.900
 first places 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:41.400
 I am satisfied that no one overturned 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.860
 it was so extremely sharp 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.120
 so I expected worse 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.600
 So the guys are definitely tough 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.330
 i would not have thought i would take this 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.950
 thought it will go hurt 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.750
 which pain is greater in the now 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:07:00.660
 finger or still sharper than 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:06.690
 optimally the blood sugar is a bit high 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:08.130
 That's a bit high it should be 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.840
 really my next days to the doctor 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.890
 go and control that and to 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.810
 check 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.430
 so i dont know if i got that from the 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.120
 Camera say so that monument is possible 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.120
 now growing like that 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.430
 a work process and then I have 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.330
 Tonight another two hours on 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.360
 the toilet 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:29.069
 it is such a feeling you 50 stop 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.069
 could not even get the fa cup 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.380
 in 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:41.129
 the
