00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
easy to get written once you have

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.010 
easy to get written once you have
entered<00:00:47.870> Anchorage<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.800> d<00:00:50.039> man<00:00:50.570> Owen<00:00:51.570> you'll

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
entered Anchorage for d man Owen you'll

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.799 
entered Anchorage for d man Owen you'll
need<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> raid<00:00:53.280> group<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:54.059> doing

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
need to be in the raid group to be doing

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
need to be in the raid group to be doing
this<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> friend<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:58.489> be

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this but you can just get a friend to be

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
this but you can just get a friend to be
in<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.699> rate<00:00:59.910> than<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.750> do<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> by

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
in your rate than they you can do it by

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.529 
in your rate than they you can do it by
yourself<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.219> all<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.430> need<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> once

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
yourself so all you need to do is once

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.590 
yourself so all you need to do is once
you<00:01:03.660> enter<00:01:03.989> you'll<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:05.189> mobs<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.820> they

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you enter you'll see for mobs here they

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.530 
you enter you'll see for mobs here they
will<00:01:06.780> each<00:01:07.020> half<00:01:07.350> above<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.040> whenever<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
will each half above and whenever one of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
will each half above and whenever one of
them<00:01:09.780> dies<00:01:10.049> all<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.860> other<00:01:11.010> maps<00:01:11.310> will<00:01:11.580> have

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
them dies all the other maps will have

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.050 
them dies all the other maps will have
that<00:01:12.060> unique<00:01:12.659> buff<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.619> them<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.520> which

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that unique buff that the them up which

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.660 
that unique buff that the them up which
you<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.570> killed<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.080> head<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.340> let's<00:01:17.520> get

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you just killed the head so let's get

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.170 
you just killed the head so let's get
this<00:01:17.820> pulling<00:01:18.860> as<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.670> map<00:01:20.909> got

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
this pulling as you see this map got

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.450 
this pulling as you see this map got
thunder<00:01:21.540> clap<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.080> when<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.860> map<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
thunder clap and when this map is that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.870 
thunder clap and when this map is that
it<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:25.040> given<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.369> other<00:01:26.640> mobs

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it will be given to all the other mobs

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.240 
it will be given to all the other mobs
so<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.600> basically<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.350> about<00:01:28.770> killing

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so it's basically just about killing

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.880 
so it's basically just about killing
them<00:01:29.750> mortal<00:01:30.750> strike<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.439> something<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
them mortal strike is not something I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
them mortal strike is not something I
would<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:32.970> other<00:01:33.329> maps<00:01:33.570> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
would like to have on the other maps so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.410 
would like to have on the other maps so
I'm<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.650> take<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.759> fire<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
I'm going to take go with this fire and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.560 
sure you have some decent gear for this
i'm<00:01:46.140> using<00:01:46.320> my<00:01:46.530> pupae<00:01:47.040> gear<00:01:47.329> protection<00:01:48.329> spec

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
i'm using my pupae gear protection spec

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.819 
i'm using my pupae gear protection spec
can<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.930> working<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.409> well<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.090> see

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
can be working as well so now you see

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.080 
can be working as well so now you see
I've<00:01:52.829> k<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.369> trying<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.060> kill<00:01:55.490> only<00:01:56.490> three<00:01:56.909> out

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
I've k I'm trying to kill only three out

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.760 
I've k I'm trying to kill only three out
of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.450> four<00:01:57.659> mops<00:01:57.960> here

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
of the four mops here

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.580 
of the four mops here
just<00:02:00.609> one<00:02:00.939> more<00:02:01.149> second<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.750> we'll<00:02:02.200> be<00:02:02.350> dead

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
just one more second and we'll be dead

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.029 
just one more second and we'll be dead
so<00:02:03.399> now<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.729> map<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.210> dead<00:02:04.560> only<00:02:05.560> one<00:02:05.710> more<00:02:05.890> is

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
so now the map is dead only one more is

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.279 
so now the map is dead only one more is
back<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.520> I'm<00:02:07.000> not<00:02:07.270> going<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.659> kill<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:07.899> map

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
back and I'm not going to kill that map

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.610 
back and I'm not going to kill that map
for<00:02:08.590> one<00:02:08.800> reason<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.929> go<00:02:11.110> out<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
for one reason I can go out of the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
for one reason I can go out of the
instance<00:02:12.480> once<00:02:13.480> I'm<00:02:13.660> out<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.709> go<00:02:15.069> back<00:02:15.340> in

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
instance once I'm out I can go back in

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.360 
instance once I'm out I can go back in
and<00:02:18.360> all<00:02:19.360> four<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.959> maps<00:02:20.170> has<00:02:20.650> respawned

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and all four of the maps has respawned

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.940 
and all four of the maps has respawned
so<00:02:22.269> that's<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.750> pretty<00:02:22.989> good<00:02:23.200> technique<00:02:23.769> and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
so that's a pretty good technique and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.910 
so that's a pretty good technique and
now<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.760> can<00:02:25.090> just<00:02:25.360> get<00:02:25.540> looting<00:02:26.200> looting<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
now you can just get looting looting the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.430 
now you can just get looting looting the
