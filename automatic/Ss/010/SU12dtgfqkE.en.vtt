00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.100
(music)

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.720
Hello everybody!

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.680
How do you like my new costume?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.680
Is it colorful?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.640
You like it?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.880
I'm here at amphitheater of Youtube Space, LA

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.980
Today, we are going to make tuna sandwich.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.600
This is Korean twist

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.900
on American classic

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.460
so it's going to be really delicious

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.460
very simple ingredients, I'm using

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.380
so let's start!

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.620
We need half cup cucumber

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.380
chopped just thin

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420
and small pieces

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
I'm going to use half cup

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Onion

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.420
we need around quarter (1/4) cup

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.720
Salt

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.080
half teaspoon

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.240
and mix

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.880
Just let it sit for a couple of minutes

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.220
This hard-boiled egg, 1 egg

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.580
Really super, super easy

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.700
Okay!

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.200
So I'm going to set it aside

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.700
This morning, I got this from my hotel.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.560
Each piece, 1 dollar!

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.660
So I'm going to grill this

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.540
Pan is heated

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.740
so you don't need any oil

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.840
So now, like my bread is a little burnt

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.280
so smell so good

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.240
so I'm going to turn over

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.700
multi grain bread

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.240
smells really like this uh

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.240
remind me of Korean Nurungji, burnt rice

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.740
Kay, done!

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.160
And then we are going to squeeze out excess water.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.760
Look at that water!

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.960
Waterfall!

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.140
Niagara Waterfall!

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.080
Put this into this bowl.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.480
And egg

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.920
and then, we need tuna.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.940
Let's strain this.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.900
Press down.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.920
Til all the liquid go through this strainer.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.840
And then, put it here.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.600
Easy, eh?

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.180
We need mayonnaise.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Quarter cup mayonnaise.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.980
This is ground black pepper

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.500
Oooh, windy windy!

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.640
Okay

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.560
around a quarter (1/4) teaspoon

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780
and mix this

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.120
egg, you don't need to chop it up on the cutting board

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.740
Very good!

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.740
Okay, let's make this sandwich now!

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.560
We need some green stuff.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880
Oooh, big!

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.500
Big lump.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920
Go all the way here.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.280
And then

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.080
radish sprouts

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.240
Wow, wow, wow

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.960
so pretty!

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.500
And

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.180
then we need hat!

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.480
That's it! Our tuna sandwich, done!

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.120
So you can make it, right?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.140
In 10 minutes, you can make this delicious tuna sandwich.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.100
Thick, thick!

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.140
I'm going to feed some people.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.920
We are just working together here Youtube Space

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.580
(Let's go!)

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.780
(Can I take one?)

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.500
Yeah yeah yeah.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.100
(You are amazing!)

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.740
I forgot to bring my...

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.000
(I'll take a little one. I'll leave the big ones for the boys.)

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.260
(Oh my god, thank you!)

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.460
Hey boys, pick one.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.540
(Hold on, let me just try...)

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.440
(Let me have both.)

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.620
(No, you can't have both, don't be so greedy!)

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.220
(Yes!!)

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.720
(That was the best tuna sandwich...)

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.400
Yeah, I saw that you just

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.520
you, what's your channel?

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.280
(Frisbee.)

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.020
I saw that your frisbee oh my crazy, crazy

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.680
(Not as crazy as good as this sandwich)

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.160
(This is insane! Amazing, thank you!)

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.120
He and I met in the Youtube Nextup

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.900
then I met him here, reunion.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.140
(Yeah, old friends.)

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.680
Really awesome, yeah, cool.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.760
(Usually, I find tuna sandwiches a little too salty

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.440
but this is perfect.)

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.860
(Less salty.)

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.380
I use fresh cucumber.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.220
(Yeah.)

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.980
Yeah, egg. 1 egg.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.220
(And by the way, you look beautiful!)

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.320
Oh, you look beautiful!

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.880
(I love this skirt, I love this hair)

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.760
Thank you!

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.300
So everybody enjoys my tuna sandwich

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.440

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.360
