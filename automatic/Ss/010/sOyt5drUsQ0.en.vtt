if<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.170> want<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.380> use<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.709> in<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:25.980> style<00:03:26.340> and

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
if you want to use it in this style and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.420 
if you want to use it in this style and
well<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.600> position<00:03:28.110> what<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.890> do<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.280> you

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
well in this position what you do is you

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.420 
well in this position what you do is you
would<00:03:29.550> position<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.269> top<00:03:30.690> velcro<00:03:31.230> pieces<00:03:31.500> as

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
would position the top velcro pieces as

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.070 
would position the top velcro pieces as
high<00:03:32.700> as<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.200> just<00:03:34.200> like<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:36.330> then

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
high as you can just like that and then

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.400 
high as you can just like that and then
from<00:03:37.320> there<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.680> can<00:03:37.709> actually<00:03:39.170> unbell<00:03:40.170> CRO

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
from there you can actually unbell CRO

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.580 
from there you can actually unbell CRO
it<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.510> make<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> little<00:03:42.780> stand<00:03:43.110> just<00:03:43.440> like

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
it and make a little stand just like

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.770 
it and make a little stand just like
that<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:45.090> going<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.299> kind<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.510> hard<00:03:45.720> to

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
that so it's going to kind of hard to

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.130 
that so it's going to kind of hard to
see<00:03:46.049> here<00:03:46.080> but<00:03:46.590> now<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.010> iPad<00:03:47.370> has<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.840> nice

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
see here but now the iPad has a nice

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.610 
see here but now the iPad has a nice
stand<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.130> nice<00:03:50.340> angle<00:03:51.440> kind<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.500> give

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
stand here the nice angle kind of give

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.120 
stand here the nice angle kind of give
it<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.709> closer<00:03:52.980> look<00:03:53.220> here<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:54.870> see<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.320> and

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
it a closer look here you see that and

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.699 
it a closer look here you see that and
it's<00:03:57.000> completely<00:03:57.600> adjustable<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:58.380> think<00:03:58.590> you

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
it's completely adjustable I think you

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.009 
it's completely adjustable I think you
can<00:03:58.860> get<00:03:59.010> your<00:03:59.130> iPad<00:03:59.549> up<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.269> 30-degree

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
can get your iPad up to a 30-degree

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.490 
can get your iPad up to a 30-degree
angle<00:04:01.049> is<00:04:01.799> what's<00:04:02.010> there's<00:04:02.190> no<00:04:02.340> website<00:04:02.670> and

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
angle is what's there's no website and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.199 
angle is what's there's no website and
if<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.590> don't<00:04:04.799> like<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.100> side<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:06.060> can

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
if you don't like that side you can

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.090 
if you don't like that side you can
actually<00:04:06.359> flip<00:04:06.810> over<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.320> entire<00:04:07.650> case

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
actually flip over the entire case

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.700 
actually flip over the entire case
just<00:04:08.520> like<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.180> do<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.080> same<00:04:10.380> exact

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
just like that and do the same exact

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.800 
just like that and do the same exact
thing<00:04:10.890> on<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.100> other<00:04:11.130> side<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:11.820> say<00:04:12.570> if<00:04:12.660> you're

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
thing on the other side so say if you're

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.240 
thing on the other side so say if you're
left-handed<00:04:13.080> or<00:04:13.380> right-handed<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:14.070> could

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
left-handed or right-handed you could

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.980 
left-handed or right-handed you could
