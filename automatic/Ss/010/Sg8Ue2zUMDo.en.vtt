00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.429
 we show you how to show 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.439
 How can we use the keyboard? 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.679
 the keyboard times have agreements 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.869
 that can cause 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.890
 the keyboard was capitalized 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.269
 clicking here 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.179
 gifts or 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.410
 the local caps 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 and some keyboards you will have 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.380
 the keyboard becoming Palestinian territories 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.580
 merchant admitted 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.740
 the leader quoted should be scheduled 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.400
 we did so well 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600
 Take the c-abs off this shift 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.330
 another back there 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.460
 in the tight xc version 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.970
 it's a defeat 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.360
 Suspended biliary writing 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.980
 put in box-high leiria work school there that I want 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.710
 all computers locally 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.170
 I already have a service shirt 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.530
 you send me boots 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.470
 we blocked keyboards 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.440
 and then in case you can type the numbers at will and also 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.480
 cross according to the mathematicians and the aesthetic scepter 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.480
 to power ground 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.440
 the procedure gradually 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.050
 The test is that they want to lose weight and that apparently no one 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.860
 keyboard 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.610
 characteristic try 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.800
 it is understood that this truce here 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.390
 chicago pelé is a little bigger and there it is right here 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.370
 step is to stay down here 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.100
 follows some tapas being human you have no part you 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.700
 the cher button even dropped 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.420
 al-sharif plates distinguish two sides so we can 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.520
 used two sides 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.790
 and there you have 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 even with the construction 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.500
 and can also be used for others as the class goes out. 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.129
 maybe you can use it for other commands 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.459
 normally 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.899
 on your keyboard, you got the title by quoting something 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:19.739
 no sooner said than done 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.129
 if you use this task 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.609
 call tech 3 or else it can be implemented 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.169
 with the company had 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.869
 this reason 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.849
 but here we had hoped for the characters you just stopped 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.469
 if you by chance 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.709
 the body is something and kia 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.400
 he would have tried to win even because he plays keyboards 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.009
 - I'm here I like to have bombs shootings 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.299
 and then 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.299
 using the exx left-end bar 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.199
 off in the field 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.779
 in case 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.729
 it's her to see 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.649
 the elective positions 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.939
 I'll be rude with the keys. 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.939
 the space between the absent 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.249
 with my wife 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:15.419
 pfizer now counts' this is xxxx 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.059
 d account to the stage 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.519
 and in the afternoon when I had 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.069
 back 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.680
 I can erase what's ahead. 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.400
 yes because it removes all xa lane benefit 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:32.309
 you can also use the keyboard to go down 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.429
 in case 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:35.869
 that keeps blinking 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.679
 also has the sudden 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.459
 and the wounded 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.419
 to the public how I am with the key 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.489
 It is indicated that I can right the moment 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.489
 the boot that five thousand 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.509
 the national portal 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.779
 and then if you want to keep any team red 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:03.089
 so I'll tell you here 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.909
 it was an hour and it was one more 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.889
 in the question behind 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.149
 dexter it 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:13.659
 the attacking midfielder 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.299
 the guy wants to go downstairs 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.389
 another feature a keyboard is like this 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.789
 the candidates 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.789
 this team part you may not want to enter 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:31.209
 the other data in the case here when I click here when to start it can

 programs he has used of a mind 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.370
 normally 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.200
 before the 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.410
 the tourism here 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.780
 an attack we have made in this way 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.620
 the programs are connected to the internet the internet story on 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.529
 another way you can use the keyboard well 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.870
 homework is the state government 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.910

 was pressed 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:06.360
 part of the entourage 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.910
 I know that I will leave the top of the new sé after denying 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.979
 the top position 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.110
 it will appear on the screen 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.610

 everything and everything that I have I think I'm coming back to mine 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:22.629
 machine 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.860
 so you or walk 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.300
 is with the 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.080
 6 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.029
 to the pressed 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.870

 the condition he describes what is underneath rudolph of buchecha eight and ten 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.759
 credits that this program 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.849
 is running 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.189
 much here the one in the case is the desktop itself has nothing written and 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:49.439
 I know it has 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.710
 something written for theft with death this is what also has 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.879
 support from the internet and here too time
