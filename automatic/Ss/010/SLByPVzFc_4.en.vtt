to understand that he's never going to

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.340 
to understand that he's never going to
get<00:06:01.380> this<00:06:02.510> at<00:06:03.510> least<00:06:03.690> not<00:06:03.780> from<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:04.020> floor<00:06:04.260> you

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
get this at least not from the floor you

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.990 
get this at least not from the floor you
can<00:06:04.380> get<00:06:04.560> it<00:06:04.620> from<00:06:04.680> my<00:06:04.860> hands<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.340> good<00:06:05.790> boy

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
yes so that's basically the next few

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.870 
yes so that's basically the next few
steps<00:06:10.410> of<00:06:10.860> teaching<00:06:11.490> lay<00:06:11.610> that<00:06:12.140> you<00:06:13.140> go<00:06:13.880> very

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
steps of teaching lay that you go very

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.420 
steps of teaching lay that you go very
simple<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:15.960> gradually<00:06:16.740> make<00:06:16.920> it<00:06:17.040> harder<00:06:17.340> and

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
simple and gradually make it harder and

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.900 
simple and gradually make it harder and
harder<00:06:17.780> and<00:06:18.920> you<00:06:19.920> know<00:06:20.040> it's<00:06:20.280> repetition

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
harder and you know it's repetition

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.390 
harder and you know it's repetition
repetition<00:06:21.030> he<00:06:21.510> starts<00:06:21.780> to<00:06:22.040> understand<00:06:23.040> the

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
repetition he starts to understand the

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.100 
repetition he starts to understand the
word<00:06:23.580> leave<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:24.060> again<00:06:24.600> we're<00:06:24.780> just<00:06:24.900> using

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
word leave it again we're just using

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.910 
word leave it again we're just using

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
that uh that we need to teach this

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.380 
that uh that we need to teach this
behavior<00:06:32.070> we<00:06:32.250> just<00:06:32.430> want<00:06:32.610> them<00:06:32.700> to<00:06:32.760> understand

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
behavior we just want them to understand

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:41.720 
behavior we just want them to understand
