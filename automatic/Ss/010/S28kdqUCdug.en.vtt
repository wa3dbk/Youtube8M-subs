and<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:14.430> pieces<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.090> basically

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and these pieces right here basically

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.140 
and these pieces right here basically
serve<00:01:16.439> me<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.890> same<00:01:17.159> function<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> back<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
serve me the same function as a back of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.460 
serve me the same function as a back of
a<00:01:18.240> toilet<00:01:19.400> when<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.150> gas<00:01:21.299> comes<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.110> fills

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
a toilet when the gas comes in it fills

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.830 
a toilet when the gas comes in it fills
up<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.860> float<00:01:23.130> Bowl<00:01:23.310> right<00:01:23.490> here

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
up in this float Bowl right here

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.010 
up in this float Bowl right here
it<00:01:24.950> raises<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.189> float<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.880> once<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> gets

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it raises the float up and once it gets

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
it raises the float up and once it gets
to<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.259> certain<00:01:28.320> level<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.040> rubber<00:01:29.909> tip<00:01:30.150> on

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
to a certain level the rubber tip on

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
to a certain level the rubber tip on
that<00:01:30.390> will<00:01:30.869> plug<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> hole<00:01:31.950> where<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.159> gas<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that will plug the hole where the gas is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.429 
that will plug the hole where the gas is
coming<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.970> not<00:01:33.329> allowing<00:01:33.450> any<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:33.990> gas<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
coming in not allowing any more gas to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.910 
coming in not allowing any more gas to
flow<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.390> once<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.570> bowl<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.869> full<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.229> gas

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.740 

then<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.369> your<00:01:41.490> jet<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:42.119> which<00:01:42.270> which

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
then you have your jet here which which

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.350 
then you have your jet here which which
screws<00:01:43.079> into<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> bottom<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> carb<00:01:44.360> which

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
screws into the bottom of the carb which

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.139 
screws into the bottom of the carb which
sits<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.250> right<00:01:47.460> into

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
sits just right but right up right into

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.910 
sits just right but right up right into
the<00:01:48.450> gas<00:01:48.840> itself<00:01:50.840> when<00:01:51.840> air<00:01:52.140> flows<00:01:52.200> through

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the gas itself when air flows through

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.789 
the gas itself when air flows through
this<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.280> where<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> air<00:01:53.729> flows<00:01:53.970> through<00:01:54.799> air

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
this is where the air flows through air

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.850 
this is where the air flows through air
flows<00:01:56.130> through<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.290> creates<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
flows through here and as it creates a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.819 
flows through here and as it creates a
vacuum<00:01:59.070> once<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> enters<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.290> as<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.530> inches

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
vacuum once it enters and as it inches

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.440 
vacuum once it enters and as it inches
it<00:02:02.219> flows<00:02:02.610> through<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.939> middle<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it flows through the middle of the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.399 
it flows through the middle of the
carburetor

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
carburetor

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.270 
carburetor
it<00:02:04.770> sucks<00:02:05.250> gas<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.670> through<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> jet<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.380> then

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
it sucks gas up through the jet and then

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.260 
it sucks gas up through the jet and then
out<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.300> here<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.720> sends<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.080> through<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> two

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
out of here it sends it through the two

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.930 
out of here it sends it through the two

slide<00:03:23.810> comes<00:03:24.800> down<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:27.910> blocks<00:03:28.910> all<00:03:29.150> air<00:03:29.390> from

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
slide comes down and blocks all air from

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.510 
slide comes down and blocks all air from
coming<00:03:29.900> through<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:30.920> helps<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.340> start

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
coming through that this helps it start

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.580 
coming through that this helps it start
up<00:03:31.730> when<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.390> engine<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.750> cold<00:03:33.020> or<00:03:33.380> when<00:03:33.500> it

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
up when the engine is cold or when it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.010 
up when the engine is cold or when it
hasn't<00:03:33.770> been<00:03:33.980> run<00:03:34.250> yet

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
hasn't been run yet

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.110 
hasn't been run yet
which<00:03:36.020> it<00:03:36.170> allows<00:03:36.320> much<00:03:37.310> more<00:03:37.520> gas<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.970> pass

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
which it allows much more gas to pass

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.690 
which it allows much more gas to pass
through<00:03:38.480> which<00:03:38.840> as<00:03:39.080> is<00:03:39.350> much<00:03:40.070> easier<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.490> start

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
through which as is much easier to start

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.530 
through which as is much easier to start
up<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.590> that's<00:03:42.590> all<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.860> parts<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.540> small

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
up and that's all the parts to a small

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.990 
up and that's all the parts to a small
moped<00:03:44.960> carburetor
