want to get an early attack up so you

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.270 
want to get an early attack up so you

can push up to the stairs and get some
control<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:39.690> otherwise<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.260> can

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
control going because otherwise you can

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
control going because otherwise you can
