00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello dear towns here 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.139
 the herbal solution I was talking about 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.200
 one of the previous videos exactly through 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.440
 I prepared a week was very 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.779
 hot weather outside and as I said 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 his cooking nonsense depends on 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.560
 weather 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.320
 that is, if the weather stood colder 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.330
 then he is preparing from up to two weeks and here 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.650
 in a week virtually everything 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.450
 all nettle is completely dissolved 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.030
 Angelica also dissolved completely 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.210
 that is, it remains only here 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.320
 When did he come across this chicken? 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.379
 see the structure 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.649
 fiber is very poorly soluble then 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.660
 have it literally a little bit left 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.410
 the rest is all set 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.149
 added 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.660
 later whey and that's me 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.500
 call so nutrient broth in 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.070
 which part is present elements 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.970
 which plants can assimilate right away 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.509
 most of the elements are in the floor 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.470
 decomposed state is you see 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:29.700
 what color is he talking to him 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.220
 dark green here and now his pair 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.500
 apply it very well apply it 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.720
 after we have processed our kind 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.799
 the area where we want to apply it 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.380
 Travian and infusion or solution this one 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.570
 that's where we plot worked shout 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.369
 as I say it again such 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.710
 nutrient broth that will 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.450
 eat just the bacteria that we 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.509
 have made 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:02.580
 exactly when you wore a catchy 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:06.680
 literally so recently I and min 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.710
 and introduced to the h Here you its new greenhouses 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.700
 now you can still fully feed 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.430
 by this 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 where there is a lot of nutritious broth 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.290
 all kinds 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.970
 batteries for just bacteria 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.360
 is in the decomposed 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.790
 see how much and how it 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.920
 apply that is i'm here on the bucket 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:36.570
 adding two such buckets they are somewhere co2 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:43.640
 while liter powder is obtained somewhere 1 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.640
 to 5 like this maybe one to four and 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.050
 so you can use a little bucket 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.489
 more 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.340
 inside the curtain and therefore the porridge I 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.340
 add a bush 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.730
 a tomato or person it is desirable that they 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.770
 already a little bit of course not a little bit 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:16.970
 rooted here I have here so I 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:16.970
 I see greenhouses will be pits 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:30.349
 Subscriber yes yes here it was brought in 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.530
 h now we and so and che still under the root 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.660
 have opened 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.489
 was what to eat here because here 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.510
 mummed only while sawdust 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:45.600
 no compost these 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:49.489
 there was no food for our 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.489
 there may be enough bacteria here 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:03.610
 in this way now I will feed 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.160
 both greenhouses this solution 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.580
 pretty good then you 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.400
 You will see how it will affect the growth of these 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.720
 tomatoes just in this greenhouse before 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.720
 see you soon
