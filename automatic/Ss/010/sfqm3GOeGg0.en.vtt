00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.670
 everyone loves you all again 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.650
 even since I have you the second part 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.420
 my flu school series for you and 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.790
 Although I always had in the first part 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.989
 shown you how you four types your 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.670
 school things really cool right 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.200
 can beautify the video you can find 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.390
 again and in the infobox 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.489
 and today I thought about it 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.230
 but directly much more motivated if the 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.450
 desk is a bit tidier 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.129
 and a bit more organized and 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.010
 That's why there is again today 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.020
 43 ideas like your desk easy 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.150
 can organize really well and also 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.980
 I can decorate it beautifully 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.019
 whole today but not alone but 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.600
 together with dear Julia from the canal 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.220
 julia bloody she also has many 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.870
 ideas for you and you again 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.640
 falls here and in the infobox linked 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.200
 and after the end of the video but now 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.840
 I do not want to continue to talk to you 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.640
 but billing going on so collecting writes 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.350
 One books ahead of you all the time 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.180
 certainly keeps things provided it has 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.340
 and as you can see, the often one 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.710
 little embellishment necessary because of that 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.720
 First of all we show this cool one 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.370
 you can do penholder there you can 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.299
 really perfect your very favorite 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.799
 put the donor in the box 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.840
 so you can always quite fast 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.399
 At hand, you simply need it 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.130
 just a normal picture frame 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.899
 my sits by poco for two euros 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.130
 I think that was the one and then another 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.570
 something thicker piece of fabric first 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.549
 you take this inside part of the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.619
 picture frame house and left on the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.840
 piece of fabric and then the whole 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.880
 Once around out so that you in the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.950
 cut out and then you can cut 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.619
 useless and often a hot sole 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.539
 or any other glue I have 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.179
 now my hot glue gun from amazon 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.070
 this super super cheap and super good 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.289
 they can think again purely in the inbox 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.060
 we just link that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.280
 cut out has piece of fabric behind 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.930
 on the picture frame on it and then puts 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.350
 her another piece of cloth there 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.180
 on it to see where you like the the 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.180
 wanted to say that bag 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.530
 that just cuts them out roughly and 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.030
 then she could just open up 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.370
 glue the other piece of fabric on it and 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.650
 after that, it was simply the protruding one 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.129
 At the end rear and just fight her 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.329
 again back firmly I have the 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.159
 Picture frame exercise us far 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.239
 sprayed so he is white with me 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.310
 and gold 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.310
 if her husband is noticed 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.600
 and the second is this sweet folder 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.440
 keeping my god i love the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.300
 total 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.040
 he just needs everything 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.200
 baked your choice 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.780
 In addition, then also wrapping paper in 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.530
 etting or a normal coli one 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.630
 scissors tape and joschi tape as well 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.340
 First you take you block the the her 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.830
 after that, put it in the milk carton 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.530
 volt and just call her how far you are 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.940
 wanted to have a look out in the end 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.200
 then you mark yourself here and 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.670
 Just turn the carton off and on 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.190
 then you put your carton on that 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.230
 Wrapping paper of your choice and showing it 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.740
 just around it so you then 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.470
 afterwards m2 cuts out large parts and 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.360
 two side panels and I can get you up 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.340
 give the tip in the front 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.260
 So the fore and aft part completely 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.180
 exactly to be exact and the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.400
 side panels as seen here 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.800
 to survive and I would 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.390
 then the side parts stick first 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.550
 The whole thing looks pretty nice 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.260
 Neat and I have the whole thing 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.780
 simply made with children's films because 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.600
 I find the simplest and make it 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.210
 always so little rolls or rolls 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.800
 or whatever the child and there 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.020
 Can you super awesome that 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.770
 Just put it on and wrap it up 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.770
 Press firmly 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.470
 and because of me at the top then 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.480
 I did not like it that much 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.430
 just around it still he marion whole 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.430
 glued long logitech strips 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.210
 Books 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.210
 so wise 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.770
 and I'll show you this cool one 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.780
 simply make your own canvas 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.210
 and I can I can promise the 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.530
 It's so much fun for everyone 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.090
 try a case 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.090
 you just need one 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.740
 canvas and acrylic paint I have mine 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.260
 The canvas and the handle are out now 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.230
 the fab shop and then another 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.460
 brush and also some sticky tape 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.350
 that does not have to look nice now 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.330
 but just one or just one 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.460
 tesafilm and then you can already 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.650
 you start taking ours 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.290
 canvas and now really sticks 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.480
 quite simply you do not believe it with that 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.760
 Tape any stripes on it 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.530
 So he can really some pattern 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.350
 you can be really creative 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.820
 and then I started the 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.890
 I wanted to mix color 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.130
 like rose and that's why I have 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.780
 logically red and white mixed and 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.020
 when the whole thing is dried cited 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.970
 strips off and kicked you 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.590
 this mega cool pattern was what 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.020
 really different with everyone 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.880
 will look like and then you still need 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.890
 your craft skills below 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.540
 evidence and a nail in the 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.040
 hit wall and then he could 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.040
 screen hangs 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.930
 And last thing is these sweet ones 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.089
 stifter glasses and i think they see it 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.949
 really mega professional from me 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.259
 find the look like bought and 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.999
 booked just like that 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.469
 spray paint in different colors i 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:02.809
 I like to link in mine 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.729
 the infobox or you are also fulfilling 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:06.499
 have and then paint the whole thing just 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.460
 In addition, then any glasses 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.009
 your choice 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.349
 logitech and any circle around 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.580
 sticker so that does not matter how that 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:16.159
 look at the main thing you have 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.569
 any round stickers i have to 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.639
 example the silver always made by 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.620
 me on the bright transparent glass 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.569
 this round sticker stuck on it 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.029
 and then just with the spray paint 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.710
 sprayed on it after all 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:31.639
 dried then pulled me off 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.050
 and then I had this glass and at 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.669
 the white I have made it similar 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.039
 and I just have it with logitech 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.770
 then stick on the whole thing 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.509
 sprayed and then strips peeled off and 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.099
 there it was then transparent and 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.469
 Do not be surprised why I do not 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.909
 filmed my camera turned me on 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:50.080
 somehow not the day and unfortunately 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.080
 not recorded 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:55.199
 if i have a thing from the video 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:57.179
 I liked it with a thumb 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.799
 up for the video then I know 

00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:00.719
 namely that I have more videos of this kind 

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:01.439
 and generally more back to school videos 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:03.779
 to turn 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:06.089
 or he sends me a book a photo 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:08.369
 that would of course be best on twitter 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:11.309
 instagram and facebook with the hashtag 

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:12.299
 nobility back to school projects and then 

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:14.999
 I will really try too 

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:16.469
 as many photos to liken also 

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:18.269
