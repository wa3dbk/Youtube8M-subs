00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi my name is kimbo and in this video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.010
 I want to show you that the same inside 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.179
 of a small town can serve good 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.170
 coffee look we are here in a village of 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 catalonia we are in degas and here in this 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.930
 town mini town we have a friend who 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.600
 has opened a cafe with his 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.660
 girlfriend this cafeteria is a coffee shop 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.570
 that from here back that is designed 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.450
 by the previous owner they have caught 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.030
 this cafeteria has been remodeled a bit 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.180
 and you have given your character your letter of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.969
 coffees and their cakes then together 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.149
 this couple is getting that inside 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.829
 of the people do something different because 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.530
 difference what I'm learning here 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.230
 is when you serve as a letter of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.329
 normal coffees 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.300
 everyone will love when I entered 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.520
 first time in your cafe all the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.980
 world is going to want a coffee that is so 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.190
 used to take two speed in what 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.650
 be the cut they ask for the cappuccino they ask 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.140
 what they would normally ask for when 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.690
 they enter a place to have a coffee or 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.110
 all what ricky has done is very 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.270
 smart has created a letter with this 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.700
 range of normal coffees that are 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.220
 used and then a range of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.590
 specialty coffees all coffees 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.649
 specials like people are not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.990
 used to this you do not have to 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.390
 first time they enter start selling 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.190
 these cafes because the casino is possible 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.490
 you have to offer first what they are 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.220
 accustomed to the same price that they are 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.500
 accustomed but much better quality and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.890
 the ricky was telling me that 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.440
 offers the letter to be able to say look if 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.649
 you want to look for next time what 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.120
 type of coffee you want to try what 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.260
 type of coffee 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.960
 we have more and what types you can good 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.790
 try next time then what has 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.170
 fact is to create a range of coffees 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.200
 specials that is a more exclusive range 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.320
 more top a little more expensive but what 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.410
 does is with this range the people are 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.080
 wanting also something special when 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.180
 come here then when you come to 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.060
 have a coffee or you are taking a 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.680
 coffee to have a shot of caffeine but 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.070
 in this kind of pretty business 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.520
 as you see from here back the idea is to come 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:35.820
 with friends or family for a drink 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.400
 in a quiet moment in the afternoon by 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.740
 example we just got to 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.830
 5 o'clock in the afternoon there was no one because 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.100
 they opened at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.280
 Less than half an hour has filled this 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.270
 site as you see here back then the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.240
 public is wanting something differential 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.459
 then he will also ask sometime 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.000
 some special coffee you have in the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.280
 letter 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.560
 then if you pass here through the town of 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.800
 gas I invite you to come to this 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.630
 cafeteria in the main street does not have 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.560
 loss because the town is also not 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.740
 big but good that was a bit my 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.330
 advice today if it is possible to get 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:24.420
 make good coffee in a village and not 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.030
