 propagated around the world in expert mode 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.860
 we think to defend with claw and teeth the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.960
 planet since it is our style more 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.910
 violent the point is to see the dogfish 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.100
 yours, the battle will end 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.229
 your sexes in matches by foundations 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.200
 I chase you racing like the wind if you 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.210
 You will pull the tails of a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.920
 I'm thirsty and you can not 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.229
 kill us since we are all dead 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.930

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.600
 body you will never escape from me since 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.080
