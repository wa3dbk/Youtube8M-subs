00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
when I did what Kyle watched it before I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.780 
when I did what Kyle watched it before I
started<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.650> wave<00:02:45.799> pattern<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.370> will<00:02:46.610> say<00:02:46.760> I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
started the wave pattern I will say I

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.270 
started the wave pattern I will say I
did<00:02:46.970> not<00:02:47.450> lose<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.110> that's<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.920> first
