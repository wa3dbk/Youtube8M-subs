00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.440
 good people today the video is about cleaning 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.490
 the aquarium on how to do this cleaning 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.759
 background of this substrate cleaning I think 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.949
 It is one of the most important leagues that have 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.789
 thereafter the partial exchange of water is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.800
 I use this funk that was bought 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.920
 but it can be a homemade siphon as well 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.210
 You can use a 600 ml bottle 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 will 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.090
 I put the end of it a way already 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.550
 go straight here in the yard then not 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.680
 I need to use buckets to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.320
 to make this civil exchange the gang is a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.469
 little big 500 liters 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.149
 then to make the partial water exchange 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.899
 in 50 buckets 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 So you're kind of out of your hands for me. 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.550
 so I had this hose been dead 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.320
 in an apartment with a hose 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.500
 of these ten meters and places it directly in the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.630
 Bathroom drain in shower drain 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.549
 works also goes straight to the water 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.909
 dirty though they do not run out there so 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.530
 simply put it here if it was in the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.180
 bathtub 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.310
 It's not much of a secret for you to stay. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.310
 carrying buckets to do the cleaning 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.580
 put funk on the bottom is the very 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:36.000
 momentum will no longer remove the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:44.750
 dirt then it's gone then again 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:50.940
 On the side he does all the work on his own 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 I do half the aquarium today from here. 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.649
 15 days 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.790
 I do the other half because I do not 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.070
 I want to remove all this dirt that is 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.990
 deep down I want to leave a little 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.960
 because they are the bacteria are 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.679
 working for me, I alone 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.720
 I can not leave much dirt on this 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.320
 end up leaving a lot of dirt under the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.660
 levels of ammonia at last that ends 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.239
 being harmful to fish 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.959
 then every 15 days I make half of the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.900
 block 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.950
 Today I'm doing this half from here. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.630
 15 days I'll do the other half, okay? 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.010
 I hope to be helping you with video there. 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.780
 remembering that if you do not have that money 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.590
 left to buy a siphon from this 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.670
 cost of $ 20 tafas with bottles of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:50.430
 coca-cola cuts the bottom cuts the bottom 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:54.450
 she is putting it on the tip where the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.160
 is very functional there was being 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.160
 the same as the one bought here
