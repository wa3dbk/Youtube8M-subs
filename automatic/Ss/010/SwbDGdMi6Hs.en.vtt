00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.460 

okay<00:00:02.490> so<00:00:02.550> today<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.120> installed<00:00:03.899> new<00:00:04.470> t8<00:00:05.100> LED

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
okay so today I installed new t8 LED

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.220 
okay so today I installed new t8 LED
fluorescent<00:00:07.470> lights<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:09.990> old

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
fluorescent lights in the old

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.799 
fluorescent lights in the old
fluorescent<00:00:10.679> fixture<00:00:11.370> these<00:00:12.300> new<00:00:12.509> ones<00:00:12.660> are

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
fluorescent fixture these new ones are

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.189 
fluorescent fixture these new ones are
22<00:00:13.230> watts<00:00:13.469> instead<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.580> 40<00:00:15.269> watts<00:00:15.450> which<00:00:16.170> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
22 watts instead of 40 watts which is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.620 
22 watts instead of 40 watts which is
what<00:00:16.470> they<00:00:16.560> replace<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.220> fluorescent<00:00:17.730> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
what they replace the fluorescent and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.130 
what they replace the fluorescent and
again<00:00:18.840> these<00:00:18.990> are<00:00:19.140> LED<00:00:19.740> they're<00:00:20.039> 5000<00:00:20.730> Kelvin

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
again these are LED they're 5000 Kelvin

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.320 
again these are LED they're 5000 Kelvin
brightness<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.130> 5000<00:00:23.760> Kelvin<00:00:24.060> color

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
brightness so or 5000 Kelvin color

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240 
brightness so or 5000 Kelvin color
temperature<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.680> color

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
temperature so it's the color

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.099 
temperature so it's the color
temperature<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.760> daylight<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.750> let<00:00:27.930> me<00:00:28.019> go

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
temperature of daylight so let me go

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.509 
temperature of daylight so let me go
ahead<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.410> turn<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:28.949> I've<00:00:29.310> done

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
ahead and turn this one on I've done

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.919 
ahead and turn this one on I've done
this<00:00:29.699> fixture<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.330> I've<00:00:30.449> left<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> other

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
this fixture but I've left the other

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.170 
this fixture but I've left the other
fixture<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.920> old<00:00:32.040> fluorescent<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> kind

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
fixture the old fluorescent just to kind

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.549 
fixture the old fluorescent just to kind
of<00:00:33.210> compare<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.660> brightness<00:00:34.079> between<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
of compare the brightness between the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.680 
of compare the brightness between the
two<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.640> let<00:00:35.820> me<00:00:35.910> turn<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> lights<00:00:36.480> here

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
two so let me turn on the lights here

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
two so let me turn on the lights here
real<00:00:36.870> quick<00:00:39.260> okay<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.040> LEDs

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
real quick okay as you can see the LEDs

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
real quick okay as you can see the LEDs
take<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.000> second<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> turn<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.290> once<00:00:43.469> they

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
take a second to turn on but once they

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.529 
take a second to turn on but once they
turn<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.829> their<00:00:44.340> instant<00:00:44.760> on

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
turn on their instant on

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.479 
turn on their instant on
everything's<00:00:46.260> self-contained<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
everything's self-contained in the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.729 
everything's self-contained in the
driver<00:00:47.760> which<00:00:48.480> else<00:00:48.750> I'll<00:00:49.110> show<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.530> little

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
driver which else I'll show you a little

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
driver which else I'll show you a little
later<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.180> are<00:00:51.329> much

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
later but as you can see these are much

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900 
later but as you can see these are much
much<00:00:52.170> brighter<00:00:52.500> than<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.340> fluorescent

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
much brighter than the fluorescent

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.250 
much brighter than the fluorescent
lights<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.809> were<00:00:54.870> placed<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> hold<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.140> one

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
lights they were placed so hold on one

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.400 
lights they were placed so hold on one
second<00:00:58.620> let<00:00:58.649> me<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.340> close<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> them

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
second let me get up close to them

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.240 
second let me get up close to them
hopefully<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.739> ipod<00:01:02.160> will<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.760> hear<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:04.250> okay

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
hopefully my ipod will just hear it okay

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.469 
hopefully my ipod will just hear it okay
so<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.489> don't<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.939> see<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.240> but

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
so I don't know if you can see it but

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.030 
so I don't know if you can see it but
there<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.250> 192<00:01:08.250> individual<00:01:09.150> LED<00:01:09.710> lights<00:01:10.710> in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
there are 192 individual LED lights in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
there are 192 individual LED lights in
these<00:01:11.220> these<00:01:12.090> usually<00:01:12.330> come<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.810> frosted

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
these these usually come with frosted

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.960 
these these usually come with frosted
covers<00:01:13.619> buy<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.610> throw<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.909> as

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
covers buy one of this is to throw it as

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
covers buy one of this is to throw it as
much<00:01:15.210> light<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.840> bright<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.200> possible

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
much light and be as bright as possible

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
much light and be as bright as possible
so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> order<00:01:17.189> these<00:01:17.340> clear<00:01:17.759> from<00:01:18.630> China<00:01:19.049> light

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so I order these clear from China light

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.570 
so I order these clear from China light
sky<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.070> light<00:01:20.250> sky<00:01:20.490> China<00:01:21.950> again<00:01:22.950> these<00:01:23.159> are

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
sky or light sky China again these are

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.140 
sky or light sky China again these are
you<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.479> modify<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> ballast<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.150> this

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you have to modify the ballast so this

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.510 
you have to modify the ballast so this
side<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.960> made<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.979> side<00:01:29.189> positive<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:31.520> this

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
side I made this side positive and this

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
side I made this side positive and this
side<00:01:32.759> negative<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.049> straight

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
side negative and it's just straight

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.140 
side negative and it's just straight
wired<00:01:34.860> through<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.909> pull<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
wired through with you just pull the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
wired through with you just pull the
ballast<00:01:36.420> board<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> electronic

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
ballast board out of the electronic

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.649 
ballast board out of the electronic
ballast<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:37.920> um<00:01:39.680> let's<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.829> what<00:01:40.890> else<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.729> as

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
ballast out um let's see what else so as

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.480 
ballast out um let's see what else so as
you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:42.960> see<00:01:43.200> compared<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> incandescent

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you can see compared to the incandescent

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.190 
you can see compared to the incandescent
the<00:01:45.000> old<00:01:45.119> incandescent<00:01:45.360> light<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.960> there

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the old incandescent light up there

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.370 
the old incandescent light up there
these<00:01:46.770> are<00:01:47.119> 5000<00:01:48.119> Kelvin<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.259> are

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
these are 5000 Kelvin so they are

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.289 
these are 5000 Kelvin so they are
daylight<00:01:49.770> they're<00:01:49.979> very<00:01:50.250> very<00:01:50.729> bright<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
daylight they're very very bright and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.690 
daylight they're very very bright and
kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> make<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> old<00:01:52.170> bulbs<00:01:52.560> look<00:01:53.040> really

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
kind of make the old bulbs look really

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.270 
kind of make the old bulbs look really
bad<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> does<00:01:55.259> give<00:01:55.470> really<00:01:56.070> nice

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
bad and it does give really nice

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.999 
bad and it does give really nice
accurate<00:01:56.899> color<00:01:57.899> rendition<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.960> company<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
accurate color rendition so a company I

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.020 
accurate color rendition so a company I
bought<00:02:02.219> these<00:02:02.369> from<00:02:03.740> China<00:02:04.740> lights<00:02:05.040> guy<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
bought these from China lights guy and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.580 
bought these from China lights guy and
these<00:02:06.869> bulbs<00:02:07.320> cost<00:02:08.030> $17<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> piece<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:10.319> are
