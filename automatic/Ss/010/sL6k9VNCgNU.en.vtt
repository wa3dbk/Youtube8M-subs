00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650 

Hey<00:00:20.680> so<00:00:21.520> in<00:00:21.640> this<00:00:21.730> lesson<00:00:22.030> we're<00:00:22.390> going<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:22.600> be

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
Hey so in this lesson we're going to be

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.510 
Hey so in this lesson we're going to be
talking<00:00:22.930> about<00:00:23.020> the<00:00:23.590> legato<00:00:23.920> technique<00:00:24.160> and

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
talking about the legato technique and

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.480 
talking about the legato technique and
I'm<00:00:25.210> basically<00:00:26.110> that<00:00:26.380> involves<00:00:26.890> two

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
I'm basically that involves two

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.610 
I'm basically that involves two
techniques<00:00:28.450> put<00:00:28.750> together<00:00:28.930> and<00:00:29.440> they're

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:29.620 
techniques put together and they're

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.519 
techniques put together and they're
called<00:00:29.830> hammer-ons<00:00:30.460> and<00:00:30.760> pull-offs<00:00:31.500> now<00:00:32.500> I

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
called hammer-ons and pull-offs now I

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.930 
called hammer-ons and pull-offs now I
was<00:00:32.739> combining<00:00:33.250> hammer-ons<00:00:33.700> and<00:00:33.850> pull-offs

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
was combining hammer-ons and pull-offs

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.590 
was combining hammer-ons and pull-offs
on<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.570> G<00:00:35.230> major<00:00:35.500> scale<00:00:35.980> just<00:00:36.219> a<00:00:36.850> second<00:00:37.149> ago<00:00:37.270> and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
on a G major scale just a second ago and

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.169 
on a G major scale just a second ago and
I'm<00:00:37.960> it<00:00:38.440> gives<00:00:38.620> you<00:00:38.770> kind<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.100> nice<00:00:39.309> violini

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
I'm it gives you kind of a nice violini

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.509 
I'm it gives you kind of a nice violini
sound<00:00:40.510> as<00:00:40.660> opposed<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.109> a<00:00:41.379> sound<00:00:41.679> that's<00:00:42.249> going

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
sound as opposed to a sound that's going

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.040 
sound as opposed to a sound that's going
to<00:00:42.579> have<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.730> tack<00:00:43.059> on<00:00:43.239> every<00:00:43.539> note<00:00:43.719> like

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
to have a tack on every note like

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.529 
to have a tack on every note like
picking<00:00:44.440> every<00:00:44.710> note<00:00:44.859> so<00:00:45.370> let's<00:00:45.699> take<00:00:46.359> each

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
picking every note so let's take each

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:47.759 
picking every note so let's take each
one<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.870> those<00:00:46.960> techniques<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.530> turn

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
one of those techniques and turn

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.279 
one of those techniques and turn
hammer-ons<00:00:48.609> and<00:00:48.699> pull-offs<00:00:48.839> learn<00:00:49.839> each<00:00:50.019> one

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
hammer-ons and pull-offs learn each one

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.200 
hammer-ons and pull-offs learn each one
and<00:00:50.469> then<00:00:50.530> we'll<00:00:50.679> put<00:00:50.859> it<00:00:50.949> together<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.969> play<00:00:52.179> a

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
and then we'll put it together to play a

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.270 
and then we'll put it together to play a
G<00:00:52.600> major<00:00:52.780> scale<00:00:53.230> kind<00:00:53.499> of<00:00:53.620> like<00:00:53.739> what<00:00:53.920> I<00:00:53.949> did<00:00:54.039> at

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
G major scale kind of like what I did at

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.220 
G major scale kind of like what I did at
the<00:00:54.339> beginning<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:55.030> well<00:00:55.569> I'll<00:00:55.719> see<00:00:56.140> how<00:00:56.199> it

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
the beginning and well I'll see how it

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.880 
the beginning and well I'll see how it
goes<00:00:56.350> from<00:00:56.530> there

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
goes from there

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.410 
goes from there
so<00:00:57.159> the<00:00:57.339> first<00:00:57.550> thing<00:00:57.730> we're<00:00:57.850> going<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.030> do<00:00:58.210> is

so the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.139 
so the first thing we're going to do is
learn<00:00:59.050> how<00:00:59.109> to<00:00:59.289> hammer<00:00:59.589> on<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.159> this<00:01:00.879> real

it<00:01:19.380> sounds<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.270> should

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
it sounds like what it is and I should

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.870 
it sounds like what it is and I should
have<00:01:21.660> a<00:01:21.720> good<00:01:22.050> solid<00:01:22.800> sound<00:01:23.250> from<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.670> you

have a good solid sound from that you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.360 
have a good solid sound from that you
don't<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.270> too<00:01:24.450> soft

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
don't want it too soft

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.100 
don't want it too soft
or<00:01:26.370> you<00:01:26.520> won't<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> good<00:01:27.570> tone<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.990> don't

want<00:01:28.230> it<00:01:28.290> too<00:01:28.380> hard<00:01:28.620> because<00:01:29.430> you'll<00:01:29.640> stress

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
want it too hard because you'll stress

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.250 
want it too hard because you'll stress
yourself<00:01:29.910> out<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.570> want<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.810> relaxed<00:01:31.200> you

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
yourself out you want to be relaxed you

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.060 
yourself out you want to be relaxed you
want<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.440> have<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.770> nice<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.190> solid<00:01:32.370> tone

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.890 

so<00:01:37.700> once<00:01:37.850> we<00:01:37.970> have<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.240> first<00:01:38.450> hammer<00:01:38.720> on

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
so once we have that first hammer on

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.140 
so once we have that first hammer on
right<00:01:39.080> there<00:01:39.320> but<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.010> do<00:01:40.160> another<00:01:40.580> hammer<00:01:40.910> on

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
right there but to do another hammer on

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.660 
right there but to do another hammer on
on<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.930> seventh<00:01:42.320> fret<00:01:42.500> with<00:01:43.160> our<00:01:43.280> pinkie

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
on to the seventh fret with our pinkie

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.030 
on to the seventh fret with our pinkie
we're<00:01:44.540> going<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.750> come<00:01:44.930> hit<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:45.380> first<00:01:45.740> note

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
we're going to come hit this first note

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.109 
we're going to come hit this first note
again<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.970> run

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.770 

so<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.810> together

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.020 

okay<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:57.740> we've<00:01:57.950> got<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.220> first<00:01:58.430> little<00:01:58.880> bit

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
okay so we've got the first little bit

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.140 
okay so we've got the first little bit
down<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.690> hem<00:01:59.900> rods<00:02:00.140> now<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.800> pull<00:02:01.070> offs<00:02:01.310> are<00:02:01.700> a

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
down to hem rods now the pull offs are a

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.430 
down to hem rods now the pull offs are a
bit<00:02:02.510> different<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.050> they're<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> bit<00:02:03.410> more

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
bit different and they're a bit more

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.320 
bit different and they're a bit more
difficult<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.190> get<00:02:04.400> started<00:02:04.880> with<00:02:05.000> right<00:02:05.210> off

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
difficult to get started with right off

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.480 
difficult to get started with right off
the<00:02:05.479> bat<00:02:05.690> but<00:02:06.380> don't<00:02:06.590> worry<00:02:06.800> after<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.250> few<00:02:07.400> days

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
the bat but don't worry after a few days

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.620 
the bat but don't worry after a few days
of<00:02:07.580> practicing<00:02:08.030> you'll<00:02:08.179> probably<00:02:08.300> get<00:02:08.539> it

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
of practicing you'll probably get it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.690 
of practicing you'll probably get it
done<00:02:08.780> just<00:02:08.810> fine<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.979> let's<00:02:10.220> start<00:02:10.460> with<00:02:10.550> our

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
done just fine so let's start with our

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.630 
done just fine so let's start with our
pinky<00:02:11.090> up<00:02:11.270> here<00:02:12.170> at<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.890> top<00:02:13.100> note<00:02:13.310> we<00:02:13.520> were

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
pinky up here at the top note we were

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.790 
pinky up here at the top note we were
just<00:02:13.820> playing<00:02:14.060> what<00:02:15.050> you're<00:02:15.170> going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.320> do<00:02:15.530> is

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
just playing what you're going to do is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.220 
just playing what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:16.490> going<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.640> take<00:02:16.790> your<00:02:16.940> pinky<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.510> pull

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
you're going to take your pinky and pull

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.030 
you're going to take your pinky and pull
off<00:02:18.440> like<00:02:19.780> down<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.020> out<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.680> little<00:02:21.830> bit<00:02:22.010> so

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
off like down and out a little bit so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.890 
off like down and out a little bit so
basically<00:02:22.520> you're<00:02:22.730> picking<00:02:23.180> using<00:02:23.780> your

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
basically you're picking using your

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.230 
basically you're picking using your
finger<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.350> pick<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.709> string<00:02:25.120> instead<00:02:26.120> of

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
finger to pick the string instead of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.270 
finger to pick the string instead of
using<00:02:26.510> your<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.350> hand<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.740> pick<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.010> string

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
using your right hand to pick the string

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.979 
using your right hand to pick the string
and<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.940> sounds<00:02:29.209> like<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.900> your

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
and it sounds like this that your

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.010 
and it sounds like this that your
pinky's<00:02:30.320> on<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.590> seventh<00:02:30.890> fret

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
pinky's on the seventh fret

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.300 
pinky's on the seventh fret
men<00:02:32.170> off

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
men off

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.059 
men off
thousand<00:02:35.000> fifth<00:02:35.330> fret

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.220 

if<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.819> want<00:02:39.969> to<00:02:40.030> practice<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.480> just<00:02:41.019> that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
if you want to practice that just that

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.000 
if you want to practice that just that
you<00:02:41.409> can<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.680> do<00:02:41.769> that<00:02:41.829> all

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.770 

you

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.660 

then<00:02:48.990> you're<00:02:49.110> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.290> pull<00:02:49.530> off<00:02:49.770> with<00:02:50.400> your

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
then you're going to pull off with your

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.930 
then you're going to pull off with your
middle<00:02:50.910> finger<00:02:51.290> from<00:02:52.290> your<00:02:52.440> fifth<00:02:52.680> fret<00:02:52.950> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
middle finger from your fifth fret to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.210 
middle finger from your fifth fret to
the<00:02:54.060> third<00:02:54.270> fret

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.390 

you

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.590 

so<00:03:02.400> all<00:03:02.640> together<00:03:03.030> you're<00:03:03.180> gonna<00:03:03.270> have<00:03:03.450> to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
so all together you're gonna have to

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.030 
so all together you're gonna have to
pull<00:03:03.870> offs<00:03:04.020> in<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.320> row<00:03:04.440> if<00:03:04.620> you're<00:03:04.740> working

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
pull offs in a row if you're working

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.430 
pull offs in a row if you're working
your<00:03:05.190> way<00:03:05.220> down<00:03:05.340> from<00:03:05.730> your<00:03:05.880> seventh<00:03:06.330> fret<00:03:06.570> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
your way down from your seventh fret to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.750 
your way down from your seventh fret to
your<00:03:07.560> third<00:03:07.800> fret<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:08.340> pick<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.610> first<00:03:08.850> note

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.330 

you<00:03:12.599> can<00:03:12.780> link<00:03:13.260> those<00:03:13.470> together<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.010> practice

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
you can link those together and practice

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.789 
you can link those together and practice
all<00:03:14.489> three<00:03:14.730> notes<00:03:14.939> together<00:03:18.590> something<00:03:19.590> like

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
all three notes together something like

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.399 
all three notes together something like
that<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.519> we<00:03:20.579> put<00:03:20.760> them<00:03:20.879> all<00:03:20.970> together<00:03:21.409> and

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
that so if we put them all together and

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.410 
that so if we put them all together and
go<00:03:22.590> up<00:03:22.799> with<00:03:23.129> your<00:03:23.220> hammer<00:03:23.430> ons<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.879> down<00:03:24.239> with

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
go up with your hammer ons and down with

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.210 
go up with your hammer ons and down with
your<00:03:24.450> pull<00:03:24.689> offs<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.769> your<00:03:25.950> legato

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
your pull offs you have your legato

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.229 
your pull offs you have your legato
technique<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:27.150> start<00:03:27.629> with<00:03:27.720> your<00:03:27.780> hammer<00:03:27.959> ons

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
technique so start with your hammer ons

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.899 
technique so start with your hammer ons
they<00:03:30.239> come<00:03:30.450> back<00:03:30.599> down<00:03:30.750> with<00:03:30.870> your<00:03:30.900> pull<00:03:31.079> off

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
they come back down with your pull off

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.039 
they come back down with your pull off
if<00:03:32.909> you<00:03:33.030> link<00:03:33.269> them<00:03:33.329> together<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.810> sounds<00:03:33.900> like

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
if you link them together it sounds like

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.230 
if you link them together it sounds like
this

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.270 

so<00:03:38.240> for<00:03:38.900> an<00:03:38.959> application<00:03:39.380> for<00:03:39.800> this<00:03:39.920> technique

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
so for an application for this technique

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.800 
so for an application for this technique
we're<00:03:40.490> going<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.670> learn<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:41.000> shape<00:03:41.270> for<00:03:41.480> our<00:03:41.630> G

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
we're going to learn a shape for our G

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.720 
we're going to learn a shape for our G
Major<00:03:42.050> scale<00:03:42.170> that's<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:43.069> little<00:03:43.220> bit<00:03:43.370> longer

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
Major scale that's a little bit longer

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.820 
Major scale that's a little bit longer
than<00:03:44.270> um<00:03:44.450> probably<00:03:45.110> maybe<00:03:45.260> some<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.709> G

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
than um probably maybe some of the G

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.650 
than um probably maybe some of the G
scales<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:46.280> you've<00:03:46.370> seen<00:03:46.550> in<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.790> past<00:03:47.000> but<00:03:47.510> it

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
scales so you've seen in the past but it

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.240 
scales so you've seen in the past but it
will<00:03:47.720> start<00:03:47.989> with<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.380> shape<00:03:48.680> on<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.040> first

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
will start with that shape on the first

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.870 
will start with that shape on the first
on<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.730> sixth<00:03:50.390> string<00:03:51.370> move<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.640> next

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
on the sixth string move to the next

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.900 
on the sixth string move to the next
string<00:03:53.090> do<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.870> exact<00:03:54.350> same<00:03:54.380> thing<00:03:54.950> with<00:03:55.819> your

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
string do the exact same thing with your

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.110 
string do the exact same thing with your
energy<00:03:56.300> third<00:03:57.140> fret<00:03:57.580> middle<00:03:58.580> finger<00:03:58.880> on<00:03:59.060> the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
energy third fret middle finger on the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.470 
energy third fret middle finger on the
fifth<00:03:59.630> fret<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.400> then<00:04:01.400> your<00:04:01.819> pinky<00:04:02.000> finger<00:04:02.150> on

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
fifth fret and then your pinky finger on

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.420 
fifth fret and then your pinky finger on
the<00:04:02.569> seventh<00:04:02.870> fret<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.500> those<00:04:03.980> two<00:04:04.160> strings

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
the seventh fret so those two strings

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.610 
the seventh fret so those two strings
together<00:04:04.550> sound<00:04:04.910> like<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:09.110> next<00:04:09.410> string

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
together sound like this the next string

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
together sound like this the next string
is<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.769> little<00:04:09.860> bit<00:04:10.130> different<00:04:10.430> you're<00:04:10.519> going

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
is a little bit different you're going

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.250 
is a little bit different you're going
to<00:04:10.700> start<00:04:11.030> on<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.360> fourth<00:04:11.630> fret<00:04:11.810> with<00:04:12.230> the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
to start on the fourth fret with the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.770 
to start on the fourth fret with the
index<00:04:12.590> finger<00:04:13.120> middle<00:04:14.120> finger<00:04:14.300> is<00:04:14.540> going<00:04:14.750> to

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
index finger middle finger is going to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.719 
index finger middle finger is going to
grab<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.110> fifth<00:04:15.350> fret<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.799> your<00:04:16.340> pinky<00:04:16.400> is

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
grab the fifth fret and your pinky is

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
going to be because the thicker strings

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.530 
going to be because the thicker strings
are<00:06:28.280> harder<00:06:28.550> to<00:06:28.580> get<00:06:28.850> a<00:06:28.910> good<00:06:29.240> little
