00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.599
 we go there the room and the bodies express themselves 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.429
 freely without any help on time 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.049
 had trouble with betting 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.740
 except that it's 96 in virtual 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.279

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.679
 completely ouf it's to defend our 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.930
 Belgian listeners and February town halls 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.980
 cannes luis and yes he was during the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.930
 cannes festival I told him yes 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.059
 cannes festival the golden palm all a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.440
 symbol this attachment to the golden palm 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.640
 since after that you liked 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.989
 recruit players who had 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 palms instead of feet and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.920
 the thickness little by little tribute to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.809
 that time and even if we can say 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 that related to these rules and gabriel in the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.890
 he had palms the mayor's hall acer his 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.660
 gabriel baton enzo yes if he was 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.859
 disappointing for you because you see everything 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 what terry his lands and palm 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.119
 poutine or editorial and a boat 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.280
 it's me who says it's not you 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 no it's not me it's a julien 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.790
 cazarre his friend daniel kennedy and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.189
 llacer I think it's tarantino the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.409
 dardenne brothers at the page level 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.600
 but good a magnificent of the iso denisot 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.359
 he has good contact with nasser know when 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.740
 even a dude channel is not calais the 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.270
 only channel guy who can not the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 let al rai life is and night and 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.409
 especially we learned that he had done 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.090
 call to a marabout arts the guy he has 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.659
 uses a marabout to beat the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.399
 steaua bucarest barrage lavesque by 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.560
 against after he gets eliminated like 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.880
 a big dung in phase of hens 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.770
 like a badger and there is no 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.349
 beautiful summer marabouts where the marabout had 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.759
 gone can not not certainly eminent 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:47.349
 and yes that's because I remind you 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.569
 that monaco he had no marabout but 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.799
 he had shot henry trezeguet giuly be 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.569
 their semifinal installed there ok 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.310
 maybe it was better to recruit 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.049
 good players rather than a marabout 1 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.090
 finally good obviously no but wait 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.679
 super technique to recruit a marabout 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.939
 to play against a wooden team that 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.409
 comes from the far end of Romania going 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.299
 because I'm going to tell you something 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.409
 may be calling a marabout for 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.659
 see if Germany can beat 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.280
 gibraltar in hen I tell myself that would be 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.200
 not bad in the scam genre 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.819
 I will begin to believe in the marabout 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.049
 when there is an African team that will go 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.819
 in France but World Cup Final 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.109
 to Africa are not even able all 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.480
 the marabouts of afrik to make succeed 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:22.150
 a gian asamoah peno so excuse me 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.500
 so here is I wish I would like 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.470
 end by marseille 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.209
 Marseille yes the fact that right buggery 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.209
 of lead shots in france football 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.829
 and the fund that we learn just less 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.639
 strong that gignac gignac stronger than that 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.620
 you imbued France and the girls is 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.450
 cool or kim and thiago silva almond 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.430
 payet who has a pastor in each leg 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.139
 and next to mandanda sirigu this is the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.700
 venus of milo and thomas they would do 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.440
 pass lukasz for the reincarnation of a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.700
 place of towers and valves oc yes but the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.200
 steeple of the good mother it is more 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.549
 high that the eiffel tower the district of 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.470
 basket it is rather here that the fields 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.910
 elysÃ©es the om shop was over 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.380
 turnover than the galleries 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.519
 lafayette and jean claude gaudin is more 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.620
 younger and more sexy candidates even 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.910
 a string of course obviously marion 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.950
 cotillard she had an Oscar for what 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.040
 for amo but not for taxi to ithaque 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.900
 if the obviously 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.060
 finally I think that the facts via the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.849
 sahara or fight to annoy a poll not 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.189
 but I have the impression that it will sound 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.280
 the security hole the ozone layer and 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.590
 Angela Merkel finally short we crack 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.500
 I cracked and now will thank you sir 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.500
 down arms at school
