00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello everyone today I bring you a new 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.310
 tutorial on instagram improved because 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.590
 in the latest instagram versions 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.210
 It gave a lot of problems and did not allow 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.580
 upload the photos since the 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.600
 program half -way through his life 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.610
 then I will do the test of what 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.480
 it used to happen and that's when we went up 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.700
 a photo in the most modern version of 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.910
 instagram where you install by 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.860
 defect the program 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.230
 when uploading the photo 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.300
 when we took the next step he gives us 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.160
 an error and put it has stopped the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.780
 instagram application then what 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 we have to do so that this does not 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.350
 happen again we have to come 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.350
 to the play store 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.040
 that we can find it here 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.680
 let's look at the play store 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.300
 let's find instagram 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.530
 inside the play story what we are going to 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.569
 do is going to be disable the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.039
 automatic update and step 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.429
 next is going to be uninstall the 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.429
 application 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.200
 well once you have uninstalled the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 application 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.790
 let's go to the web and there is a page that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.790
 it's called 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.790
 uptodown 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 where can we download versions 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.120
 previous instagram and get 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.460
 solve the error 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.730
 when we enter here to the page we are going to 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.500
 watch 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.500
 a tab that puts Android 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.350
 and here we can look for the program 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.350
 instagram 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.960
 well we give to the application of 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.820
 instagram and let's see if we go down 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:07.500
 here we are going to have previous versions 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.500
 Well wait, it has moved a bit 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.170
 here it is we see that we have versions 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.000
 previous instagram we have all 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.980
 the versions 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.630
 if we give him to see more we see that they are 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.030
 all the versions that he has gone 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.900
 updating instagram i'm going to try 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.900
 with version 5.1 5.1 2 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.170
 we give here 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.620
 and let's see that directly only 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.620
 discharge 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.629
 if the download does not start good 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.269
 we squeeze here it already starts and the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.520
 browser that is very smart 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.600
 directly allows us to open it 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.230
 the file ap here with blocks tax 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.230
 then we accept 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.420
 I have some small problems like 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.420
 Internet a bit slow connection 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.250
 well once you have downloaded 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.750
 directly bluestacks 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.460
 opens opens the application 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.740
 and install it automatically you can 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.610
 try with other versions that appear 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.660
 here to capture if you want to me this is me 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.670
 has worked before so I'm going to 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.830
 reinstall so you can see the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.150
 example but you can try other 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.160
 surely you also work with 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.830
 any 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.250
 ok and now we're going to blues tax 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.020
 and within instagram 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.700
 when we access instagram we see that 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.950
 this version is already older nothing more 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.960
 you have to see the initial screen and now 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.830
 we will have to log in again and 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.830
 that closes the session 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.019
 and be careful when using the numbers of 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.409
 keyboard since those on the right do not 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.409
 do they work 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.819
 and once we're inside then we're going 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.069
 to follow the same process before 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.989
 is to give here to the photo and we will go to 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.940
 this site that is as if it were our 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.070
 gallery and we will choose the photo of 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.350
 windows then me here in the 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.360
 desk I have this picture that I'm going to 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.310
 try uploading to instagram with this 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.430
 older version to see if it's true 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.030
 that works well here, we have the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.760
 old version to frame as 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.820
 we want and I'm going to give 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.770
 next to crop the photo and 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.070
 we observe how the program does not 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.170
 stop 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.300
 It takes a little while to order the photo 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.610
 but good and yes we can apply 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.220
 the instagram characteristic filters 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.800
 and good as according to example I'm not going to 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.500
 go around and I'm going to apply this 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.720
 same and I give the following here it takes a 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.850
 little that is what is processing 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.470
 is the time it takes to process the 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.460
 image 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.080
 but let's see how psyche 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.080
 so let's upload the photo 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.170
 we see that it has taken a little bit but 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.220
 good in the end yes that it has obtained and 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.220
 here good we can add 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.050
 a tag and put angliru 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.150
 and I will directly give it to the 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.449
 next next 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.509
 if you want to share it good 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.400
 that is something unnecessary right now 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.309
 because it 's an example but we give the 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.240
 next and we observe that ending 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:44.030
 we already have our instagram photo 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.900
 basically this is the improved tutorial 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.900
 good 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.630
 when uploading the file but it is by subject of 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.710
 internet connection that I'm going a bit 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.000
 slow 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.000
 but let's hope it works that way 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.780
 so it does not leave me more at the last hour 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.090
 and we already have the photo and nothing you can 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.990
 try the different versions that 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.210
 we have instagram here version 5.1 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.530
 2 is the one that I used and it works if 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.160
 you want to try some more version 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:25.070
 modern I do not assure you that it works but 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.870
 you can try and comment it like that to see if 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.130
 it works and nothing this is the tutorial 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.550
 I hope you liked it and that 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:35.610
 really work for you this time 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.610
 instagram from our pc a greeting
