00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:11.550
 all bodies of nature all substances consist of 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:17.070
 smallest particles of molecules and atoms 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.460
 between which there is a gap of noise 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.609
 make sure you can spend a whole 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:30.330
 a series of experiments one of which we 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.740
 now show you we will pour a long 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.770
 glass tube 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.230
 two liquids tinted water and this one 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.390
 second clear lighter fluid 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 acetone 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 you see that the volume of these liquids is water 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:58.170
 and acetone equally first we pour in 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.010
 tube a heavier liquid I 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.010
 said someone 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.630
 and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:26.230
 above, we pour in the same tube 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.230
 acetone 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:49.220
 then i plug the phone 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.690
 The rubber stopper is tight enough and 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.360
 celebrate 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.360
 acetone level in the tube 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:11.130
 and now I will mix water with acetone for 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.130
 I'll tilt it up 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.520
 heavier water goes down and so 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.390
 tilting the tube into one then the other 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.390
 side i mix these two liquids 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.930
 here it turns out that during education 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.230
 solution when these liquids are mixed 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.230
 one another 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:58.020
 then the molecules of water and acetone are located 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:04.800
 more compactly packed denser 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:09.600
 than they were packed in separate 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.550
 liquids before mixing them more 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:22.080
 dense packing of molecules leads to 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:25.140
 that the total volume of the solution turns out to be 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.520
 pay less attention to 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.500
 the fluid level in the tube is now 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.580
 significantly less 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:40.020
 this total solution volume than the total 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:43.080
 volume of liquids before mixing them if 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.220
 mix 100 cubic centimeters of water 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.120
 and 100 cubic centimeters of acetone 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.610
 mix these liquids thoroughly then 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:59.989
 the volume of the resulting solution will not 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.989
 200 cubic centimeters and about 196
