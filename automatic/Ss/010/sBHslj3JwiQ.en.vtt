 the table that has all this material and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.690
 immaterial us before materials was it 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.790
 What you created then is if you use 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.940
 I do not know what to do for a video lesson. 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.160
 Tutorials Tutorials There is nothing in 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:45.130
 on top of it is a value you created 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.690
 because if everyone knows plage right to 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.180

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.500
 how to teach the viola by creating a cube 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.230
 You do not take any material from this 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.980
 who will play in it 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:06.900

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:28.520
 I'm going to take these materials out of here . 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.900
 letta they ready you will be able to create 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.939
 a material that you are going to tell today 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.919
 so you will have created an object 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:36.409
 you can create a material 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.449
 two clicks are ready here and 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.430
 will create a material and you did not see that 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.990
 the double team on top of that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.830
 ball and change 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.990
 here you can choose the way it is 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:54.139
 here you click the button 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:57.680
 right and choose until this donut has 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:02.139
 This one makes no difference to anything. 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:07.060
 I know it was signed but it's okay. 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.060
 interesting and george buck team miner 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.360
 made things clearer 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.500
 the elections can vote the milestone is flex 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:23.930
 how it turned out and how reflexes can 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:27.189
 adjust the reflex three feet 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.279
 I think it's better not mess Rio is and 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:34.400
 lighting the right material I go 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:37.060
 come back very softly and diffusion do not know 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.060
 very good that this 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.969
 diffused athael is melting of the material by 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.060
 example you can completely remove the 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.229
 color of it here you say that it moves more in the 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.050
 color of him right? 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:54.349
 our way so catch yourselves clear 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.009
 can take good and that the goal here ah 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:02.649
 OK 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:07.490
 this approach around us 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:11.659
 ready to test our cube of having 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.629
 It's very cool 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:17.089
 saw then is this just be in the click 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.490

 gameplay on the channel 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.669

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.450
