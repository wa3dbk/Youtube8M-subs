 hello to you dad and today u 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.379
 I again review applications and this time 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.950
 i will tell you the ibooks application and 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.590
 tell you how to download books there 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.010
 using the server to filibust. no so 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.529
 well let's get started first us 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.050
 potency two applications this is safari and 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.410
 and ebooks let's go in safari and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.590
 let's follow the link of filibust. no and there 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.170
 we will open a library from which you 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.100
 you can always download any books there 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 very much a book let's for example y 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:48.090
 look for a white beat black ear 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:51.149
 so white beat black ear and so here 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.129
 now we have found it and it opens to us 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.800
 some option we click on the name 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.020
 books and then the book itself opens 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.620
 now we have to choose the right one 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.300
 option 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.640
 choose epub format 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.390
 so then it will download and open 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.090
 wai books 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.119
 when we opened the wai books book itself 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.240
 us will open for the first time but then 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.790
 we will have to somehow choose from 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.159
 libraries here you see that now in 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.350
 ibooks can be read not only 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.380
 books but it will also be possible 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.990
 view pdf-files for example here 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 I have a German test here 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.439
 all this can be printed and sent 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 power prints all very easy also we 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:43.010
 we can also change themes in the app 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.720
 ibooks for example u change the theme from dark 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.730
 on lighter there add brightness 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 here and the world to see how I change the subject 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.720
