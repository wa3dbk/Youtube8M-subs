00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:10.420
 hello my name is light mireya martÃ­nez in 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.710
 my blog is www dot receives those of chile 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.730
 point 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:20.200
 blogspot.com today I want to teach you 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.919
 how to make rings consistent with the tags 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.550
 of the soda cans or rings of the 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.480
 cream 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.460
 now for that we're going to need 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.390
 different ring model we're going to 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.120
 use so there are others that are like this will give 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.490
 there are different models there are also 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.620
 some that already come in colors with 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.070
 different figurines 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.649
 and there are different colors I now 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.390
 whom I will explain there are 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.969
 some that are already ready and it's not 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.570
 I need to paint them but I'm going to 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:00.460
 show them that I here as usual 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.769
 do that I jump painting the then 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.940
 let's occupy the rings we're going to 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.890
 occupy the hooks 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.820
 for 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.090
 the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.490
 the hoops and I'm also occupying 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.630
 different 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.580
 enamels 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.130
 of nail to give it color 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.410
 something that is very important and the truth 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.140
 is the most important the stained glass varnish 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.200
 which is what is called 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.290
 the paint to prevent it from being discarded 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.700
 or that sticks once we have painted 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.280
 and it is already dry and sealed for example 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.970
 in this case of the latita that is 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.850
 complete here I made a hole 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.900
 before painting it to avoid scratching it 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.020
 once it has been painted later 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.790
 you have to manipulate it then now you 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.070
 we put the corresponding ring with 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.830
 the little hook there 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.340
 and what are we going to do 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.700
 I'm going to use a little flower that 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.860
 it comes in a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.230
 to take it out of a bracelet that no longer 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.590
 I used then 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.990
 how are you having a roll I'm going here 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.170
 to pass the thread 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.400
 adjust to the tip 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.400
 for this today 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 and whenever we want to do 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.160
 different bracelets with this we passed 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.880
 and then we will occupy a crochet 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.720
 let's tie here 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.330
 then I tied him now here we can 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.830
 use different things 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.410
 for example if I 'm going to use thread here 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.060
 but you can also make another type 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.860
 of material like without step ribbon and here 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.380
 I do not know how they say in each country but 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.120
 of this type of tape that are the most 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.500
 finite 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.330
 I will show you later at the end 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.860
 how are the rings like that so I'll 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.190
 marroquin 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.110
 in this case, because I paint only 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.610
 half because the other party is going 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.270
 covered with the thread then here 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.840
 we make low points 1 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.840
 two 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.209
 3 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.209
 4 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.540
 78 I'm used to here I always 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.750
 I make 8 for half as I go to 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.360
 place one if I sometimes put 3 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.270
 perlitas for example I put less 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.360
 point I make 8 points but I have to have 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:07.980
 the precaution of placing this towards 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.980
 go ahead and I do it like that and it happened here 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.100
 Car 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.290
 with the thread behind the little flowers 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.989
 because if it is not going to twist 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.180
 and there is the rosita in front and there 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.489
 I made a chain and I do the 7 that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.010
 missing 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.580
 there is 1 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.580
 two 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.770
 4 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.000
 with 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.889
 6 and 7 then we have completed the 8 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.889
 then cut 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.120
 and this is auctioned it 's that fast and 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.110
 easy to do this what more time 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.780
 take this is fixed and there we have the the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.920
 batter finished after we're going to finish 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.390
 the 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.120
 the 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.690
 life girl is I'm going to show you 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.550
 to be able to explain other details 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:14.510
 here in this case for example and to the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:19.460
 ring the ring this is so green now 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.650
 complete then I spent 3 beads or 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.170
 mostacillas chakira as you them 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:30.020
 call before I knitted 5 point pass one of the 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.870
 pearls after weaves a net mouth 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.110
 pass another pearl and so on but always 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.320
 there is a balance and in this case what 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.550
 I did with the tape is also the same 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.630
 color already 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.990
 so here it says I 3.1 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.810
 chakira mostacillas a single point 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.150
 a mostacilla even a point one 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.470
 Chakira beads and the other three 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.030
 points and so each one is looking according to the 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.970
 harmony 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.290
 This was golden I put one here 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:10.200
 and with what I did with a silk thread 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:14.550
 So it goes a long way to create and invent 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.670
 everything of what one has and the black 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.310
 that will never go out of style 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.370
 can I make a wide variety of 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.950
 I invite you to see the blog because I'm going to 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.430

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.470
 be able to show it to people in detail 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.140

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.390

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.640

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.070
