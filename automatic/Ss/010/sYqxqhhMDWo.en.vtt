00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
doing commentaries but I think that's I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.360 
doing commentaries but I think that's I
will<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.809> often<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.559> always<00:00:58.739> put<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> tips

that's why you guys subscribed but I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
that's why you guys subscribed but I
think<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.470> valuable<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.790> not

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
things bother me but they promised a big

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.209 
things bother me but they promised a big
patch<00:03:08.829> they<00:03:09.810> brought<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.959> out<00:03:11.049> these<00:03:11.319> 1.5<00:03:11.919> gigs

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.619 
patch they brought it out these 1.5 gigs
and<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.519> course<00:03:12.759> there'll<00:03:12.970> be<00:03:13.000> new<00:03:13.209> problems

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
and of course there'll be new problems

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.030 
and of course there'll be new problems
because<00:03:13.840> that's<00:03:14.019> what<00:03:14.169> happens<00:03:14.470> with<00:03:14.560> patches

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
because that's what happens with patches

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.649 
because that's what happens with patches
and<00:03:15.220> that's<00:03:15.340> why<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.549> need<00:03:15.819> so<00:03:15.849> many<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:16.509> them

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
and that's why you need so many of them

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.629 
and that's why you need so many of them
and<00:03:17.409> now<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.650> problem<00:03:17.949> is<00:03:20.069> suppression<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.400> I

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
and now the problem is suppression and I

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.699 
and now the problem is suppression and I
understand<00:03:22.269> that<00:03:22.479> it<00:03:22.629> is<00:03:22.659> an<00:03:23.049> overreaction

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
understand that it is an overreaction

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.099

don't want to put down but just I'm

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.960 
don't want to put down but just I'm

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
tired of it and the other thing I'm

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.610 
tired of it and the other thing I'm

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.749 
tired of it's not a glitch or anything
but<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.829> was<00:03:47.919> something<00:03:48.159> that<00:03:48.189> was<00:03:48.340> promised

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:48.759 
but it was something that was promised

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:50.759 
but it was something that was promised
before<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> game<00:03:49.299> even<00:03:49.329> came<00:03:49.780> out<00:03:49.959> his<00:03:50.560> voice

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
PCs we don't have it many people will

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.659 
PCs we don't have it many people will
say<00:03:58.629> but<00:03:59.019> I<00:03:59.199> don't<00:03:59.500> want<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.680> hear<00:03:59.799> whiny<00:04:00.159> kids

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
on the microphone and that's a valid

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.949 
on the microphone and that's a valid
concern<00:04:04.139> but<00:04:05.139> just<00:04:05.439> maybe<00:04:06.009> mute<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.609> mic

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:13.539 
that I think out of the negatives there

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.510 
that I think out of the negatives there
are<00:04:13.629> way<00:04:13.810> more<00:04:13.840> positive

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
are way more positive

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.220 
are way more positive

and I think it's something absolute was
promised<00:05:03.170> and<00:05:03.410> it<00:05:03.530> was<00:05:03.650> never<00:05:03.860> delivered<00:05:04.040> and

the<00:05:12.740> broken<00:05:13.630> parts<00:05:14.630> of<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.840> game<00:05:14.990> whether<00:05:15.290> it

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
the broken parts of the game whether it

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.780 
the broken parts of the game whether it
be<00:05:15.530> suppression<00:05:16.040> whether<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.340> be<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.460> dark

mean<00:05:17.030> you<00:05:17.510> name<00:05:17.690> it<00:05:17.930> it's<00:05:18.770> frustrating<00:05:19.720> so

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.470 
mean you name it it's frustrating so
here's<00:05:20.960> my<00:05:21.020> suggestion<00:05:22.240> this<00:05:23.240> model

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
here's my suggestion this model

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.420 
here's my suggestion this model
obviously<00:05:23.990> doesn't<00:05:24.290> work<00:05:24.440> because<00:05:24.680> I<00:05:25.010> if

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
obviously doesn't work because I if

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.280 
obviously doesn't work because I if
money<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.150> problem<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:26.960> is<00:05:27.110> why

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
money is the problem and that is why

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.250 
money is the problem and that is why
there<00:05:28.220> can't<00:05:28.520> be<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.700> bigger<00:05:28.940> support<00:05:29.720> team<00:05:29.930> for

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
there can't be a bigger support team for

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.760 
there can't be a bigger support team for
the<00:05:30.320> current<00:05:30.590> games<00:05:30.890> that<00:05:31.400> are<00:05:31.550> out<00:05:32.260> if<00:05:33.260> that

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
the current games that are out if that

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.130 
the current games that are out if that
is<00:05:33.920> the<00:05:34.100> issue<00:05:34.220> there's<00:05:35.030> there<00:05:35.600> are<00:05:35.780> solutions

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
is the issue there's there are solutions

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.520 
is the issue there's there are solutions
one<00:05:36.710> is<00:05:37.340> a<00:05:37.400> subscription-based<00:05:38.150> model<00:05:38.530> the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
one is a subscription-based model the

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.260 
one is a subscription-based model the
other<00:05:39.680> is<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:39.890> cash<00:05:40.220> drop<00:05:40.490> those<00:05:40.790> are<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.060> two

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
other is a cash drop those are the two

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.820 
other is a cash drop those are the two
big<00:05:41.510> ones<00:05:41.540> that<00:05:41.930> there<00:05:42.050> are<00:05:42.200> others<00:05:42.530> but<00:05:42.560> those

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
big ones that there are others but those

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.060 
big ones that there are others but those
are<00:05:42.980> the<00:05:43.040> big<00:05:43.190> ones<00:05:43.250> a<00:05:44.710> subscription<00:05:45.710> model<00:05:45.980> I

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
are the big ones a subscription model I

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.120 
are the big ones a subscription model I
don't<00:05:46.100> think<00:05:46.610> would<00:05:46.970> be<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.150> wise<00:05:47.420> option<00:05:48.130> maybe

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
don't think would be a wise option maybe

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.240 
don't think would be a wise option maybe
if<00:05:49.340> it<00:05:49.490> was<00:05:49.640> yearly<00:05:50.440> but<00:05:51.440> I<00:05:51.470> don't<00:05:51.770> think<00:05:52.040> that

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
if it was yearly but I don't think that

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.940 
if it was yearly but I don't think that
