00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
when I'm using lines I'm actually

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.669 
when I'm using lines I'm actually
pushing<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.719> little<00:00:58.870> bit<00:00:59.019> and<00:00:59.379> then<00:00:59.589> I'm

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
pushing a little bit and then I'm

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.739 
pushing a little bit and then I'm
knocking<00:01:00.159> on<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.670> outside<00:01:01.059> there's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
but when the metal gets hit the crown

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.030 
but when the metal gets hit the crown
zones<00:01:12.729> are<00:01:13.299> on<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.110> outside<00:01:14.469> basically

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
zones are on the outside basically

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.319
