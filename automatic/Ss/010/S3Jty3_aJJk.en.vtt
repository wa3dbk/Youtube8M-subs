00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.450 
fun to do I think this is where I might
I<00:05:16.300> pop<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:16.720> buff<00:05:16.930> oh<00:05:17.169> no<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.740> got<00:05:17.950> a<00:05:17.979> 08<00:05:18.190> out

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
there but just one hit 2k right there I

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.159 
there but just one hit 2k right there I
don't<00:05:21.550> even<00:05:21.639> did<00:05:22.240> that<00:05:22.270> crit<00:05:22.630> yeah<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:22.870> guess<00:05:23.139> it

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
don't even did that crit yeah I guess it

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.440 
don't even did that crit yeah I guess it
probably<00:05:23.380> did<00:05:23.680> Chris<00:05:23.919> but<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.760> wasn't<00:05:25.120> really

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
probably did Chris but I wasn't really

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.180 
probably did Chris but I wasn't really
hitting<00:05:25.660> for<00:05:25.840> 2k<00:05:26.200> and<00:05:26.440> so<00:05:26.530> I<00:05:26.560> was<00:05:26.740> up<00:05:26.889> like

hitting for 2k and so I was up like

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.980 
hitting for 2k and so I was up like
close<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.490> level<00:05:27.820> 50<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.270> don't<00:05:28.570> think<00:05:28.750> I'm<00:05:28.870> my

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
close to level 50 I don't think I'm my

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.129 
close to level 50 I don't think I'm my
trooper<00:05:30.419> certainly<00:05:31.419> wasn't<00:05:31.630> hitting<00:05:32.020> that
