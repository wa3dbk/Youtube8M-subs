hello<00:00:00.719> I'm<00:00:00.930> Anthony<00:00:01.110> romrell<00:00:01.680> welcome<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.280> CG

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hello I'm Anthony romrell welcome to CG

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.999 
hello I'm Anthony romrell welcome to CG
for<00:00:02.790> me<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.929> rig<00:00:04.529> our<00:00:04.680> pig

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
for me we're going to rig our pig

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.230 
for me we're going to rig our pig
character<00:00:06.529> put<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> start<00:00:07.980> by<00:00:08.670> selecting<00:00:08.910> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
character put a start by selecting the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.970 
character put a start by selecting the
character<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.870> creating<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.230> new<00:00:10.469> display

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
character and creating a new display

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.879 
character and creating a new display
layer<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:12.200> then<00:00:13.200> I'm<00:00:13.290> gonna<00:00:13.500> put<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.830> in

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
layer and then I'm gonna put it in

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.349 
layer and then I'm gonna put it in
template<00:00:14.340> mode<00:00:14.519> I'll<00:00:15.000> rename<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.599> layer<00:00:17.359> pig

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
template mode I'll rename this layer pig

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:28.250 
template mode I'll rename this layer pig
mesh<00:00:19.910> layer<00:00:23.840> I'll<00:00:24.840> hit<00:00:25.230> save<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> makes<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
mesh layer I'll hit save this makes it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.040 
mesh layer I'll hit save this makes it
so<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.529> easy<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.949> see<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.789> rig<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.840> not

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
so it's easy to see the rig but I'm not

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.720 
so it's easy to see the rig but I'm not
going<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> interfere<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:33.180> model<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> one

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
going to interfere with the model so one

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.010 
going to interfere with the model so one
thing<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.030> important<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> understand

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
thing that's important to understand

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.580 
thing that's important to understand
about<00:00:37.320> Maya<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.100> joint<00:00:38.879> orientation<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.290> I'm

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
about Maya is joint orientation so I'm

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.030 
about Maya is joint orientation so I'm
gonna<00:00:40.860> build<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.430> joint<00:00:41.850> chain<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.829> I'm<00:00:43.829> going

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
gonna build a joint chain and I'm going

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.540 
gonna build a joint chain and I'm going
to<00:00:44.430> hold<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> X<00:00:45.059> key<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.719> click<00:00:46.250> four<00:00:47.250> times

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to hold the X key and click four times

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
to hold the X key and click four times
to<00:00:47.850> draw<00:00:48.059> four<00:00:48.390> joints<00:00:48.719> using<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> joint<00:00:49.770> tool

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to draw four joints using the joint tool

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.439 
to draw four joints using the joint tool
that's<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.210> joint<00:00:51.449> tool<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
that's the joint tool right there and

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.319 
that's the joint tool right there and
what<00:00:54.449> I'm<00:00:54.510> gonna<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.969> then<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
what I'm gonna do is I'm then going to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.889 
what I'm gonna do is I'm then going to
go<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.660> modify<00:00:59.449> excuse<00:01:00.449> me<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> go

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
go to modify excuse me I'm going to go

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.399 
go to modify excuse me I'm going to go
to<00:01:00.960> edit<00:01:01.440> select<00:01:02.250> hierarchy<00:01:03.199> that's<00:01:04.199> gonna

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
to edit select hierarchy that's gonna

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.500 
to edit select hierarchy that's gonna
select<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> entire<00:01:05.159> chain<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:06.180> gonna<00:01:06.360> go

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
select the entire chain and I'm gonna go

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.950 
select the entire chain and I'm gonna go
to<00:01:06.570> display<00:01:07.820> transform<00:01:08.820> display<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> show

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
to display transform display and show

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.450 
to display transform display and show
local<00:01:10.500> rotation<00:01:10.920> axes<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.740> important<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
local rotation axes so it's important to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.280 
local rotation axes so it's important to
understand<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.150> joint<00:01:15.450> orientation<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
understand what joint orientation is

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.429 
understand what joint orientation is
joint<00:01:16.830> orientation<00:01:17.549> basically<00:01:18.540> orientation

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
joint orientation basically orientation

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.580 
joint orientation basically orientation
is<00:01:19.820> like<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> second<00:01:21.570> rotation<00:01:22.290> value<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:24.590> these

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
is like a second rotation value so these

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.210 
is like a second rotation value so these
rotate<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.790> axes<00:01:27.420> show<00:01:27.720> us<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.220> which

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
rotate these axes show us in which

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
rotate these axes show us in which
direction<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.759> pointing<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.540> rotate

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
direction it's pointing so if I rotate

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.039 
direction it's pointing so if I rotate
this<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> X<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.939> pointing<00:01:33.450> down

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
this you can see the X is pointing down

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.420 
this you can see the X is pointing down
the<00:01:34.590> chain<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.360> Y<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.420> pointing<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.430> in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the chain and Y is pointing up and in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.600 
the chain and Y is pointing up and in
space<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> Z's<00:01:39.420> pointing<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> whole

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
space and Z's pointing out now the whole

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.490 
space and Z's pointing out now the whole
process<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.689> whole<00:01:42.840> reason<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.229> this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
process this the whole reason for this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.039 
process this the whole reason for this
is<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> rotate<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.180> X<00:01:45.509> no<00:01:46.020> matter

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
is so that when I rotate in X no matter

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.830 
is so that when I rotate in X no matter
what<00:01:46.470> position<00:01:46.619> I'm<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.270> it'll<00:01:48.270> point<00:01:48.479> it'll

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
what position I'm in it'll point it'll

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
what position I'm in it'll point it'll
rotate<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.640> straight<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.979> rotate

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
rotate in a straight way so if I rotate

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.149 
rotate in a straight way so if I rotate
this<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> another<00:01:54.119> one<00:01:54.420> X<00:01:54.990> still<00:01:55.590> rotates<00:01:56.009> in

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
this and another one X still rotates in

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.050 
this and another one X still rotates in
a<00:01:56.250> straight<00:01:56.549> way<00:01:57.799> without<00:01:58.799> X<00:01:59.340> pointing<00:01:59.850> down

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
a straight way without X pointing down

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.120 
a straight way without X pointing down
the<00:02:00.090> chain<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.840> won't<00:02:01.409> get<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.799> result<00:02:04.130> I'm

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the chain I won't get this result I'm

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.889 
the chain I won't get this result I'm
going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> undo<00:02:06.030> this

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.010 

so<00:02:09.899> let<00:02:10.740> me<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:10.950> show<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.160> again<00:02:11.990> how<00:02:12.990> I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
so let me just show you again how I

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.080 
so let me just show you again how I
created<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.620> now<00:02:13.800> Maya<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.520> world<00:02:14.730> space

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
created this now Maya is in world space

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.360 
created this now Maya is in world space
you<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.690> X<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.830> pointing<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.250> this

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you can see X is pointing in this

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.690 
you can see X is pointing in this
direction<00:02:17.430> Z<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.600> then<00:02:18.870> Y<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.160> created<00:02:20.550> this

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
direction Z and then Y so I created this

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.309 
direction Z and then Y so I created this
joint<00:02:21.030> chain<00:02:21.270> because<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.630> find<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.260> is

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
joint chain because I find that this is

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.199 
joint chain because I find that this is
the<00:02:22.530> easiest<00:02:22.980> way<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.250> get<00:02:23.550> started<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
the easiest way to get started and

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.690 
the easiest way to get started and
rigging<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.720> what<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.530> basically<00:02:25.650> does<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.520> it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
rigging and what it basically does is it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.880 
rigging and what it basically does is it
automatically<00:02:27.510> Orient's<00:02:28.260> everything<00:02:28.709> down

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
automatically Orient's everything down

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.400 
automatically Orient's everything down
the<00:02:29.070> chain<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.240> let<00:02:30.510> me<00:02:30.600> create<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:31.020> one<00:02:31.230> more

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the chain so let me create this one more

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.830 
the chain so let me create this one more
time<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.860> could<00:02:31.950> see<00:02:32.209> I'm<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.480> gonna<00:02:33.570> go

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
time so you could see I'm just gonna go

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.260 
time so you could see I'm just gonna go
to<00:02:33.900> my<00:02:34.080> joint<00:02:34.800> tool<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.400> I'm<00:02:35.610> gonna<00:02:35.700> hold<00:02:35.970> X

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
to my joint tool and I'm gonna hold X

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.910 
to my joint tool and I'm gonna hold X
and<00:02:36.630> I'm<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:36.870> gonna<00:02:37.050> snap<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.530> grid<00:02:37.560> I'm

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
and I'm just gonna snap to the grid I'm

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.020 
and I'm just gonna snap to the grid I'm
gonna<00:02:38.069> create<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> clavicle<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:39.030> shoulder<00:02:39.930> an

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
gonna create a clavicle a shoulder an

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.720 
gonna create a clavicle a shoulder an
elbow<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.780> wrist<00:02:43.400> normally<00:02:44.400> we'd<00:02:44.550> add<00:02:44.700> a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
elbow and a wrist normally we'd add a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.820 
elbow and a wrist normally we'd add a
wrist<00:02:45.090> roller<00:02:45.390> too<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.140> we'll<00:02:46.320> save<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.530> for

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
wrist roller too but we'll save that for

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.420 
wrist roller too but we'll save that for
another<00:02:46.920> time<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:48.530> I'm<00:02:49.530> going<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.890> select<00:02:50.280> my

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
another time and I'm going to select my

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.449 
another time and I'm going to select my
hierarchy<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.269> created<00:02:51.959> some<00:02:52.320> icons<00:02:52.830> here<00:02:53.160> in

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
hierarchy I created some icons here in

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.240 
hierarchy I created some icons here in
order<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.760> create<00:02:53.940> icons<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.890> come<00:02:56.190> over

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
order to create icons you just come over

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.870 
order to create icons you just come over
to<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.610> menu<00:02:56.790> system<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.430> hit<00:02:59.670> edit

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
to the menu system and you just hit edit

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.140 
to the menu system and you just hit edit
and<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.390> hold<00:03:00.630> down<00:03:00.780> ctrl<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.380> shift<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.250> by

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and you hold down ctrl and shift and by

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.180 
and you hold down ctrl and shift and by
selecting<00:03:03.720> something<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.230> select

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
selecting something like select

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.680 
selecting something like select
hierarchy<00:03:05.870> it'll<00:03:06.870> create<00:03:07.080> an<00:03:07.170> icon<00:03:07.530> over<00:03:07.769> here

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
hierarchy it'll create an icon over here

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.920 
hierarchy it'll create an icon over here
so<00:03:09.690> I've<00:03:09.930> got<00:03:09.959> an<00:03:10.200> icon<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.329> I<00:03:12.329> hit<00:03:12.720> select

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
so I've got an icon and I hit select

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.150 
so I've got an icon and I hit select
hierarchy<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.590> then<00:03:13.709> I'm<00:03:13.799> going<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.950> turn<00:03:14.100> on

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
hierarchy and then I'm going to turn on

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
hierarchy and then I'm going to turn on
the<00:03:14.670> same<00:03:14.880> thing<00:03:15.209> show<00:03:15.810> local<00:03:16.079> rotation<00:03:16.470> axes

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
the same thing show local rotation axes

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.440 
the same thing show local rotation axes
and<00:03:19.130> that's<00:03:20.130> just<00:03:20.400> gonna<00:03:20.519> show<00:03:20.820> me<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.180> can

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
and that's just gonna show me this can

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.170 
and that's just gonna show me this can
we<00:03:21.570> give<00:03:21.840> me<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:21.989> way<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> know<00:03:22.910> which<00:03:23.910> direction

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
we give me a way to know which direction

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.720 
we give me a way to know which direction
X<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.870> pointing<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.380> Y<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.579> different

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
X is pointing and Y so for different

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.670 
X is pointing and Y so for different
pipelines<00:03:27.390> different<00:03:28.200> companies<00:03:28.500> use

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
pipelines different companies use

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.380 
pipelines different companies use
different<00:03:28.709> things<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:29.880> particular

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
different things in this particular

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.060 
different things in this particular
pipeline<00:03:30.630> we<00:03:30.989> use<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.590> at<00:03:31.620> Utah<00:03:31.890> Valley

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
pipeline we use here at Utah Valley

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.690 
pipeline we use here at Utah Valley
University<00:03:32.600> we<00:03:33.600> use<00:03:33.900> X<00:03:34.200> down<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> chain<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.160> Y

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
University we use X down the chain and Y

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.970 
University we use X down the chain and Y
pointing<00:03:36.209> up<00:03:36.390> Z<00:03:37.049> always<00:03:37.440> goes<00:03:37.650> positive<00:03:39.980> so

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
pointing up Z always goes positive so

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.940 
pointing up Z always goes positive so
next<00:03:41.880> step<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.450> rename<00:03:42.720> my<00:03:42.780> joints<00:03:43.320> I'm

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
next step is to rename my joints I'm

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.330 
next step is to rename my joints I'm
going<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.250> name<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.480> clav<00:03:45.799> underscore<00:03:46.799> L<00:03:46.980> and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
going to name this clav underscore L and

00:03:49.340 --> 00:04:01.980 
going to name this clav underscore L and
shoulder<00:03:52.610> underscore<00:03:53.610> L<00:03:55.700> elbow<00:03:58.610> underscore<00:03:59.610> L

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:11.130 

and<00:04:02.970> wrist<00:04:04.650> underscore<00:04:05.650> L<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.690> find<00:04:11.080> that

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
and wrist underscore L so I find that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.800 
and wrist underscore L so I find that
it's<00:04:11.230> easiest<00:04:11.740> just<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.610> take<00:04:12.850> this<00:04:13.090> chain<00:04:13.480> and

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
it's easiest just to take this chain and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.780 
it's easiest just to take this chain and
duplicate<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.680> for<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:15.010> other<00:04:15.190> parts<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.670> the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
duplicate it for the other parts of the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.770 
duplicate it for the other parts of the
body<00:04:16.140> say<00:04:17.140> I'm<00:04:17.290> gonna<00:04:17.470> create<00:04:17.680> my<00:04:17.800> back<00:04:18.780> so

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
body say I'm gonna create my back so

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.590 
body say I'm gonna create my back so
I'll<00:04:20.200> just<00:04:20.230> hit<00:04:20.770> command<00:04:21.010> D<00:04:21.220> or<00:04:21.970> control<00:04:22.420> da

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
I'll just hit command D or control da

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.110 
I'll just hit command D or control da
front<00:04:22.810> on<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.960> PC<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.770> I'll<00:04:24.670> move<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.000> over

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
front on the PC and I'll move it over

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.320 
front on the PC and I'll move it over
and<00:04:25.570> I'll<00:04:26.200> name<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:26.680> for<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.580> leg<00:04:27.760> so<00:04:28.150> I'll

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
and I'll name this for the leg so I'll

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:42.770 
and I'll name this for the leg so I'll
say<00:04:28.890> hip<00:04:31.320> underscore<00:04:32.320> ell<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:38.400> knee

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:51.600 

underscore<00:04:43.780> ell<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:46.530> ankle<00:04:49.260> underscore<00:04:50.610> ell

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
underscore ell and ankle underscore ell

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.050 
underscore ell and ankle underscore ell
and<00:04:52.980> I<00:04:53.980> don't<00:04:54.220> need<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.400> tow<00:04:54.700> for<00:04:54.940> this

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
and I don't need a tow for this

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.750 
and I don't need a tow for this
particular<00:04:55.540> character<00:04:56.040> if<00:04:57.040> I<00:04:57.220> needed<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.640> I

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
particular character if I needed it I

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.880 
particular character if I needed it I
would<00:04:57.970> name<00:04:58.180> it<00:04:58.240> toe<00:04:58.630> underscore<00:04:59.260> L<00:04:59.380> but<00:04:59.710> I

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
would name it toe underscore L but I

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.990 
would name it toe underscore L but I
don't<00:05:00.130> need<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:00.400> I'm<00:05:00.580> just<00:05:00.730> going<00:05:00.850> to

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
don't need it so I'm just going to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.640 
don't need it so I'm just going to
delete<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.840> just<00:05:02.080> have<00:05:02.200> three<00:05:02.470> in<00:05:02.560> the

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
delete it and just have three in the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.050 
delete it and just have three in the
chain<00:05:05.160> next<00:05:06.160> I<00:05:06.430> know<00:05:06.490> I'm<00:05:06.700> going<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.880> need<00:05:06.940> a

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
chain next I know I'm going to need a
