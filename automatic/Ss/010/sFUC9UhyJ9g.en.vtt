00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 biceps exercise biceps curl standing with teat bar this exercise has 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.260
 an average difficulty of execution 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.099
 description of the exercise 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.429
 It is a basic and heavy exercise for the biceps appropriate for any level 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.369
 the grip is anatomically more rational with the zeta bar and also 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.480
 It provides a slightly greater indication of the braque or radial and of the long head 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.839
 of the biceps 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.169
 the drawback of the z-bar is that the grip has a fixed width 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.970
 it can not be adapted for each user 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.670
 to prevent the position of the wrists is uncomfortable or painful 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.980
 we will use the z-bar when we work with big weights 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.220
 completion of the exercise 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
 e with legs slightly apart to maintain balance 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.560
 the bar is held in front of the musicians, the hands are placed in supination 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.530
 palms up with a grip slightly wider than 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.570
 the width of the shoulders 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.240
 the bar is lifted in a controlled manner until the maximum flexion of about 145 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.760
 degrees 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.000
 if you have a lot of muscle volume, maximum flexion can be reduced 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.450
 during exercise the trunk, shoulders and wrists should be 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.890
 blocked 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.790
 To maintain a stable and adequate posture we must carry out a 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.790
 Isometric contraction of the abdominals and glutes 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.100
 the elbows we can push forward only what anatomically 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.900
 force us to bend biceps 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.270
 It is advisable not to leave the arms relaxed in the lowest position where there is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.310
 maximum extension since this can excessively compromise the tendons 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.950
 of the biceps 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.570
 most frequent mistakes balance the body throwing the elbows back to 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.850
 shorten the movement and help the dorsal elbows forward 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.310
 excessively to help themselves from the toriles 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.220
 Those who have back problems or want to avoid the traps can 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.770
 lean against a wall and separate the feet a little more than the width of the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.050
 shoulders 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.970
 In this way you will find firm support that will relieve tension and 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.200
 unwanted movements 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.200
 Advanced bodybuilders prefer not to support themselves because they are supported 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.040
 prevents completing a heavy series with small impulses from the trunk 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.980
 muscles involved this exercise requires a great involvement of the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.079
 two heads of the biceps 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.090
 if the grip is wide, the short head of the biceps will be involved 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:27.749
 If the grip is narrower, the long head of the 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:28.969
 biceps 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.539
 main muscles 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:34.409
 it says that there is kial brache to the previous varallo radial and black and oh radial 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.619

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.209
 secondary muscles 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.910
 On the one hand round, it is a long radial sensor of the superficial flexor carpi 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.969
 the palmar long fingers 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.679
