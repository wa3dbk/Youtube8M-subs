there's<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.900> many<00:01:15.960> stainless<00:01:16.470> pins<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> can

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
there's so many stainless pins you can

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.469 
there's so many stainless pins you can
see<00:01:17.159> them<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.580> mini<00:01:17.820> micro<00:01:18.180> screws

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
see them in there and mini micro screws

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.210 
see them in there and mini micro screws
it's<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.409> worth<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> time<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it's it's not worth the time for me to

it's it's not worth the time for me to
pull<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> there's<00:01:22.170> four<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
pull all that out so there's four of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
pull all that out so there's four of
those<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.830> anyway<00:01:23.070> I'll<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.460> catching<00:01:23.610> those

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
those so anyway I'll be catching those

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
those so anyway I'll be catching those

this<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> guts<00:01:32.670> from<00:01:32.880> four

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this is just the guts from four

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.789 
this is just the guts from four
computers<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.200> I've<00:01:34.290> got<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> pull<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.770> that

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
computers so I've got to pull all that

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.039 
computers so I've got to pull all that
apart<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.909> those<00:01:36.540> motherboards<00:01:37.020> are

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
apart and then those motherboards are

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.590 
apart and then those motherboards are
like<00:01:37.259> three<00:01:37.470> pounds<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.829> piece<00:01:37.950> they're<00:01:38.189> huge

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
like three pounds of piece they're huge
