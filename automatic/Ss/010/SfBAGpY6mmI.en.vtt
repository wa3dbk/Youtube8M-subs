on fire explosive arrows they explode on

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.039 
on fire explosive arrows they explode on
contact<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:50.600> impact<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> know<00:01:51.840> whatever

contact and impact you know whatever
these<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.009> very<00:01:53.759> useful<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.380> run<00:01:55.649> out

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
these are very useful but they run out

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.240 
these are very useful but they run out
easily<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.549> guess<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.909> only<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.299> five<00:01:58.250> so

reinforced limbs
Liz<00:02:11.700> are<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:13.020> increase<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.410> damage

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.510 

plated<00:02:17.760> string<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.980> increases<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
plated string this is this increases the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.980 
plated string this is this increases the
arrow<00:02:20.700> damage<00:02:22.430> stabilizing<00:02:23.430> weight<00:02:23.990> this

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
arrow damage stabilizing weight this

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.860 
arrow damage stabilizing weight this
also<00:02:25.200> increases<00:02:25.680> damage<00:02:26.540> penetrating<00:02:27.540> arrows

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
also increases damage penetrating arrows

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
also increases damage penetrating arrows
now<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.860> haven't<00:02:29.100> really<00:02:29.370> used<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
now this is I haven't really used this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.610 
now this is I haven't really used this
much<00:02:30.000> yet<00:02:30.210> like<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.600> haven't<00:02:30.870> gotten<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
much yet like I haven't gotten the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.860 
much yet like I haven't gotten the
chance<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.820> let's<00:02:33.180> say<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.600> you're<00:02:33.780> going

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
chance but let's say that you're going

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.630 
chance but let's say that you're going
to<00:02:33.930> go<00:02:34.020> for<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> head<00:02:34.410> shot<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.950> there's

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
to go for a head shot and there's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.340 
to go for a head shot and there's
somebody<00:02:35.910> else<00:02:36.270> right<00:02:36.600> like<00:02:36.840> directly<00:02:37.230> behind

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
somebody else right like directly behind

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.600 
somebody else right like directly behind
them<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.860> could<00:02:38.190> possibly<00:02:38.490> kill<00:02:39.000> both<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.330> them

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
them it could possibly kill both of them

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.930 
them it could possibly kill both of them
so<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:42.750> wrapped<00:02:42.960> string<00:02:43.670> faster<00:02:44.670> firing

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
so we have wrapped string faster firing

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.610 
so we have wrapped string faster firing
rate<00:02:45.360> which<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.960> is<00:02:46.050> awesome

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
rate which that is awesome

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.340 
rate which that is awesome
like<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.250> use<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.850> then<00:02:48.450> keyring<00:02:49.080> trigger

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
like I I use that then keyring trigger

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.280 
like I I use that then keyring trigger
which<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.710> also<00:02:49.950> faster<00:02:50.520> fire<00:02:50.700> rate<00:02:50.990> having<00:02:51.990> a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
which is also faster fire rate having a

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.860 
which is also faster fire rate having a
really<00:02:52.950> fast<00:02:53.190> fire<00:02:53.430> rate<00:02:53.460> on<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.180> bow<00:02:54.420> it's

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
really fast fire rate on the bow it's

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.760 
really fast fire rate on the bow it's
very<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:55.650> useful<00:02:57.350> alright<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.620> is

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
very very useful alright and this is

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.440 
very very useful alright and this is
just<00:02:59.630> yet<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.810> ice<00:03:00.930> pick<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:03.090> we<00:03:03.120> come<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.330> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
just yet the ice pick so we come to the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.170 
just yet the ice pick so we come to the
handgun<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.110> has<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> burst<00:03:05.400> fire<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.970> tap

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
handgun now has a burst fire if you tap

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.510 
handgun now has a burst fire if you tap
RB<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.020> uh<00:03:07.470> it'll<00:03:08.130> be<00:03:08.160> through<00:03:08.430> our

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
RB and uh it'll be through our

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.280 
RB and uh it'll be through our
three-round<00:03:09.000> burst<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.720> don't<00:03:09.930> use<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.230> much

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
three-round burst I don't use this much

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.660 
three-round burst I don't use this much
could<00:03:10.710> I<00:03:10.770> forget<00:03:11.070> about<00:03:11.310> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
could I forget about it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.170 
could I forget about it
and<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:14.160> yeah<00:03:14.310> but<00:03:14.580> that's<00:03:14.640> actually<00:03:14.820> really

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
and so yeah but that's actually really

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.850 
and so yeah but that's actually really
cool<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:16.590> kills<00:03:17.070> enemies<00:03:17.250> pretty<00:03:17.700> easily

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
cool it kills enemies pretty easily

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.199 
cool it kills enemies pretty easily

we<00:03:29.070> got<00:03:29.220> port<00:03:29.640> vented<00:03:30.060> slide<00:03:30.770> this<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:31.950> this

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
we got port vented slide this is this

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.630 
we got port vented slide this is this
increases<00:03:32.760> damage<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:34.380> yeah<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.340> then<00:03:35.550> you

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
increases damage so yeah and then you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.920 
increases damage so yeah and then you
get<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.820> muzzle<00:03:36.150> break<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.750> also

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
get the muzzle break and this also

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.220 
get the muzzle break and this also
increases<00:03:37.230> damage<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.760> polished<00:03:39.150> Baro<00:03:39.420> also

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
increases damage the polished Baro also

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.830 
increases damage the polished Baro also
increases<00:03:40.590> damage<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:42.239> magazine<00:03:42.630> well

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
increases damage and the magazine well

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.449 
increases damage and the magazine well
yeah<00:03:43.140> helps<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.860> reload<00:03:44.190> faster<00:03:45.050> having<00:03:46.050> fire

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
yeah helps you reload faster having fire

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.070 
yeah helps you reload faster having fire
it<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.520> increases<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.600> rate<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.780> fire<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
it just increases the rate of fire the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.420 
it just increases the rate of fire the
fast<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.380> press<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> trigger<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.070> best<00:03:50.250> it's

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
fast you press the trigger the best it's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.870 
fast you press the trigger the best it's
going<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.640> shoot

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.130 

ergonomic<00:03:53.880> grip<00:03:54.300> we<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:55.440> as<00:03:55.560> recoil<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.250> like

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
ergonomic grip we just as recoil so like

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.570 
ergonomic grip we just as recoil so like
if<00:03:58.140> you're<00:03:58.410> shooting<00:03:58.709> one<00:03:59.010> target<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.459> you're

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
if you're shooting one target and you're

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.610 
if you're shooting one target and you're
shooting<00:03:59.730> really<00:04:00.060> fast<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:01.080> chance<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.470> you

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
shooting really fast the chance of you

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.650 
shooting really fast the chance of you
hitting<00:04:01.830> them<00:04:02.040> with<00:04:02.370> each<00:04:02.850> shot<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.360> higher

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
hitting them with each shot is higher

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.920 
hitting them with each shot is higher
with<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.290> ergonomic<00:04:04.980> grip<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:06.209> silencer<00:04:06.750> I

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
with the ergonomic grip the silencer I

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.360 
with the ergonomic grip the silencer I
don't<00:04:07.110> use<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.410> much<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:07.980> really<00:04:08.160> good

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
don't use this much but it's really good

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.400 
don't use this much but it's really good
for<00:04:08.550> stealth<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.450> normally<00:04:09.959> use<00:04:09.989> just<00:04:10.290> a

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
for stealth but I I normally use just a

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.290 
for stealth but I I normally use just a
bow<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.830> use<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.340> bow<00:04:11.520> for<00:04:11.820> most<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.180> whole

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
bow I use the bow for most of the whole

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.770 
bow I use the bow for most of the whole
game<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:13.640> only<00:04:14.640> used<00:04:16.730> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
game I only used the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.710 
game I only used the
ah<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:20.519> machine<00:04:20.820> guy<00:04:21.000> didn't<00:04:21.329> use<00:04:21.420> that<00:04:21.450> much

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
ah the machine guy didn't use that much

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.780 
ah the machine guy didn't use that much
because<00:04:22.079> it's<00:04:22.260> actually<00:04:22.410> if<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.160> don't<00:04:23.610> love<00:04:23.730> it

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
because it's actually if I don't love it

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.280 
because it's actually if I don't love it
but<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.210> haven't<00:04:24.480> gotten<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.720> much<00:04:24.900> upgrade

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
but I haven't gotten that much upgrade

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.030 
but I haven't gotten that much upgrade
for<00:04:25.560> yet<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.010> just<00:04:26.820> got<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> commando<00:04:31.040> commando
