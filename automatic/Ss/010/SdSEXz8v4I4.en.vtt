00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello here is again en masse today who 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.250
 to show oneself, there is me 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.099
 will show you two ways how 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.759
 you can do your unknown with cinema 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 4d and that is the first reality 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.160
 if you create a dice and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.359
 you want rounded edges in there 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.800
 you just go down to the earnings 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 round up and you see you have the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.910
 Rounding but your apartment size can 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.030
 the setting is too big the apartment is 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 that means she should be so tiny 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.809
 Of course you can overdo it 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.140
 and make really thick that 's one 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.270
 But then ball is down again 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.800
 the rounding segments monument sit that 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.750
 if you look back with his one 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.940
 Knowing everything says it all 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.850
 I want to dance segments when we do that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.829
 1 down from the shit off so 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.070
 five should be at least 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.230
 then the whole thing is not right 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.809
 send out the curves and then 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.689
 I think so synonymous times that fits 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.310
 second possibility is of course the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.640
 no longer have rounding inside and you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 the object has already been converted 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.860
 has converted then there is the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.130
 possibility if you go to structure 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.470
 go on battle you choose here still 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.860
 The line mode will now select once 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 here 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.710
 this line and this line goes out 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.710
 then down here on convex then see 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.979
 you rush with the left or right 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.240
 and you have such a nice round here 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.840
 then I could you too 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.840
 Of course, only where you mark off 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:02:02.799
 then of course there is the concave 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:04.539
 that the rounding inside what the cs 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.069
 because they do not really can indeed times 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:19.180
 but ask that is exactly the same 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:22.180
 as it is and manually I know that too 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.709
 not what manual lineas meant 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.420
 definitely slanted to it best 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.690
 with the pictures convex then you can 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.940
 make nice curves or then concave 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.629
 inside you can do it inside this 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.629
 make roundings 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.180
 yes that was me first so first 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.910
 step in the video I still have 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.220
 forgot to divide 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.049
 you train yourselves how much the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.600
 subdivision should have so now 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:03:04.709
 of course 0 now a web team at ten 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:07.750
 or five with 5 cents 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.400
 The goal could not be bad either 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.379
 out with five if you have it in there 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.370
 does not always have to be so holy models 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.140
 Above all , many are happy for 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.010
 games 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.780
 that's not what hey police moth her that 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.150
 it was already synonymous with this video 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.349
 That was possible and this time 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.439
 round off the edges 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.420
 I hope I could help you 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.129
 So please come back to the comments 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.650
 Write if you wish or 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.890
 if you want to know something about 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.500
 cinema 4d or nz modeler i will too 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.980
 soon a row over the three gates 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.930
 then we make for all 13 and when 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.599
 the s15 outside is there you can find that 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.329
 but I would have to show everything 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.090
 once that's all that and through that 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.530
 I also learned a little bit, I hope 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.980
 I mean, there again, hopefully grip 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.150
 my video fell through again and 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.480
 then we'll see each other in the next video 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.480
 again
