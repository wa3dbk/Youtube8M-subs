00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.160
 today we will be doing unpacking the phone 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.929
 highscreen zero f came for me only 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.639
 today and today I decided to record 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:19.130
 unpacking this phone ordered more 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.670
 case and cooperative memory card with 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.380
 adapter which i will really need 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.539
 now let's start unpacking 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.870
 phone is such a good package 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:39.180
 plump not everything has come here already 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.480
 the charger falls out of us here 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.530
 noggin it's just like that open it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.129
 so far we do not need to come such 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:55.260
 stylish headphones are very cool not 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:59.489
 like the design and of course the phone itself 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.940
 which is right here and the secret i 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.140
 already just watched this phone so 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.210
 opened the store to look here 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.060
 such a phone is very beautiful in appearance 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.060
 a little slick then I'll do 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:24.530
 a little case that's right here 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.530
 here's the phone really good 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.660
 all well done phone i have a lot 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.510
 I can not say so where we have the charger 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.060
 the device will be here with us here with us 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.450
 headphone input 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.630
 here is the screen lock itself and 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.720
 adding less sound and so cameras 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:56.610
 let's try to take a picture 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:59.600
 somebody and maximuk a picture of type 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.650
 you can still bring it clear 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.650
 scaling here is an example here and so 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.650
 about 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.980
 with him it turned out clear in principle this 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.810
 rate is normal 5 camera 5 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.680
 megapixels 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:29.050
 So take our little slip 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:36.940
 phone case for this phone 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:39.820
 it just fits like that 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.220
 so here's the phone and you can already walk and 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.640
 and user to use it here 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.880
 I remind that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.959
 like rand his phone they are plastic and 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.230
 glass that is and it is very necessary 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.060
 ok well treat him here if 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.420
 will crack u will crack to full because 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.720
 This glass but no scratches and you 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.489
 so you guys will not watch it all 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.670

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.000
