00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.770
 Let's cook a curd casserole with semolina 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.160
 and sweet cherries on crispy crust 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.410
 Such a casserole can be cooked with any berries, only 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.220
 then, you need to increase the amount of sugar. 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.900
 For a crunchy crust (crust): take 2.5 st. spoons 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.580
 semolina, sugar and flour. 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.189
 Combine products and mix. 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.449
 If the curd is wet, the amount of sugar, flour and semolina can be 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:39.350
 increase to 3 tbsp. spoons. 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.210
 Grease the form with butter, put the resulting 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:56.359
 baby 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.780
 Distribute it evenly. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:09.350
 Add eggs, sugar and vanillin to mashed cottage cheese, well 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.800
 mix it up. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:30.010
 Pour in semolina and mix again. 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:42.770
 Add pitted cherries and mix gently. 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.070
 Put the curd mass in the form, lay out the dining room 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.960
 spoon to evenly distribute the sweet cherry. 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 Lightly level, you do not need to level out much, 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.540
 Let the surface be slightly bumpy. 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:10.590
 Then knock the form on the table, as if tamp 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.610
 cottage cheese. 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.060
 Whisk the sour cream with the egg, I whisk it with a fork. 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:34.560
 Pour the resulting mass onto the curd and evenly 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.240
 distribute. 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.750
 Put the casserole in the oven preheated to 200C, bake 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.170
 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.000
 I bake until a darker crust, I love so much. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.540
 Remove the baked pudding from the oven, give it a little 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:13.000
 cool, then remove from the mold. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:30.530
 Cut the casserole into pieces, 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.040
 serve, sprinkled with powdered sugar. 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.500
