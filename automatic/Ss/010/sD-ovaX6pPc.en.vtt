00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hi here I am with a new video 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.290
 I will present on this occasion the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 10 most dangerous roads in the world 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.790
 let's start at number 10 we have 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.350
 Hindu highway Tibet India the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.910
 construction of this road was 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 ordered by whoever was governor 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.359
 general of the British Indian Lord 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.730
 ousley in 1850 to connect the north of 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.619
 India with the Tibetan lands as 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.410
 part of the circuits of the route of the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.770
 silk today is known as 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.899
 the national and hua and 22 and has 459 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.000
 kilometers in length but the last 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.700
 100 kilometers are the most dangerous 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 because of its poor state of conservation in more 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.500
 on one occasion the Indian government has 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.180
 proposed to close it and nowadays only 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.809
 locals in the area dare 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.809
 use it 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.920
 Position number 9 highway to Lisbon Norway 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.290
 just enter this road you 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.809
 you'll see submerged in a tunnel of 11 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.000
 kilometers in the shape of a snail with a 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.199
 pending 11 percent and without any 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.440
 type of lighting 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.300
 then you will have to negotiate 24 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.180
 closed curves in just 4 kilometers 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.640
 however on the contrary that in many 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.159
 other roads of this top its asphalt 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.990
 he is careful his journey starts in the 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.130
 village of lisburn and concludes at the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 fjord of the isef court 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.100
 position number 8 cabbage of turini france 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.689
 a road so demanding that it forms 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.850
 part of the route of the rally 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.340
 montecarlo during which cars 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.140
 they reach speeds of 180 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.869
 kilometers per hour in the port of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.049
 mountain its drawn includes nothing less 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.539
 that 34 forks has a length of 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.630
 about 20 kilometers and at its most 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.630
 high reaches the 1,607 meters of altitude 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.960
 put number 7 step of the liberators 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.299
 chile-argentina also known as 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 paso de los caracoles is one of the 40 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.220
 Existing border crossings between Chile 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.230
 and Argentina is on its Chilean side where 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.600
 we found all this series of curves 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.640
 without protections and most of the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.590
 year covered in snow while in 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.980
 the Argentine side we will find the tunnel 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.720
 of the redeeming Christ of 3 km another one of those 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.069
 sections that have to be closed in 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.920
 winter because they become 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.930
 impassable your traffic volume is 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.880
 so that two new ones are being prepared 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.880
 tunnels to improve communication 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.670
 put number 6 roasting in norway with 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.099

 composed of 11 curves of 180 degrees was 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.400
 inaugurated in 1936 2 some works that 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.260
 they lasted eight years it travels the mountains

 of the rauma area among the villages 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.770
 of Danish and vandal and its route 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.690
 ends in a viewpoint from which 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.750
 contemplate the waterfall steve fossett 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.730
 next to this road to travel it 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.830
 you will have to attend summer as the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.069
 snow forces to close it during the rest 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.069
 of the year 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.350
 put number 5 trans will fail to Romania 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.900
 when top gear got tired of the passage of 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.600
 Stélvio went to this Romanian road 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.280
 naming the best way in the world the 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.380
 dictator ceaucescu ordered the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.970
 construction of this road as passage 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.950
 military the work lasted 4 years between 1970 and 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.930
 1974 trans will pay Shannon in the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.910
 Transylvanian regions and malaria 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.850
 through the highest peaks of the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.410
 Carpathians exist official documents 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.540
 that prove that 40 soldiers 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.880
 they died during the construction of 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.100
 this road but other data point 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.010
 to a figure closer to 400 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.170
 dead were also used more than 6 thousand 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.060
 tons of explosives to be able 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.310
 install between the mountains a great 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.250
 variety of curved hairpins in that 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.110
 so between October and June usually 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.380
 be closed because the snow does it 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.380
 impassable 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.210
 put number 4 shot attacking japan this 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.090
 road was raised on a road 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.980
 for which Buddhist monks made a pilgrimage 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.769
 currently going up and down this 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.170
 Highway means negotiating 48 curves 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.450
 specially closed 20 forks in 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.240
 the rise lane and 28 in the descent lane 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.100
 the journey that he makes starts in the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.680
 nikko town station and 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.720
 ends in the chu chu lake and online 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.270
 straight they are 3 kilometers away 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.270
 but the length of the eiroás layout 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.160
 here is almost 8 kilometers the name of 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.100
 turn has been taken from a poem of 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.200
 11th century in which the 48 are used 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.840
 characters of the Japanese syllabary dragan 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.070
 to each of them reproduced in a 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.070
 of the curves of this way 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.460
 placed number 3 step of the stélvio italia 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:58.860
 Cycling fans will know about 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.319
 over this road of 24 kilometers 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.139
 one of the most anticipated points of the turn 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.699
 from italy every year they will also know 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.770
 from it the followers of the program 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.080
 British on the motor world top

 very dice gear to test cars in this 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.699
 The passage of the stélvio connects the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.520
 Lombard area of the ual of china with the 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.250
 Merano locality through 48 curves 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.500
 closed located at more than 2700 meters 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.539
 of altitude with big slopes and 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.940
 points where it becomes very narrow 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.449
 the good thing is that at least there is hardly 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.449
 traffic 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.139
 put number 2 tunnel road

 yang in the canton of hunan the risks 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.710
 of this road were already patents 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.840
 since its construction during which 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.090
 some of the 13 locals who died 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.620
 allegedly dug it in search of 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.770
 an exit for his people 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.919
 William always isolated was inaugurated 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.680
 in 1977 and it has become a great 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.389
 tourist attraction but the Chinese do not 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.449
 They hesitate to call it the path that 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.939
 tolerated mistakes has 1.2 kilometers 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.749
 of length 5 meters high and 4 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.749
 meters wide 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.189
 in the number one position we have nor 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.439
 Yungas or road of death or Libya 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:19.710
 this road connects the capital of the country 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:22.199
 peace with coroico in the Andean region 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.240
 of the dunes combines the curves more 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.340
 Closed imaginable with circulation 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.740
 in a double sense as it could not be 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.659
 another way having only three meters of 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.400
 wide in some sections and the presence 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:35.460
 of a precipice that is rolled very 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.650
 next and without any protection 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.319
 its poorly paved surface 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.090
 It is particularly slippery 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:45.000
 fog and rain appear with 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.099
 often although in Bolivia he drives 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.020
 on the right this road demands 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.909
 do it from the left so that 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.370
 the trucks always circulate through the 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:56.129
 the most solid part the one seated on rocks 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:00.210
 otherwise the land would yield to its 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:02.639
 weight and would fall down the cliff in 1995 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.729
 He was named most dangerous road 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.729
