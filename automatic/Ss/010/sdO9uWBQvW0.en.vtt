angel trick I've seen performance just
now<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.800> this<00:01:59.980> is<00:02:00.220> how<00:02:00.490> he<00:02:00.550> does<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.060> this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
now and this is how he does this this

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.930 
now and this is how he does this this
trick<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.650> also<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.100> little<00:02:03.310> bit<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.670> setup

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
trick and also a little bit of setup

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.030 
trick and also a little bit of setup
there<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.900> setup<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.710> bottom

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
there and the setup is that the bottom

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.660 
there and the setup is that the bottom
three<00:02:06.250> cards<00:02:06.700> are<00:02:06.940> gonna<00:02:07.690> face<00:02:08.250> down<00:02:09.250> right

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
three cards are gonna face down right

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.009 
three cards are gonna face down right
like<00:02:09.819> this<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.390> these<00:02:10.509> are<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.720> bottom<00:02:10.989> three

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
like this so these are the bottom three

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.110 
like this so these are the bottom three
cards<00:02:11.470> no<00:02:11.590> matter<00:02:11.769> what<00:02:12.040> cost<00:02:12.340> they<00:02:12.489> are<00:02:12.519> but

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
cards no matter what cost they are but

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.550 
cards no matter what cost they are but
you<00:02:13.269> have<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.569> put<00:02:13.720> them<00:02:13.840> face<00:02:14.019> down<00:02:14.080> right

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
you have to put them face down right

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.030 
you have to put them face down right
like<00:02:14.709> this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
like this

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.949 
like this
so<00:02:15.400> all<00:02:15.730> cost<00:02:16.150> normal<00:02:16.540> that's<00:02:16.659> it<00:02:16.780> for<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
so all cost normal that's it for the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.820 
so all cost normal that's it for the
last<00:02:17.110> three<00:02:17.319> cards<00:02:17.680> there<00:02:18.519> face<00:02:18.700> down<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.200> then

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
last three cards there face down so then
