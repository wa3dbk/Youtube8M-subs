hi I'm Ginny formidable design and this

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.830 
hi I'm Ginny formidable design and this
is<00:00:08.370> one<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.549> the<00:00:08.670> new<00:00:08.820> stoves<00:00:09.180> i'm<00:00:09.389> working<00:00:09.750> on

is one of the new stoves i'm working on
it's<00:00:10.080> kind<00:00:10.289> of<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.410> prototype<00:00:11.510> using<00:00:12.510> some<00:00:12.900> of

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
it's kind of a prototype using some of

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.410 
it's kind of a prototype using some of
the<00:00:13.080> technology<00:00:13.709> from<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.980> cat<00:00:14.400> stove<00:00:14.820> that's

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
the technology from the cat stove that's

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.540 
the technology from the cat stove that's
a<00:00:15.600> single<00:00:15.900> wall<00:00:16.199> stove<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.160> got<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> lot

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
a single wall stove but it's got a lot

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.770 
a single wall stove but it's got a lot
of<00:00:17.609> tricks<00:00:18.000> involved<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:19.850> so<00:00:20.850> let's<00:00:21.600> move

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
of tricks involved in it so let's move

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.410 
of tricks involved in it so let's move
the<00:00:21.960> camera<00:00:22.200> around<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.000> look<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.119> baby

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the camera around and look this baby

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.460 
the camera around and look this baby
over<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.110> it's<00:00:25.260> got<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.440> offer<00:00:25.970> okay

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
over and see what it's got to offer okay

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.810 
over and see what it's got to offer okay
what<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> basically<00:00:28.860> got<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:29.520> begin<00:00:29.640> with

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
what I basically got here to begin with

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.509 
what I basically got here to begin with
is<00:00:30.270> an<00:00:31.260> online<00:00:31.910> stove<00:00:34.760> it's<00:00:35.760> jetted<00:00:36.329> low<00:00:37.519> so

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
is an online stove it's jetted low so

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.180 
is an online stove it's jetted low so
that<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.789> can<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.030> used<00:00:39.179> with<00:00:39.269> a<00:00:39.359> honey<00:00:39.629> pot

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
that it can be used with a honey pot

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.069 
that it can be used with a honey pot
without<00:00:41.190> choking<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.940> off<00:00:42.089> so<00:00:42.359> i<00:00:42.389> put<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.749> jets

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
without choking it off so i put the jets

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.629 
without choking it off so i put the jets
down<00:00:43.350> low<00:00:43.620> that's<00:00:43.920> reason<00:00:44.219> why<00:00:44.309> there's<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:44.639 
down low that's reason why there's so

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:48.799 
down low that's reason why there's so
much<00:00:44.760> space<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:46.309> now<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:48.210> fill<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.569> full

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
much space here now you fill this full

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.529 
much space here now you fill this full
alcohol<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.679> light<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.699> your<00:00:50.850> pot<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.299> and
