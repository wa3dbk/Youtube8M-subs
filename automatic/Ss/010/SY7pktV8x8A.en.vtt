00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.099
 all smp saddles are characterized by 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.730
 be based on a concept 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.009
 extremely innovative and revolutionary 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.050
 all the products of the line are 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.359
 characterized by four patents a 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.529
 world level 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.170
 each of which is bearer of 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.210
 precise features and benefits e 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.879
 advantages in favor of the cyclist there 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.989
 uses at the sel line is subdivided 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.949
 in four sub-categories depending on the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.640
 of the structuring of the 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.780
 the saddles are physical characteristics 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.789
 in carbon fibers 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.690
 obviously whose fundamental advantage 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:57.260
 to the lightness and high technology of the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.059
 materials used covered saddles 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.570
 without padding for those who 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.690
 they prefer saddles from saddles 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.369
 padded for those who prefer one 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.130
 more comfortable seat more comfortable e 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.050
 finally the subcategory of the halls 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.890
 dedicated to children then the category 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.149
 junior 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.929
 the first fundamental characteristic 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:22.400
 of the smp saddles is the central channel that 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:25.430
 goes from the most extreme point of del 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.520
 nose to the back of the saddle e 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.979
 in this way it allows to eliminate 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.960
 all the compression that happens to 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.780
 level of the genital perineal area 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.939
 favoring a normal circulatory flow 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.000
 of blood in these areas that are 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.100
 particularly sensitive and delicate 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.020
 second key feature is the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.290
 so-called beak- shaped nose 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.759
 eagle which combined with the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.030
 central channel previously 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.590
 described allows precisely to favor 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.570
 blood circulation level 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.509
 perineal and genital then eliminate 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.310
 all the compression on the parts more 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.530
 of the cyclist 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.049
 the third characteristic concerns instead 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.399
 the back of the saddle which presents 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.590
 a hollow that allows the coccyx 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.780
 especially in extremely terrains 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.140
 bumpy like those for 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.810
 the mountain bike not to touch the salle 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.480
 therefore to avoid the repercussions caused 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.310
 from the roughness of the ground the fourth 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.430
 Finally, a feature concerns the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.040
 fork that is the cart which it is 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.430
 the longest available on the market e 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.160
 which therefore allows a perfect one the most 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.050
 wide adjustment range possible in 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.000
 so that you can find a lot 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.250
 the best is simple and immediate 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.630
 bike position which various 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.410
 clearly depending on the user 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.410
 considered
