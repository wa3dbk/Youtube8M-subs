00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
 we are getting screenprinted land 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.879
 a new tutorial 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.019
 today it's about the topic how to 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.690
 a screenprint template with a 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.450
 created canvas or I show you how 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.789
 I put a canvas on the one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 collage made afterwards as t 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.660
 you have transformed your shirt motif 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.539
 her already the motive that is a t 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.310
 shirt what I offer and I'll show you 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.060
 Now how did I do that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.619
 I have a canvas here that I have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.700
 I have created one myself 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.829
 art needs shop then bought 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.010
 then made a collage 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.010
 have you been with diverse year with diverse 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.360
 glue it on then glued to it 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.829
 Britt but also with a special 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.079
 glue then have here a bit with 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 the paint has been lubricated so on 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.840
 every event has been fun for me since 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.530
 I do not believe the eighth grade anymore 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.530
 made something like that and this template wants 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.120
 I now like to transform into a t 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 shirt template respectively in one 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 template for a film which I then 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.830
 then print out my tip 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.299
 expose 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.659
 the first is first that I do that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.270
 whole three stables and up here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.040
 go and say so free so that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.110
 I also have this area 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.140
 not on need and nothing more 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.009
 next step is now the whole in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.509
 to convert grayscale 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.420
 and then there are two possibilities 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.920
 once adjust tone separation 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.630
 here we take only 22, so to speak 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460
 So, whoever blacks and knows who that is 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.890
 then 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.000
 then the whole thing looks like it has one 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.369
 a little bit the disadvantage that one 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520
 here you can see that the things are the ones 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.930
 the quasi me where a bit 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 played that, of course 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.149
 tough now black and that is 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.119
 others will be white so it will be total 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.869
 radically dissolved and that's what you think 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.450
 I do not like it 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.759
 I would like to have the journal 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.799
 go far that it stays like that 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.610
 it was before too 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.819
 That's why I'm taking a step again 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.249
 back 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.780
 and now go away for the time being 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:17.709
 about brightness and contrast so only 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.889
 sometimes manually a bit more 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:28.319
 adjust say okay and now I do 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:31.120
 following I go to mode with map 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.049
 Here I have 72 dpi that is 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.450
 not correct i have in my mine 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.620
 Camera always the problem or the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.870
 situation this is all pictures in 72 dpi 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.930
 but produces in incredibly large 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.540
 file sizes therefore I have to first now 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.480
 adjust the values â€‹â€‹here and that 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.900
 I take here then 29 centimeters in the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.659
 width 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.629
 what about 3 corresponds to something 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:06.939
 higher even than a3 and say okay now 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:12.000
 I go to mode with map and go here 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.000
 on OK 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.710
 and now I have the situation here 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.370
 a scanning further enter here 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:29.090
 must and indeed it is so that you ever 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.820
 after which one sees or uses 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.230
 Whichever starch you use 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.020
 also the corresponding rasta on 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.960
 must enter on screenprint land.de gives 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.590
 it here under this link 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:45.170
 a very good overview which values 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.790
 you have to use for which song and 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.220
 I take a relatively fine sieve and 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.960
 Although in 80s with 80 threads per centimeter 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:58.460
 and that must be 44 rp 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.480
 as value or must the picture that 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.780
 raced on 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.760
 I have this value I do here 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.650
 So I give 44 1 here and say okay like that 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.690
 The great thing is now I have no loss 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.190
 or virtually no loss is up 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.450
 has been rastered that is called this 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.610
 Lubrication was easy in 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.410
 split grid points and thereby that 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.290
 which took a relatively fine grid 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.440
 I have a very faithful to the original 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.170
 a very faithful version of 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.850
 a poster so of course with something 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.640
 sharper contrast is better than 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.540
 the sound separation in any case to 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.860
 The whole thing has to be concluded 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.640
 actually only here at the edges 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.380
 edit something so that I do not have one 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.860
 frame because in my original t 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:47.740
 shirt i have the motive drama 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.200
 and that's it 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.990
 Of course the whole thing has to be done then 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.720
 printed there as well on it 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.400
 pay attention that it is black really 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.770
 jet black that the film is good 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.310
 that it always looks important for that to happen 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.690
 then also well exposed is yes that was 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.770
 it actually already i hope that 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.720
 of course fun 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.280
 maybe that will have you too new 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.140
 ideas brought something like that myself 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.270
 So try with a canvas 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.900
 definitely make me happy and I will 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.270
 now more often 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.650
 Apply this technique because it's easy 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.140
 something different than just 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.750
 to assemble something at photoshop 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.790
 you are so a little bit more realistic 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.160
 yes, have fun watching and writing 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.640
 us if you have any ideas or suggestions 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.640
 have
