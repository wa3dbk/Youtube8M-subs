Marvel<00:01:04.739> Comics<00:01:05.070> has<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> whole<00:01:06.810> thing<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
Marvel Comics has so the whole thing is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620 
Marvel Comics has so the whole thing is
they<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.680> go<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> psyche<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.970> people

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
they really go into the psyche of people

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
they really go into the psyche of people
supposedly<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> sense<00:01:10.619> where<00:01:10.770> people

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
supposedly in the sense where people

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.469 
supposedly in the sense where people
exposed<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.180> gh-325<00:01:12.990> went<00:01:13.530> crazy<00:01:14.210> now<00:01:15.210> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
exposed to gh-325 went crazy now I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
exposed to gh-325 went crazy now I
believe<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:15.990> didn't<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.500> go<00:01:16.710> crazy<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
believe they didn't really go crazy in a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.550 
believe they didn't really go crazy in a
sense<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> life<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.509> lost<00:01:18.840> their<00:01:19.140> minds

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
sense of life they just lost their minds

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.770 
sense of life they just lost their minds
because<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.979> did<00:01:20.310> something<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.729> him<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.090> think

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
because it did something to him I think

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.440 
because it did something to him I think
they're<00:01:21.930> overloaded<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.590> knowledge<00:01:23.450> Garret

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
they're overloaded with knowledge Garret

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
they're overloaded with knowledge Garret
kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.720> hinted<00:01:25.020> towards<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
kind of hinted towards that when you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.469 
kind of hinted towards that when you
know<00:01:26.220> after<00:01:26.520> he<00:01:26.580> took<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> he<00:01:26.970> was<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.270> can

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
know after he took it he was like I can

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
know after he took it he was like I can
see<00:01:27.659> everything<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> people<00:01:29.340> were

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
see everything and a lot of people were

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.490 
see everything and a lot of people were
saying<00:01:29.610> cosmic<00:01:30.119> awareness<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
saying cosmic awareness now I think that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.420 
saying cosmic awareness now I think that
that<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.979> very<00:01:32.040> very<00:01:32.460> likely<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:33.150> since<00:01:33.840> we're

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
that is very very likely as since we're

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.859 
that is very very likely as since we're
Kree<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.700> connected<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> something<00:01:36.509> called

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
Kree are connected to something called

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.080 
Kree are connected to something called
the<00:01:37.110> supreme<00:01:37.470> intelligence<00:01:37.670> now<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> supreme

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the supreme intelligence now the supreme

the supreme intelligence now the supreme
intelligence<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.729> deity<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
intelligence is kind of like a deity to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.149 
intelligence is kind of like a deity to
them<00:01:42.299> he's<00:01:42.750> not<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.229> God<00:01:43.500> he's<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.009> a

know over time you know he's just so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.679 
know over time you know he's just so
powerful<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> Kree<00:01:53.850> start<00:01:54.210> worshiping

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
powerful of the Kree start worshiping

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.420 
powerful of the Kree start worshiping
worshiping<00:01:55.079> him<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> god<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:58.219> yeah<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
worshiping him like a god so yeah I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.560 
worshiping him like a god so yeah I
think<00:01:59.520> that<00:02:00.619> by<00:02:01.619> mixing<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.310> gh-325<00:02:03.030> which<00:02:03.450> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
think that by mixing the gh-325 which is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.859 
think that by mixing the gh-325 which is
from<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.810> Kree<00:02:04.369> with<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.450> human<00:02:06.750> DNA

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
from a Kree with you know the human DNA

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.589 
from a Kree with you know the human DNA
I<00:02:07.380> think<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.399> formed<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.119> connection

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
I think that formed the connection

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.800 
I think that formed the connection
between<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.920> whoever<00:02:11.280> had<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.480> Kree

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
between the whoever had it and the Kree

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.300 
between the whoever had it and the Kree
now<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
now in the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.220 
now in the
especially<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.300> was<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.480> specific<00:02:15.630> Cree

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
especially if it was that specific Cree

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.200 
especially if it was that specific Cree
it<00:02:16.490> probably<00:02:17.490> formed<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.790> connection<00:02:18.090> with

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
it probably formed the connection with

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.120 
it probably formed the connection with
the<00:02:18.270> supreme<00:02:18.420> intelligence<00:02:18.720> now<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.740> reason

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
the supreme intelligence now the reason

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.800 
the supreme intelligence now the reason
why<00:02:20.250> out<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.550> all<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.030> Cree<00:02:21.300> especially<00:02:21.720> they

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
why out of all the Cree especially they

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.410 
why out of all the Cree especially they
created<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.350> gh-325<00:02:23.100> from<00:02:23.730> would<00:02:24.150> be

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
created got the gh-325 from would be

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.750 
created got the gh-325 from would be
connected<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:26.160> well<00:02:26.430> first<00:02:26.610> off

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
connected is because well first off

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.260 
connected is because well first off
hashtag<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.300> all<00:02:27.420> connected<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:28.500> anyways

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
hashtag it's all connected but anyways

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.480 
hashtag it's all connected but anyways
that<00:02:30.270> Cree<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.660> probably<00:02:30.960> asked<00:02:31.230> out<00:02:31.410> all<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
that Cree is probably asked out all you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.490 
that Cree is probably asked out all you
know<00:02:32.580> scouting<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.180> planet<00:02:33.720> Earth<00:02:33.900> now

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
know scouting out the planet Earth now

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.530 
know scouting out the planet Earth now
obviously<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.730> information<00:02:36.000> back

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
obviously to get the information back

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.930 
obviously to get the information back
they<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.470> crude<00:02:37.740> probably<00:02:38.220> contact<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
they that crude probably contact the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.830 
they that crude probably contact the
supreme<00:02:39.300> intelligence

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
supreme intelligence

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.480 
supreme intelligence
um<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.890> don't<00:02:41.040> know<00:02:41.160> supreme

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
um if you don't know supreme

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.880 
um if you don't know supreme
intelligence<00:02:41.610> has<00:02:42.090> stuff<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.450> telepathy

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
intelligence has stuff like telepathy

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.260 
intelligence has stuff like telepathy
cosmic<00:02:43.890> awareness<00:02:44.010> vast<00:02:45.000> knowledge

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
cosmic awareness vast knowledge

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.360 
cosmic awareness vast knowledge
obviously<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:46.200> it's<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.440> collection<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
obviously as it's a collection of the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.140 
obviously as it's a collection of the
smartest<00:02:47.700> Cree<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.630> ever<00:02:48.840> lived<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:50.150> you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
smartest Cree that ever lived so you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.630 
smartest Cree that ever lived so you
know<00:02:51.270> presumably<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.140> if<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.560> Cree<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.520> know

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
know presumably so if that Cree you know

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.590 
know presumably so if that Cree you know
we're<00:02:53.850> gonna<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.000> connected<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.480> another

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
we're gonna be connected to another

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.000 
we're gonna be connected to another
being<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.320> being<00:02:55.560> would<00:02:55.739> be<00:02:55.830> able<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
being that being would be able to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.890 
being that being would be able to
connect<00:02:56.400> also<00:02:56.640> with<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.090> super<00:02:57.330> intelligence

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
connect also with the super intelligence

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.790 
connect also with the super intelligence
and<00:02:58.080> vice<00:02:58.290> versa

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
and vice versa

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.660 
and vice versa
now<00:02:59.580> there's<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.660> big<00:03:00.870> saying<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:02.550> know

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
now there's a big saying that you know

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.220 
now there's a big saying that you know
too<00:03:02.760> much<00:03:03.150> knowledge<00:03:03.450> could<00:03:03.810> drive<00:03:03.989> someone

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
too much knowledge could drive someone

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.680 
too much knowledge could drive someone
crazy<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:05.190> know<00:03:05.280> like<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.880> can't<00:03:06.360> remember<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
crazy you know like I can't remember the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.780 
crazy you know like I can't remember the
quote<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.080> there's<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> quote<00:03:07.470> where<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.640> was

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
quote but there's a quote where it was

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.120 
quote but there's a quote where it was
if<00:03:09.000> people<00:03:09.450> if<00:03:09.660> humans<00:03:10.500> could<00:03:10.709> understand

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
if people if humans could understand

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.550 
if people if humans could understand
God's<00:03:11.430> plan<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:12.030> understand<00:03:12.750> God<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.410> know

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
God's plan and understand God you know

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.350 
God's plan and understand God you know
how<00:03:13.770> he<00:03:13.830> thinks<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.550> all<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.880> stuff<00:03:15.060> you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
how he thinks and all that stuff you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.840 
how he thinks and all that stuff you
would<00:03:16.140> die<00:03:16.380> or<00:03:16.709> you'd<00:03:16.920> go<00:03:17.070> insane<00:03:17.220> because<00:03:17.730> you

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
would die or you'd go insane because you

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.009 
would die or you'd go insane because you
wouldn't<00:03:18.030> be<00:03:18.090> able<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.299> cope<00:03:18.540> with<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.810> much

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
wouldn't be able to cope with that much

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.780 
wouldn't be able to cope with that much
knowledge<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.680> much<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.190> guess

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
knowledge that much I guess

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.259 
knowledge that much I guess
understanding<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.769> speak<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.670> that's<00:03:24.120> uh

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
understanding so to speak so that's uh

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.240 
understanding so to speak so that's uh
what<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.750> think<00:03:25.049> happened<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.380> Garrett<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.860> think

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
what I think happened to Garrett I think

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.190 
what I think happened to Garrett I think
he<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.489> went<00:03:26.670> crazy<00:03:26.790> with<00:03:27.600> knowledge<00:03:28.019> I

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
he just went crazy with knowledge I

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.740 
he just went crazy with knowledge I
think<00:03:28.530> he<00:03:28.860> was<00:03:28.980> smart<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.580> think<00:03:30.120> he<00:03:30.299> he<00:03:30.570> had

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
think he was smart I think he he had

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.160 
think he was smart I think he he had
knowledge<00:03:31.019> uh<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:33.180> know<00:03:33.299> obviously<00:03:34.049> he

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
knowledge uh you know obviously he

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.289 
knowledge uh you know obviously he
wasn't<00:03:34.320> truly<00:03:34.739> clairvoyant<00:03:35.549> like<00:03:35.700> he<00:03:35.940> wanted

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
wasn't truly clairvoyant like he wanted

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.670 
wasn't truly clairvoyant like he wanted
to<00:03:36.390> believe<00:03:36.660> he<00:03:36.870> was<00:03:37.070> but<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.940> believe<00:03:39.780> he

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
to believe he was but it's I believe he

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.539 
to believe he was but it's I believe he
was<00:03:40.799> connected<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> supreme

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
was connected to the supreme

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.190 
was connected to the supreme
intelligence<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.269> he<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.630> went<00:03:42.840> mad<00:03:42.959> from

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
intelligence and he just went mad from

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.550 
intelligence and he just went mad from
as<00:03:43.320> much<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.400> not<00:03:45.120> mad<00:03:45.360> as<00:03:45.600> he<00:03:46.230> got<00:03:46.350> mad

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
as much as the not mad as he got mad

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.840 
as much as the not mad as he got mad
from<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.980> amount<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.190> knowledge<00:03:47.549> he<00:03:47.790> was

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
from the amount of knowledge he was

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.990 
from the amount of knowledge he was
exposed<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.440> now<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.980> goes<00:03:50.220> back<00:03:50.489> also<00:03:50.820> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
exposed to now this goes back also to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.320 
exposed to now this goes back also to
what<00:03:51.570> they<00:03:51.780> were<00:03:51.840> drawing<00:03:52.459> on<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.519> board<00:03:54.090> now

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
what they were drawing on that board now

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.810 
what they were drawing on that board now
if<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:55.140> pay<00:03:55.290> attention<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.549> kinda

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
if you pay attention to it it kinda

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.220 
if you pay attention to it it kinda
looks<00:03:56.940> like<00:03:57.000> coordinates<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.780> not

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
looks like coordinates and not

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.860 
looks like coordinates and not
coordinates<00:03:58.709> like<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.250> know<00:03:59.540> you<00:04:00.540> know<00:04:00.660> what

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
coordinates like you know you know what

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.080 
coordinates like you know you know what
we<00:04:01.019> use<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.739> know<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.280> map<00:04:02.489> something<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
we use you know the to map something I

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.940 
we use you know the to map something I
think<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.720> was<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:03.900> star<00:04:04.170> coordinates

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
think it was like star coordinates

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.640 
think it was like star coordinates
you<00:04:05.400> know<00:04:05.519> maybe<00:04:05.760> those<00:04:05.970> are<00:04:06.120> Kree<00:04:06.660> colonies

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
you know maybe those are Kree colonies

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.100 
you know maybe those are Kree colonies
maybe<00:04:07.950> they<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:08.640> like<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.120> star<00:04:09.540> system<00:04:09.780> map

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
maybe they that's like a star system map

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.720 
maybe they that's like a star system map
to<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.890> Kree<00:04:11.070> homeworld

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
to the Kree homeworld

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.330 
to the Kree homeworld
maybe<00:04:12.239> that's<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.570> universe<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.380> each<00:04:14.010> star

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
maybe that's the universe and each star

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.410 
maybe that's the universe and each star
you<00:04:14.730> know<00:04:14.820> represents<00:04:15.299> different

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
you know represents different

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.449 
you know represents different
civilization<00:04:16.140> we<00:04:16.680> don't<00:04:16.859> know<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.250> do

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
civilization we don't know but I do

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.770 
civilization we don't know but I do
believe<00:04:17.579> it<00:04:17.760> has<00:04:17.850> something<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.209> space<00:04:18.570> and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
believe it has something to a space and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.740 
believe it has something to a space and
the<00:04:19.079> Kree<00:04:19.440> Empire<00:04:19.640> because<00:04:20.640> if<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:21.510> didn't

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
the Kree Empire because if you didn't

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.779 
the Kree Empire because if you didn't
know<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.109> from<00:04:22.410> comic<00:04:22.740> secrete<00:04:23.160> like<00:04:23.640> the

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
know and from comic secrete like the

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.060 
know and from comic secrete like the
scroll<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.360> Shiar<00:04:24.750> all<00:04:25.020> them<00:04:25.680> at<00:04:25.830> best

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
scroll and the Shiar all them at best

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.460 
scroll and the Shiar all them at best
and<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.970> know

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
and you know

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.080 
and you know
you<00:04:28.470> know<00:04:28.560> they<00:04:28.919> have<00:04:29.039> asked<00:04:29.520> what's<00:04:29.909> the<00:04:29.940> word

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
you know they have asked what's the word

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.260 
you know they have asked what's the word
for<00:04:30.330> empires<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.500> span<00:04:32.370> tons<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.180> different

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
for empires that span tons of different

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.320 
for empires that span tons of different
planets<00:04:33.889> so<00:04:34.889> I<00:04:35.220> do<00:04:35.280> think<00:04:35.639> that<00:04:35.699> has<00:04:36.120> something

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
planets so I do think that has something

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.010 
planets so I do think that has something
to<00:04:36.449> do<00:04:36.569> with<00:04:36.599> it

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
to do with it

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.230 
to do with it
obviously<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:38.039> also<00:04:38.280> think<00:04:38.520> its<00:04:38.610> Creed<00:04:38.879> because

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
obviously I also think its Creed because

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.360 
obviously I also think its Creed because
the<00:04:39.840> agent<00:04:40.139> Carter<00:04:40.379> shows<00:04:40.710> coming<00:04:40.949> out<00:04:41.129> soon

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
the agent Carter shows coming out soon

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.040 
the agent Carter shows coming out soon
which<00:04:41.879> will<00:04:41.940> be<00:04:42.150> dealing<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:42.690> early

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
which will be dealing with the early

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.499 
which will be dealing with the early
developments<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.650> shield<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:45.000> that's<00:04:45.270> really

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
developments of shield and that's really

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.300 
developments of shield and that's really
interesting<00:04:45.780> because<00:04:46.199> what<00:04:46.770> else<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.039> coming

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
interesting because what else is coming

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.279 
interesting because what else is coming
out<00:04:47.400> later<00:04:47.729> this<00:04:47.849> year<00:04:48.090> gardens<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.810> galaxy

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
out later this year gardens the galaxy

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.290 
out later this year gardens the galaxy
was<00:04:49.889> in<00:04:50.039> gardens<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.430> galaxies<00:04:50.789> aliens

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
was in gardens and galaxies aliens

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.909 
was in gardens and galaxies aliens
specifically<00:04:51.840> wrote<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.169> accuser<00:04:52.590> who's

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
specifically wrote in the accuser who's

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.550 
specifically wrote in the accuser who's
creat<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.729> has<00:04:54.330> relations<00:04:54.840> obviously<00:04:55.289> due<00:04:55.530> to

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
creat and has relations obviously due to

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.159 
creat and has relations obviously due to
that<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:56.099> the<00:04:56.190> Kree<00:04:56.430> Empire<00:04:56.750> so<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:57.780> think<00:04:57.900> what

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
that to the Kree Empire so I think what

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.379 
that to the Kree Empire so I think what
we're<00:04:58.349> probably<00:04:58.620> gonna<00:04:58.889> see<00:04:59.099> here<00:04:59.370> is<00:04:59.520> more

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
we're probably gonna see here is more

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.809 
we're probably gonna see here is more
the<00:05:01.050> reveal<00:05:01.469> that<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.740> aliens<00:05:02.099> creepers<00:05:02.580> off

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
the reveal that the aliens creepers off

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.270 
the reveal that the aliens creepers off
the<00:05:02.969> official<00:05:03.389> reveal<00:05:04.069> also<00:05:05.069> they're<00:05:05.190> gonna

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
the official reveal also they're gonna

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.219 
the official reveal also they're gonna
go<00:05:05.430> more<00:05:05.639> into<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:06.060> Kree<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.569> think<00:05:07.050> with

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
go more into the Kree I think with

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.020 
go more into the Kree I think with
agents<00:05:07.620> of<00:05:07.680> shield<00:05:07.740> when<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.699> comes<00:05:08.849> back

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
agents of shield when it comes back

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.570 
agents of shield when it comes back
season<00:05:09.659> two<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.139> also<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:10.889> think<00:05:11.310> around<00:05:11.430> that

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
season two and also I think around that

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.920 
season two and also I think around that
time<00:05:11.819> agent<00:05:12.360> Carter

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
time agent Carter

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.020 
time agent Carter
they're<00:05:13.469> gonna<00:05:13.590> have<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.949> episode<00:05:14.370> where<00:05:14.819> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
they're gonna have the episode where the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.170 
they're gonna have the episode where the
Kree<00:05:15.360> Scout<00:05:15.659> lands<00:05:16.319> on<00:05:16.469> earth<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:17.039> they<00:05:17.849> they

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
Kree Scout lands on earth and they they

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.689 
Kree Scout lands on earth and they they
take<00:05:18.419> him<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.020> know<00:05:19.259> we<00:05:20.190> go<00:05:20.340> on<00:05:20.490> from

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
take him and you know we go on from

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.170 
take him and you know we go on from
there<00:05:20.909> so<00:05:22.400> it's<00:05:23.400> kind<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.580> sum<00:05:23.759> up<00:05:23.789> what<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.030> was

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
there so it's kind of sum up what I was

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.320 
there so it's kind of sum up what I was
saying<00:05:24.740> gh-325<00:05:25.740> comes<00:05:26.550> from<00:05:26.729> a<00:05:26.819> cream<00:05:27.120> that

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
saying gh-325 comes from a cream that

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.469 
saying gh-325 comes from a cream that
Crees<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.199> Kree<00:05:28.590> scout<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.610> crease<00:05:29.909> scout<00:05:30.210> is

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
Crees a Kree scout the crease scout is

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
Crees I guess fluids so to speak we're

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.540 
Crees I guess fluids so to speak we're
taken<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.319> injected<00:05:43.680> into<00:05:43.830> other<00:05:43.949> people

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
taken and injected into other people

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.610 
taken and injected into other people
it<00:05:44.729> connected<00:05:45.360> those<00:05:45.509> people<00:05:45.960> obviously

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
it connected those people obviously

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.430 
it connected those people obviously
because<00:05:47.069> now<00:05:47.219> there's<00:05:47.460> Crete<00:05:48.289> biology<00:05:49.289> in

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
because now there's Crete biology in

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.589 
because now there's Crete biology in
them<00:05:49.620> it<00:05:50.190> connected<00:05:50.699> those<00:05:51.090> people<00:05:51.389> with<00:05:51.509> the

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
them it connected those people with the

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.749 
them it connected those people with the

supreme intelligence which drove them

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.459 
supreme intelligence which drove them

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.890 
mad due to the vast amount of knowledge
the<00:05:56.460> supreme<00:05:56.759> intelligence<00:05:56.940> has<00:05:57.419> and

the supreme intelligence has and

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.689 
the supreme intelligence has and
especially<00:05:58.590> considering<00:05:59.279> that<00:05:59.430> they

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
especially considering that they

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.129 
especially considering that they
probably<00:05:59.909> weren't<00:06:00.150> prepared<00:06:00.569> to<00:06:00.810> get<00:06:00.990> that

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
probably weren't prepared to get that

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.439 
probably weren't prepared to get that
much<00:06:01.289> knowledge<00:06:01.620> in<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.830> first<00:06:02.009> place<00:06:02.360> and<00:06:03.360> I

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
much knowledge in the first place and I

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:04.490 
much knowledge in the first place and I
think<00:06:03.629> it's<00:06:03.719> what<00:06:03.810> happened<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.080> Gary<00:06:04.289> I<00:06:04.379> think

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
think it's what happened to Gary I think

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.230 
think it's what happened to Gary I think
that<00:06:04.770> we<00:06:05.009> might<00:06:05.219> see<00:06:05.490> that<00:06:05.729> start<00:06:06.090> happening

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
that we might see that start happening

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.050 
that we might see that start happening
with<00:06:06.509> Coulson<00:06:07.099> Coulson<00:06:08.099> might<00:06:08.490> have<00:06:08.580> been<00:06:08.729> may

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
with Coulson Coulson might have been may

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.969 
with Coulson Coulson might have been may
have<00:06:09.210> been<00:06:09.330> a<00:06:09.360> bit<00:06:09.539> luckier<00:06:09.990> though<00:06:10.199> because

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
have been a bit luckier though because

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.290 
have been a bit luckier though because
what<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.279> lot<00:06:11.520> of<00:06:11.550> people<00:06:11.849> seem<00:06:12.000> to<00:06:12.029> forget<00:06:12.150> that

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
what a lot of people seem to forget that

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.820 
what a lot of people seem to forget that
like<00:06:12.479> Rhys<00:06:12.659> and<00:06:13.020> Coulson<00:06:13.440> you<00:06:13.469> know<00:06:13.680> that

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
like Rhys and Coulson you know that

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.540 
like Rhys and Coulson you know that
affected<00:06:14.219> by<00:06:14.340> it

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
affected by it

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.439 
affected by it
his<00:06:15.449> mind<00:06:15.810> was<00:06:16.080> erased<00:06:16.879> so<00:06:17.879> I<00:06:17.909> think<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.300> play

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
his mind was erased so I think that play

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:19.790 
his mind was erased so I think that play
an<00:06:18.509> important<00:06:18.810> part<00:06:18.870> also<00:06:19.289> if<00:06:19.349> you<00:06:19.440> noticed

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
an important part also if you noticed

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.140 
an important part also if you noticed
when<00:06:19.949> he<00:06:19.979> went<00:06:20.250> into<00:06:20.430> that<00:06:20.520> brain<00:06:20.940> machine

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
when he went into that brain machine

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.170 
when he went into that brain machine
that<00:06:22.020> I<00:06:22.050> Rana<00:06:22.529> put<00:06:22.800> him<00:06:22.889> in<00:06:23.069> when<00:06:23.639> he<00:06:23.699> was<00:06:24.000> like

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
that I Rana put him in when he was like

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.580 
that I Rana put him in when he was like
starting<00:06:24.449> to<00:06:24.539> remember<00:06:24.659> what<00:06:25.080> happened<00:06:25.259> to

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
starting to remember what happened to

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.379 
starting to remember what happened to
him<00:06:25.710> the<00:06:26.250> first<00:06:26.520> thing<00:06:26.729> we<00:06:26.819> saw<00:06:27.029> it<00:06:27.300> looked

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
him the first thing we saw it looked

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.409 
him the first thing we saw it looked
like<00:06:27.569> space<00:06:27.979> that's<00:06:28.979> pretty<00:06:29.219> cool<00:06:29.400> but<00:06:29.580> yeah

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
like space that's pretty cool but yeah

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.939 
like space that's pretty cool but yeah
his<00:06:31.020> memory<00:06:31.349> was<00:06:31.469> erased

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
his memory was erased

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.279 
his memory was erased
so<00:06:32.520> that<00:06:32.729> probably<00:06:33.029> is<00:06:33.120> a<00:06:33.300> reason<00:06:33.690> why<00:06:33.810> this

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
so that probably is a reason why this

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.829 
so that probably is a reason why this
stuff<00:06:34.529> is<00:06:34.620> starting<00:06:34.800> to<00:06:35.009> take<00:06:35.190> a<00:06:35.370> slower<00:06:35.839> you

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:36.839 
stuff is starting to take a slower you

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.320 
stuff is starting to take a slower you
know<00:06:36.870> buildup<00:06:37.560> but<00:06:38.250> obviously<00:06:38.759> also<00:06:39.000> has<00:06:39.210> to

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
know buildup but obviously also has to

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.610 
know buildup but obviously also has to
have<00:06:39.360> solar<00:06:39.630> build-up<00:06:40.020> so<00:06:40.050> we<00:06:40.199> can<00:06:40.320> focus<00:06:40.440> on

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
have solar build-up so we can focus on

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.100 
have solar build-up so we can focus on
it<00:06:40.740> foresee

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
it foresee

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.570 
it foresee
-<00:06:41.349> so<00:06:43.289> yeah<00:06:44.289> that's<00:06:44.740> all<00:06:44.889> I<00:06:44.949> have<00:06:45.099> at<00:06:45.460> this

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
- so yeah that's all I have at this

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.999 
- so yeah that's all I have at this
