difficult<00:04:28.509> time<00:04:28.690> creating<00:04:29.110> any<00:04:29.259> interesting

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
difficult time creating any interesting

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.710 
difficult time creating any interesting
skilled<00:04:30.160> chances<00:04:30.729> so<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:30.880> get<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.120> goal<00:04:31.360> there<00:04:31.540> in

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
skilled chances so I get a goal there in

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.810 
skilled chances so I get a goal there in
the<00:04:31.870> 45th<00:04:32.440> minute<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:33.040> then<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.580> skill

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
the 45th minute and then the skill

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.270 
the 45th minute and then the skill
chance<00:04:34.090> in<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.479> 65th<00:04:35.139> minute<00:04:35.289> is<00:04:35.710> right<00:04:36.009> on

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
chance in the 65th minute is right on

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.800 
chance in the 65th minute is right on
the<00:04:36.340> ball<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:36.970> that<00:04:37.120> was<00:04:37.270> pretty<00:04:37.539> much<00:04:37.660> my

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
the ball and that was pretty much my

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.409 
the ball and that was pretty much my
best<00:04:37.990> skill<00:04:38.620> chance<00:04:38.889> in<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.310> game<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.090> just

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
best skill chance in the game so I just

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.420 
best skill chance in the game so I just
had<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.630> adjust<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.229> little<00:04:41.259> bit<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:42.009> not<00:04:42.160> having

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
had to adjust a little bit to not having

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.310 
had to adjust a little bit to not having
those<00:04:42.610> five<00:04:42.940> starts<00:04:43.300> killers<00:04:43.600> going<00:04:44.199> without

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
those five starts killers going without

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.960 
those five starts killers going without
the<00:04:44.650> running<00:04:44.919> scoop<00:04:45.160> term<00:04:45.400> is<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.639> big

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
the running scoop term is a big

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.879 
the running scoop term is a big
difference<00:04:46.210> because<00:04:46.720> well<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.139> is<00:04:47.380> so<00:04:47.650> very

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
difference because well it is so very

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.980 
difference because well it is so very
useful<00:04:48.520> but<00:04:49.000> nonetheless<00:04:49.210> we<00:04:49.600> had<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.720> few

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
useful but nonetheless we had a few

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.659 
useful but nonetheless we had a few

controlling<00:05:55.810> it<00:05:55.930> pretty<00:05:56.199> much<00:05:56.440> but<00:05:56.949> slipped

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
controlling it pretty much but slipped

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.920 
controlling it pretty much but slipped
up<00:05:57.460> in<00:05:57.639> the<00:05:57.970> end<00:05:58.180> and<00:05:58.419> he<00:05:58.570> will<00:05:58.690> actually

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
up in the end and he will actually

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.960 
up in the end and he will actually
convert<00:05:59.289> his<00:05:59.470> first<00:05:59.740> shot<00:06:00.070> and<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.729> looked

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
convert his first shot and it looked

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.390 
convert his first shot and it looked
really<00:06:01.150> really<00:06:01.750> bad<00:06:02.169> to<00:06:02.409> start<00:06:02.650> off<00:06:02.860> with<00:06:03.220> but

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
really really bad to start off with but

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.460 
really really bad to start off with but
then<00:06:03.520> he<00:06:03.610> steps<00:06:03.849> up<00:06:04.000> with<00:06:04.210> kaka<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:04.810> i<00:06:05.229> will

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
then he steps up with kaka and i will

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.110 
then he steps up with kaka and i will
say<00:06:05.710> that<00:06:05.740> he<00:06:05.919> goes<00:06:06.099> down<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.490> middle<00:06:06.789> and<00:06:07.000> i

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
say that he goes down the middle and i

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.969 
say that he goes down the middle and i
saw<00:06:07.389> my<00:06:07.539> chance<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.870> get<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.110> back<00:06:08.409> into<00:06:08.860> the

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
game with it so here he steps up and

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.950 
game with it so here he steps up and
converts<00:06:11.500> it<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:11.740> make<00:06:12.130> it<00:06:12.370> 1-1<00:06:12.940> it's<00:06:13.150> all<00:06:13.419> even

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
the box they are so very useful and we

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
and we pick up a penalty not quite sure

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.010 
and we pick up a penalty not quite sure
it<00:07:03.490> was<00:07:03.730> a<00:07:03.760> penalty<00:07:04.270> but<00:07:04.300> nonetheless<00:07:04.600> we'll

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
it was a penalty but nonetheless we'll

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.140 
it was a penalty but nonetheless we'll
take<00:07:05.350> it<00:07:05.530> but<00:07:05.980> he<00:07:06.070> will<00:07:06.250> save<00:07:06.580> it<00:07:06.610> and<00:07:06.880> the

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
take it but he will save it and the

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.020 
take it but he will save it and the
sixth<00:07:07.570> miss<00:07:07.780> off<00:07:08.169> the<00:07:08.380> series<00:07:08.770> so<00:07:09.010> far<00:07:09.040> and<00:07:09.610> i

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
sixth miss off the series so far and i

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.930 
sixth miss off the series so far and i
guess<00:07:10.300> people<00:07:10.960> start<00:07:11.380> to<00:07:11.560> read<00:07:11.770> my<00:07:11.980> my<00:07:12.460> shut<00:07:12.730> to

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
guess people start to read my my shut to

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.550 
guess people start to read my my shut to
the<00:07:12.970> right<00:07:13.210> so<00:07:13.419> i'll<00:07:13.510> probably<00:07:13.870> him<00:07:14.200> and

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
the right so i'll probably him and

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.800 
the right so i'll probably him and
change<00:07:15.310> it<00:07:15.430> up<00:07:15.520> a<00:07:15.640> little<00:07:15.669> bit<00:07:15.940> for<00:07:16.270> the<00:07:16.390> future

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
change it up a little bit for the future

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.620 
change it up a little bit for the future
episodes<00:07:17.350> I'd<00:07:17.800> try<00:07:18.250> to<00:07:18.280> get<00:07:18.640> a<00:07:18.669> go<00:07:18.940> back<00:07:19.240> to<00:07:19.419> get

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:21.970 
that to go lead but his keeper would

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.640 
that to go lead but his keeper would
just<00:07:22.300> save<00:07:22.540> and<00:07:22.690> we<00:07:22.810> get<00:07:22.990> a<00:07:23.020> chance<00:07:23.350> here<00:07:23.500> in
