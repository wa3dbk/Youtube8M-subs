in quite a few different shades the one
I<00:00:23.880> was<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.930> originally<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
I was going to originally get was the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.759 
I was going to originally get was the
lights<00:00:26.910> capade<00:00:27.330> one<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:27.810> when<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.960> sort<00:00:28.680> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
lights capade one but when I sort of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.849 
lights capade one but when I sort of
swatched<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> bit<00:00:29.849> too<00:00:30.289> chalky<00:00:31.289> for

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
swatched it it was a bit too chalky for

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.069 
swatched it it was a bit too chalky for
me<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.940> didn't<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> white<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
me and I didn't really like the white I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.260 
me and I didn't really like the white I
thought<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> would<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.730> really

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
thought I would do but I really

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.080 
thought I would do but I really
preferred<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.520> which<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.670> bit<00:00:38.820> dusty

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
preferred this one which is a bit dusty

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.040 
preferred this one which is a bit dusty
at<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> moment<00:00:40.070> but<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.129> looks<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:42.050> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
at the moment but it looks like this and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
at the moment but it looks like this and
it<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:43.860> nice<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> little<00:00:44.910> bit

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it really really nice I was a little bit

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
it really really nice I was a little bit
worried<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> would<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.719> slightly<00:00:46.020> bronzy

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
worried that would be slightly bronzy

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520 
worried that would be slightly bronzy
but<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.340> actually<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.410> gives

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
but it's actually not and it just gives

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
but it's actually not and it just gives
you<00:00:49.649> sort<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> gold<00:00:50.760> shimmery<00:00:51.539> glow

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
you sort of like a gold shimmery glow

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.920 
you sort of like a gold shimmery glow
it's<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:54.000> chalky<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> lights

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it's not really chalky like the lights

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
it's not really chalky like the lights
copied<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> chalky

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
copied one was a little bit to chalky

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
copied one was a little bit to chalky
for<00:00:57.480> me<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.980> actually<00:00:59.160> really

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
for me but this is actually really

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.569 
for me but this is actually really
really<00:00:59.670> nice<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.390> sort<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:01.190> it's<00:01:02.190> actually

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
really nice it's sort of it's actually

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.780 
really nice it's sort of it's actually
closer<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.660> my<00:01:03.930> skin<00:01:04.350> tone<00:01:04.680> than<00:01:05.489> anything

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
closer to my skin tone than anything

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.039 
closer to my skin tone than anything
else<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.450> why<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.720> looks

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
else so I think that's why it looks

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.980 
else so I think that's why it looks
better<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.979> me<00:01:08.130> anyway<00:01:08.159> personally<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.840> they

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
better for me anyway personally but they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
better for me anyway personally but they
do<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.320> darker<00:01:10.740> versions<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.400> well<00:01:11.570> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
do do darker versions as well and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
do do darker versions as well and
obviously<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.020> lights<00:01:13.260> kapade<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
obviously the lights kapade one is the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.570 
obviously the lights kapade one is the
like<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> sort<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.939> white<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.100> usually<00:01:17.100> use

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
like the sort of white one I usually use

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.410 
like the sort of white one I usually use
this<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:19.460> why<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.790> only<00:01:20.939> highlight

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
this and why are really only highlight

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.060 
this and why are really only highlight
like<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.750> cheekbone<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.320> i<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:22.979> the

moment you might be able to see it or

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and just put a little bit on but it's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.039 
and just put a little bit on but it's
really<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.210> nice<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.540> gives<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> nice

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
really really nice it gives you a nice

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.800 
really really nice it gives you a nice
sort<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.820> healthy<00:01:36.079> glow<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.380> suppose<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.130> not

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
sort of healthy glow I suppose it's not

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.090 
sort of healthy glow I suppose it's not
really<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.049> glittery<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> lot<00:01:41.070> of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
really really glittery because a lot of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.730 
really really glittery because a lot of
them<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.490> quite<00:01:41.700> glittery<00:01:42.470> but<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
them can be quite glittery but this is

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.850 
them can be quite glittery but this is
just<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.280> nice<00:01:44.460> shimmer<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:46.560> soft

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
just a really nice shimmer so the soft

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
just a really nice shimmer so the soft
and<00:01:47.040> gentle<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.670> definitely<00:01:47.820> my<00:01:48.149> favorite

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and gentle one is definitely my favorite

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.899 
and gentle one is definitely my favorite
out<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> them<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.790> too

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
out of all of them but it's not too

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.749 
out of all of them but it's not too
powdery<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.720> nice<00:01:51.930> texture<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.860> used<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
powdery it's a nice texture I used to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.600 
powdery it's a nice texture I used to
have<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.840> used<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> use<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:55.409> ELF<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:56.340> which

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
have and I used to use my ELF one which

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.310 
have and I used to use my ELF one which
was<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> liquid<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.259> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
was more of a liquid but I think I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.859 
was more of a liquid but I think I
definitely<00:01:58.649> prefer<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.250> powder<00:01:59.490> ones<00:01:59.869> so

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
definitely prefer the powder ones so

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.959 
definitely prefer the powder ones so
yeah<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:02.070> everything<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.759> now<00:02:02.820> that's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
yeah that's everything for now that's

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.680 
yeah that's everything for now that's
all<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.540> say<00:02:03.719> about<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690
