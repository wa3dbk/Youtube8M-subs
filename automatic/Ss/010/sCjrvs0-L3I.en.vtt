00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
is hot now the only difference is you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
is hot now the only difference is you
don't<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.690> things<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.350> um<00:00:49.670> IDs<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.000> guard

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
don't have things like um IDs to guard

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
don't have things like um IDs to guard
your<00:00:51.570> back<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> used<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.129> far<00:00:53.340> as

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
your back like you used to but as far as

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310 
your back like you used to but as far as
camping<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.300> maps<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.899> been<00:00:55.020> pretty

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
camping on these maps it's been pretty

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
camping on these maps it's been pretty
easy<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.800> find<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> best<00:00:56.610> work<00:00:56.850> there's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
easy I find that the best work there's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.549 
easy I find that the best work there's
what<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> call<00:00:57.390> three<00:00:57.870> level<00:00:58.170> Maps<00:00:58.320> look<00:00:58.440> at

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
what I call three level Maps look at

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.720 
what I call three level Maps look at
this<00:00:58.649> guy<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:58.980> how<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.190> using<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.609> those

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
this guy see how I'm using all those

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.639 
this guy see how I'm using all those
little<00:00:59.940> exosuits<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.840> those<00:01:01.170> little<00:01:01.379> moves

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
little exosuits and those little moves

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.009 
little exosuits and those little moves
but<00:01:02.190> I'll<00:01:02.309> tell<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> he<00:01:02.730> double<00:01:03.120> double<00:01:03.809> moved

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
but I'll tell you he double double moved

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.070 
but I'll tell you he double double moved
I<00:01:04.229> double<00:01:04.619> shot<00:01:04.830> ah<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> what<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.540> finding<00:01:06.840> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
I double shot ah so what I'm finding is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
I double shot ah so what I'm finding is
a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.650> these<00:01:07.770> maps<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.700> three

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
a lot of these maps there are three

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.550 
a lot of these maps there are three
level<00:01:09.180> maps<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.229> difference

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
level maps so that's the difference

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320 
level maps so that's the difference
between<00:01:10.619> us<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.010> ghosts<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> first

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
between us and ghosts you have a first

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.880 
between us and ghosts you have a first
floor<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.900> middle<00:01:13.140> floor<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.560> people

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
floor you have a middle floor now people

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
floor you have a middle floor now people
can<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.310> from<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> roof<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.420> are

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
can get you from the roof so there are

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.999 
can get you from the roof so there are
more<00:01:15.750> ways<00:01:15.930> people<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:16.920> I'm

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
more ways people can get you but I'm

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
more ways people can get you but I'm
noticing<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.670> lot<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.030> good<00:01:18.150> teams<00:01:18.330> are<00:01:18.509> already

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
noticing a lot of good teams are already

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
noticing a lot of good teams are already
coming<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.409> they're<00:01:19.680> holding<00:01:19.830> down

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
targets them and now the teammates gonna

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.680 
targets them and now the teammates gonna
see<00:02:40.820> then<00:02:40.940> watching<00:02:41.209> someone<00:02:41.390> hit<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.540> guys

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.280 
see that he turns red they can see him
through<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.610> screen<00:02:43.880> now<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.810> low<00:02:44.989> score

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
through the screen now it's a low score

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.840 
through the screen now it's a low score
streak<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.860> easiest<00:02:46.190> one<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.459> get<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
streak it's the easiest one to get and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.310 
streak it's the easiest one to get and
it's<00:02:47.000> probably<00:02:47.360> one<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.690> more<00:02:47.840> helpful

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
it's probably one of the more helpful

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
in a room here don't think I gotta watch

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.590 
in a room here don't think I gotta watch
out<00:02:52.040> for<00:02:52.070> now<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.760> people<00:02:53.209> can<00:02:53.330> jump<00:02:53.510> through

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
out for now is people can jump through

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.390 
out for now is people can jump through
the<00:02:53.720> window<00:02:53.750> real<00:02:54.200> quick<00:02:54.230> now<00:02:54.800> look<00:02:55.040> when<00:02:55.280> you

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
the window real quick now look when you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.729 
the window real quick now look when you
use<00:02:55.810> score<00:02:56.810> strings<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.140> think<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.470> makes<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.709> a

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
use score strings I think it makes you a

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.440

things<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.299> don't<00:04:02.510> think<00:04:02.750> LMGs<00:04:03.260> are<00:04:03.380> gonna<00:04:03.530> be

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
things I don't think LMGs are gonna be

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.229 
things I don't think LMGs are gonna be
for<00:04:03.829> this<00:04:03.920> game<00:04:04.100> either<00:04:04.250> my<00:04:04.519> first<00:04:04.790> impression

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
for this game either my first impression

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.610 
for this game either my first impression
of<00:04:05.299> this<00:04:05.450> game<00:04:05.660> assault<00:04:06.079> rifles<00:04:06.500> will

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
of this game assault rifles will

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.539 
of this game assault rifles will
probably<00:04:06.950> be<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.220> best

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
probably be the best

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.150 
probably be the best
smg's<00:04:08.360> are<00:04:08.540> great<00:04:08.780> but<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.260> be<00:04:09.380> honest<00:04:09.680> unless

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
smg's are great but to be honest unless

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.620 
smg's are great but to be honest unless
you're<00:04:10.459> gonna<00:04:10.549> do<00:04:10.760> what's<00:04:11.000> called<00:04:11.209> close

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
counter camping which I probably will do

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.160 
counter camping which I probably will do
