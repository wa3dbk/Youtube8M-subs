know<00:03:38.660> if<00:03:38.750> I'm<00:03:38.840> explaining<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.470> right<00:03:39.709> so

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
know if I'm explaining that right so

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.199 
know if I'm explaining that right so
with<00:03:40.310> all<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.459> being<00:03:40.639> said<00:03:40.849> I<00:03:41.030> haven't

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
with all that being said I haven't

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.360 
with all that being said I haven't
pulled<00:03:41.450> any<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.870> couple<00:03:42.170> packs<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:42.680> maybe<00:03:43.250> I

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
pulled any in a couple packs so maybe I

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.530 
pulled any in a couple packs so maybe I
was<00:03:43.549> just<00:03:43.609> getting<00:03:43.940> lucky<00:03:44.239> but<00:03:44.359> I<00:03:44.419> was

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
was just getting lucky but I was

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.210 
was just getting lucky but I was
thinking<00:03:44.900> if<00:03:45.019> those<00:03:45.200> things<00:03:45.230> are<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.739> common

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
thinking if those things are that common

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.339 
thinking if those things are that common
then<00:03:46.669> you<00:03:46.819> can<00:03:47.030> make<00:03:47.150> 12k<00:03:47.750> off<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.109> them<00:03:48.230> you're

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
then you can make 12k off of them you're

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.720 
then you can make 12k off of them you're
going<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.530> make<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.919> price<00:03:49.160> of<00:03:49.370> your<00:03:49.519> pack

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
going to make the price of your pack

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.599 
going to make the price of your pack
back<00:03:50.060> plus<00:03:50.989> an<00:03:51.230> extra<00:03:51.319> 5k<00:03:51.769> if<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.220> understand

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
back plus an extra 5k if you understand

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:53.710 
back plus an extra 5k if you understand
what<00:03:52.669> I'm<00:03:52.790> saying<00:03:52.819> kind<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.299> like<00:03:53.419> with<00:03:53.599> the

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
what I'm saying kind of like with the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.930 
what I'm saying kind of like with the
turkeys<00:03:54.109> and<00:03:54.260> Thanksgiving<00:03:54.859> promotion<00:03:55.340> but

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
turkeys and Thanksgiving promotion but

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.300 
turkeys and Thanksgiving promotion but
clearly<00:03:56.269> these<00:03:56.599> things<00:03:56.930> aren't<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.440> common

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
clearly these things aren't that common

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.280 
clearly these things aren't that common
because<00:03:58.849> I<00:03:59.090> pulled<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.599> bunch<00:03:59.810> of<00:03:59.959> my<00:04:00.079> first

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
because I pulled a bunch of my first

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.530 
because I pulled a bunch of my first
couple<00:04:00.620> packs<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.880> haven't<00:04:02.180> pulled<00:04:02.329> any

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
couple packs and I haven't pulled any

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.140 
couple packs and I haven't pulled any
sense<00:04:02.870> then<00:04:03.109> so<00:04:03.440> we<00:04:04.040> got<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.220> Reggie<00:04:04.459> Bush<00:04:04.819> Road

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
sense then so we got a Reggie Bush Road

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.059 
sense then so we got a Reggie Bush Road
to<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.389> playoffs<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:08.620> nothing<00:04:09.620> good<00:04:09.829> there

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
to the playoffs and nothing good there

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.099 
to the playoffs and nothing good there
so<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.430> was<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.790> crap<00:04:11.150> pack<00:04:11.389> I<00:04:11.630> mean<00:04:11.780> I'm<00:04:11.900> kind

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
so that was a crap pack I mean I'm kind

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.440 
so that was a crap pack I mean I'm kind
of<00:04:12.200> happy<00:04:12.380> right<00:04:12.739> now<00:04:12.769> with<00:04:13.250> move<00:04:13.639> my<00:04:13.849> results

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
at this point just because of the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.890 
at this point just because of the
collectibles<00:04:16.970> it'd<00:04:17.180> be<00:04:17.299> nice<00:04:17.539> to<00:04:17.570> get

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
collectibles it'd be nice to get

these things let's just check my binder
real<00:05:50.690> quick<00:05:50.930> here<00:05:51.169> and<00:05:51.639> make<00:05:52.639> sure<00:05:52.669> that<00:05:53.029> this

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
real quick here and make sure that this

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.589 
real quick here and make sure that this
is<00:05:53.449> the<00:05:53.630> case<00:05:53.779> so<00:05:54.139> we're<00:05:54.289> gonna<00:05:54.380> go<00:05:54.680> to<00:05:55.599> quality

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
is the case so we're gonna go to quality

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:03.999 
is the case so we're gonna go to quality
is<00:05:57.099> elite<00:05:58.099> and<00:06:00.520> program<00:06:01.520> is<00:06:02.740> ultimate<00:06:03.740> freeze

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
is elite and program is ultimate freeze

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.580 
is elite and program is ultimate freeze
I<00:06:04.400> got<00:06:04.849> seven<00:06:05.210> them<00:06:05.389> so<00:06:05.479> I<00:06:05.539> lost<00:06:06.020> count<00:06:06.229> at<00:06:06.409> some

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
I got seven them so I lost count at some

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.589 
I got seven them so I lost count at some
point<00:06:06.830> but<00:06:07.310> I<00:06:07.370> got<00:06:07.520> seven<00:06:07.940> I<00:06:08.029> figure<00:06:08.419> I<00:06:08.449> can

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
point but I got seven I figure I can

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:14.589 
point but I got seven I figure I can
make<00:06:08.960> about<00:06:09.789> 11<00:06:10.789> k<00:06:11.060> off<00:06:11.300> of<00:06:11.539> these<00:06:11.860> so<00:06:13.599> probably

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
make about 11 k off of these so probably

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.050 
make about 11 k off of these so probably
around<00:06:14.810> seven<00:06:15.529> and<00:06:15.800> I'm<00:06:15.889> saying<00:06:16.400> 11<00:06:16.729> k<00:06:16.879> each

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
around seven and I'm saying 11 k each

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.830 
around seven and I'm saying 11 k each
after<00:06:17.449> tax<00:06:17.719> so<00:06:17.990> I<00:06:18.229> could<00:06:19.009> probably<00:06:19.250> make<00:06:19.490> 75<00:06:20.419> to

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
after tax so I could probably make 75 to

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.230 
after tax so I could probably make 75 to
80<00:06:21.020> k<00:06:21.379> just<00:06:21.889> selling<00:06:22.279> these<00:06:22.370> right<00:06:22.729> now<00:06:22.940> and

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
80 k just selling these right now and

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.939 
80 k just selling these right now and
that's<00:06:23.690> probably<00:06:24.050> what<00:06:24.440> I'm<00:06:24.529> going<00:06:24.680> to<00:06:24.710> do

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
that's probably what I'm going to do

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.100 
that's probably what I'm going to do
because<00:06:25.250> I<00:06:25.789> mean<00:06:26.090> like<00:06:26.360> I<00:06:26.539> said<00:06:26.569> in<00:06:26.870> my<00:06:26.900> video
