00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.430
 had the lack of street 13 to come and 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.890

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.409
 music is not only business if

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.210
 event without authorization despite not 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.070
 have the permission of the 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.770
 municipality of lima calle13oficial 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.140
 He started his concert a few minutes ago 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.390
 with crazy party even though the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.180
 respectable departed happy from the plaza san 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.040
 martín not everything was perfect so it was 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.790
 this area of ​​the historic center post 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.790
 back street 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.109
 all good with 13th street there is no 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.269
 problem there are people who may like it 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.909
 there are people who may not like it but 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.090
 there are rules because there are rules to follow 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.859
 what do you think because they come here do not 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 they give authorization for the concert they go to 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.459
 any public square to see if they do 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.459
 that in puerto rico 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.620
 because it is a great irresponsibility 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.349
 for all public events where there is a 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.209
 large number of people must have 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.459
 then a civil defense certification 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.680
 know that everything will be fine this 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.189
 Of course, nothing has happened, but 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.650
 has been able to pass a tragedy very well the 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.469
 music that is not the theme the theme is that 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.959
 to do these things you have to ask for a 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.209
 authorization is not treated but as the 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.389
 people believe not because I come 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.239
 spontaneously here to live the music not 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.389
 there are no codes and rules to follow 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.849
 and these guys unfortunately rené 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.440
 Perez and his people have not fulfilled them like this 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.090
 that the fine has to fall 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.099
 that's the thing and also the dirty thing that 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.569
 have left in the plaza san martin the 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:37.119
 you have to clean the municipality 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.119
 7 with 45 minutes let's pray
