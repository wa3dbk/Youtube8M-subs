like<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.560> far<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.460> I'm<00:02:39.880> actually<00:02:40.090> going

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
like this so far and I'm actually going

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.090 
like this so far and I'm actually going
to<00:02:40.420> get<00:02:40.570> something<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:41.260> underneath<00:02:41.650> here<00:02:41.890> so

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
to get something for underneath here so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.560 
to get something for underneath here so
it's<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.310> little<00:02:42.460> bit<00:02:42.550> easier<00:02:42.970> for<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.270> guys<00:02:43.360> to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
it's a little bit easier for you guys to

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.840 
it's a little bit easier for you guys to
see<00:02:43.780> since<00:02:44.050> it's<00:02:44.230> like<00:02:44.350> black<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.860> black<00:02:45.130> so

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
see since it's like black on black so

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.100 
see since it's like black on black so
I'll<00:02:45.910> be<00:02:46.030> right<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:46.360> okay<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.330> i<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.750> got<00:02:49.930> a

blue one that i'm actually going to do

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.180 
blue one that i'm actually going to do
another<00:02:52.240> DIY<00:02:52.690> line<00:02:53.260> i<00:02:53.290> got<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> couple<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.070> these

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
another DIY line i got a couple of these

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.340 
another DIY line i got a couple of these
actually<00:02:54.970> today<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.750> really<00:02:56.020> big

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.760 
one and i'm going to show you how to
make<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.660> smaller<00:02:58.870> but<00:02:59.350> i'm<00:02:59.440> just<00:02:59.470> going<00:02:59.740> to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
make it smaller but i'm just going to

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.100 
make it smaller but i'm just going to
put<00:02:59.950> this<00:02:59.980> actually<00:03:00.580> underneath<00:03:00.880> here<00:03:01.360> just

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
put this actually underneath here just

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.660 
put this actually underneath here just
to<00:03:02.200> kind<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.470> show<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.710> guys<00:03:03.810> what<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:04.930> doing

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
to kind of show you guys what I'm doing

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.830 
to kind of show you guys what I'm doing
so<00:03:06.670> it's<00:03:06.760> going<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.940> look<00:03:07.000> funny<00:03:07.300> but<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.690> not

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
so it's going to look funny but it's not

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.980 
so it's going to look funny but it's not
going<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.050> look<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.670> afterwards<00:03:12.990> okay

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
going to look like this afterwards okay

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.610 
going to look like this afterwards okay
so<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.410> stands<00:03:14.770> out<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.010> little<00:03:15.370> bit<00:03:15.580> better

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
so that stands out a little bit better

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.199 
so that stands out a little bit better
what<00:03:17.620> we're<00:03:17.770> going<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.950> do<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.459> just<00:03:18.490> take<00:03:18.970> our

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
what we're going to do is just take our

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.360 
what we're going to do is just take our
strings<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.990> we're<00:03:20.770> just<00:03:20.920> going<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.070> pull

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
strings and we're just going to pull

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.699 
strings and we're just going to pull
them<00:03:21.550> out<00:03:21.730> now<00:03:22.630> when<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.870> pull<00:03:23.080> them<00:03:23.200> out<00:03:23.380> they

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
them out now when you pull them out they

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.090 
them out now when you pull them out they
should<00:03:24.010> roll<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:25.140> would<00:03:26.140> do<00:03:26.350> them<00:03:26.590> one<00:03:26.860> at<00:03:26.890> a

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
should roll I would do them one at a

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.070 
should roll I would do them one at a
time<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:28.150> i'll<00:03:28.480> show<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.690> how<00:03:28.780> I'm<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.020> to

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
time and i'll show you how I'm going to

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:39.570 
time and i'll show you how I'm going to
do<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.830> top<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:31.060> kind<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.450> pull<00:03:31.720> it

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.730 

and<00:03:39.700> then<00:03:40.420> if<00:03:40.540> they<00:03:40.660> weren't<00:03:40.900> cut<00:03:41.260> evenly

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
and then if they weren't cut evenly

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.970 
and then if they weren't cut evenly
before<00:03:42.360> it's<00:03:43.360> going<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.630> give<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.410> more

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
before it's going to give you a more

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.870 
before it's going to give you a more
even<00:03:45.250> look<00:03:46.380> if<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.590> decide<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.160> want<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> go<00:03:48.550> a

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
even look if you decide you want to go a

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.290 
even look if you decide you want to go a
little<00:03:49.120> bit<00:03:49.330> bigger<00:03:49.600> for<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.860> holes<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:51.610> you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
little bit bigger for the holes on you

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:59.190 
little bit bigger for the holes on you
can<00:03:52.480> cut<00:03:52.750> now<00:03:53.850> shut<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:54.970> crossed<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:59.020> do

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
can cut now shut it crossed but just do

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.720 
can cut now shut it crossed but just do
that<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.560> whole<00:03:59.710> way<00:03:59.830> down<00:03:59.860> keep<00:04:00.460> stretching

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
that the whole way down keep stretching

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:10.520 
that the whole way down keep stretching
them

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.120 

okay<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:11.590> once<00:04:12.130> they<00:04:12.430> are<00:04:12.780> rolled<00:04:13.920> they<00:04:14.920> should

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
okay so once they are rolled they should

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.509 
okay so once they are rolled they should
look<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.840> there<00:04:17.100> look<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.190> little<00:04:18.340> bit

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
look like this there look a little bit

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.710 
look like this there look a little bit
more<00:04:19.799> put<00:04:20.799> together<00:04:20.920> I<00:04:21.250> guess<00:04:21.610> even<00:04:22.510> if<00:04:22.600> you

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
more put together I guess even if you

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.450 
more put together I guess even if you
did<00:04:22.900> cut<00:04:23.140> them<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.290> little<00:04:23.410> bit<00:04:23.740> off<00:04:23.920> you're<00:04:24.310> not

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
did cut them a little bit off you're not

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.310 
did cut them a little bit off you're not
going<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:24.700> be<00:04:24.790> able<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:25.090> tell<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:26.050> what<00:04:26.200> we're

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
going to be able to tell so what we're

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.780 
going to be able to tell so what we're
going<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.500> do<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.920> we're<00:04:27.100> going<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.280> start<00:04:27.580> up

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
going to do is we're going to start up

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.760 
going to do is we're going to start up
here<00:04:27.820> by<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.780> first<00:04:29.170> one<00:04:29.440> we're<00:04:29.620> going<00:04:29.710> to

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
here by the first one we're going to

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.130 
here by the first one we're going to
ignore<00:04:30.010> this<00:04:30.460> right<00:04:30.820> now<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.300> I'm<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:31.930> going

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
ignore this right now and I'm just going

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.950 
ignore this right now and I'm just going
to<00:04:32.230> call<00:04:32.470> them<00:04:32.650> numbers<00:04:33.010> like<00:04:33.250> 1<00:04:33.280> 2<00:04:33.820> 3<00:04:33.960> we're

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
to call them numbers like 1 2 3 we're

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.900 
to call them numbers like 1 2 3 we're
going<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.140> take<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.530> first<00:04:35.830> one<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.400> what

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
going to take the first one and what

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.640 
going to take the first one and what
we're<00:04:37.030> going<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.210> do<00:04:37.420> is<00:04:37.720> take<00:04:38.110> them<00:04:38.380> and

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
we're going to do is take them and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.260 
we're going to do is take them and
you're<00:04:39.460> going<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.640> have<00:04:39.730> your<00:04:39.880> two<00:04:40.030> fingers

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
you're going to have your two fingers

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.630 
you're going to have your two fingers
like<00:04:40.750> this<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.070> then<00:04:42.070> you're<00:04:42.220> going<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.370> flip

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
like this and then you're going to flip

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.540 
like this and then you're going to flip
it<00:04:42.700> around<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.480> it<00:04:43.540> makes<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.900> loop<00:04:44.140> like<00:04:44.550> that

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
it around so it makes a loop like that

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.490 
it around so it makes a loop like that
and<00:04:46.210> then<00:04:46.660> you're<00:04:46.810> going<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:46.960> take<00:04:47.050> your<00:04:47.230> two

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
and then you're going to take your two

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.140 
and then you're going to take your two
fingers<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.100> grab<00:04:49.500> number<00:04:50.500> two<00:04:50.910> okay<00:04:51.910> and

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
fingers and grab number two okay and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.460 
fingers and grab number two okay and
then<00:04:52.780> pull<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.320> through<00:04:55.110> okay<00:04:56.110> so<00:04:56.170> it<00:04:56.440> looks

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
then pull that through okay so it looks

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.280 
then pull that through okay so it looks
like<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.640> then<00:04:58.330> once<00:04:58.630> you<00:04:58.840> get<00:04:59.110> that

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
like that and then once you get that

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.080 
like that and then once you get that
through<00:04:59.770> you're<00:05:00.400> going<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.580> twist<00:05:00.760> it<00:05:01.030> like

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
through you're going to twist it like

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.660 
through you're going to twist it like
this<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.840> then<00:05:02.410> you're<00:05:02.590> going<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.770> grab<00:05:03.130> for

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
this and then you're going to grab for

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.510 
this and then you're going to grab for
loop<00:05:03.910> number<00:05:04.180> three<00:05:04.750> or<00:05:05.650> four<00:05:05.860> string<00:05:06.160> three

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
loop number three or four string three

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.250 
loop number three or four string three
and<00:05:06.850> you're<00:05:07.210> just<00:05:07.330> going<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.570> push<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:07.840> up

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
and you're just going to push that up

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.300 
and you're just going to push that up
through<00:05:09.190> here<00:05:10.050> okay<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:11.680> i'm<00:05:11.770> going<00:05:11.890> to<00:05:11.950> try<00:05:12.250> to

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
through here okay so i'm going to try to

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.830 
through here okay so i'm going to try to
put<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:12.640> down<00:05:12.850> and<00:05:13.150> try<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.390> show<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:13.750> a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
put this down and try to show you a

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.750 
put this down and try to show you a
little<00:05:14.020> bit<00:05:14.200> better<00:05:14.350> that<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.680> can<00:05:14.950> we're<00:05:15.670> going

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
little bit better that I can we're going

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.400 
little bit better that I can we're going
to<00:05:15.850> take<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.570> first<00:05:16.870> string<00:05:17.200> and<00:05:19.260> like<00:05:20.260> to

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
to take the first string and like to

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.020 
to take the first string and like to
make<00:05:20.560> Sherman<00:05:20.950> frame<00:05:21.990> okay<00:05:23.880> we're<00:05:24.880> going<00:05:24.970> to

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
make Sherman frame okay we're going to

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.420 
make Sherman frame okay we're going to
take<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.450> first<00:05:25.690> string<00:05:26.080> and<00:05:26.410> I'm<00:05:27.220> going<00:05:27.370> to

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
take the first string and I'm going to

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.790 
take the first string and I'm going to
take<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:27.610> with<00:05:27.760> my<00:05:27.910> two<00:05:27.970> fingers<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.870> we're

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
take it with my two fingers and we're

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.220 
take it with my two fingers and we're
going<00:05:29.950> to<00:05:29.980> loop<00:05:30.190> it<00:05:30.310> around<00:05:30.510> to<00:05:31.510> make<00:05:31.540> a<00:05:31.690> circle

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
going to loop it around to make a circle

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.700 
going to loop it around to make a circle
so<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.220> have<00:05:33.340> a<00:05:33.370> little<00:05:33.669> loop<00:05:33.960> okay<00:05:34.960> then<00:05:35.560> you

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
so you have a little loop okay then you

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.250 
so you have a little loop okay then you
grab<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.280> second<00:05:36.669> one<00:05:36.850> push<00:05:37.450> this<00:05:37.660> loop<00:05:38.020> up

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
grab the second one push this loop up

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.850 
grab the second one push this loop up
through<00:05:39.010> and<00:05:39.310> push<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.419> down<00:05:40.620> I'm<00:05:41.620> going<00:05:41.740> to

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
through and push it down I'm going to

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.440 
through and push it down I'm going to
have<00:05:41.950> that<00:05:42.190> then<00:05:42.850> you're<00:05:43.000> going<00:05:43.090> to<00:05:43.150> grab

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
have that then you're going to grab

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.360 
have that then you're going to grab
third<00:05:44.050> loop<00:05:44.380> but<00:05:44.770> what<00:05:44.890> you're<00:05:44.980> going<00:05:45.100> to<00:05:45.190> do

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
third loop but what you're going to do

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.360 
third loop but what you're going to do
is<00:05:45.580> take<00:05:46.090> your<00:05:46.240> fingers<00:05:46.630> and<00:05:46.870> make<00:05:47.860> it<00:05:48.040> around

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
is take your fingers and make it around

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.440 
is take your fingers and make it around
like<00:05:49.150> you're<00:05:49.330> going<00:05:49.480> to<00:05:49.570> tie<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:50.110> shoe<00:05:50.230> and<00:05:50.919> then

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
like you're going to tie a shoe and then

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.170 
like you're going to tie a shoe and then
push<00:05:52.450> this<00:05:52.630> back<00:05:52.870> up<00:05:52.930> through<00:05:53.880> okay<00:05:54.880> so<00:05:54.940> you're

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
push this back up through okay so you're

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
push this back up through okay so you're
going<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.330> take<00:05:55.390> it<00:05:55.600> i'll<00:05:55.810> show<00:05:55.960> you<00:05:56.020> one<00:05:56.169> more

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
going to take it i'll show you one more

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.610 
going to take it i'll show you one more
time<00:05:56.350> oops<00:05:58.110> okay<00:05:59.110> so<00:05:59.169> you're<00:05:59.380> going<00:05:59.470> to<00:05:59.530> take

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
time oops okay so you're going to take

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.770 
time oops okay so you're going to take
that<00:05:59.770> loop<00:06:00.190> you're<00:06:01.030> going<00:06:01.180> to<00:06:01.240> twist<00:06:01.450> it

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
that loop you're going to twist it

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.290 
that loop you're going to twist it
around<00:06:02.020> once<00:06:02.560> you're<00:06:03.460> going<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.640> take<00:06:03.940> it<00:06:04.150> and

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
around once you're going to take it and

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.530 
around once you're going to take it and
then<00:06:04.660> push<00:06:04.870> it<00:06:04.900> up<00:06:05.320> through<00:06:06.240> okay<00:06:07.240> so<00:06:07.300> you're

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
then push it up through okay so you're

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.380 
then push it up through okay so you're
going<00:06:07.630> to<00:06:07.720> do<00:06:07.900> this<00:06:08.160> twist<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.340> take<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.180> next

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
going to do this twist it take the next

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.860 
going to do this twist it take the next
one<00:06:10.540> and<00:06:10.930> pull<00:06:11.410> it<00:06:11.440> up<00:06:11.530> through<00:06:12.810> okay<00:06:13.810> so

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
one and pull it up through okay so

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.040 
one and pull it up through okay so
you're<00:06:14.169> going<00:06:14.260> to<00:06:14.320> take<00:06:14.410> it<00:06:14.760> twist<00:06:15.760> it<00:06:15.910> once<00:06:16.050> so

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
you're going to take it twist it once so

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.740 
you're going to take it twist it once so
it's<00:06:17.169> still<00:06:17.350> loop<00:06:17.789> grab<00:06:18.789> the<00:06:19.060> next<00:06:19.270> one<00:06:19.539> and

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
it's still loop grab the next one and

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.310 
it's still loop grab the next one and
put<00:06:20.140> it<00:06:20.169> through

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.740 

maybe<00:06:24.320> I'll<00:06:24.470> do<00:06:24.620> a<00:06:24.650> video<00:06:24.919> on<00:06:25.100> just<00:06:25.850> how<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:26.210> do

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
maybe I'll do a video on just how to do

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.950 
maybe I'll do a video on just how to do
weaving<00:06:27.410> if<00:06:27.650> you<00:06:28.370> guys<00:06:28.550> are<00:06:28.970> familiar<00:06:29.300> with<00:06:29.630> it

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
weaving if you guys are familiar with it

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.000 
weaving if you guys are familiar with it
but<00:06:30.169> once<00:06:30.800> you<00:06:31.370> get<00:06:31.580> it<00:06:31.669> done<00:06:32.590> it<00:06:33.590> can<00:06:33.860> go

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
but once you get it done it can go

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.340 
but once you get it done it can go
pretty<00:06:34.190> fast<00:06:37.660> okay<00:06:38.660> so<00:06:38.720> we're<00:06:39.020> just<00:06:39.050> going<00:06:39.260> to

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
pretty fast okay so we're just going to

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.370 
pretty fast okay so we're just going to
take<00:06:39.530> that<00:06:39.970> cut<00:06:40.970> this<00:06:41.150> in<00:06:41.360> half<00:06:41.389> right<00:06:42.199> in<00:06:42.320> the

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
take that cut this in half right in the

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.060 
take that cut this in half right in the
middle<00:06:42.530> and<00:06:42.860> then<00:06:43.669> we're<00:06:43.820> going<00:06:43.940> to<00:06:44.000> tie<00:06:44.240> it

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
middle and then we're going to tie it

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:52.629 
middle and then we're going to tie it
just<00:06:46.070> in<00:06:46.190> the<00:06:46.280> not<00:06:50.680> do<00:06:51.680> a<00:06:51.710> double<00:06:52.040> knot<00:06:52.190> make

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
just in the not do a double knot make

00:06:52.639 --> 00:07:03.550 
just in the not do a double knot make
sure<00:06:52.669> it's<00:06:53.000> really<00:06:53.150> tight<00:06:53.620> pull<00:06:54.620> it<00:06:54.710> tight
