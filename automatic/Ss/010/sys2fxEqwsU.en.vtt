00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 and the first thing we're going to do is make 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.120
 a circle 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.460
 let's use this here 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.179
 to make circles 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.870
 then let's put any part 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:27.960
 the center is misplaced 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.410
 and from then on we are going to do 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.580
 circulated a large circle 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.610
 in this case the size because it's going to be 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.900
 so a paper mill requires to put it in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.079
 my bedroom 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.239
 for then 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.579
 but some of us use 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.899
 now we are going to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.850
 to cut and paste it into another piece of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.190
 paperboard 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 how hard is it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.119
 it is not necessary that on the cardboard and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.369
 then pass it on the cardboard if you like what 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.530
 they can do front and then delete them 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.620
 it depends on you 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.870
 then good is cut 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.870
 with a knife a cutter 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.869
 and this we can cover it arrive once 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.020
 with the paper that you want, I'm going to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.020
 use 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.400
 but no 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.470
 as I have enough of this then I'm going 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.470
 to use it together 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.980
 and since then 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.980
 we only go as 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.440
 to draw it and cut it 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.260
 we will cut and then we will paste it with 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.640
 our rubber bar well I have not done 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.940
 a little smaller was like this now because 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.790
 is reduced because if I was not going to 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.700
 leaving very large is narrow so size 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.190
 more or less from my hand 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.220
 just run 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.950
 and now what I'm going to do is put 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.380
 the top part and I'm going to use this 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.870
 cardboard if you have cardboard 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.900
 duplex that is the thickest one because much 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.530
 better than how I have it, I 'm going to 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.070
 do with this they are going to use silicone to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.440
 paste it but now I do not have and 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.440
 that mico points is very rubber 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:06.070
 and let's start putting from the 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.519
 center but I do not go out yes a 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.519
 little bit 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.519
 two 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.530
 with their 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.530
 In the local 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.800
 and the paper we're going to go running 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.800
 as if it were a rabbit 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.220
 it is not this this this challenge only 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.470
 let's go the cardboard we're going to go 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.910
 molding 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.910
 as if it were a glass 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.269
 also this way will it be 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:08.290
 I'm going to wait for it to dry a little then 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:12.490
 this one has to be this right and there 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:18.280
 let's cut all the excess 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:20.470
 and then everything being kicked and what 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.700
 now let's do is cut it in the 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.700
 height that we want 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.790
 all right 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.120
 well I 'm going to cover it only for the 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.850
 part of the outside part of inside 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.340
 cowgirl if I put that pink color 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:19.760
 I'm just going to report it flush 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:24.520
 I'm not going to apply gum on everything 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.520
 cardboard and let's go then 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.149
 now 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.569
 if you like you can follow 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:21.379
 remembering putting here something else or 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.379
 here the fines 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:29.400
 well girls this way fits the 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:31.500
 tachito and here I put the bow you 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.750
 we can continue to decorate it as 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.170
 I've run out of silicone and nothing else 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.320
 has left and well you know what they put there 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.330
 next to the dressing table to fight and their 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.520
 cottons because the disc and this 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.550
 so we already have something to decorate 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.400
 but then they are encouraged to do it 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.260
 keep decorating your room and 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.780
