gotta love trash find computers one of

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.800 
gotta love trash find computers one of
my<00:00:05.430> co-workers<00:00:05.670> was<00:00:06.060> driving<00:00:06.569> down<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.720> road

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
my co-workers was driving down the road

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.990 
my co-workers was driving down the road
and<00:00:07.200> saw<00:00:07.410> that<00:00:07.710> there<00:00:07.830> was<00:00:08.010> four<00:00:08.490> computers

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
and saw that there was four computers

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.320 
and saw that there was four computers
sitting<00:00:09.240> there<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.690> picked<00:00:10.139> him<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.820> he

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
sitting there and picked him up and he

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.629 
sitting there and picked him up and he
kept<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.960> had<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> standard<00:00:14.009> ATX

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
kept the one that had a standard ATX

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.720 
kept the one that had a standard ATX
case<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.420> was<00:00:15.540> like<00:00:15.719> aluminum<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.730> I

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
case that was like aluminum and I

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.679 
case that was like aluminum and I
brought<00:00:18.630> home<00:00:18.840> three<00:00:19.170> Dells<00:00:20.300> this<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.480> here

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
brought home three Dells this one here

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.570 
brought home three Dells this one here
has<00:00:21.810> actually<00:00:21.960> turned<00:00:22.350> out<00:00:22.470> pretty<00:00:22.650> nice<00:00:23.010> now

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
has actually turned out pretty nice now

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.240 
has actually turned out pretty nice now
that<00:00:23.789> I've<00:00:23.910> put<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> RAM<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.500> stuff<00:00:25.740> back<00:00:25.980> in

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
that I've put the RAM and stuff back in

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.460 
that I've put the RAM and stuff back in
they<00:00:26.849> had<00:00:27.029> hard<00:00:27.300> drives<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.779> them<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.050> no<00:00:28.199> RAM

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
they had hard drives in them but no RAM

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.410 
they had hard drives in them but no RAM
and<00:00:28.830> no<00:00:28.980> cd-rom<00:00:29.939> go<00:00:30.330> figure<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:32.090> one<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and no cd-rom go figure this one here is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.760 
and no cd-rom go figure this one here is
a<00:00:33.450> Optiplex<00:00:34.230> GX<00:00:34.739> 270<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:36.329> got<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.770> 3.2

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
a Optiplex GX 270 it's got a 3.2

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.760 
a Optiplex GX 270 it's got a 3.2
gigahertz<00:00:38.100> Pentium<00:00:38.760> 4<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.590> believe<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
gigahertz Pentium 4 I believe it's a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
gigahertz Pentium 4 I believe it's a
Northwood<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:42.059> quite<00:00:42.450> positive<00:00:43.079> on

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
Northwood I'm not not quite positive on

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.900 
Northwood I'm not not quite positive on
that<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.770> runs<00:00:43.920> hot<00:00:44.100> whatever<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.789> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that I know it runs hot whatever it is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.430 
that I know it runs hot whatever it is
because<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.360> got<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> big<00:00:45.690> heat<00:00:45.870> pipe<00:00:46.079> cooler

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
because it's got a big heat pipe cooler

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.420 
because it's got a big heat pipe cooler
on<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:47.120> I<00:00:48.120> managed<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.930> dig<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.260> 2<00:00:49.649> gigs<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.160> RAM

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
on it I managed to dig up 2 gigs of RAM

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.889 
on it I managed to dig up 2 gigs of RAM
so<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.300> got<00:00:51.480> 2<00:00:52.440> gigs<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.949> DDR<00:00:53.730> 400<00:00:54.660> running

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so it's got 2 gigs of DDR 400 running

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
so it's got 2 gigs of DDR 400 running
and<00:00:55.050> dual<00:00:55.199> channel<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:57.829> also<00:00:58.829> installed<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and dual channel and also installed the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
and dual channel and also installed the
geforce<00:01:01.010> 7600<00:01:02.010> GS<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:03.570> has<00:01:03.750> onboard<00:01:04.229> Gigabit

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
geforce 7600 GS it has onboard Gigabit

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.670 
geforce 7600 GS it has onboard Gigabit
LAN<00:01:05.159> which<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
LAN which I really like it's one of the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.910 
LAN which I really like it's one of the
main<00:01:08.070> reasons<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.490> fixed<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.450> first

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
main reasons I fixed this one up first

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
main reasons I fixed this one up first
and<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> cool<00:01:11.220> thing<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.000> little

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and the cool thing is that little

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.210 
and the cool thing is that little
sticker<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.320> top<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> Windows<00:01:14.430> XP<00:01:14.580> Pro

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
sticker on top there is a Windows XP Pro

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
sticker on top there is a Windows XP Pro
license<00:01:17.220> sticker<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.869> other<00:01:19.020> two<00:01:19.200> systems

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
license sticker the other two systems

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.700 
license sticker the other two systems
also<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.009> window<00:01:20.549> stickers<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.299> ones

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
also have window stickers on them ones

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.789 
also have window stickers on them ones
XP<00:01:22.710> Pro<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> other<00:01:23.340> ones<00:01:23.520> Windows<00:01:23.850> 2000

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
XP Pro and the other ones Windows 2000

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:32.780 
XP Pro and the other ones Windows 2000
this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.360> C<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.930> GX<00:01:28.400> 150<00:01:29.810> Pentium<00:01:30.810> 3<00:01:31.790> it's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
this is a C so GX 150 Pentium 3 it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.899 
this is a C so GX 150 Pentium 3 it's
also<00:01:32.970> missing<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> RAM<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> drives

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
also missing the RAM and and the drives

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.300 
also missing the RAM and and the drives
that<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:38.150> precision<00:01:39.150> 340<00:01:40.310> which

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that one there is a precision 340 which

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330 
that one there is a precision 340 which
is<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> Pentium<00:01:42.060> 4<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.659> uses<00:01:43.049> our<00:01:43.320> dram<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is a Pentium 4 that uses our dram and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.690 
is a Pentium 4 that uses our dram and
since<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> RAM<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.180> missing<00:01:46.220> it's<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.549> not

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
since the RAM is missing it's really not

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.300 
since the RAM is missing it's really not
worth<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> cost<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> bunch<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.920> RAM<00:01:50.130> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
worth the cost to put a bunch of RAM in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.710 
worth the cost to put a bunch of RAM in
there<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.790> don't<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.060> any<00:01:51.240> argue<00:01:51.540> RAM

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
there because I don't have any argue RAM

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510 
there because I don't have any argue RAM
on<00:01:51.960> me<00:01:52.140> I'm<00:01:52.560> probably<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> strip

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
on me I'm probably just going to strip

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.889 
on me I'm probably just going to strip
this<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.060> parts<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.750> only

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this one for parts because it's only

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.149 
this one for parts because it's only
like<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.610> 1.8<00:01:56.610> gigahertz<00:01:56.640> Pentium<00:01:57.540> 4<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
like a 1.8 gigahertz Pentium 4 and the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190 
like a 1.8 gigahertz Pentium 4 and the
only<00:01:59.310> thing<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.729> really<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.689> maybe<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
only thing I can really use is maybe the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.920 
only thing I can really use is maybe the
drive<00:02:01.469> learning<00:02:01.950> rails<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.390> other<00:02:03.540> one<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
drive learning rails the other one the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.810 
drive learning rails the other one the
Pentium<00:02:04.259> 3<00:02:04.290> I'm<00:02:04.829> able<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.189> do<00:02:05.340> something<00:02:05.700> with

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
Pentium 3 I'm able to do something with

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.690 
Pentium 3 I'm able to do something with
that<00:02:05.850> have

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
that have

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.969 
that have
really<00:02:06.939> dug<00:02:07.899> into<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.410> got<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.649> see<00:02:08.770> how<00:02:08.860> much

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
really dug into it I got to see how much
