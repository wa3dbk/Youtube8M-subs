00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 the problem tells us multiply 6 by 14 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.450
 simplify your answer and write it as 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.940
 a mixed number then right here 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.420
 we have 6 and the good thing is that we know 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.640
 the whole integer we can 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.410
 write as a fraction therefore 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.529
 if it makes sense to take this 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.740
 multiplication of fractions on 6 what 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 we can see how 6 out of 1 and we have 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.009
 6 the 6 over 1 is the same as 6 that is 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.010
 a whole number and I'm going to 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.340
 multiply I'm going to multiply it by a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.680
 fourth for a quarter then we're going to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 multiply it by a quarter and the father 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 is that we also know how to multiply 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 fractions we know what is this for this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.600
 and this for this one so this is going to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.550
 look exactly the same as 6 let me 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.489
 put it with a green a little stronger 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.329
 6 that will multiply that will 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.859
 multiply to 16 which multiplies to 1 and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.040
 All this 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.060
 all this divided by 1 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.500
 between 1 that multiplies to 4 that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.080
 multiply in turn to 4 ok now date 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 realize that this is exactly the same 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.640
 that 6 for 1 that we know how to do 6 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.570
 for a 9 6 divided by 1 by 4 1 by 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.940
 4 is 4 now we already have is like 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.150
 answer but if you realize 6 about 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.880
 4 can be simplified a little 6 on 4 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.560
 is exactly the same as dividing the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.229
 top part between 2 and the bottom 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.240
 we can divide both parts between 2 well 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.160
 let's do it I'm going to divide the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.750
 top part between 2 and the part of 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.729
 down I'll also divide it between 2 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.890
 because they are even numbers and so I am going to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.670
 can get a much more response 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.680
 simplest most simplified 6 between 2 is 3 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.340
 to 4 between 2 is 2 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.470
 three media this is my answer already 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.650
 seen as a simplified fraction 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.110
 now here it does not end the thing tells me that 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.050
 write this answer as a number 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.630
 mixed then for that what I 'm going to 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.240
 to do is take the top part and the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.990
 I will put with this color here I have 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.050
 three ok I'm going to take the 3 and I'm going to 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.750
 divide between the denominator remembers 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.950
 that three means is exactly the same 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.590
 that 3 between 2 3 between 2 and good if you 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.330
 you realize here we have amp that fits 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.880
 once once 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.930
 1 for 2 is 2 then this I'm going to 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.000
 remove 2 and I have a residue of 1 and I have 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.110
 and let me put it with another color a 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.870
 residue of 1 here over 1 therefore 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.989
 I can say that 3 media I can see it from 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.590
 the following way as an integer like 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.680
 an integer is just this 1 from here this 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.720
 a 9 here and I have a residue of 1 so 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.900
 I have an entire 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.680
 a half the denominator is conserved that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.510
 it's just this one medium and it's already here 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.460
 I have three means is the same as a 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.410
 whole in half seen with a number 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.230
 mixed therefore would already have the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.880
 answer to this problem now if 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.260
 we want to understand a little better 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.390
 what is happening in the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.130
 multiplication of these two fractions or 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.930
 rather of a whole number by a 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.580
 fraction we can visualize the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.640
 next way you think if 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.470
 I do around here a rectangle will 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.020
 make a rectangle here this is going to 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.230
 be a rectangle and I will copy it 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.290
 several times let me copy it ok let's 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.020
 copy control cm and then I'm going to 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.240
 ok I have it stick around here and I will 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.459
 put it right here and I'll copy it 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.440
 four times ok I'm going to paste another one here 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.000
 ok and I'm going to hit another one here ok and let's go 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.580
 to do it twice more 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.280
 I'm going to stick it here, ok, it's more this 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.170
 I'm going to take it off because I'm going to 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.350
 put with another color if you realize 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.099
 here I have six times a quarter up 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.489
 here until here we take 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:15.099
 once another quarter dawn again another 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.889
 fourth there goes again and here we take 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.100
 another room there goes again is to say 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.130
 I have a room plus a room plus a 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.100
 fourth plus a quarter all these rooms 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.350
 these four rooms form a turn 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.020
 larger rectangle that is an integer 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.750
 this here is the same as a whole 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.960
 so let me click here this 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.610
 is an integer now here we carry four 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.010
 rooms but really what we are 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.199
 doing is multiply six times a 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.139
 fourth therefore I need two so 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.120
 let me now take this other color 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.800
 and I will put here the two that I need 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.070
 here I have one more 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.729
 ok more or less like that ok, I'm going to 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:02.659
 copy and I'm going to paste it to copy 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.580
 and I'm going to hit it here ok and then 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:07.189
 here I have two other two that I need 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.270
 therefore here I take four quarters 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:14.210
 plus a quarter plus plus a quarter plus this 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.240
 it's the same as six times a quarter six 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.659
 rooms now these two rooms if you 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.969
 account is half of another integer if 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.680
 we take each other here to another 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.199
 of green and I'm going to put more or less 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.960
 well and another green ok I'll put them 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.969
 here these are still not in our 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.009
 multiplication these are empty 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.740
 really the only thing I'm taking are 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:40.189
 two more rooms this here and this one 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.529
 here therefore this is half of a 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:45.199
 whole whole I can say that a 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:48.289
 fourth is not a room is a means a 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.629
 medium and here I have a means of another 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.270
 whole and then when I add one more 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:56.509
 a medium gives me exactly if I add 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.409
 these two gives me a whole an integer that 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.409
 It's just what I have here 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.080
 medium let me look for the color of 2 a 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.150
 medium and it is already right to the answer 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.910
 to which I come seen in a way 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.600
 visual of luxury we see ourselves in the 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.600
 next video
