 That it really is a theater show should hear that

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.109

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.560
 yes first own production is correct and too 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.560
 start betting 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.940
 where is the theater show about this 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.780
 theater show is actually about mine 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.060
 brain 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.829
 my mind and that is also very plunge 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.889
 see the logo my head that from the 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.720
 cold withdrawn and the viewers go 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.569
 actually in my brain and in line 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.120
 emotions and my thoughts and going to see 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.159
 how i mine 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.010
 obstacles my emotion use everything to 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.349
 my personal problems are running us 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.069
 actually but that is deep 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.930
 yes it is very deep and yes that is theater 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.660
 present express something very new and not 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.140
 so flat and easy 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.250
 ok interesting 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.130
 and where inspiration came from 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.489
 actually it actually started with me 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.489
 a kind of 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.920
 Communion who actually wanted between the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.810
 good graves in dutch so the 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.710
 toppers from the Netherlands so I loved it 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.530
 too little 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.510
 if your gate was blue, add each other and 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.210
 then I actually got the idea of â€‹â€‹me 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.310
 want to do something with this group with this one 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.900
 people and eventually a taunt came 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.180
 looking at me then year it would be nice 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.330
 to find a theater show 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.070
 and then I saw it is the moment 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.250
 so I had my people together 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.620
 I am a sight a story a message 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.570
 and so looks really come on 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.770
 yes, because are real toppers in the Netherlands 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.080
 that indeed more dance in you 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.580
 theater show how you combine them 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.440
 all because of course we have too 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.550

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.550
 you can just train enough 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.560
 it is almost impossible to combine 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.840
 I think I have for this show 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.930

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.460
