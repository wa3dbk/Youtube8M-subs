00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.980
 hello everyone we continue our experiment with 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.590
 planting nonstandard potatoes means 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.970
 passed today 14 16 number landing 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.650
 produced 24 i.e. 3 weeks have passed 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.189
 approximately and see what we have 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.560
 came out 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.260
 so let's start with the first bed so that I don't 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.680
 confused is the potato which was 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.279
 planted without any peel without eyes 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.950
 ogle potatoes from potatoes here were 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.829
 Only the stalks are planted here these stolons 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.800
 or a cat means it’s what we’ve seen 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.920
 whether they ascended surprisingly they 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.809
 Weak look like small such 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.559
 I will just show the difference we will understand why 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.600
 mean but they came up see from all 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.940
 the beds on the other side I don’t see yet 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.309
 I do not see I do not see a gallon I see 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.899
 for this thorn thorn is not 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.100
 we can withdraw do not save even through 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 the straw climbs nothing clean eye 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.830
 creep in here is a little ring means we are logged in 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.220
 logged in logged in see they planted 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.860
 all the same here coming off there went that is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 This suggests that this is really so 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.430
 way we breed potatoes or rather 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.229
 to grow but not a fact what will be there 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.290
 harvest so we will look after her 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.170
 then let's see what came out of it by the way 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.000
 I want to open now to see what is 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.350
 let's turn you around and see here 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.759
 the streets 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.540
 alive or here it is under the table I'm trying 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:56.670
 shoot and shows and and watch yourself not 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 so I understood that he lives alive and he lives 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.310
 By the way , you see his roots too 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.770
 the roots are there, so let's see 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 will there be potatoes 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.860
 how much will be here and generally will be for 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.880
 we are so little weak to know 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.470
 let's go further to the second bed 2 bed 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.269
 I apologize a little for Rostov my husband is not 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.910
 managed at the checkout because it broke in 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.640
 orders kind of drove 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.060
 and five places means 2 we have a little bit 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.340
 Better bed also took 3 weeks here 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.040
 lapels were planted a little bit i 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.040
 peel cut it remember and here's how a 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.090
 that he has 10 excellent inputs more 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:47.760
 first so i tell you again they are more 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.940
 better go by themselves what a handsome man 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.650
 they went better but here than 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.799
 previous to loop pier not even 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.450
 attach to the hilka so i think that 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.670
 here even the coil will be bigger to them 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.500
 the best and the third potato with large 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.420
 salons 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.230
 this which was i was sleeping potatoes 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.140
 left one third of the legs there 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.070
 potatoes see she has more strength 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.660
 itself a little longer effect 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:22.209
 one-to-one all went even through this 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.820
 three weeks notice three weeks usually 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.440
 the potatoes just sprout 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.120
 who puts potatoes in the ground two or three 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.900
 weeks it only needs a coil in order 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.410
 to log in 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.440
 after three weeks she started to bloom 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.750
 so guys but what's the solution if you 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.079
 want to rustle 39 cute potato win 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.770
 just do not tear off these here stallone 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.340
 long 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.360
 people that grow and plant with 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.030
 them their usual landing but not 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.310
 cutting off and here you are in a week please 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.750
 coil blooms the only thing let's 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.370
 we will look further because one 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.110
 the matter has blossomed the second thing that there will be 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.600
 underneath she let 's find now let 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.830
 here it is not very easy to rake 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.830
 I wonder what is not here 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:14.380
 My husband and I are intrigued by such 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.299
 landing for the first time 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:23.140
 just afraid that we dry up and there 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:25.390
 nothing will be this table for me 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.410
 I wonder if there will be potatoes here 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:32.560
 whether she is going to be out there usually 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.810
 potatoes, I will explain what I mean 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.980
 there is a bush and under it is a potato 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.140
 under the bush 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.690
 and here the potatoes should be if 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.700
 this method will work landing method 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.240
 there will be potatoes here and here and here and 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.590
 here so here will be everywhere . 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.420
 popov so my guetta he became this 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.060
 lies here from here and here and so 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.830
 about 20 25 centimeters long who 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.050
 remembers who watched the first video 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.760
 who did not look see what i have 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.880
 due because more will not be on again 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.470
 new explain what and how sadil 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.170
 view the experiment on the unusual 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:09.100
 planting potatoes first roller where there 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.660
 planting potatoes goes and you immediately all 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.730
 understand that this experiment 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.330
 what did it do and so on 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.500
 sat here but look guys 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.920
 the best came in where it was 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.410
 half means a little bit worse than looks 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.280
 like potatoes that only you 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.140
 I left me and went up but completely 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.620
 nondescript so far at least 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:38.690
 looks like a potato that was planted 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:41.080
 Only here these these void coupons as 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.280
 they are still making well, that is, you understand 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.500
 so let's see maybe this 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.130
 the potatoes just won't be later but too 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.860
 there will be potatoes here and that way 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.960
 you can sit down stay with us and 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.140
 watch for further events 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.690
 I promised a video about how we hoard what 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.610
 spray large potatoes and how it 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.390
 working so far you have seen the beetle on 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.150
 so there is no coil 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.520
 wait for his appearance if he appears i 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:16.550
 Be sure to remove a separate role as well 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.810
 Follow in the third video I will show you 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.330
 There is firstly further development 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.280
 these two beds first 2 where 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.400
 rather bad she went up what happened to her 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.680
 further and thirdly show what is in the bottom 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:34.130
 is a potato made there? 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.260
 how much is there and so on after 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.570
 flowering in italy during flowering 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.950
 let's see what will happen next stay with 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.470

 too we will be happy to see because 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.250
 we are very interested in this topic as 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.160
 make it easier to work with potatoes like 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.980
 facilitate the landing and how the image so 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.540
 the method can still be salted potatoes here 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.540
 thank you all bye
