application fluid formula it's real

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.250 
application fluid formula it's real
simple<00:01:40.390> it's<00:01:40.659> 32<00:01:41.140> ounces<00:01:41.440> of<00:01:41.590> water<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.240> for

solid drops of dishwashing liquid

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.200 
solid drops of dishwashing liquid
I<00:01:47.440> would<00:01:47.830> strongly<00:01:48.310> suggest<00:01:48.580> obviously

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
I would strongly suggest obviously

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.420 
I would strongly suggest obviously
putting<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.540> water<00:01:49.720> in<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.470> container<00:01:50.830> first

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
putting the water in the container first

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.910 
putting the water in the container first
and<00:01:51.729> then<00:01:51.820> adding<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.590> dishwashing<00:01:53.590> liquid

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
and then adding the dishwashing liquid

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.750 
and then adding the dishwashing liquid
afterwards<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.670> then<00:01:56.430> mixing<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.549> up<00:01:57.640> a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
afterwards and then mixing it up a

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.250 
afterwards and then mixing it up a
little<00:01:57.880> bit<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.450> make<00:01:58.600> sure<00:01:58.630> it's<00:01:58.960> evenly

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
little bit to make sure it's evenly

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.640 
little bit to make sure it's evenly
distributed<00:02:00.990> application<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.140> these<00:02:02.290> stripes

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
distributed application of these stripes

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.450 
distributed application of these stripes
is<00:02:03.090> impossible<00:02:04.090> without<00:02:04.330> application<00:02:04.630> fluid

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
is impossible without application fluid

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.779 
is impossible without application fluid
so<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.490> strongly<00:02:06.939> suggest<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:08.640> mix<00:02:09.640> them

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
so I strongly suggest that you mix them

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.899 
so I strongly suggest that you mix them
up<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.590> single<00:02:11.590> job<00:02:11.950> stripe<00:02:12.370> kit<00:02:12.640> on

up for a single job stripe kit on

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.890 

all<00:02:19.360> right<00:02:19.510> let's<00:02:19.720> talk<00:02:19.900> about<00:02:19.959> application

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
all right let's talk about application

all right let's talk about application

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
the decal over time obviously it will

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.600 
the decal over time obviously it will
continue<00:05:56.610> to<00:05:57.410> erode<00:05:58.410> and<00:05:58.440> perhaps<00:05:59.310> even

remove the decal removing it's very

remove the decal removing it's very
unlikely<00:06:01.770> but<00:06:02.070> I<00:06:02.190> see<00:06:02.430> it<00:06:02.550> it<00:06:03.390> prevents<00:06:03.930> that

unlikely but I see it it prevents that

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.120 
unlikely but I see it it prevents that
simply<00:06:05.250> when<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.960> majority<00:06:06.960> of<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.130> liquid

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.130 
simply when the majority of the liquid
is<00:06:08.340> removed<00:06:09.950> folded<00:06:10.950> under<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:12.020> from<00:06:13.020> the
