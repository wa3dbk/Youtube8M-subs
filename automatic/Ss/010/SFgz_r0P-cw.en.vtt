alright<00:00:01.650> here's<00:00:01.920> my<00:00:02.010> latest<00:00:02.480> creation<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:03.720> call

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
alright here's my latest creation I call

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.780 
alright here's my latest creation I call
this<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.440> lid<00:00:04.859> motor<00:00:05.130> top<00:00:05.490> charger<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:07.790> it's

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
this the lid motor top charger and it's

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.549 
this the lid motor top charger and it's
kind<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.179> culmination<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.929> everything<00:00:10.080> I've

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
kind of a culmination of everything I've

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.060

are the eyes the white LEDs which are

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280 
are the eyes the white LEDs which are
going<00:01:19.560> back<00:01:20.340> into<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> battery<00:01:21.240> -<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.170> all

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
going back into the battery - so it all

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.320 
going back into the battery - so it all
worked<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.740> quite<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> neat<00:01:23.909> very

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
worked up quite a kind of neat very

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.630 
worked up quite a kind of neat very
simple<00:01:24.780> circuit<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.220> combination

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
simple circuit it's just a combination

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.050 
simple circuit it's just a combination
some<00:01:26.880> things<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.299> learned<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:29.159> runs

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
some things that I learned and it runs

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.200 
some things that I learned and it runs
on<00:01:30.270> anywhere<00:01:30.600> from<00:01:30.840> about<00:01:31.140> 4<00:01:31.740> 5<00:01:32.280> volts<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.880> up

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
on anywhere from about 4 5 volts on up

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.899 
on anywhere from about 4 5 volts on up
to<00:01:33.360> 12<00:01:33.750> I've<00:01:34.229> got<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> couple<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.829> 9<00:01:35.070> volts<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to 12 I've got a couple of 9 volts on it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.190 
to 12 I've got a couple of 9 volts on it
right<00:01:36.090> now

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
right now

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.460 
right now
this<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.310> drive<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
this one is the drive this is the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.859 
this one is the drive this is the
charging<00:01:40.470> battery<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> wanted<00:01:42.630> was

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
charging battery and what I wanted was

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
charging battery and what I wanted was
something<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> didn't<00:01:43.560> make<00:01:43.590> any<00:01:43.680> noise<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
something that didn't make any noise and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
something that didn't make any noise and
that<00:01:44.850> thing<00:01:45.030> doesn't<00:01:45.360> make<00:01:45.450> any<00:01:45.630> noise<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:46.110> all

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that thing doesn't make any noise at all

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.149 
that thing doesn't make any noise at all
it's<00:01:47.159> totally<00:01:47.790> quiet<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.869> ball<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.290> great<00:01:49.500> but

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it's totally quiet the ball is great but

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.749 
it's totally quiet the ball is great but
the<00:01:50.340> ball<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.729> very<00:01:50.970> very<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.570> noisy<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
the ball is very very very noisy and

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
the ball is very very very noisy and
until<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> get<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.210> problem<00:01:54.509> solved<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.350> went

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
until I get that problem solved I went

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.069 
until I get that problem solved I went
to<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.890> now<00:01:56.490> that's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.850> neodymium<00:01:57.149> magnet

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
to this now that's a neodymium magnet

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.590 
to this now that's a neodymium magnet
attracting<00:01:58.740> another<00:01:59.040> neodymium<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
attracting another neodymium this is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.959 
attracting another neodymium this is
almost<00:02:01.170> completely<00:02:01.680> levitated<00:02:02.549> off<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
almost completely levitated off that

almost completely levitated off that
class<00:02:03.420> plate<00:02:03.810> right<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.250> what

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
class plate right there and this is what

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.080 
class plate right there and this is what
it<00:02:05.640> looks<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.090> there's<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.860> ball<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.310> hematite

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it looks like there's a ball a hematite

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.869 
it looks like there's a ball a hematite
this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.050> sizzler<00:02:10.489> magnets<00:02:11.489> and

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
this is the the sizzler magnets and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.010 
this is the the sizzler magnets and
that's<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.209> hematite

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
that's a hematite

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.590 
that's a hematite
magnet<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> north<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.030> south<00:02:15.270> facing

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
magnet with the north and south facing

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.230 
magnet with the north and south facing
out<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.830> neo<00:02:17.100> magnet<00:02:17.700> attracting

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
out a little neo magnet attracting

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.030 
out a little neo magnet attracting
another<00:02:18.480> neo<00:02:18.720> magnet<00:02:19.230> which<00:02:19.740> partially

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
another neo magnet which partially

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.360 
another neo magnet which partially
levitates<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> top<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:22.350> when<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.860> first<00:02:23.190> did

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
levitates the top and when I first did

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.520 
levitates the top and when I first did
this<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:23.910> using<00:02:24.090> Abedini<00:02:24.660> circuit<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.320> this

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
this I was using Abedini circuit on this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.500 
this I was using Abedini circuit on this
and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.040> feel<00:02:26.670> around<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.240> pull<00:02:27.450> around

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
and then I feel around and pull around

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.380 
and then I feel around and pull around
it<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.100> made<00:02:29.100> my<00:02:29.250> own<00:02:29.280> circuit<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.150> that's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it and made my own circuit but that's

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.880 
it and made my own circuit but that's
the<00:02:30.570> latest<00:02:30.720> thing<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.140> look<00:02:31.320> on<00:02:31.470> right<00:02:31.740> now

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the latest thing I look on right now

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.870 
the latest thing I look on right now
that's<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:33.360> lid<00:02:33.600> motor<00:02:34.850> top<00:02:35.870> charger<00:02:36.870> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
that's the the lid motor top charger and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.430 
that's the the lid motor top charger and
been<00:02:38.880> testing<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.750> looks<00:02:39.780> pretty<00:02:40.050> darn

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
been testing on it it looks pretty darn

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.530 
been testing on it it looks pretty darn
good
