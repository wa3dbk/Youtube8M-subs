00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
it down to five but then that would be

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.440 
it down to five but then that would be
really<00:03:28.920> really<00:03:29.100> like<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.090> episode<00:03:30.329> that

there's<00:03:33.570> no<00:03:33.690> point<00:03:33.989> going<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.440> something

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
there's no point going to something

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.340 
there's no point going to something
which<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.070> probably<00:03:35.280> over<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.870> video<00:03:37.140> is

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
which is probably over and the video is

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.420 
which is probably over and the video is
because<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.709> I'll<00:03:37.799> just<00:03:37.829> make<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.250> file

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
because that I'll just make the file

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.229 
because that I'll just make the file
size<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.760> lot<00:03:39.000> bigger<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.570> make<00:03:39.840> no<00:03:41.239> quality

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
size a lot bigger and make no quality

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.680 
size a lot bigger and make no quality
difference<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.769> just<00:03:44.130> kept<00:03:44.370> on<00:03:44.489> same<00:03:44.850> audio

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
difference so I just kept on same audio

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.009 
difference so I just kept on same audio

doesn't actually take that long magic
Aziz<00:04:38.280> really<00:04:38.610> pretty<00:04:38.820> quickly<00:04:39.090> at<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.360> moment

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
Aziz really pretty quickly at the moment

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.980 
Aziz really pretty quickly at the moment
but<00:04:41.040> it<00:04:41.280> actually<00:04:41.610> ends<00:04:42.090> up<00:04:42.150> converting<00:04:42.600> it

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
but it actually ends up converting it

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.860 
but it actually ends up converting it
after<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.800> after<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:45.000> ripped<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.450> ends

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
after you that after you ripped it ends

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.230 
after you that after you ripped it ends
up<00:04:45.930> converting<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.620> file<00:04:47.120> rendering<00:04:48.120> it

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
up converting the file rendering it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.990 
up converting the file rendering it
stuff<00:04:48.510> like<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:48.720> for<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.170> desired<00:04:50.000> settings

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
stuff like that for the desired settings

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.720 
stuff like that for the desired settings
that<00:04:51.240> you've<00:04:51.420> chosen<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:52.230> mean<00:04:53.220> they<00:04:53.310> spit<00:04:53.550> on

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
that you've chosen I mean they spit on

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.880 
that you've chosen I mean they spit on
it<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.180> that<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.690> does<00:04:54.840> take<00:04:55.140> longer<00:04:55.170> than<00:04:55.770> it

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
it and that and does take longer than it

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.190 
it and that and does take longer than it
does<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.190> Rick<00:04:56.400> so<00:04:57.060> say<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.390> takes<00:04:57.690> half<00:04:57.990> an

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
does to Rick so say it takes half an

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.010 
does to Rick so say it takes half an
hour<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.440> rip<00:04:59.090> it<00:05:00.090> will<00:05:00.210> probably<00:05:00.450> take<00:05:00.630> about

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
hour to rip it will probably take about

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.460 
hour to rip it will probably take about
45<00:05:01.890> minutes<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.640> render<00:05:03.120> so<00:05:03.660> that'll<00:05:04.260> leave

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
45 minutes to render so that'll leave

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.470 
45 minutes to render so that'll leave
you<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:05.280> an<00:05:05.400> hour<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:05.730> a<00:05:05.790> half<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.090> do<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.330> in

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
you like an hour and a half to do it in

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.600 
you like an hour and a half to do it in
that's<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.260> full<00:05:07.470> movie<00:05:07.890> about<00:05:08.130> an<00:05:08.280> hour<00:05:08.400> and

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
that's the full movie about an hour and

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.940 
that's the full movie about an hour and
a<00:05:08.640> half<00:05:08.730> this<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:09.810> just<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.110> 20-minute<00:05:10.530> clips

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
a half this is just a 20-minute clips

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.060 
a half this is just a 20-minute clips
that<00:05:11.160> will<00:05:11.280> probably<00:05:11.460> only<00:05:11.670> take<00:05:12.000> about<00:05:12.590> 40<00:05:13.590> 45

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
that will probably only take about 40 45

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.130 
that will probably only take about 40 45
minutes<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.640> do<00:05:14.760> so<00:05:15.000> I'll<00:05:15.540> pause<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.050> video

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
minutes to do so I'll pause the video

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.800 
minutes to do so I'll pause the video
now<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.980> I'll<00:05:17.580> come<00:05:17.790> back<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.240> when<00:05:18.630> it's

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
finished okay so it's the loungers

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.400 
finished okay so it's the loungers
finish<00:05:25.970> riffing<00:05:26.970> actual<00:05:27.330> DVD<00:05:27.750> now<00:05:28.020> it's<00:05:28.230> just

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
finish riffing actual DVD now it's just

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
doing the rendering and stuff like that

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.430 
doing the rendering and stuff like that
so<00:05:30.510> it's<00:05:30.720> going<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:30.930> take<00:05:31.080> about<00:05:31.230> another

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
so it's going to take about another

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.430 
so it's going to take about another
three<00:05:31.890> minutes<00:05:32.040> to<00:05:32.310> do<00:05:32.490> that<00:05:33.200> so<00:05:34.200> I'll<00:05:34.290> come
