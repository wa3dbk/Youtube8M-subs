this is a Qi or Chi wireless charger I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.140 
this is a Qi or Chi wireless charger I
don't<00:00:20.160> know<00:00:20.220> what's<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.640> with<00:00:20.670> these<00:00:20.850> crazy

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
but apparently Qi pronounced Qi and so

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.480 
but apparently Qi pronounced Qi and so
this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> Qi<00:00:24.930> inductive<00:00:25.650> wireless<00:00:26.160> charging

something that wirelessly charged my

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.120 
something that wirelessly charged my
Nexus<00:00:30.570> 5<00:00:30.679> set<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.769> down

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
Nexus 5 set it down

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.770 
Nexus 5 set it down
charging<00:00:32.700> because<00:00:32.940> throughout<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> day

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
charging because throughout the day

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.270 
charging because throughout the day
sometimes<00:00:33.840> use<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> more<00:00:34.710> times<00:00:34.920> than<00:00:35.040> others

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
sometimes use it more times than others

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.440 
sometimes use it more times than others
and<00:00:35.430> I'm<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.730> charge<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.270> quick

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and I'm going to charge it really quick

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.580 
and I'm going to charge it really quick
before<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.170> something

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
before I got to do something

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
before I got to do something
set<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> down<00:00:38.160> starts<00:00:38.640> charging<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
set it down starts charging and so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.970

your cable which is a mini USB or a
micro<00:01:14.760> USB<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.270> never<00:01:15.360> remember<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
micro USB I can never remember what it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.450 
micro USB I can never remember what it
is<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> smaller<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
is but it's a smaller one the one the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.149 
is but it's a smaller one the one the
Nexus<00:01:17.880> 5<00:01:18.090> uses<00:01:18.479> pretty<00:01:18.930> sure<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.110> micro<00:01:19.470> -

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
Nexus 5 uses pretty sure it's micro -

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.700 
Nexus 5 uses pretty sure it's micro -
regular<00:01:20.460> USB<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.720> doesn't<00:01:22.229> come<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
regular USB and so doesn't come with a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310 
regular USB and so doesn't come with a
wall<00:01:23.040> charging<00:01:23.759> mount<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
wall charging mount which is kind of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
wall charging mount which is kind of
weird<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.740> thought<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.090> plug<00:01:27.240> directly

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
weird I thought but it can plug directly

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
weird I thought but it can plug directly
into<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.840> computer<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
into your computer and then here is the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.060 
into your computer and then here is the
wireless<00:01:30.210> charging<00:01:30.780> mat<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> comes<00:01:32.009> with

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
wireless charging mat that it comes with

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
wireless charging mat that it comes with
and<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:32.939> has<00:01:33.090> four<00:01:33.299> rubber<00:01:33.479> feet<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and so this has four rubber feet in the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.330 
and so this has four rubber feet in the
bottom<00:01:34.259> I'll<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.530> showing<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:34.860> closer<00:01:35.130> up

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
bottom I'll be showing some closer up

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.179 
bottom I'll be showing some closer up

whenever you set a phone on top of it it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.139 
whenever you set a phone on top of it it
will<00:01:43.829> start<00:01:44.070> blinking<00:01:44.280> blue<00:01:44.670> letting<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
will start blinking blue letting you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.480 
will start blinking blue letting you
know<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.570> charging<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> a

know that it's charging now this is a
good<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.820> bad<00:01:47.939> thing<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.600> blue

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
light you know it's nice you can tell

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.740 
light you know it's nice you can tell
other<00:01:50.579> whether<00:01:51.000> or<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.360> device<00:01:51.570> is

bed at night when you're trying to sleep

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.480 
bed at night when you're trying to sleep
it's<00:01:54.899> kind<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.200> bright<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.070> keep<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.430> in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it's kind of bright and so keep that in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.950 
it's kind of bright and so keep that in
mind<00:01:56.729> whenever<00:01:56.969> you're<00:01:57.149> setting<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.780> or

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
mind whenever you're setting this up or

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.389 
mind whenever you're setting this up or
wherever<00:01:58.140> you're<00:01:58.469> setting<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.189> kind

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
wherever you're setting it up it's kind

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.010 
wherever you're setting it up it's kind
of<00:01:59.460> bright<00:01:59.610> whenever<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.479> dark<00:02:00.689> I'll<00:02:00.840> try<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
of bright whenever it's dark I'll try to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.709 
of bright whenever it's dark I'll try to
show<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.469> video<00:02:01.680> we'll<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.210> it's

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
show that on video we'll see and so it's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.330 
show that on video we'll see and so it's
a<00:02:03.810> nice<00:02:03.990> matte<00:02:04.229> finish<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.130> it's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
a nice matte finish I really like it's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.709 
a nice matte finish I really like it's
not<00:02:05.579> glossy<00:02:05.820> doesn't<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.420> attract

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
not glossy doesn't really attract

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.650 
not glossy doesn't really attract
fingerprints<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:07.350> anything<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.700> Nexus<00:02:09.179> 5

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
fingerprints or anything and the Nexus 5

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.839 
fingerprints or anything and the Nexus 5
I'm<00:02:10.020> adds<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.379> little<00:02:10.500> thin<00:02:10.770> case<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.370> charge

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
I'm adds a little thin case on it charge

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.290 
I'm adds a little thin case on it charge
is<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.030> fine<00:02:12.420> with<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> case<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.050> on

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
is just fine with the case so on

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.480 
is just fine with the case so on
and<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:14.320> kind<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.710> have<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.010> get<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.340> there

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
and you kind of have to get it on there

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.920 
and you kind of have to get it on there
somewhat<00:02:16.000> straight<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:16.540> not<00:02:16.600> going<00:02:16.870> to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
somewhat straight it's not going to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.570 
somewhat straight it's not going to
charge<00:02:17.140> whenever<00:02:17.710> it's<00:02:17.890> like<00:02:18.010> crooked<00:02:18.400> like

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
charge whenever it's like crooked like

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.550 
charge whenever it's like crooked like
this<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.090> don't<00:02:19.360> know<00:02:19.450> how<00:02:19.750> easy<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.290> to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
this I don't know how easy that is to

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.740 
this I don't know how easy that is to
see<00:02:20.770> but<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.520> kind<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:21.970> set<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.360> right

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
see but you kind of have to set it right

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.220 
see but you kind of have to set it right
there

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
there

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.190 
there
set<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.860> somewhat<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.400> middle<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.900> up<00:02:25.900> and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
set it somewhat in the middle and up and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.540 
set it somewhat in the middle and up and
down<00:02:26.230> perpendicular<00:02:26.650> with<00:02:27.220> how<00:02:27.370> it's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
down perpendicular with how it's

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.250 
down perpendicular with how it's
actually<00:02:27.670> going<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.110> kind

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
actually going and so you have to kind

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.420 
actually going and so you have to kind
of<00:02:29.350> keep<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.800> mind<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.130> can't<00:02:30.370> just

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
of keep that in mind you can't just

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.890 
of keep that in mind you can't just
throw<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:30.970> not<00:02:31.300> look<00:02:31.540> at<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.870> just

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
throw it on and not look at it and just

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.330 
throw it on and not look at it and just
walk<00:02:32.170> away<00:02:32.320> because<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.740> might<00:02:32.890> not<00:02:33.040> start

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
walk away because it might not start

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.470 
walk away because it might not start
charging<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:33.850> already<00:02:34.030> happened<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> me<00:02:34.450> a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
charging it's already happened to me a

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.120 
charging it's already happened to me a
few<00:02:34.540> times<00:02:34.750> but<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.590> doesn't<00:02:35.800> happen<00:02:35.890> too

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
few times but it doesn't happen too

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.680 
few times but it doesn't happen too
often<00:02:36.310> as<00:02:36.820> long<00:02:36.970> as<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.150> get<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.360> somewhat

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
often as long as you get it somewhat

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.970 
often as long as you get it somewhat
centered<00:02:37.960> on<00:02:38.110> there<00:02:38.290> you'll<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.530> perfectly

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
centered on there you'll be perfectly

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.970 
centered on there you'll be perfectly
fine<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.600> said<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.380> works<00:02:41.740> with

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
fine but like I said this works with

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.310 
fine but like I said this works with
cases<00:02:42.460> with<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> Nexus<00:02:42.940> 5<00:02:43.180> works<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.020> thin

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
cases with the Nexus 5 works with a thin

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.610 
cases with the Nexus 5 works with a thin
case<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.800> Nexus<00:02:45.070> 7<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:47.290> does<00:02:47.440> work

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
case of the Nexus 7 and so it does work

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.190 
case of the Nexus 7 and so it does work
with<00:02:47.800> multiple<00:02:48.040> sized<00:02:48.430> devices<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.240> there's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
with multiple sized devices and there's

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.420 
with multiple sized devices and there's
really<00:02:50.320> not<00:02:50.470> too<00:02:50.620> much<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.860> can<00:02:50.980> say<00:02:51.190> about<00:02:51.220> it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
really not too much I can say about it

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.140 
really not too much I can say about it
it<00:02:51.700> works

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
it works

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.730 
it works
um<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.720> blue<00:02:52.870> lights<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.230> little<00:02:53.320> bit<00:02:53.440> bright

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
um the blue lights a little bit bright

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
vertically I don't know but every time

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.420 
vertically I don't know but every time
I've<00:03:07.960> used<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:08.500> been<00:03:08.650> horizontal<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.370> it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
I've used it it's been horizontal and it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.100 
I've used it it's been horizontal and it
works<00:03:09.610> just<00:03:09.760> fine<00:03:10.030> now<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.660> aren't<00:03:10.870> going<00:03:11.080> to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
works just fine now you aren't going to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.620 
works just fine now you aren't going to
have<00:03:11.170> 100%<00:03:11.800> charge<00:03:12.370> rate<00:03:12.640> I'm<00:03:13.030> charging<00:03:13.450> with

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
the cables still going to be a little

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.260 
the cables still going to be a little
bit<00:03:14.890> better<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.280> have<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> little<00:03:15.730> bit<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.060> loss

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
bit better you have a little bit of loss

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.300 
bit better you have a little bit of loss
whenever<00:03:16.990> you're<00:03:17.140> using<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.500> wireless<00:03:17.890> charger

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
but it's really not that much if you

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.390 
but it's really not that much if you
just<00:03:20.290> need<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.620> give<00:03:20.770> it<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.950> quick<00:03:21.130> charge

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
might move it over to my computer

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.860 
might move it over to my computer

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
plugged into a wall charger and it just

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.449 
plugged into a wall charger and it just
works<00:03:49.540> with<00:03:49.840> any<00:03:49.990> USB<00:03:50.410> charger<00:03:51.070> that'll<00:03:51.280> plug

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
in just plug it into the wall but I

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.270 
in just plug it into the wall but I
really<00:03:53.320> wish<00:03:53.470> table<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.800> include<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:54.100> wall

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
really wish table to include a wall

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.100 
really wish table to include a wall
charger<00:03:54.310> or<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> wall<00:03:55.209> mount<00:03:55.450> with<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.959> that

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
charger or a wall mount with it that

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.630 
charger or a wall mount with it that
would<00:03:56.200> have<00:03:56.260> made<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.410> little<00:03:56.590> bit<00:03:56.740> better<00:03:56.800> but

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
would have made a little bit better but

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.520 
would have made a little bit better but
you<00:03:57.940> know<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.270> think<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:58.990> much<00:03:59.140> more<00:03:59.350> of<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
you know I think this is much more of a

you know I think this is much more of a

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.580 
use for a desktop setting or a computer
setting<00:04:01.959> when<00:04:02.080> you're<00:04:02.200> working<00:04:02.470> on<00:04:02.530> your

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
setting when you're working on your

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.960 
setting when you're working on your
pewter<00:04:02.980> just<00:04:03.160> set<00:04:03.280> your<00:04:03.370> phone<00:04:03.550> down<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.880> be

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
pewter just set your phone down to be

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.400 
pewter just set your phone down to be
charging<00:04:04.240> while<00:04:04.450> you're<00:04:04.570> working<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:05.320> it

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
charging while you're working and it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.140 
charging while you're working and it
works<00:04:05.590> just<00:04:05.709> fine<00:04:05.800> for<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.100> too<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.580> so

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
works just fine for that too and so

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.540 
works just fine for that too and so
besides<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.140> not<00:04:08.260> having<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.770> wall<00:04:09.100> charging

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
besides the not having the wall charging

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.770 
besides the not having the wall charging
mount<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:09.970> light<00:04:10.120> being<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.480> little<00:04:10.690> bit

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
mount and the light being a little bit

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.180 
mount and the light being a little bit
bright<00:04:11.020> during<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.500> nighttime<00:04:11.830> hours

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
bright during the nighttime hours

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.979 
bright during the nighttime hours
there's<00:04:12.970> really<00:04:13.090> nothing<00:04:13.390> else<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.660> can<00:04:13.840> say

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
there's really nothing else I can say

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.900 
there's really nothing else I can say
about<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.230> that's<00:04:14.440> negative<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.610> I<00:04:15.700> said

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
about it that's negative like I said

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.670 
about it that's negative like I said
before<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.359> I'm<00:04:16.480> going<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.660> charge<00:04:16.870> as<00:04:17.169> good<00:04:17.500> as

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
before so I'm going to charge as good as

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.260 
before so I'm going to charge as good as
plugging<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.160> directly<00:04:18.489> into<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.760> cable<00:04:19.120> but<00:04:19.209> it

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
plugging it directly into a cable but it

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.640 
plugging it directly into a cable but it
still<00:04:19.540> gives<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:19.810> pretty<00:04:19.959> good<00:04:20.140> charge<00:04:20.410> rates

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
still gives you pretty good charge rates

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.050 
still gives you pretty good charge rates
I<00:04:20.830> think<00:04:21.340> it's<00:04:21.430> pretty<00:04:21.549> good<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:21.820> would

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
I think it's pretty good I would

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.640 
I think it's pretty good I would
recommend<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.570> I've<00:04:22.720> had<00:04:23.020> no<00:04:23.169> problems<00:04:23.200> with

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
recommend it I've had no problems with

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.710 
recommend it I've had no problems with
it<00:04:23.740> not<00:04:23.950> working<00:04:24.280> whenever<00:04:25.090> it's<00:04:25.240> blinking<00:04:25.600> it

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
it not working whenever it's blinking it

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.580 
it not working whenever it's blinking it
lets<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.960> know<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.140> it's

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
lets you know that it's

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.110 
lets you know that it's
charging<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.040> I<00:04:27.580> think<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.820> works<00:04:27.970> pretty

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
charging and I think it works pretty

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.550 
charging and I think it works pretty
good<00:04:28.240> for<00:04:28.510> 30<00:04:28.630> bucks<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:29.139> would<00:04:29.260> definitely

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
good for 30 bucks I would definitely

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.290 
good for 30 bucks I would definitely
