we<00:00:00.269> are<00:00:00.329> presenting<00:00:00.870> right<00:00:01.020> now<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.410> a

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
we are presenting right now is a

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.439 
we are presenting right now is a
technology<00:00:01.920> it's<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.669> hybrid<00:00:03.030> battery

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
technology it's a hybrid battery

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.749 
technology it's a hybrid battery
management<00:00:03.780> technology<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:05.100> enables<00:00:05.609> a

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
management technology that enables a

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.909 
management technology that enables a
mobile<00:00:06.029> phone<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.109> recharged<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.770> go

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
mobile phone to be recharged on the go

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.549 
mobile phone to be recharged on the go
so<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.940> particular<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.630> mobile<00:00:09.990> phone<00:00:10.200> has

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
so in particular this mobile phone has

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.209 
so in particular this mobile phone has
two<00:00:11.519> batteries<00:00:12.139> inside<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
two batteries inside one is a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.460 
two batteries inside one is a
lithium-ion<00:00:14.670> standard<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.809> my<00:00:16.080> battery

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
lithium-ion standard is my battery

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.980 
lithium-ion standard is my battery
rechargeable

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.110 

and

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
and

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.050 
and
it<00:00:22.810> has<00:00:23.020> a<00:00:23.230> slot<00:00:23.650> for<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:24.070> triple<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.640> battery

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
it has a slot for a triple a battery

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.650 
it has a slot for a triple a battery
standard<00:00:25.630> triple<00:00:25.960> a<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.240> when<00:00:28.480> the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
standard triple a so when the

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.080 
standard triple a so when the
lithium-ion<00:00:29.080> battery<00:00:29.500> gets<00:00:29.710> low<00:00:29.800> if<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.940> have

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
lithium-ion battery gets low if you have

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.230 
lithium-ion battery gets low if you have
one<00:00:31.270> triple-a<00:00:31.660> inside<00:00:32.370> the<00:00:33.370> illicit<00:00:33.730> that<00:00:33.940> the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
one triple-a inside the illicit that the

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.420 
one triple-a inside the illicit that the
triplet<00:00:34.630> can<00:00:34.930> recharge<00:00:35.350> this<00:00:35.650> divine<00:00:36.040> battery

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
triplet can recharge this divine battery

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.880 
triplet can recharge this divine battery
and<00:00:36.940> get<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:37.300> an<00:00:37.810> extra<00:00:38.020> additional<00:00:38.680> power

main battery and one is the second

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.290 
main battery and one is the second
battery<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:33.190> this<00:01:33.370> case<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.700> second<00:01:34.000> battery

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
battery in this case the second battery

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.630 
battery in this case the second battery
is<00:01:34.360> empty<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.870> just<00:01:35.229> took<00:01:35.350> out<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.680> battery<00:01:36.010> now

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
is empty I just took out the battery now

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.600 
is empty I just took out the battery now
when<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:36.820> put<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.119> in<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:39.190> when<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.340> put<00:01:39.550> the

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.260 

the<00:01:46.690> device<00:01:46.990> will<00:01:47.170> make<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> quick<00:01:47.920> detection

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the device will make a quick detection

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.180 
the device will make a quick detection
and<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.630> telling<00:01:49.960> me<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.440> have<00:01:50.950> two

and it is telling me I have two

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
and it is telling me I have two
batteries<00:01:51.640> right<00:01:51.820> now<00:01:52.030> one<00:01:52.840> main<00:01:53.110> battery

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
batteries right now one main battery

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.280 
batteries right now one main battery
three-quarters<00:01:55.210> charged<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:55.990> backup

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
three-quarters charged and a backup

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.350 
three-quarters charged and a backup
battery<00:01:56.320> fully<00:01:56.800> charged<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:57.940> case<00:01:58.150> the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
battery fully charged so in case the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.510 
battery fully charged so in case the
lithium-ion<00:01:58.810> battery<00:01:59.230> is<00:01:59.290> low<00:01:59.380> then<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.340> know<00:02:00.400> I

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
lithium-ion battery is low then I know I

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.420 
lithium-ion battery is low then I know I
have<00:02:00.760> a<00:02:00.790> complete<00:02:01.630> backup<00:02:01.950> battery<00:02:02.950> ready<00:02:03.190> to

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
have a complete backup battery ready to

lithium-ion battery pretty simple so now

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.090 
lithium-ion battery pretty simple so now
let's<00:02:31.270> say<00:02:31.420> let's<00:02:31.840> say<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.170> user<00:02:32.380> also<00:02:32.890> runs

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
let's say let's say the user also runs

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.820 
let's say let's say the user also runs
out<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.310> battery<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.270> triple-eight

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
out of battery on the triple-eight

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.380 
out of battery on the triple-eight
because<00:02:35.830> he<00:02:35.980> really<00:02:36.220> uses<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.580> lot<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:37.000> he<00:02:37.030> went
