I'm just going to take my elastic and
wrap<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.540> around<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.930> ends<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.590> keep<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
wrap it around the ends to keep it a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190 
wrap it around the ends to keep it a
break<00:01:41.520> together<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:42.750> doesn't<00:01:43.020> matter

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
break together and it doesn't matter

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.139 
break together and it doesn't matter
what<00:01:43.410> elastic<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.130> use<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.580> could<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
what elastic you use it could be one of

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.910 
what elastic you use it could be one of
the<00:01:45.300> really<00:01:45.479> thin<00:01:45.810> ones<00:01:46.020> i'm<00:01:46.200> using<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.830> it

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the really thin ones i'm using or it

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
the really thin ones i'm using or it
could<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> regular<00:01:47.610> scrunchie<00:01:48.450> one

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
could just be a regular scrunchie one

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
could just be a regular scrunchie one
and<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:49.080> just<00:01:49.290> repeat<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.890> process<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and then just repeat the process on the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.260 
and then just repeat the process on the
other<00:01:51.090> two<00:01:51.600> sections

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.240 

so<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.259> look<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.770> Pippi<00:01:59.100> Longstocking

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
so now we look like Pippi Longstocking

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.940 
so now we look like Pippi Longstocking
but<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.390> continue<00:02:01.140> braiding<00:02:01.350> your<00:02:01.530> hair<00:02:01.679> in

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
but just continue braiding your hair in

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.690

the<00:02:02.130> back<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.979> did<00:02:05.219> three<00:02:05.460> breaks

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the back now so I did three breaks

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.789 
the back now so I did three breaks
because<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:06.119> hair<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.390> quite<00:02:06.689> thin<00:02:07.049> however<00:02:07.469> if

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
because my hair is quite thin however if

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.529 
because my hair is quite thin however if
you<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.280> thicker<00:02:08.550> hair<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.970> might<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.450> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you have thicker hair you might want to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.380 
you have thicker hair you might want to
do<00:02:09.780> 425<00:02:10.769> braids<00:02:11.400> depending<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.269> thickness

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
do 425 braids depending on the thickness

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.780 
do 425 braids depending on the thickness
of<00:02:12.720> your<00:02:12.780> hair<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.410> if<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> want<00:02:14.129> loser<00:02:14.549> waves

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
then maybe just do two braids and if you

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.059 
then maybe just do two braids and if you
want<00:02:17.610> more<00:02:17.940> tighter<00:02:18.269> curls<00:02:18.690> then<00:02:19.049> try<00:02:19.530> adding

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
suggest going for a break this side so

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.940 
suggest going for a break this side so
just<00:02:26.849> customize<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.930> depending<00:02:28.379> on<00:02:28.560> your<00:02:28.709> hair

actually<00:03:44.760> curl<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.720> properly<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:46.739> this<00:03:46.980> will

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
actually curl it properly so this will

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.220 
actually curl it properly so this will
take<00:03:47.370> me<00:03:47.609> about<00:03:47.730> 10<00:03:48.209> minutes<00:03:48.419> or<00:03:48.690> less<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.019> do

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
take me about 10 minutes or less to do

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.530 
take me about 10 minutes or less to do
unlike<00:03:49.859> curling<00:03:50.430> my<00:03:50.819> hair<00:03:50.849> which<00:03:51.269> usually

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
unlike curling my hair which usually

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.530 
unlike curling my hair which usually
takes<00:03:51.900> about<00:03:52.139> 20<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.889> 30<00:03:53.099> minutes<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:54.150> style

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
takes about 20 to 30 minutes the style

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.909 
takes about 20 to 30 minutes the style
would<00:03:54.690> be<00:03:54.720> great<00:03:55.049> for<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.319> spring<00:03:55.709> or<00:03:55.859> summer

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
would be great for the spring or summer

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.190 
would be great for the spring or summer
and<00:03:56.459> on<00:03:57.030> those<00:03:57.239> days<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.480> you're<00:03:57.780> rushing

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
and on those days that you're rushing

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.450 
and on those days that you're rushing
for<00:03:58.410> school<00:03:58.739> or<00:03:58.829> work

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.350 

I<00:04:06.200> think<00:04:07.200> this<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.680> great<00:04:07.980> if<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.760> tried

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
I think this is great if you tried

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.060 
I think this is great if you tried
sleeping<00:04:09.750> with<00:04:09.990> braids<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.710> your<00:04:10.860> hair

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
sleeping with braids in your hair

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.370 
sleeping with braids in your hair
however<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.000> effect<00:04:12.360> didn't<00:04:12.810> last<00:04:13.020> because

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
however the effect didn't last because

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.040 
however the effect didn't last because
your<00:04:13.560> hair<00:04:13.740> is<00:04:13.770> hard<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.400> curl<00:04:14.670> try<00:04:15.360> doing<00:04:15.630> this

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.050 
your hair is hard to curl try doing this

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.140 
your hair is hard to curl try doing this
after<00:04:16.680> sleeping<00:04:16.950> with<00:04:17.250> your<00:04:17.400> braids<00:04:17.670> to<00:04:17.970> get

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
after sleeping with your braids to get

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.560 
after sleeping with your braids to get
more<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.780> longer<00:04:19.110> lasting<00:04:19.430> effect<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.820> as

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
more of a longer lasting effect and as

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.240 
more of a longer lasting effect and as
you<00:04:21.690> guys<00:04:21.750> saw<00:04:22.080> at<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.290> beginning<00:04:22.500> my<00:04:22.890> hair<00:04:23.130> is

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
you guys saw at the beginning my hair is

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.980 
you guys saw at the beginning my hair is
quite<00:04:23.460> poofy<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.060> frizzy<00:04:24.480> so<00:04:24.600> I'm<00:04:24.660> just<00:04:24.840> going

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
quite poofy and frizzy so I'm just going

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.900 
quite poofy and frizzy so I'm just going
to<00:04:25.080> take<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.290> flat<00:04:25.590> iron<00:04:25.920> and<00:04:26.070> run<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:26.880> through

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
to take a flat iron and run it through

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.950 
to take a flat iron and run it through
the<00:04:27.180> ends<00:04:27.600> just<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.230> flatten<00:04:28.530> them<00:04:29.040> out<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.930> i

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
the ends just to flatten them out so i

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.290 
the ends just to flatten them out so i
would<00:04:34.200> say<00:04:34.410> at<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.590> time<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.980> takes<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.490> press

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
would say at the time it takes to press

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.210 
would say at the time it takes to press
the<00:04:36.510> flat<00:04:36.720> iron<00:04:36.930> into<00:04:37.410> your<00:04:37.590> hair<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.040> create

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
the flat iron into your hair to create

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.580 
the flat iron into your hair to create
the<00:04:38.550> way<00:04:38.730> while<00:04:39.330> depend<00:04:39.720> on<00:04:39.960> your<00:04:40.110> hair<00:04:40.350> type

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
the way while depend on your hair type

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.220 
the way while depend on your hair type
so<00:04:41.280> if<00:04:41.520> your<00:04:41.670> hair<00:04:41.820> is<00:04:41.850> harder<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.300> curl<00:04:42.690> try

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
so if your hair is harder to curl try

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.650 
so if your hair is harder to curl try
drink<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.800> for<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.310> minute<00:04:44.550> or<00:04:44.790> two<00:04:44.970> longer<00:04:45.180> and

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
drink it for a minute or two longer and

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.710 
drink it for a minute or two longer and
if<00:04:45.870> it's<00:04:46.020> easier<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.500> curl<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:47.280> maybe<00:04:47.550> do<00:04:48.060> two

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
if it's easier to curl just maybe do two

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.840 
if it's easier to curl just maybe do two
minutes<00:04:49.080> per<00:04:49.410> braid<00:04:49.770> or<00:04:50.010> something<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:50.640> once

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
minutes per braid or something so once

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.270 
minutes per braid or something so once
you<00:04:51.060> finish<00:04:51.420> depressing<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.530> moving<00:04:52.950> up<00:04:53.130> and

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
you finish depressing and moving up and

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.910 
you finish depressing and moving up and
down<00:04:53.400> process<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.690> want<00:04:54.930> your<00:04:55.200> brakes<00:04:55.620> to

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
down process you want your brakes to

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.340 
down process you want your brakes to
cool<00:04:56.190> for<00:04:56.430> about<00:04:56.520> five<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.060> ten<00:04:57.480> minutes<00:04:57.510> just

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
cool for about five to ten minutes just

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.950 
cool for about five to ten minutes just
so<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.830> curl<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.370> wave<00:04:59.790> takes<00:05:00.270> form<00:05:00.750> and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
so the curl and wave takes form and

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.170 
so the curl and wave takes form and
shape<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:02.190> want<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.520> take<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:02.700> out<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.150> just

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
shape and I want to take it out it just

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.210 
shape and I want to take it out it just
doesn't<00:05:03.660> fall<00:05:03.840> apart<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.500> we<00:05:04.530> want<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.950> let<00:05:05.070> it

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
doesn't fall apart so we want to let it

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.700 
doesn't fall apart so we want to let it
cool<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:05.670> set<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:06.540> i<00:05:06.570> would<00:05:07.020> go<00:05:07.200> with<00:05:07.230> finish

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
cool and set so i would go with finish

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.410 
cool and set so i would go with finish
doing<00:05:07.890> my<00:05:08.010> makeup<00:05:08.460> or<00:05:08.760> finish<00:05:09.030> getting<00:05:09.330> ready

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
doing my makeup or finish getting ready

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.840 
doing my makeup or finish getting ready
or<00:05:09.780> whatever<00:05:10.110> else<00:05:10.380> i<00:05:10.590> needed<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:11.010> do<00:05:11.160> while<00:05:11.640> it

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
or whatever else i needed to do while it

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.850 
or whatever else i needed to do while it
cools<00:05:12.090> ok<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:12.750> it's<00:05:13.020> been<00:05:13.140> about<00:05:13.170> 10<00:05:13.650> minutes

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
cools ok so it's been about 10 minutes

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.680 
cools ok so it's been about 10 minutes
and<00:05:14.100> i<00:05:14.250> just<00:05:14.460> waited<00:05:14.700> until<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.390> curls

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
and i just waited until the curls

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.240 
and i just waited until the curls
completely<00:05:16.380> cooled<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:16.890> we're<00:05:17.070> no<00:05:17.220> longer

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
completely cooled and we're no longer

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.690 
completely cooled and we're no longer
warm<00:05:17.910> so<00:05:18.630> now<00:05:19.080> let's<00:05:19.320> see<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.620> results<00:05:20.280> so<00:05:20.640> i'm

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
warm so now let's see the results so i'm

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.800 
warm so now let's see the results so i'm
just<00:05:20.760> going<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.240> take<00:05:21.600> off<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:23.210> elastic<00:05:24.210> and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
just going to take off the elastic and

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.450 
just going to take off the elastic and
this<00:05:25.320> is<00:05:25.440> my<00:05:25.560> first<00:05:25.830> time<00:05:26.010> trying<00:05:26.250> this

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
this is my first time trying this

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.980 
this is my first time trying this
technique<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.510> let's<00:05:28.110> see<00:05:28.440> if<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.830> worked<00:05:29.990> so

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
technique so let's see if it worked so

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.280 
technique so let's see if it worked so
i'm<00:05:31.140> just<00:05:31.340> unbreathing<00:05:33.950> and<00:05:36.140> hopefully<00:05:37.140> we

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
i'm just unbreathing and hopefully we

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.670 
i'm just unbreathing and hopefully we
get<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.740> crimped<00:05:38.400> beachy<00:05:38.790> style<00:05:39.240> effect<00:05:39.960> so

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
get that crimped beachy style effect so

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.830 
get that crimped beachy style effect so
it<00:05:40.830> is<00:05:40.950> actually<00:05:41.160> like<00:05:41.760> you've<00:05:42.030> just<00:05:42.060> slept<00:05:42.630> in

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
it is actually like you've just slept in

how cool is that I love it I think it's

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.330 
how cool is that I love it I think it's
such<00:06:06.330> a<00:06:06.360> unique<00:06:06.480> effect<00:06:07.140> and<00:06:07.410> even<00:06:07.950> after

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
such a unique effect and even after

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.820 
such a unique effect and even after
sleeping<00:06:08.520> with<00:06:09.300> my<00:06:09.510> braids<00:06:09.810> in<00:06:10.080> it<00:06:10.290> never

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
sleeping with my braids in it never

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.070 
sleeping with my braids in it never
looks<00:06:11.130> this<00:06:11.220> good<00:06:11.490> I<00:06:11.670> think<00:06:11.940> it<00:06:12.300> just<00:06:12.480> starts

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
looks this good I think it just starts

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.200 
looks this good I think it just starts
getting<00:06:13.290> frizzy<00:06:13.530> and<00:06:13.980> I<00:06:14.280> think<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:14.610> Flatiron

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
getting frizzy and I think the Flatiron

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.700 
getting frizzy and I think the Flatiron
really<00:06:15.870> like<00:06:16.020> helps<00:06:16.320> smooth<00:06:16.920> it<00:06:17.100> down<00:06:18.470> so<00:06:19.470> this

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
really like helps smooth it down so this

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.020 
really like helps smooth it down so this
is<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.860> end<00:06:20.100> result<00:06:20.310> I<00:06:20.670> think<00:06:20.880> it<00:06:21.000> looks

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
is the end result I think it looks

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.830 
is the end result I think it looks
really<00:06:21.450> cool<00:06:22.080> sort<00:06:22.620> of<00:06:22.740> like<00:06:22.890> a<00:06:22.920> beachy<00:06:23.640> wave<00:06:24.570> I

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
really cool sort of like a beachy wave I

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.690 
really cool sort of like a beachy wave I
think<00:06:25.140> this<00:06:25.260> is<00:06:25.410> great<00:06:25.620> if<00:06:25.920> you<00:06:26.160> just<00:06:26.190> want

think this is great if you just want
that<00:06:27.000> instant<00:06:27.510> gratification<00:06:27.980> without
