okay<00:00:04.779> so<00:00:04.840> hi<00:00:05.109> I'm<00:00:05.260> Jim<00:00:05.620> downing<00:00:05.950> I<00:00:06.069> work<00:00:06.609> in<00:00:06.880> the

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
okay so hi I'm Jim downing I work in the

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.610 
okay so hi I'm Jim downing I work in the
chemistry<00:00:07.359> department<00:00:07.479> at<00:00:07.990> the<00:00:08.109> University

chemistry department at the University
of<00:00:08.650> Cambridge<00:00:09.600> I'm<00:00:10.600> going<00:00:10.750> to<00:00:10.840> talk<00:00:10.930> to<00:00:10.990> you<00:00:11.139> a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
of Cambridge I'm going to talk to you a

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.330 
of Cambridge I'm going to talk to you a
little<00:00:11.320> bit<00:00:11.440> about<00:00:11.680> a<00:00:11.740> programming<00:00:12.309> language

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
little bit about a programming language

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.470 
little bit about a programming language
called<00:00:12.639> closure<00:00:14.100> closure<00:00:15.100> is<00:00:15.520> a<00:00:15.549> functional

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
called closure closure is a functional

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.120 
called closure closure is a functional
Lisp<00:00:16.690> to<00:00:16.930> put<00:00:17.080> it<00:00:17.170> in<00:00:17.289> it's<00:00:17.440> a<00:00:17.650> classification

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
Lisp to put it in it's a classification

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.030 
Lisp to put it in it's a classification
of<00:00:19.029> programming<00:00:19.660> languages<00:00:20.080> actually<00:00:20.710> got

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
of programming languages actually got

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.710 
of programming languages actually got
interesting<00:00:21.580> interested<00:00:22.210> in<00:00:22.300> it<00:00:22.390> because<00:00:22.510> of

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
interesting interested in it because of

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.410 
interesting interested in it because of
the<00:00:22.890> functional<00:00:23.890> aspects<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.880> because<00:00:25.300> I've

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
the functional aspects and because I've

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.690 
the functional aspects and because I've
got<00:00:25.630> a<00:00:25.660> well<00:00:26.350> I'm<00:00:26.470> betting<00:00:27.070> that<00:00:27.100> functional

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
got a well I'm betting that functional

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.130 
got a well I'm betting that functional
languages<00:00:28.060> are<00:00:28.210> going<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.480> be<00:00:28.600> a<00:00:28.630> big<00:00:28.840> thing<00:00:28.870> in

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
languages are going to be a big thing in

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.529 
languages are going to be a big thing in
the<00:00:29.200> next<00:00:29.410> few<00:00:29.530> years<00:00:29.590> as<00:00:29.980> we<00:00:30.940> get<00:00:31.090> more<00:00:31.119> course

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
the next few years as we get more course

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.720 
the next few years as we get more course
and<00:00:31.720> our<00:00:31.810> computer<00:00:31.990> run<00:00:32.410> bigger<00:00:33.160> clock<00:00:33.430> speeds

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
and our computer run bigger clock speeds

allowed to our access wall at what times
and<00:00:55.950> object-oriented<00:00:56.950> languages<00:00:57.489> like<00:00:57.670> I've

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
and object-oriented languages like I've

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.490

done<00:00:57.940> my<00:00:58.120> jar<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.630> you<00:00:58.719> have<00:00:58.899> these<00:00:59.170> locks

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
done my jar that you have these locks

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.619 
done my jar that you have these locks
and<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.920> have<00:01:00.130> synchronized<00:01:01.030> blocks<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.570> all

and you have synchronized blocks and all

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.630 
and you have synchronized blocks and all
this<00:01:01.809> planet<00:01:02.200> and<00:01:02.680> you<00:01:02.950> still<00:01:03.250> have<00:01:03.430> to<00:01:03.550> be

that's a lot of help compared to you
know<00:01:05.590> what<00:01:05.770> might<00:01:05.979> be<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.180> still

side effects there's no mutable state so
that<00:01:25.959> you<00:01:26.499> don't<00:01:26.679> have<00:01:26.799> anything<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.189> trigger

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459 
that you don't have anything to trigger

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.969 
that you don't have anything to trigger
yourself<00:01:27.549> up<00:01:27.969> you<00:01:28.420> know<00:01:28.539> if<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.499> have<00:01:29.649> a

yourself up you know if you have a

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.559 
yourself up you know if you have a
function<00:01:30.459> you<00:01:30.729> need<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:30.939> do<00:01:31.060> over<00:01:31.299> a<00:01:31.329> list

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
function you need to do over a list

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.410 
function you need to do over a list
since<00:01:31.929> each<00:01:32.049> function<00:01:32.499> can<00:01:32.649> only<00:01:32.770> return<00:01:33.159> its

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
since each function can only return its

since each function can only return its
function<00:01:34.420> its<00:01:34.539> arguments<00:01:34.959> you<00:01:35.499> can<00:01:35.649> just<00:01:35.829> do

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
function its arguments you can just do

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.709 
function its arguments you can just do
all<00:01:36.249> the<00:01:36.490> functions<00:01:36.849> at<00:01:36.939> once<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.299> parallel

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
all the functions at once and parallel

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.870 
all the functions at once and parallel
on<00:01:37.810> every<00:01:38.170> every<00:01:38.649> all<00:01:39.189> of<00:01:39.429> those<00:01:39.579> problems

on every every all of those problems

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.080 
on every every all of those problems
become<00:01:40.329> embarrassing<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.929> whole<00:01:41.139> so<00:01:42.099> you<00:01:42.939> end

become embarrassing the whole so you end

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.350 
become embarrassing the whole so you end
up<00:01:43.209> a<00:01:43.359> lot<00:01:43.509> in<00:01:43.659> functional

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
up a lot in functional

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360 
up a lot in functional
in<00:01:44.810> functional<00:01:45.200> programming<00:01:45.230> doing<00:01:45.950> pairs<00:01:46.190> of

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
in functional programming doing pairs of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.940 
in functional programming doing pairs of
MapReduce<00:01:46.910> operations<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:47.750> we<00:01:47.840> map<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.650> apply

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
MapReduce operations so we map you apply

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.770 
MapReduce operations so we map you apply
a<00:01:49.220> function<00:01:49.760> to<00:01:49.910> each<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.270> members<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
a function to each of the members of the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.210 
a function to each of the members of the
collection<00:01:51.230> and<00:01:51.350> give<00:01:51.500> back<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.860> results<00:01:51.980> of

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
collection and give back the results of

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.000 
collection and give back the results of
the<00:01:52.310> function<00:01:52.700> as<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.270> new<00:01:53.510> collection<00:01:54.010> and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
the function as a new collection and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.880 
the function as a new collection and
that's<00:01:55.220> that's<00:01:55.820> parallelizable<00:01:56.480> across<00:01:56.890> as

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
that's that's parallelizable across as

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.040 
that's that's parallelizable across as
far<00:01:58.100> as<00:01:58.190> you<00:01:58.310> wait<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.450> then<00:01:59.540> you'll<00:01:59.690> reduce

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
far as you wait and then you'll reduce

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.810 
far as you wait and then you'll reduce
where<00:02:00.320> basically<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.770> accumulator<00:02:01.400> across

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
where basically you accumulator across

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.969 
where basically you accumulator across
the<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.600> list<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.229> that's<00:02:03.410> not<00:02:03.560> that's<00:02:03.830> not

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
the the list and that's not that's not

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.219 
the the list and that's not that's not
paralyzed<00:02:04.490> well<00:02:04.700> at<00:02:04.790> all<00:02:05.000> but<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.720> point<00:02:05.960> is

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
paralyzed well at all but the point is

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.109 
paralyzed well at all but the point is
that<00:02:06.260> you've<00:02:06.920> separated<00:02:07.130> out<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.700> paralyzed

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
that you've separated out the paralyzed

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.790 
that you've separated out the paralyzed
with<00:02:08.420> bits<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.840> your<00:02:09.020> program<00:02:09.410> from<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.619> not

function language and as soon as I saw

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.180 
function language and as soon as I saw
that<00:02:20.750> there<00:02:20.900> was<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.230> functional<00:02:21.890> language

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
that there was a functional language

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.040 
that there was a functional language
that<00:02:22.370> works<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.820> JVM<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:23.660> could<00:02:23.840> call

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
that works on the JVM and we could call

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.500 
that works on the JVM and we could call
into<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.890> our<00:02:25.220> existing<00:02:25.700> Java<00:02:26.090> libraries

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
into all of our existing Java libraries

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.880 
into all of our existing Java libraries
you<00:02:26.660> know<00:02:26.780> we've<00:02:26.930> got<00:02:27.140> something<00:02:27.440> like<00:02:27.590> about

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
you know we've got something like about

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.410 
you know we've got something like about
half<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.220> million<00:02:28.670> lines<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:29.000> code<00:02:29.060> of

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
half a million lines of code of

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.290 
half a million lines of code of
chemistry<00:02:30.230> specific<00:02:30.770> Java<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.400> that's<00:02:32.150> a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
chemistry specific Java and that's a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.449 
chemistry specific Java and that's a
fair<00:02:32.510> legacy<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.110> leave<00:02:33.260> behind<00:02:33.320> order<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.220> try

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
fair legacy to leave behind order to try

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.330 
fair legacy to leave behind order to try
and<00:02:34.489> recreate<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.900> access<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.130> pretty

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
and recreate so access to that is pretty

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.330 
and recreate so access to that is pretty
pretty<00:02:37.700> valuable<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:39.080> it's<00:02:39.800> also<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.130> lot

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
pretty valuable and it's also a lot

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.010 
pretty valuable and it's also a lot
better<00:02:40.520> for<00:02:40.670> deployment<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.330> know<00:02:41.480> there<00:02:41.989> are

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
better for deployment you know there are

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.570 
better for deployment you know there are
plenty<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.410> places<00:02:42.560> where<00:02:42.980> if<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.340> want<00:02:43.520> to

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
plenty of places where if you want to

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.520 
plenty of places where if you want to
deploy<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.910> web<00:02:44.120> application<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:45.110> stick<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.440> in

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
deploy a web application you stick it in

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.890 
deploy a web application you stick it in
your<00:02:45.620> wine<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.040> deploy<00:02:46.370> it's<00:02:46.700> done<00:02:46.910> we<00:02:47.540> can<00:02:47.750> do

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
your wine you deploy it's done we can do

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.780 
your wine you deploy it's done we can do
that<00:02:47.930> with<00:02:48.260> closure<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.250> case<00:02:49.580> we're

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
that with closure in this case we're

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.430 
that with closure in this case we're
using<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.209> for<00:02:50.390> doing<00:02:50.600> sparkle<00:02:51.049> queries

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
using it for doing sparkle queries

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.870 
using it for doing sparkle queries
against<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:53.110> government<00:02:54.110> data<00:02:54.350> and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
against the government data and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.400 
against the government data and
processing<00:02:55.880> those<00:02:56.090> doing<00:02:56.720> some<00:02:56.870> stats<00:02:57.140> over

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
processing those doing some stats over

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.010 
processing those doing some stats over
those

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.980 

okay<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.620> basic<00:03:02.130> idea<00:03:02.250> was<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.760> when<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
okay so the basic idea was to when it

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.630 
okay so the basic idea was to when it
was<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.590> kind<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.860> worked<00:03:05.070> from<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.310> end<00:03:05.490> of<00:03:05.580> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
was I kind of worked from the end of the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.310 
was I kind of worked from the end of the
film<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:05.970> wanted<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.330> do<00:03:06.540> was<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.780> wanted<00:03:07.140> to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
film what I wanted to do was I wanted to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.530 
film what I wanted to do was I wanted to
find<00:03:08.220> some<00:03:08.760> embarrassingly<00:03:09.450> parallel

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
find some embarrassingly parallel

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
find some embarrassingly parallel
problem<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.320> we<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.530> play<00:03:10.770> around<00:03:10.920> with<00:03:11.880> some

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
problem so we can play around with some

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.930 
problem so we can play around with some
chrysalis<00:03:13.560> multiple<00:03:14.040> programming<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.790> work

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
chrysalis multiple programming and work

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.760 
chrysalis multiple programming and work
out<00:03:15.210> how<00:03:15.750> much<00:03:15.780> faster<00:03:16.080> we<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:16.320> make<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.680> and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
out how much faster we can make it and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.660 
out how much faster we can make it and
how<00:03:16.890> easy<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.310> could<00:03:17.490> be<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:18.540> enclosure<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.770> so

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
how easy it could be in enclosure and so

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.770 
how easy it could be in enclosure and so
I<00:03:20.700> thought<00:03:20.940> about<00:03:21.150> some<00:03:21.360> problem<00:03:21.660> where<00:03:21.750> we

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
I thought about some problem where we

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.690 
I thought about some problem where we
could<00:03:22.020> do<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.440> decent<00:03:23.160> amount<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.460> work

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
could do a decent amount of work

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.940 
could do a decent amount of work
computational<00:03:24.450> work<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.870> get<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.830> know

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
computational work to get the you know

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.190 
computational work to get the you know
personal<00:03:26.430> war<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.750> thought<00:03:28.170> about

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
personal war and thought about

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.900 
personal war and thought about
correlating<00:03:29.040> large<00:03:29.220> dose<00:03:29.430> that's<00:03:29.610> basically

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
correlating large dose that's basically

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.020 
correlating large dose that's basically
a<00:03:30.000> big<00:03:30.210> deck<00:03:30.360> tomorrow<00:03:30.740> and<00:03:31.740> I<00:03:32.670> thought<00:03:32.910> well

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
a big deck tomorrow and I thought well

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.490 
a big deck tomorrow and I thought well
what<00:03:33.240> would<00:03:33.360> be<00:03:33.450> an<00:03:33.570> appropriate<00:03:33.660> data<00:03:34.170> set<00:03:34.410> to

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
what would be an appropriate data set to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.120 
what would be an appropriate data set to
use<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:34.980> seemed<00:03:35.310> obvious<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.940> use<00:03:36.860> wtk<00:03:37.860> and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
use and it seemed obvious to use wtk and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.180 
use and it seemed obvious to use wtk and
as<00:03:38.880> we've<00:03:39.090> dick<00:03:39.270> you<00:03:39.900> know<00:03:40.040> we've<00:03:41.040> been

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
as we've dick you know we've been

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.290 
as we've dick you know we've been
digging<00:03:41.340> further<00:03:41.700> into<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.210> and<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:45.090> still

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
digging further into it and it's still

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.570 
digging further into it and it's still

early days for data.gov the UK's that

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.550 
early days for data.gov the UK's that

you know they the ontology s haven't

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
been worked out that the different data

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.610 
been worked out that the different data

scheme<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.490> yet<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.630> been<00:03:54.780> more

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
scheme is just yet so it's been more

scheme is just yet so it's been more

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
presentations earlier in the week and it

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.300 
presentations earlier in the week and it
seems<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.470> be<00:04:04.560> going<00:04:04.710> in<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.950> great<00:04:05.160> direction

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
seems to be going in a great direction

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.690 
seems to be going in a great direction
and<00:04:06.350> one<00:04:07.350> thing<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.680> definitely<00:04:07.740> learnt<00:04:08.370> this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
and one thing I definitely learnt this

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.510 
and one thing I definitely learnt this
is<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.440> linked<00:04:10.440> data<00:04:10.620> is<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.920> lot<00:04:11.100> better<00:04:11.340> than

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
is that linked data is a lot better than

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.310 
is that linked data is a lot better than
sparkle<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.450> make<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> lot<00:04:13.140> better

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
sparkle that a you make a lot better
