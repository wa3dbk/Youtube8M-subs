 from laura I am Laura and this is my 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.660
 kitchen today we are going to cook a recipe 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:16.289
 that some of you have asked me 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.630
 and this recipe is rabbit with garlic 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.830
 ingredients that we need are a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.460
 rabbit chopped a little salt 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.820
 choose that she is minced a glass of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 white wine three or four cloves of garlic 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.460
 large and a little bit of olive oil 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.830
 we put the fire not very strong and we put 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.430
 a pan that has the bottom of the 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.480
 pan with olive oil and we leave it 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.480
 to warm up 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.030
 we put the rabbit slices in the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.770
 fire and let it go and 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.770
 Go brown little by little 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.390
 we give the garlic 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.290
 we give the garlic in a mortar 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.240
 we take a handful of salt 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.240
 and crush the garlic 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.060
 when we have enough eyes 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.990
 crushed 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.990
 we add 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.240
 she is minced and we keep pounding 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.240
 all together to make a paste 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.890
 to make this pasta we can take a 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.890
 little bit of wine 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.400
 and we are removing 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.159
 Look, we have to get one more pasta 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.159
 or less so 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.820
 from time to time we are giving you the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.490
 turn so that it goes browning by 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.530
 all sides 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.930
 so that the rabbit is done well we have 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.750
 have a game like 15-20 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.300
 minutes and as I said before 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.890
 we will go around so that he leaves 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.890
 browning on all sides 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.959
 well now that it has evaporated 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 all the water resolved the rabbit and that already 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.640
 begins to brown, we take our bite 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.640
 of garlic and parsley 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.090
 and we are also 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.090
 the glass of wine 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.440
 until all the wine is May 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.440
 going around once in a while 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.260
 good with your miles as you see it already 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.370
 We are consuming all the wine and 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.990
 bunny is pretty golden so 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.710
 we put out the fire because now we only 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:15.840
 it would be plated all we need this 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.840

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.420

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.290
