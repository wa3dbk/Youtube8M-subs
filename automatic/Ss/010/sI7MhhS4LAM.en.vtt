00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.550
 check it a little bit but the main thing is that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.439
 need to check its performance and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.910
 so we connect the battery 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.980
 removed his minus terminals can be seen that 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.369

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.280

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.510

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.989

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:18.010
 terminal and now we give start 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.010

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.780

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.150

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.150
 accidentally remove just the terminal 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.800
