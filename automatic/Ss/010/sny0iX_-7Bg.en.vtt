00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.400
 1 AGB Kitten Angle Unfortunately it did not stay on the planet too 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.370
 Died aahet long almost immediately after the birth of uh ... but 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.049
 This is scary looking 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.980
 Viewed 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.859
 Who are indirectly using 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.919
 This is very nice 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.130
 The will however is as good as the giant's 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.300
 Today 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.339
 So I see from the elections 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.160
 right Now 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.820
 We ran out of time without sound ever stick around the budget 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.690
 About but that is all 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.320
 Determine a lot about what it is not 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.880
 Catering here is my point of view 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.330
 No people say yes to evolution 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.620
 You know it is a religious state 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.200
 It happens well again from my line not to all of the sudden hot 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.000
 I have to be well established 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.530
 So they were also saying like profits 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.059
 Believe what we are 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.440
 How can we possibly get us 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.720
 Or make us how we can get it for one hour 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.840
 You see sometimes a new patient is read 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.340
 Now in this case 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.760
 Did not take a point 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.200
 But if it turns out that it was not incredibly useful boom 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 Could possibly take out 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.890
 What if we had 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.310
 weather 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.430
 I bet you did not pay towards 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.570
 clearly 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.299
 Disorders like this 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.000
 has evolved 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.710
 He released all recited 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.020
 Explanations on the budget issue 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.729
 But 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.070
 We could go to a whole new display mode called Too Bad I do not know what 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.870
 Conservatives use this to make their argument 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.689
 Defense 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.860
 It's my version of the argument bed that religious people 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.560
 But 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.080
 The hottest the better you must get 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.840
 Perfectly fits in your ad 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.100
 Dr r_b_c_ made this way 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.349
 Now that showed this 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:05.370
 Or got the color to its shape 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.740
 Uh ... 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.049
 Interaction in any tree is mostly banana 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.149
 Forget about the ship seemed like work really like you 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.069
 So he did not know of course is not great
