00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:12.630
 the office of architecture and design 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.880
 reveal the style the professional knows 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:25.590
 the place of work of the roberta 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:28.260
 lining an architect's office 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
 interiors, it's just a showcase to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.850
 office was a challenge for your 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.510
 portfolio quite since I very well 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.309
 novel I will say that this project was 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.649
 one of the most difficult projects in my 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.480
 career despite his compact size 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.670
 and did the office project in 2008 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.039
 we've been talking about four years and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.340
 in the ear and trade in 2009 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.410
 I did what I did free because I eat 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 architect likes many styles 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.629
 I like the modern taste of the classic so 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.680
 murray hesitated for me very difficult and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.660
 pull 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.519
 I wanted an office that printed 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.260
 a bit of my personal taste so that the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.260
 person customer arrived since 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.670
 First contact with the client is with me 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.470
 he knew a little bit of it started 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.570
 so at the same time that I wanted a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.530
 innovative project I have a project with 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 the limited 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.540
 so I always looked for something new and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.580
 It was the first time we saw each other here. 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.310
 flowered by the entire walls covered 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.799
 that he thinks in the middle of this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.159
 gray one golden giant monster one 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.159
 completely unexpected structure for 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.680
 The time they become was boyfriend. 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.680
 so it was a challenge to form this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.240
 project and at the same time when I went to 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.880
 this path of innovation, I think 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.149
 found the right formula and it worked the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 customer arrives identifies himself with what he sees 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 already seen in the media of his work 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.390
 looks we look I see how 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.540
 important a professional and your location 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.730
 of exquisite work this house dictation 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 of blacksmith woodpecker eats group 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.590
 always expressed my house is more 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.050
 beautiful and a more beautiful office 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.410
 after all, it is there that people 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.000
 Are you going to look at my work and if I 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.100
 I 'm not careful with the way it is 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.800
 What do you have of each other then we stay 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.660
 care the projects they always are 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.420
 marked by symmetry one thing that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.150
 very pleased and this characteristic is the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.890
 lighting that I am very carefully 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.140
 So, how do we have good spaces? 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.840
 I wanted a room that had 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.280
 the possibility of isolating birthday and 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.470
 integrated 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.020
 and then I made a very modern table 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.930
 very succinct with the great forest are 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.000
 these side luminaires as well 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.340
 work environment and 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.270
 all my passions are there in 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.070
 return 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.870
 I have a card game 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.590
 personal black and white brought from 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.560
 Paris 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.580
 I play that's my passion is chanel 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.650
 it's fashion 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.880
 eifel tower represents big politics 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.130
 passion 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.709
 the children are my daughters and 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.550
 savior to represent to him what is 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.770
 world 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.480
 so I 'm going to have a lot to hand everything I 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.420
 I love my magazines in my collection 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.209
 of goals my books imported in depth 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.970
 eliminates in a very organized way 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.370
 and very practical - at meetings elected 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.680
 exactly that it is an icon of the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.950
 world architecture is to be inem 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.350
 she's right in the middle right there 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.600
 this marble rug is the son of all 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.880
 office there nothing of wood oak 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.860
 and we asked, made of marble to 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.870
 give a subject to the city for office 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.110
 and at the meeting table she is exactly 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.440
 in the center again in the symmetry she 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.239
 here is illuminated by 111 the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.780
 office that I call that is the chandelier 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.700
 drum from bertolucci was purchased on 11th 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.230
 four years and at that time a 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.780
 superplanning that still no one 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.940
 imagined putting a golden chandelier on the 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.069
 half of zero cin and we did this 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.870
 and shows that innovating 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.019
 Nice gisela because the story has 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.569
 four years and beautiful bunch perfumes the people 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.209
 speak the service helps the goal as golden 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:14.290
 attack is my style infecting here is 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.939
 exactly one cherry closes its side 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.609
 of the operating cat 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:21.190
 there are still two architects 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.820
 I count a glass marble table 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.650
 cloud environment in practice and all 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.199
 girls then stay there working 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.330
 together until it is one of the reasons we are 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.530
 leaving soon and of offices to the island 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.190
 It's small, we have a 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.500
 well- regarded team and there she 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.900
 also have hand every part of books 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.860
 magazines in our archive are all very 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.030
 tactical see the gray came from the sealed of 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.099
 eggplant and an orange a little 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.840
 transgressing the great presence by hitting 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.820
 I really like gray because he 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.979
 allows your games without fear of 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.259
 then err the gray with eggplants 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.430
 asking for gray and yellow stays there with 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.590
 she 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.419
 the cut symptom allowed us many 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.210
 jokes so he gives you a cry of 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.190
 color in the office is a screen says treats 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.500
 also from Felipe that I brought from the line 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.590
 my personal collection is that he 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.990
 runs the company came with your case 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.720
 work prior to the assembly of this 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.370
 office but out of that office 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.590
 outstanding projects 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.610
 some large apartments by the sea 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.320
 north 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.659
 that entry role that we ended up with 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.820
 to record brother murilo grandson and others 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.729
 so many that same office that was a 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.810
 It's not a business or a profession. 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:40.240
 really make food one of the biggest 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.430
 offices of the city and the team left 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.590
 so great classics in the places of 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.909
 andrÃ© that innovated so many works and 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.680
 that we have already shown that in the 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.680
 case of companies left favor of Kim 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.800
