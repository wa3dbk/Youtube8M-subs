00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.870
 this is one of the most 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.059
 amazing never took a dinosaur 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.309
 carrying a missile launcher to other cases 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.750
 for this one I'm not quite sure 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.799
 certain that she is not photoshopped 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.150
 so I'm not going to get into the 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.529
 ranking but the one I'm going to 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.309
 speak now his guaranteed 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.020
 authentic 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.890
 here are the top 10 incredible photos 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.869
 the number 10 cage centers I you 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.820
 presents mathias following a champion 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.160
 German and international and I you 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.470
 lets find out which arm sport from 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.150
 of course he made his disability due to 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:42.890
 a genetic disease a force and 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:44.480
 guess his nickname popeye number 9 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.090
 here we are a drawing of a giant handkerchief 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.140
 on a hill a drawing not really 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.059
 it is simply a 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.129
 giant sculpture of the artist neil 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.859
 people in new zealand giving 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.160
 this illusion from this precise point of view 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.690
 number 8 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.859
 these Chinese mountains of colors 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.859
 pastel actually exists 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.570
 this is due to a combination of effects 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.979
 erosion and tea for two layers 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.610
 sediment between two plates 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.380
 tectonic 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.869
 a process that started there are near 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.610
 24 million years number 7 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.070
 no this picture is not distorted 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.170
 the picture is not tampered with this lover and 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.880
 well built as you see it this 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.220
 furniture by the Italian artist ferruccio 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.320
 laviani is precisely an illusion of 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.509
 computer dog 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.340
 number 6 here we think we see the same forest 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.009
 at two different times but he 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.470
 is a single picture 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.030
 is weird it's that perfect line 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.890
 appeared in Hungary following a 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.890
 flood contaminated by a leak of 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 chemicals number 5 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.490
 this photo looks like an invasion 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.319
 alien shot from a movie at small 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.090
 budget but this spiral appeared 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.050
 as you see it missed launch tutorial 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.050
 a missile in the middle of the night 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.149
 number four c4 photo would not have anything 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.259
 especially amazing if he does not 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.149
 was not one and the same 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.220
 photograph fictitious lines 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.080
 been created by the artist from the first sodi 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.149
 only through the provision of 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.969
 objects necessarily from another angle that does not 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.320
 not walk at all number 3 this time 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.970
 it looks like a wallpaper a little 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.040
 nerdy and the faking is badly done in 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.950
 more except that no the photo is not 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.600
 touched she was taken during a 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.160
 Spanish festival in which the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.019
 tradition for riders and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.570
 spend with their horses through 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.760
 big bonfires on the street number 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.069
 2 here is the longest fly at 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.219
 world here converted vocal discovered 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.219
 yeah 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.810
 lewis who makes this photograph 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.430
 microscopic is actually a 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.930
 technical demonstration of a company 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.180
 German company specialized in 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.829
 nanotechnology is able to tag 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.720
 eyeglasses the size of a fly 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.209
 laser with a precision of one thousandth 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.489
 of millimeter and number 1 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.569
 this picture of trees in namibia appeared 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.720
 in the national geographic magazine 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.870
 seems perfectly unrealistic but guy 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.579
 me not that it's not true and here this 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.019
 effect is due to the play of light the only 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.310
 parent and blue and dark trees 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.720
 simply because they are in 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.030
 the shadow while the sky appears 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.010
 orange because it's not about the sky 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.930
 but of a dune in the background enlightened 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.950
 by the sun 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.480
 that's all for this ranking 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.739
 subscribe to the channel to see all 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.359
 the next ones and on the facebook pages 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.150
 or twitter for clues about 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.200
 themes coming up next is the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.459
 reflection in the water that makes me doubt 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.459
 I can not tell if it's true
