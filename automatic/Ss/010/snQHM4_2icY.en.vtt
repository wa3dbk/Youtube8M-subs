 Today's video lesson, let 's go 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.139
 learning how to create an effect 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.100
 take off we should get an image 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 like this 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.510
 we will transform into several images 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.779
 and the smaller images we will 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.240
 unite again we 'll ride as if 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.359
 sticking together and we're going 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.040
 form the larger image again and will 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.420
 give a very interesting effect 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.910
 remembering that this effect can be 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.610
 applied in previous versions of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.140
 photoshop photoshop cs5 and also this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 effect can be done with any 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.640
 image you can pick up your own 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.980
 image and create its effect after having 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.920
 chosen the image inserted in the adobe 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.690

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 is unlocked 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.510
 now we will create a copy of the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.450
 our original layer by pressing the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.150

 of our image 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.520
 let's select our right layer

 we want to create two layers layered 1 and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.350
 layer 2 here in layer 1 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.020
 we go in our tool tin of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.790

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.009
 let's paint her job as you 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.939
 can see my class got totally 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.520
 black and layer 2 we will relate 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.860
 our rectangular sign tool 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.500
 and let's zoom in on our image and 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.680
 pressing the alt key and scrolling 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.829

 let's select the part to part 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.780
 want to form the best image 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.030
 Like I said at the beginning, you sign this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.159
 part here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.280
 done that we will have new tools 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.280
 brush and let's paint in black 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.239
 You can see that in my class. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.530
 appear a black screen out there 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.690
 done that 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.610
 if you click on the copy of our layer we will 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.380
 click the right button and go on 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.500
 to create cutting masks 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.910
 You can see it gave this effect here. 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.870
 was all black and we again our 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.120
 layer 1 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.700
 Let's create a new layer of our 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.800
 layer 3 and in this layer we will 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.959
 re-select our 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.370
 rectangular sign and let's create 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.790
 again a selection around our 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.790
 Image 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.170

 totally white as you can see 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.260
 she became all white 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.010
 now we must unite these three 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.950
 layers 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.720

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.720
 let's press the shift key 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:16.050

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.950
 layers and we will give one against the given g 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.350
 g1 account 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.170
 We are going to create a group or we are 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.079

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.900
 we open here they go is inside 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.150
 our group and we have to create a 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.980
 copy of our group 1 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.570
 for this we will press the key 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.549

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.120
 new layers we'll create a copy 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.519
 of our group 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.769

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.750
 in linking dogs bound in these 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.750
 layers 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.940
 We can already relate our 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.269
 selection tool and create our 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.450
 It is made 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.640
 you can drag the image and 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.489
 jumping wherever you want as you 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.239
 can see our effect is being 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.140
 created 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.150
 let's turn the little image for us 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.820
 coolest 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.959
 now every time we are going to create a 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.209
 new image 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.430
 we have to create a copy of our 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.680
 group is this one by pressing the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.950
 it counts again pushing the button 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.810
 of new layers 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.070
 I re-created a copy in our 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.230
 group and let's open it and we'll drag the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.980
 our image 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:45.710
 we will create a new copy of copy 3 and 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:49.680
 Let's open selection in layer 2 and let's 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.380
 spend the image of 1 against the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.090
 t shirt did not spare the effect well 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.880
 interesting and henceforth the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.790
 we every time we create a 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.280
 effect we have to create a new 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.700
 copy and let's select what our 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.200
 layer 2 and we are creating our effect 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.580
 I'll take a step here in the video lesson 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:17.310
 I'm going to do it, I'll try to fill it out 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.340
 this image if you are 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.010
 I finished I will return back staff 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.380
 As you can see I have created 23 new 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.270
 more interesting groups and if you 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.130
 you're finding your image very 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.290
 small you can pinch the hired 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.590
 He called paquin swearing it to the premium 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.710
 Let me give you a new group 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.880
 a copy if you are finding this 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.880
 very small image 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.620
 you can give one against time and 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.259
 further enhance your smaller image 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.919
 As you can see the man has more to 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:08.039
 my image with is faster than 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.529
 work but gives an effect does not 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.389
 effect and a little more different 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:14.430
 but it's cool, too, the staff 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.819
