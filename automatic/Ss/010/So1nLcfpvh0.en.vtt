00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi everyone knows shoulders and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.609
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.550
 new video in which I'm going to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.019
 introduce a new concept in this 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.780
 concept i'm going to show you how one 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.130
 commits well from his age of 17 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.910
 what that means is that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.450
 when you are going to pass 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.680
 hdv 7 for example as 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.900
 I take an example you will pass 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.529
 of bessÃ¨de yes there he just passed 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.750
 dv7 so I'm going to show you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.870
 for rightly for example how 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.309
 well past his age 17 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.260
 I will show you some small 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.600
 lists just so that it helps you 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 so we just end up 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 now here is so here's a little one 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.960
 little visual effect two years that in 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.920
 first what you need to improve 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.899
 so I put you a little girl 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.100
 so we see in the defenses in 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.470
 first I advise you to improve 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.510
 your mortar then the cannons and turn to 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.820
 market because that's what really makes 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.530
 your base then the wizard's tricks 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.850
 then the anti- aerial because for me 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 in the beginning it is not the most 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.360
 of impressions then the tesla and 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.910
 then the traps so the traps it's 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.910
 really the last one if you do not have one 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.070
 need now the dead mounts so 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.410
 the buildings here is another visual of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.240
 what you will improve first 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.590
 so it seems yondre to the small plug 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.729
 so these are the buildings then in 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.560
 first I advise you to improve 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.510
 your barracks and lab what will 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.190
 to improve your troops 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.290
 and the number of troops you can 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.910
 then have golden tank and 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.590
 lexicles then mines extractor and 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.120
 the fifteen loire reservoir high school students 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.120
 black because it's not the most useful 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.180
 when you just spent your age and v7 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.440
 so now in the lab there 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.900
 it's a bit more complex because 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.670
 are there more things then in the troops 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.280
 I advise you first to improve 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.400
 your base troops so giant archers 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.750
 barbarians then brick breakers because that 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.520
 is also part of the basic troops 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.900
 but some people use it after me 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.590
 the wizards because that makes it 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.900
 truly bad 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.190
 the healer because for me it's 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.780
 not the most useful the balloons the boom 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.180
 because we really use it in 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.830
 each attack and then the dragons 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.540
 because it's really expensive then 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.340
 the black troops but that's it 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.920
 really if you do not know what to do 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.080
 of your black election so here you go 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.670
 the friends 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.450
 I hope that this little lily will have pleased you 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.540
 because for me it's really useful 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.010
 me when you go dv7 gg I do not have 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.020
 had this list and suddenly I had to 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.989
 I had to do without 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:49.060
 so as we see I have soon payment 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:53.230
 hdv au max I have more than his 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.170
 reserves these extractors his barracks and 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.800
 more than a tesla and after I'll have my 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.060
 hdv to max so when you see I have 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.610
 a lot of black elixir I am at 13,845 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.460
 Thu 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.880
 I'm doing that really I'm trying to have 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.980
 a maximum of black elixir to pass my 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 king level 4 then level 5 I know that 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.810
 level 5 is going to be really galley but 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.790
 i absolutely want the past there are five 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.770
 minutes I saw a level 69 dv7 match 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.480
 crystalline I had never seen that so 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.310
 that means he was missing 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.100
 still two mortars these anti air 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.320
 so he easily passed level 70 in 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.070
 hd v7 for me personally it's 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.709
 just amazing 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.310
 and what was still missing 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.290
 finally he was missing with that and he had 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.940
 his barbaric king level 5 is then 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.860
 frankly 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.640
 Ben honestly it's never seen before 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.230
 that but well I wanted to see you here 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.989
 precisely this little list 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.910
 and as down I told you a player 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.790
 my hd2 at max and after I pass 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.530
 directly hd v8 so bought v8 seen from 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.010
 money back plus sorcerer's turn 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.290
 antiaircraft a tesla is the thing we 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.450
 waiting all in hd high school this drill 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.850
 of elixir that will really help us 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.340
 I will make a video about what it is 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.260
 it must pass the age of 8 years 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.669
 first with people I put myself 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.400
 advice from a few people who 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.970
 know themselves because they are level at 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.530
 level in HD v8 for me it's really 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.350
 what makes all the difference this 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.820
 elixir driller because that's 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.240
 really really useful for and that he 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.990
 save seven years listen to friends 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.510
 I hope this video will have you more 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.470
 that it's a good concept and then we're going 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.470
 to say to each other
