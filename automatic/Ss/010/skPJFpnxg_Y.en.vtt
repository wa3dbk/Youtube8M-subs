a plan that routes the Internet through

a plan that routes the Internet through
the<00:02:10.050> proxy<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.710> still<00:02:11.010> says<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> we're<00:02:11.670> in

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
the proxy it still says that we're in

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.080 
the proxy it still says that we're in
Kansas<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.750> some<00:02:12.930> reason<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:14.460> we're

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
Kansas for some reason and we're

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.650 
Kansas for some reason and we're
actually<00:02:15.240> in<00:02:15.570> Texas<00:02:19.940> when<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> did<00:02:21.210> this<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.570> was

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
actually in Texas when I did this it was

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.820 
actually in Texas when I did this it was
around<00:02:21.870> 9:00<00:02:22.680> 10:00<00:02:23.180> p.m.<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.470> assume

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
around 9:00 10:00 p.m. so you can assume

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.950 
around 9:00 10:00 p.m. so you can assume
that<00:02:28.910> there<00:02:29.910> might<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.120> some<00:02:30.420> people<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.810> their

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
that there might be some people on their

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.110 
that there might be some people on their
phones<00:02:31.170> maybe<00:02:31.560> not

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
phones maybe not

are<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> little<00:03:01.530> bit<00:03:01.650> better<00:03:01.799> on<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.099> one<00:03:02.689> but

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
are a little bit better on this one but
