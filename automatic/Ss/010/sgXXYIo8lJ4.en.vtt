00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.620
 good that so welcome a new 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.900
 video pharma 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.000
 Many times it may be the case that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.070
 our ipad our iphone or our 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.680
 such is blocked we need 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.009
 access the device and we can only 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.330
 perform an installation if we perform 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.189
 a clean installation 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.650
 we will have to restore a copy of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.990
 security 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.480
 apart from that it will take us much more 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.039
 time especially if we do not have a copy of 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.620
 security and we have to redial 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.840
 what synchronization what applications 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.070
 they have what downloads 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.680
 when we have our device 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.140
 blocked and we need to install a 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.120
 top version to work or the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.519
 same version to be able to restore 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.430
 our device one of the ways 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.220
 faster is to update so what 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.820
 we will do is download the firmware 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.820
 relative to our device 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.910
 we will assemble the unit where we will have the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.940
 file and then what we will do is 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.220
 go directly to itunes 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.930
 on itunes we select the device 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.350
 to which we want to update to be able 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.810
 directly access that power and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 work with our applications and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.470
 access our files and for that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.560
 what we are going to do is 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.930
 use the update much more 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.940
 quick that if we restore the ipad and 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.970
 then we have to restore a copy of 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.910
 security especially if we are not clear 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.650
 if we have backup or not the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.200
 option that will be better for us not to 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.230
 touch any data from our device 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.480
 and being able to access it is the option of 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.910
 search update to install the 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.910
 firmware and re-leave the system 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.740
 operative well as we can see here 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.440
 we could use the option of 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.470
 restore ipad and restore the copy now 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.690
 that we have a very recent copy like this 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.390
 that there would be no problems what happens that 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.390
 we take longer good our 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.050
 method is to look for update 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.810
 we press the alt key we use the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.730
 option to find update and we're going to 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.100
 choose us the firmware in this case 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.000
 which we have downloaded we use the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.370
 option to open 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.590
 and your will update the software ie 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.050
 that if we have left iPad or 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.820
 iphone blocked by using a beta 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.010
 that has expired or by any other 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.340
 reason and we can not activate let's 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.980
 be able to perform this update 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.300
 we use the option to update 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.140
 we click 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.540
 As we can check itunes will check 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.460
 and it will extract the software and immediately 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.840
 proceed to the installation which 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.670
 It will take your time but once installed 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.240
 what we get is to have again 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.980
 our operating device in this 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.260
 case as we can not activate the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.150
 device we observe that we have a 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.480
 excess capacity and that we can not 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.300
 synchronize content is this way this has 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.610
 been the reason why we have decided 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.190
 restore the software in this case let's 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.040
 to opt for this update and we'll see 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.900
 how quickly we solve the problem 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.750
 iTunes prepares the ipad for the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.790
 update restarts and in the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.790
 screen of our ipad we will begin to 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.060
 see the progress bar is this 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.400
 update once done we can 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.520
 already enter our device and 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.160
 work with total normality we wait 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.860
 for this process to be completed and on 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.230
 everything we disconnected the device from 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.349
 our team 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.430
 well as we can observe we already have 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:47.720
 operational again our device 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.390
 with all the functions 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.940
 the applications and their data continue 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.090
 being available 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.040
 and now we can simply go back to 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.650
 perform synchronization is to use 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.750
 our files a much more way 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.330
 quick to restore from a copy of 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.280
 safety especially when we know that 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.890
 our device is simply 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.220
 blocked by an activation or by a 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.710
 problem with the initial configurator 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.519
 well this is all we see in a 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.519
 next video
