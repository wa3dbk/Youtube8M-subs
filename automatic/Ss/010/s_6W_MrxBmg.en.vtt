Gardevoir I predict the switch here into

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
Gardevoir I predict the switch here into
sylveon<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.500> from<00:01:01.649> psyshock<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.910> going

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
so I do get a crit on the moon blast I'm

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.860 
so I do get a crit on the moon blast I'm
not<00:03:43.980> sure<00:03:44.040> how<00:03:44.459> much<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.819> matters<00:03:44.940> i<00:03:45.450> am<00:03:45.599> mac

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
not sure how much it matters i am mac

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.289 
not sure how much it matters i am mac
special<00:03:46.230> attack<00:03:46.500> i<00:03:46.739> would<00:03:47.549> assume<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.940> did<00:03:48.060> it

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
special attack i would assume it did it

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.839 
special attack i would assume it did it
did<00:03:48.360> matter<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.019> degree<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.440> how<00:03:50.280> much<00:03:50.519> i'm

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
did matter to a degree but how much i'm

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.059 
did matter to a degree but how much i'm
not<00:03:51.000> sure<00:03:51.060> i<00:03:51.510> miss<00:03:52.200> my<00:03:52.349> second<00:03:52.650> focus<00:03:52.920> blast

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
not sure i miss my second focus blast

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.890 
not sure i miss my second focus blast
which<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.519> a<00:03:53.700> little<00:03:53.879> unfortunate<00:03:54.299> it's<00:03:54.720> not

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
which is a little unfortunate it's not

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.390 
which is a little unfortunate it's not
super<00:03:55.260> effective<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:55.799> when<00:03:55.950> we've<00:03:56.069> done<00:03:56.129> much

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
super effective so when we've done much

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.949 
super effective so when we've done much
the<00:03:57.090> problem<00:03:57.360> here<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.629> he<00:03:57.810> does

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
the problem here is that he does

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.750 
the problem here is that he does
actually<00:03:58.140> have<00:03:58.349> shift<00:03:58.590> gear<00:03:58.860> which<00:03:59.549> have<00:03:59.670> been

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
actually have shift gear which have been

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.449 
actually have shift gear which have been
seeing<00:04:00.030> quite<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.450> bit<00:04:00.629> lately<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.650> that's<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
seeing quite a bit lately so that's the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.009 
seeing quite a bit lately so that's the
thing<00:04:02.610> i<00:04:02.700> did<00:04:02.849> not<00:04:03.000> know<00:04:03.060> he<00:04:03.390> got<00:04:03.510> blazed<00:04:03.750> pick

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
thing i did not know he got blazed pick

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.809 
thing i did not know he got blazed pick
however<00:04:04.500> i<00:04:04.590> did<00:04:04.769> get<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.069> from<00:04:05.250> an<00:04:05.340> event<00:04:05.579> or

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
however i did get it from an event or

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.660 
however i did get it from an event or
something<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:06.860> i<00:04:07.860> blaze<00:04:08.280> kick<00:04:08.489> does

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
something like that so i blaze kick does

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.550 
something like that so i blaze kick does
actually<00:04:08.849> hurt<00:04:09.150> i<00:04:09.420> go<00:04:09.810> for<00:04:09.930> an<00:04:10.049> extreme<00:04:10.319> speed

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
actually hurt i go for an extreme speed

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.440 
actually hurt i go for an extreme speed
just<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:11.010> see<00:04:11.280> i<00:04:11.549> would<00:04:11.700> be<00:04:11.819> able<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.150> hit<00:04:12.269> it

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
just to see i would be able to hit it

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.990 
just to see i would be able to hit it
and<00:04:12.829> it<00:04:13.829> actually<00:04:14.129> killed<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.579> after<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.819> life

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
and it actually killed it after a life

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.710 
and it actually killed it after a life
or<00:04:15.180> which<00:04:15.329> is<00:04:15.450> pretty<00:04:15.660> okay<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.139> mean<00:04:16.530> um<00:04:17.720> not

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
or which is pretty okay I mean um not

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.700 
or which is pretty okay I mean um not
too<00:04:19.530> bad<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.789> mean<00:04:21.000> at<00:04:21.239> least<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.510> killed<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.870> his

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
too bad I mean at least I killed it his

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.590 
too bad I mean at least I killed it his
mistake<00:04:23.039> here<00:04:23.250> was<00:04:23.400> not<00:04:23.639> mock<00:04:23.940> punching<00:04:24.449> I

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
mistake here was not mock punching I

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.180 
mistake here was not mock punching I
actually<00:04:24.780> assumed<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.560> he<00:04:25.680> did<00:04:25.800> not<00:04:25.830> have

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
actually assumed that he did not have

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.580 
actually assumed that he did not have
mock<00:04:26.430> lunch<00:04:26.720> because<00:04:27.720> he<00:04:27.930> did<00:04:28.080> not<00:04:28.110> go<00:04:28.320> for

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
mock lunch because he did not go for

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.080 
mock lunch because he did not go for
that's<00:04:28.830> why<00:04:28.949> I<00:04:28.979> go<00:04:29.100> into<00:04:29.220> good<00:04:29.400> ninja<00:04:29.520> here<00:04:29.880> and

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
that's why I go into good ninja here and

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.270 
that's why I go into good ninja here and
go<00:04:30.180> for<00:04:30.449> a<00:04:30.479> hydrophone<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:31.410> which<00:04:31.919> does<00:04:32.160> not

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
go for a hydrophone I which does not

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.100 
go for a hydrophone I which does not
kill<00:04:32.550> so<00:04:32.789> I'm<00:04:32.940> thinking<00:04:33.300> he<00:04:33.449> might<00:04:33.570> be<00:04:33.720> assault

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
kill so I'm thinking he might be assault

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.390 
kill so I'm thinking he might be assault
