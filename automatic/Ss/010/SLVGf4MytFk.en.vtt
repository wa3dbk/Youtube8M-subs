00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.810 
team I just went kind of cheap on the
Gronk<00:01:52.700> because<00:01:53.740> he's<00:01:54.740> pretty<00:01:55.189> expensive<00:01:55.460> man

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
Gronk because he's pretty expensive man

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.539 
Gronk because he's pretty expensive man
so<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.990> try<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.290> keep<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:57.979> budget<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.399> little

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
so I try to keep the budget a little

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.810 
so I try to keep the budget a little
lower<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.570> that's<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.320> offense<00:02:00.860> let's<00:02:01.579> go

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
lower so that's the offense let's go

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.740 
lower so that's the offense let's go
ahead<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.509> check<00:02:03.079> out<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.740> defense<00:02:04.430> so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
ahead and check out this defense so

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.090 
ahead and check out this defense so
there's<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.840> lot<00:02:05.990> more<00:02:06.110> players<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.530> defense<00:02:06.560> of

there's a lot more players on defense of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.050 
there's a lot more players on defense of

Patriots defense and we have a lot of

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.449 
Patriots defense and we have a lot of
Super<00:02:13.910> Bowl<00:02:14.200> history<00:02:15.200> MVP<00:02:15.890> players<00:02:16.190> that's

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
Super Bowl history MVP players that's

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.160 
Super Bowl history MVP players that's
what<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.760> gets<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.690> was<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.989> guy<00:02:18.140> that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170

I<00:02:18.379> posted<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:18.980> Instagram<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.810> was<00:02:21.050> a

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
I posted it on Instagram this was a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.860 
I posted it on Instagram this was a
sheis

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
sheis

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.979 
sheis
night<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.170> got<00:02:22.440> him<00:02:22.560> for<00:02:22.709> 11<00:02:23.159> K<00:02:23.400> guys<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.000> I

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
night I got him for 11 K guys and I

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.240 
night I got him for 11 K guys and I
don't<00:02:25.170> know<00:02:25.349> why<00:02:25.440> people<00:02:25.470> are<00:02:25.739> monopolizing

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
don't know why people are monopolizing

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.210 
don't know why people are monopolizing
him<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.879> he<00:02:27.060> ranged<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:27.540> 200<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.409> 1<00:02:28.920> million

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
him that he ranged from 200 to 1 million

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160 
him that he ranged from 200 to 1 million
coins<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.700> people<00:02:29.940> buy<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.599> price<00:02:30.780> so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
coins and people buy it at that price so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.470 
coins and people buy it at that price so
this<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.099> probably<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.580> good<00:02:32.640> as<00:02:32.909> red<00:02:33.090> Bryant

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
this is probably as good as red Bryant

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.509 
this is probably as good as red Bryant
right<00:02:33.569> now<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:35.190> don't<00:02:35.340> know<00:02:35.430> if

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
right now just because I don't know if

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.190 
right now just because I don't know if
you<00:02:35.640> were<00:02:35.760> stopping<00:02:36.060> people<00:02:36.299> from<00:02:36.659> trying<00:02:37.140> to

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
you were stopping people from trying to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.539 
you were stopping people from trying to
do<00:02:37.319> an<00:02:37.409> all<00:02:37.590> Patriots<00:02:38.040> team<00:02:38.720> but<00:02:40.099> or<00:02:41.099> they're

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
do an all Patriots team but or they're

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.569 
do an all Patriots team but or they're
just<00:02:42.079> monopolizing<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.200> Gronk<00:02:43.500> MVP<00:02:44.069> set<00:02:44.370> so

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
just monopolizing the Gronk MVP set so

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.990 
just monopolizing the Gronk MVP set so
but<00:02:44.760> he<00:02:45.060> goes<00:02:45.840> for<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.110> huge<00:02:46.950> amount<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.220> coins

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
but he goes for a huge amount of coins

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.089 
but he goes for a huge amount of coins
and<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.360> select<00:02:48.659> them<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:48.959> 11<00:02:49.319> K<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:49.829> was

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
and I select them for 11 K so that was

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.809 
and I select them for 11 K so that was
pretty<00:02:50.310> cool

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
pretty cool

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.880 
pretty cool
this<00:02:51.360> could<00:02:51.629> be<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> possibly<00:02:52.260> way<00:02:52.409> of<00:02:52.530> making

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
this could be a possibly way of making

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.309 
this could be a possibly way of making
money<00:02:53.040> because<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.610> was<00:02:53.819> so<00:02:53.970> easy<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.269> snipe<00:02:54.569> but

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
money because I was so easy to snipe but

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.050 
money because I was so easy to snipe but
yeah<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.799> let's<00:02:55.950> look<00:02:56.069> at<00:02:56.190> his<00:02:56.310> defense<00:02:56.489> we<00:02:56.879> got

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.509 
yeah so let's look at his defense we got
Darrelle<00:02:57.810> Revis<00:02:57.989> as<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.379> cornerback<00:02:58.829> I<00:02:59.220> went

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519
