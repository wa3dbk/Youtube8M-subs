you<00:02:12.880> start<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.209> game<00:02:14.110> flat<00:02:14.440> B<00:02:14.620> flat<00:02:14.650> E<00:02:14.890> flat

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
you start this game flat B flat E flat

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.630 
you start this game flat B flat E flat
left<00:02:16.000> hands<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.630> low<00:02:16.989> E<00:02:17.019> flat<00:02:17.410> B<00:02:17.769> flat<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:18.430> E

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
left hands on a low E flat B flat and E

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.250 
left hands on a low E flat B flat and E
flat<00:02:18.959> one

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.600 

so<00:02:22.739> goes<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.310> two<00:02:23.760> three<00:02:24.270> four<00:02:24.780> five<00:02:25.319> six<00:02:25.920> so

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
so goes one two three four five six so

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.699 
so goes one two three four five six so
this<00:02:26.730> comes<00:02:27.000> between<00:02:27.209> count<00:02:27.989> five<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.470> six

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
this comes between count five and six

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.030 
this comes between count five and six
one<00:02:29.340> two<00:02:29.760> three<00:02:30.330> four<00:02:30.840> five<00:02:31.319> six

one two three four five six

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.100 
one two three four five six
spin<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:36.230> second<00:02:37.230> chance<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:39.569> we<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.870> G

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
spin the second chance so here we have G

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.850 
spin the second chance so here we have G

a<00:03:08.940> break<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:11.250> here<00:03:11.459> we<00:03:11.579> have<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.480> same<00:03:12.660> exact

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
a break so here we have the same exact

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.720 
a break so here we have the same exact
course<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.560> had<00:03:13.739> here<00:03:14.010> okay<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.489> not<00:03:14.610> going
