00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.600
 happiness

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:37.569
 we can tell 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.869
 I was actually invited to work at that time to found the foundation in the 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:43.600
 Brazil 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.759

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.869
 people from there and we had some parties to be able to fuck the foundation 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.609
 concerts in brazil 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.819
 understood there were several raffle kisses 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.990
 we studied 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.809
 these children and young people 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.319
 people are demanding with the wild parties they make the prices in the 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.849
 next events 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.900
 and he spends this paid income on all of them are reversed about 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.539
 does 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:32.059
 then actually what the people who will play another are 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:36.509
 partners are tourism weight suppliers' and they do not have this thing of the 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.999
 prejudice goes whoever wants to invite us if the entire landfill hotels 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:45.269
 of Rio de Janeiro and is spreading in the time and grace of the 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.409
 good thing also spreads so sometimes I take so the phone whereabouts 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.159
 There is someone who wants to give a donation. 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.829
 until opting 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.379
 You always lived through this. 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.759
 are also called 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:03.539
 no one that you live against reality my reality that is not 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:04.319
 of today 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.679
 and this reality I work on the front line 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.159
 there are clear indications 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.019
 17 years 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.979
 but I have a lot of ground 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.060
 because I suspect 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.009
 this month of May being institutions 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.949
 so it is a job that is 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.430
 and today yes 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.319
 well but I'm very down to earth a lot by the boss a lot 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.930
 very dear the trips for your return to the stages see also are 

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:27.379
 working too much 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.669
 first because we do not have to pay parking you have to have 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.210
 A very good conversation with this. 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.669
 had once 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.509
 I did not ask you to question a gun. 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.039
 his birthday, his birthday 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.539
 and I asked if he lost 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.249
 that is who criticizes the trip of the elephant 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.649
 was not an isolated case and to return to power is not because usually when 

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:47.150
 I'll 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.550
 it's a children's dish 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.770
 and I asked her so I was ready 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.279
 whatever he wanted 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.279
 He even talks a bicycle the quintet. 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.949
 the place spent five years 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.979
 and what he answered me 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.490
 let me have my strength forces at that moment 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.419
 Ã©fren pedra that you made this 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.419
 James Vibe I want to paint 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.059
 and that club's whistle story 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:19.059
 left me a lunge 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.029
 because 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.669
 to paint 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.669
 is very little 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.539
 and striker before the judo team then this is it 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.130
 the ATM 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.130
 black gil also people who think it will not help me much 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.350
 the drop in team performance
