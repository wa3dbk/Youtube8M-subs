00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.290
 what the hell was that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.500
 we have the map when it is at least 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.689
 Half a dozen 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.029
 we do not need everything we must assume that 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.520
 there is some deterioration I do not think that all 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 remain functional at least two 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.380
 they seem to be in masses of land that already 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 we do not exist, we will send equipment to each 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.420
 site to determine its viability only 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.059
 we need one the truth what happens with 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.640
 the rest pick up the ones you do not have to leave 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.080
 nothing at random the last thing we want is 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.780
 that some survivor believes us 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.540
 problems in the new world and the killer 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.820
 it is no longer necessary not to wait 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.840
 You know how this is, I doubt we can 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.180
 enter by good can be useful your 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.920
 I recommend that we keep it 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.350
 to confirm that it does not wait for us 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.800
 no surprise on those sites that 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.920
 waste of time you said no 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.360
 we should leave nothing to chance again 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.640
 make sure we do not need it 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.640
 then kill the good 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.939
 stop undermining my authority and I have 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.190
 saved the back we go we have a lot 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.410
 work 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.420
 do not get very comfortable sir mails 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.570

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.140

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.250

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.140
