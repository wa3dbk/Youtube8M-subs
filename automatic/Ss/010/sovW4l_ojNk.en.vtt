00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.589
 Hello today is is called and at the appropriate charter school 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.620
 I'll talk about the choices and the slow packaging. 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.329
 is. 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.219
 Gyeonggi Province has a center on the camera and a certain position 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.270
 This is the scale, 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.650
 Also known as the Korean Peninsula 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.510
 Photo isyan isna 251214 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.810
 Beige 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.710
 Society will do 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.440
 The future is hard and hard when we shoot 6400 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.400
 It is not a good idea to use a lot of supervisors. 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.650
 It is core 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.310
 Kazimier with the director 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.250
 May increase 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.970
 Sensitive response in small packages 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.320
 Returning to the state 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.350
 It corresponds to a rebound in injury 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.640
 On the other hand, 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.400
 It was said to be the first decline. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.500
 Even in dark places such as sports photos, 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.850
 In the center of the center 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270
 Iso will drive vehicles in over 400 segments 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.360
 However, the higher the intensity, 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.400
 The grain of the photograph becomes rough 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.340
 The more evil there is, the more spousal administration is expanded. 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.160
 If you get too many kids from your digital camera 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 In addition to its location, 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.030
 Images from within a digital camera 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.260
 Relevant technology to prevent railway delays in the peninsula from occurring 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.349
 We are developing 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.679
 So the look of the director should be free on 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.859
 And many of the people 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.709
 Are you getting better 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.480
 I need to raise the sensitivity when I take a picture of Hight nrg 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.579
 There is not 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.799
 The shutter speed is not secured here. 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.609
 You can raise it. 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.279
 Unlike the conventional one, the digital camera is 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.319
 You can shoot while changing 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.269
 If you look for the director you need 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.269
 Please prescribe. 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.349
 Next, a vigorously developed shutter speed is selected and controlled 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.510
 about 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.969
 I'll talk to you. 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.689
 If you take a picture, the sports picture will take about 1/2 a second 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.749
 Stopped at a fast shutter speed of 1/500 second 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.049
 I'll keep the image 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.259
 In the case of a city that is energized and lacks light, the shutter speed is fast 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:20.959
 To get out 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.389
 We also select strength as a pipe. 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.829
 Such moving subjects are already dynamic 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.959
 Shutter speed is used and conversely, 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.469
 No fireworks, no pain or movement 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.679
 The dark night view of the light shows the recent 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:44.169
 even if 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.449
 I dismissed it. They have to find what they have to choose 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:52.189
 I talked outside six. As the speed changes, 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:56.659
 I denied the existence and understand it. 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.839
 In addition to creative support, 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.569
 Would you like tv av 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.650
 This is the shooting mode in which the camera automatically determines the action 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.629
 If you specify the camera automatically then you can expect to peel off 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.629
 I will take a picture. 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:21.440
 However, even if the exposure has been set, 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.760
 Taking 7 days while taking a shot shortage 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.760
 There will be occasions when it becomes the sea. 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:33.509
 In recent years, the camera function has improved 

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.069
 I take that. 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.189
 Appropriate exposure is lost, but it is not perfect. 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:43.999
 Therefore, in some cases, 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.529
 It is not. 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:46.910
 E.g 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.310
 If you shoot the body after the new world as Camara suggested 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.870
 How to get out 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.419
 At this time, the measures are one step lower. 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.400
 I will not 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.240
 On the contrary, if the subject is taken as it is, 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.419
 You'll have to take steps to make sure you get it right. 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.379
 So, depending on the subject, 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.819
 Only a few monstrous steps in the monster 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.550
 Eight of the photos Exposure correction is beneficial even when he is dark 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.949
 Whether or not the exposure is corrected. When the kt stage is set up, it comes. 

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:37.589
 It's with automatic withdrawal. 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:42.429
 I dream of sending a dozen saga to set the exposure automatically 

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:45.429
 I found a third of the saucers. 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.879
 The bricketti side of the work is the old 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.699
 If you want to shoot in three steps, 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.699
 You can get pictures 

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:02.019
 So far, there are three 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.960
 Quality assurance has been talked about 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.910
 Thank you goodbye
