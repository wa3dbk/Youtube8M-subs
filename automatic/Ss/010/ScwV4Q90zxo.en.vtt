well<00:01:48.909> you<00:01:49.689> can<00:01:49.840> take<00:01:49.959> a<00:01:50.020> monofilament<00:01:50.649> or<00:01:50.979> a

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
well you can take a monofilament or a

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.639 
well you can take a monofilament or a
fishing<00:01:51.489> line<00:01:51.880> like<00:01:52.239> this<00:01:52.479> one<00:01:52.689> and<00:01:52.899> build<00:01:53.529> a

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
fishing line like this one and build a

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.399 
fishing line like this one and build a
fence<00:01:53.829> about<00:01:54.039> three<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.520> four<00:01:54.669> feet<00:01:54.909> tall<00:01:55.409> deer
