00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.170
 Yes 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.250
 yes hello together here are the casual 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.740
 pierick rafters and there are indeed 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.040
 again a borderlands 2 video of us 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.930
 on the subject of slot machines yes we 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.759
 They certainly know and I explain 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.130
 you today times what it's all there are so 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.290
 Of course, there is the bad guy, of course 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.090
 psycho yes if you psycho three times 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.400
 then he gets a grenade 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.960
 fall that makes a lot of damage 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.809
 also level based that is if you are 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.800
 not too big sign then had 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.840
 I'm pretty good in it 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.000
 but we want something here 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.190
 So we'll go ahead and win 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.290
 and look what we still in the so 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.510
 Slot machines can pull everything yes 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.520
 of course there are also grenades 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.559
 still the classic rent you have 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 unfortunately nothing gained that happens when 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.860
 three different items or it 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.480
 even enough even if the first 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.070
 then both are different 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.610
 So you just just a rivet and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.780
 then your money is gone then yes go 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.100
 Let's go a little further 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.600
 We're actually winning something 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.369
 right if we do that twice 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.580
 same item and a bell at the end 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.500
 Then there is money if we are in front 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.760
 have two bells and something behind 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.619
 there is a bit more money and at 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.080
 three bells, there is really a lot of money 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.330
 yes, but we do not want money here 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.580
 want beautiful items that's why 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.100
 next if the front both teams the same 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.500
 are you rolling the dice and the back? 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.479
 psycho then you get a white weapon 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.040
 is not great but it 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.159
 after all, even a small upgrade 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.460
 yes it continues with the weapons 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.369
 Proof comes green and green sloot 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.950
 you get with three churches so well 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.070
 big guns come out on the left guns 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.840
 come out the front of the drawer so 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.780
 Cherry Ash Cherry and you get 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.280
 a green weapon but we have in the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.619
 title already announced that we are here 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.299
 Legendary it's looking for orange weapons 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.130
 So let's go behind ladder 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.320
 and if you are here three times this leg 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.579
 or yes the pantyhose of maxi 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.459
 even then there is already one 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:13.500
 blue weapon very nice are the weapons 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.239
 by the way also how it whole loaded what me 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.459
 Here's how it fits your level 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.750
 means I always find soy just below 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.579
 level 35 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.380
 It continues when we three times the 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.170
 get markus then it is even already 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.780
 purple weapon just beautiful they are too 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.800
 times something worthwhile and on the computer 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.900
 distance 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.630
 So there you can cancel quite well 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.910
 if you get the mark three times yes 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.340
 this can be, we can not as we 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.550
 but just pull the losebude again 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.040
 drum roll and we get ting ting 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.480
 ting three times seven years with three 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.130
 get the seven you get one 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.020
 character skins there are of 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.240
 different manufacturers for 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.380
 different skins class you there 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.580
 I can get now 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.190
 Almost all because I just 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.480
 For hours around but as I said 37 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.460
 and you get a free one 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.310
 character or 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.330
 he is now not so free 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.940
 you can also win government if 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.430
 we get three times the individual ingots 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.470
 then there is a four in it 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.080
 in the iridium would be mentioned 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.150
 which is cool, get some 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.250
 friends in the game so it plays 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.510
 not alone if you are here at the slot 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.970
 machines but with several 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.670
 everyone gets that iridium 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.140
 If we are here now I mean these three 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.300
 times the double government stacks 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.050
 dice and therefore get eight region and 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.730
 collects the 1 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.290
 then , for example, get the mabo if 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.940
 he also plays eight iridium with me 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.130
 although he did not play at all 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.540
 So by or 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.690
 he has already played but he stood 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.890
 not in the same slot machines yes 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.870
 yes, last but not least there is even 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.810
 still on the subject of rhi the um if you 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.270
 three times the three aspects region gets 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.860
 then even whole twelve threaten with the 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.430
 nice sound and fall for you on the 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.320
 Feet so there you can also right 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.840
 well iridium earn by upgrades 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.290
