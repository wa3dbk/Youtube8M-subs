00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
gonna go in the last five years we've

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.610 
gonna go in the last five years we've
had<00:01:44.180> three<00:01:44.510> and<00:01:44.630> Wainwright's<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.260> to<00:01:45.440> engage

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
had three and Wainwright's and to engage

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.700 
had three and Wainwright's and to engage
town<00:01:46.130> from<00:01:47.030> my<00:01:47.180> own<00:01:47.300> perspective<00:01:47.630> there's<00:01:48.560> no

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
town from my own perspective there's no

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.250

comparison<00:01:49.430> Wainwright<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.570> much<00:01:50.960> larger

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
comparison Wainwright is a much larger

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.370 
comparison Wainwright is a much larger
area<00:01:51.710> from<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.729> maneuver<00:01:53.330> perspective<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.229> is

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
area from a maneuver perspective it is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.070 
area from a maneuver perspective it is
much<00:01:54.619> better<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.369> affords<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.119> planners<00:01:57.050> and

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
much better it affords the planners and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.650 
much better it affords the planners and
the<00:01:57.290> people<00:01:57.860> executing<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.610> missions<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:59.210> lot

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
the people executing the missions a lot

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.660 
the people executing the missions a lot
more<00:01:59.869> maneuver<00:02:00.260> space<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.830> execute<00:02:01.490> those

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
more maneuver space to execute those

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.490 
more maneuver space to execute those
missions<00:02:02.060> it's<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.600> much<00:02:02.750> better<00:02:02.990> training

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
missions it's a much better training

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.430 
missions it's a much better training
area<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.010> I<00:02:04.700> think<00:02:05.150> it's<00:02:05.660> proved<00:02:05.960> very

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
area and I think it's proved very

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.130 
area and I think it's proved very
worthwhile<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:07.040> have<00:02:07.190> them<00:02:07.340> here

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
worthwhile to have them here
