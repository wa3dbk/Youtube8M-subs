00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
basically if you know the the DB 90

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.790 
basically if you know the the DB 90
pretty<00:00:18.449> well<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.840> way<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:18.990> change<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.590> memory

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
pretty well the way to change the memory

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.920 
pretty well the way to change the memory
settings<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.210> get<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> memory<00:00:21.689> button

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
settings is to get the memory button

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.990 
settings is to get the memory button
make<00:00:22.560> sure<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.920> memory<00:00:23.279> light<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.789> blinking

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
make sure the memory light is blinking

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.269 
make sure the memory light is blinking
in<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> top<00:00:24.600> left<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.769> use<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> dial

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
in the top left and you can use the dial

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.370 
in the top left and you can use the dial
to<00:00:26.609> change<00:00:26.880> through<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.900> different

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to change through all of your different

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.009 
to change through all of your different
memory<00:00:28.650> settings<00:00:29.330> if<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.390> run<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.840> show

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
memory settings if you run in a show

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.290 
memory settings if you run in a show
segment<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.800> need<00:00:32.009> tempo<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.120> beat

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
segment and you need tempo right on beat

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.840 
segment and you need tempo right on beat
one<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.809> next<00:00:34.050> measure<00:00:34.579> sometimes<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> can

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
one of the next measure sometimes it can

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.240 
one of the next measure sometimes it can
be<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> pain<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.540> turn<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> dial<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.129> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
be a pain to turn the dial and get it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.490 
be a pain to turn the dial and get it
directly<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.790> tempo<00:00:39.270> sometimes<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.110> might<00:00:40.260> go

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
directly in tempo sometimes you might go

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.850 
directly in tempo sometimes you might go
too<00:00:41.190> far<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> you'll<00:00:43.050> skip<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> beat<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
too far so you'll skip a beat and go to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.260 
too far so you'll skip a beat and go to
a<00:00:43.920> program<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> didn't<00:00:44.760> want<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> go<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
a program that you didn't want to go to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.410 
a program that you didn't want to go to
or<00:00:46.039> or<00:00:47.039> maybe<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.340> won't<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.760> tempo<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
or or maybe you won't do it in tempo and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.119 
or or maybe you won't do it in tempo and
so<00:00:48.750> therefore<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.260> create<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> skip<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
so therefore you create a skip and the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.709 
so therefore you create a skip and the
beat<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.579> through<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> mega<00:00:51.030> Vox<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
beat going through the mega Vox and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
beat going through the mega Vox and
rehearsal<00:00:52.320> gets<00:00:52.500> stopped<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:54.530> directors<00:00:55.530> get

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
rehearsal gets stopped and directors get

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.709 
rehearsal gets stopped and directors get
mad<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> pretty<00:00:57.149> sight<00:00:57.239> because

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
mad and it's not a pretty sight because

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.250 
mad and it's not a pretty sight because
rehearsal<00:00:58.140> gets<00:00:58.320> bogged<00:00:58.530> down<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:59.039> quick

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
rehearsal gets bogged down pretty quick

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
rehearsal gets bogged down pretty quick
that's<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.440> way<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> another<00:01:02.370> way<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that's one way to do it another way that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.700 
that's one way to do it another way that
I've<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.539> I've<00:01:03.660> seen<00:01:03.960> done<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> Blue

I've got a couple plugs on the end and a

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.050 
I've got a couple plugs on the end and a
couple<00:02:15.290> buttons<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:17.090> with<00:02:17.689> this<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:19.250> first

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
couple buttons so with this this first

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.869 
couple buttons so with this this first
jack<00:02:20.780> on<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.110> top<00:02:21.439> goes<00:02:22.280> into<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.579> memory

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
jack on the top goes into the memory

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.000 
jack on the top goes into the memory
slot<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.870> then<00:02:24.079> this<00:02:24.260> second<00:02:24.650> jack<00:02:24.799> at<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
slot and then this second jack at the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.399 
slot and then this second jack at the
bottom<00:02:25.310> doesn't<00:02:25.610> your<00:02:25.730> start/stop<00:02:26.390> Jack<00:02:27.140> our

bottom doesn't your start/stop Jack our
start/stop<00:02:27.950> Jack<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:29.629> reason<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:29.989> the

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
start/stop Jack the reason for the

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.319 
start/stop Jack the reason for the
start/stop<00:02:30.650> plug<00:02:31.280> over<00:02:31.879> here<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:32.239> not

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
start/stop plug over here it's not

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.940 
start/stop plug over here it's not
really<00:02:32.540> attached<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.959> anything<00:02:33.170> but<00:02:33.799> it's

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
really attached to anything but it's

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.220 
really attached to anything but it's
meant<00:02:34.159> for<00:02:34.250> stability<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.689> whenever<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.019> plug

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
meant for stability so whenever you plug

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.479 
meant for stability so whenever you plug
it<00:02:36.349> into<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.620> side<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> mat<00:02:37.189> you're<00:02:37.370> not

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
it into the side of the mat you're not

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.369 
it into the side of the mat you're not
gonna<00:02:37.579> get<00:02:37.790> any<00:02:37.939> wiggle<00:02:38.359> and<00:02:38.569> it's<00:02:38.930> it

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
gonna get any wiggle and it's it

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.830 
gonna get any wiggle and it's it
supports<00:02:39.859> itself<00:02:40.129> a<00:02:40.280> little<00:02:40.400> bit<00:02:40.579> better<00:02:40.840> so

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
supports itself a little bit better so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.929 
supports itself a little bit better so
with<00:02:42.019> this<00:02:42.230> button<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.890> have<00:02:43.129> two<00:02:43.459> buttons<00:02:43.670> on

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
with this button I have two buttons on

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.509 
with this button I have two buttons on
here<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.659> button<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.109> the<00:02:45.230> left<00:02:45.340> takes<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
here this button to the left takes the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.899 
here this button to the left takes the
memory<00:02:46.879> and<00:02:47.470> brings<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.650> up<00:02:48.889> so<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.489> can<00:02:49.519> cycle

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
memory and brings it up so you can cycle

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.759 
memory and brings it up so you can cycle
through<00:02:49.940> you're<00:02:50.150> Larry<00:02:50.269> going<00:02:50.629> up<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.109> then

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
through you're Larry going up and then

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:52.720 
through you're Larry going up and then
the<00:02:51.859> button<00:02:52.099> on<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:52.280> right

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
the button on the right

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.640 
the button on the right
cycles<00:02:53.269> through<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.540> memory<00:02:53.810> going<00:02:53.989> back<00:02:54.349> so

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
cycles through the memory going back so

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.559 
cycles through the memory going back so
say<00:02:54.799> you're<00:02:54.920> running<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.220> show<00:02:55.430> segment<00:02:55.879> and

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
say you're running a show segment and

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.330 
say you're running a show segment and
you're<00:02:56.810> starting<00:02:57.049> your<00:02:57.260> first<00:02:57.709> memory<00:02:57.980> and

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
you're starting your first memory and

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.979 
you're starting your first memory and
then<00:02:58.730> by<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.030> end<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.299> show<00:02:59.450> segment<00:02:59.900> you

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
then by the end of the show segment you

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.740 
then by the end of the show segment you
get<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.409> memory<00:03:00.769> number<00:03:00.950> three<00:03:01.420> two<00:03:02.420> ways<00:03:02.569> that

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
get to memory number three two ways that

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.199 
get to memory number three two ways that
you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:03.019> go<00:03:03.139> back<00:03:03.349> to<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.639> memory<00:03:04.909> one<00:03:05.090> if

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
you can go back to to memory one if

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.610 
you can go back to to memory one if
you're<00:03:05.329> doing<00:03:05.450> reset<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:05.989> hit<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.290> memory

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
you're doing reset is hit the memory

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.009 
you're doing reset is hit the memory
button<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.159> then<00:03:07.280> scroll<00:03:07.549> back<00:03:07.819> or<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.900> can

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
button and then scroll back or you can

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.660 
button and then scroll back or you can
just<00:03:09.170> click<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.500> back<00:03:09.650> button<00:03:09.680> twice<00:03:10.250> and

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
just click the back button twice and

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.589 
just click the back button twice and
then<00:03:11.030> you're<00:03:11.209> back<00:03:11.329> at<00:03:11.569> memory<00:03:11.870> one<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:13.280> let's

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
then you're back at memory one so let's

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.439 
then you're back at memory one so let's
let's<00:03:14.599> see<00:03:14.900> how<00:03:15.139> this<00:03:15.409> thing<00:03:15.680> works<00:03:15.980> out<00:03:16.449> let's

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:17.449 
let's see how this thing works out let's

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:54.400 
let's see how this thing works out let's
get<00:03:17.629> some<00:03:17.870> beats<00:03:18.079> over<00:03:18.410> here

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.470 

all<00:03:55.410> right<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.890> there<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.250> basically<00:03:57.209> our

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
all right so there it is basically our

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.850 
all right so there it is basically our
our<00:03:57.870> little<00:03:58.080> button<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.650> we've<00:03:58.769> been

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
our little button that we've been

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.110 
our little button that we've been
working<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.400> makes<00:03:59.549> life<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.849> little<00:03:59.970> bit

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
working on it makes life a little bit

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.410 
working on it makes life a little bit
easier<00:04:00.680> much<00:04:01.680> smaller<00:04:02.040> than<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.269> boss

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
easier much smaller than the in the boss

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.750
