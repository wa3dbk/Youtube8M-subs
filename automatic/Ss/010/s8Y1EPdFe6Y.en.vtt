level I really quickly sought one out

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.749 
level I really quickly sought one out
and<00:01:20.790> tried<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.360> find<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.610> reproduce<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and tried to find a way to reproduce it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.520 
and tried to find a way to reproduce it
out<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> paint<00:01:24.180> able<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:24.690> one<00:01:24.930> I've<00:01:25.350> been

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
out of paint able to make one I've been

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.060
