00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
going to build a sandwich spaces are on

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
going to build a sandwich spaces are on
either<00:00:49.289> side<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> leg<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.550> give<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
either side of the leg to give it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
either side of the leg to give it
stability<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.629> we'll<00:00:51.809> only<00:00:51.989> screw<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
stability but we'll only screw the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.430 
stability but we'll only screw the
spacer<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.430> foot<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.989> leg<00:00:55.199> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
spacer to the foot but not the leg to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
spacer to the foot but not the leg to
the<00:00:55.530> foot<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.980> later<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> pull<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the foot so later we can pull up the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.200 
the foot so later we can pull up the
ladder<00:00:57.329> assembly<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.050> storage<00:00:58.969> I'm<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
ladder assembly for storage I'm going to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.369 
ladder assembly for storage I'm going to
drill<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:01.050> counter<00:01:01.890> circles<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.420> I've<00:01:04.260> got

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
drill for counter circles and I've got

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.469 
drill for counter circles and I've got
my<00:01:04.500> spacers<00:01:04.890> are<00:01:05.010> already<00:01:05.250> pre-drilled<00:01:05.610> off

my spacers are already pre-drilled off

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.210 
my spacers are already pre-drilled off
centered<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.770> doesn't<00:01:08.010> conflict

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
centered so that it doesn't conflict

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
centered so that it doesn't conflict
with<00:01:08.400> my<00:01:08.640> other<00:01:08.820> foot<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> glue
