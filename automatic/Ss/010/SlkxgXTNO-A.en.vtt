00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
put 60 if you have a 120 Hertz monitor

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.960 
put 60 if you have a 120 Hertz monitor
point<00:01:51.619> 120<00:01:52.190> if<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.399> have<00:01:52.490> 144<00:01:53.270> plus<00:01:54.399> 144<00:01:55.399> and

detail on low and shade detail on low

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.010 
detail on low and shade detail on low
because<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.460> if<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:35.210> a<00:02:35.240> smoke<00:02:35.660> or

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
because like if you see a smoke or

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.260 
because like if you see a smoke or
something<00:02:36.380> like<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:37.550> won't<00:02:37.730> get<00:02:38.120> as

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
something like that you won't get as

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.040 
something like that you won't get as
much<00:02:38.450> FPS<00:02:38.990> Robbie<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:39.950> low<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.960> you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
much FPS Robbie but this on low and you

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.180 
much FPS Robbie but this on low and you
want<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.260> turn<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.500> multiple<00:02:42.860> rendering

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
want to turn on multiple rendering

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.540 
want to turn on multiple rendering
because<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:43.580> utilizes<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.540> multiple<00:02:44.870> CPUs

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
because this utilizes the multiple CPUs

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.650 
because this utilizes the multiple CPUs
present<00:02:46.550> in<00:02:46.670> your<00:02:46.820> system<00:02:47.000> you're<00:02:47.390> like<00:02:47.510> what

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
present in your system you're like what

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.660 
present in your system you're like what
if<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.810> don't<00:02:48.020> have<00:02:48.170> multiple<00:02:48.500> well<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.460> it

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
if I don't have multiple well that it

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.010 
if I don't have multiple well that it
dis<00:02:49.880> basically<00:02:50.270> means<00:02:50.480> if<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.750> have<00:02:50.900> like<00:02:50.990> a

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
dis basically means if you have like a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.740 
dis basically means if you have like a
dual-core<00:02:51.440> or<00:02:51.500> quad-core<00:02:51.790> it'll<00:02:52.790> use<00:02:52.940> all<00:02:53.330> of

dual-core or quad-core it'll use all of

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.770 
dual-core or quad-core it'll use all of
it<00:02:53.870> your<00:02:54.200> CPUs<00:02:54.560> power<00:02:54.800> on<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.580> game<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.150> they

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it your CPUs power on this game and they

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.020 
it your CPUs power on this game and they
will<00:02:56.870> help<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.560> perform<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.070> better<00:02:58.220> now

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
will help you perform it's better now

don't turn that on and motion blur I
don't<00:03:18.590> know<00:03:18.740> we<00:03:19.010> like<00:03:19.160> motion<00:03:19.610> blur<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.570> I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
don't know we like motion blur so I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.910 
don't know we like motion blur so I
don't<00:03:21.920> know
