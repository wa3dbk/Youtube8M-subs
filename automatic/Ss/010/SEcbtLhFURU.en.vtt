00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.830
 the Yaquis lose two races six 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.170
 hits zero errors in a match that 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.330
 since early, he brought news from 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.790
 early came to bring careers and it was 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.430
 for the visiting team they were taking 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.259
 three in the first chapter Luis Borges 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.470
 with the base by ball a match that 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.329
 opened the tamaulipeco rolando valdez and 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.559
 Jorge Cantú was the first one who brought 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.809
 races to the plate a hit 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.559
 difficult to line the line of the third 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.390
 base towed Borges also to Karim 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.730
 From there, the orange people took 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.620
 advantage of two races per 0 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.570
 valdés was going through problems for 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.480
 find the strike zone was 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.100
 faltering and this line would come this hit 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.469
 towards the central garden of edgar 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.600
 quintero so he sang he scored and so 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.219
 fast orange will take the advantage and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.379
 The main problems of valdés 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.239
 they were more than anything that managed to place 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.930
 hitters with two strikes but not 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.740
 I finally managed to eliminate them 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.570
 they tried to put together a reaction 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.030
 the Yaquis but the defense of the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.790
 Naranjeros was brilliant Luis Borges 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.409
 in a great night connecting here the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.259
 tablazo to tow one more race 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.939
 of flavor so unfortunately for him 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.880
 I feel that it has always been excellent 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 defensive and made a mistake though 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.689
 anyway, these were the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.539
 brush strokes that we saw of video in 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.520
 different moments of the Miguel party 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.789
 ruiz in a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.109
 spectacular output could be said is 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.039
 led to his fourth victory of the 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.960
 season 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.450
 that jorge cantú play that was 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.369
 great because it was complicated and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.069
 then he solved the initial and Luis 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.960
 Borges that was still inspired by Borges 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.750
 like josé juan aguilar today they had 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.579
 featured offensive days there until 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.459
 the intermediate was going to give because it is stuck 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.890
 couple of hits and jose good aguilar took 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.110
 three for the cause after the real the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.119
 Parade of Yaqui relievers came 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.759
 the young martini sotelo came osvaldo 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.370
 martínez vino césar carrillo iván zavala 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.959
 giovani gallegos and also began to 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.670
 get the team's home runs 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.890
 and the offensive of the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.510
 naranjeros was very distributed no 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.150
 player came to produce more than two 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.829
 races gave 18 hits to give 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.520
 an idea go from the score of 92 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:29.280
 they left 12 runners on the trails 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.010
 here jose el chapo amador got his 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.200
 second this case of the entire return of the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.880
 campaign to join the club all 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.130
 starters hit at least one unstoppable 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.900
 by the naranjeros and jesse 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.430
 Gutierrez who also told him to have 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.740
 to entertain the file of 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.020
 Ivan Zavala would be writing 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.250
 the story of this first of the series 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.460
 in which hermosillo hits first 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.860
 followed the hits of the naranjeros 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.010
 and the races kept coming to the plate 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.500
 one of Yaqui workers who before 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.410
 start the meeting very shortly before such 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.660
 once half an hour 45 minutes they knew the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.390
 news that he had the new manager 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.320
 Juan Gabriel Castro was in front in 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.150
 place of matías carrillo that also 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.830
 he received the news apparently until 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.880
 that will come here to this city we go in 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.880
 a cut and we go back
