video series thanks for tuning in today
what<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.220> like<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.550> talk<00:00:08.700> about<00:00:08.910> our<00:00:09.210> sales

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
what I like to talk about our sales

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.549 
what I like to talk about our sales
simulations<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.330> specifically<00:00:12.410> like<00:00:13.410> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
simulations and specifically like to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.640 
simulations and specifically like to
address<00:00:13.799> two<00:00:14.009> topics<00:00:14.460> one<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:16.109> well<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.529> they

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
address two topics one how well do they

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.929 
address two topics one how well do they
work<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:18.020> why<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.500> secondly<00:00:20.430> are<00:00:20.580> they<00:00:20.730> being

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
work and why and secondly are they being

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.090 
work and why and secondly are they being
underutilized<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> training<00:00:22.289> methodology

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
underutilized as a training methodology

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.179 
underutilized as a training methodology
a<00:00:24.230> little<00:00:25.230> bit<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> context<00:00:25.830> setting<00:00:26.039> first

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
a little bit of context setting first

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.759 
a little bit of context setting first
when<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.240> talking<00:00:27.570> about<00:00:27.599> sales<00:00:28.170> simulations

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
when I'm talking about sales simulations

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.919 
when I'm talking about sales simulations
today<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.910> talking<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.330> classroom

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
today I'm talking about classroom

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.240 
today I'm talking about classroom
simulations<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.740> opposed<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
simulations as opposed to a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.459 
simulations as opposed to a
computer-based<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.570> secondly<00:00:33.899> I'm<00:00:34.110> talking

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
computer-based and secondly I'm talking

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.610 
computer-based and secondly I'm talking
about<00:00:34.680> programs<00:00:35.180> which<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.420> 1<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.960> 2<00:00:37.170> days<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
about programs which are 1 to 2 days in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
about programs which are 1 to 2 days in
length<00:00:38.360> ok<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> little<00:00:39.960> bit<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
length ok with that a little bit of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
length ok with that a little bit of
stage<00:00:40.320> setting<00:00:40.670> let's<00:00:41.670> take<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> first<00:00:42.149> topic

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
stage setting let's take the first topic

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.100 
stage setting let's take the first topic
which<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.140> well<00:00:43.530> did<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:43.710> work<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.930> if

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
which is how well did they work and if

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.470 
which is how well did they work and if
they<00:00:46.230> work<00:00:46.410> well<00:00:46.649> why<00:00:46.920> might<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.480> well

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
they work well why might that be well

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.400 
they work well why might that be well
the<00:00:48.690> short<00:00:48.870> answer<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:50.039> work<00:00:50.219> great

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
the short answer is they work great

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
the short answer is they work great
we've<00:00:52.410> been<00:00:52.770> using<00:00:53.190> them<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> training

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
we've been using them as a training

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.200 
we've been using them as a training
methodology<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.199> about<00:00:55.350> 10<00:00:55.620> years<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.210> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
methodology for about 10 years and the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.279 
methodology for about 10 years and the
results<00:00:58.129> have<00:00:59.129> been<00:00:59.160> outstanding<00:01:00.289> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
results have been outstanding the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
results have been outstanding the
important<00:01:01.620> thing<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.430> taking<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.030> at

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
important thing is is taking a look at

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
important thing is is taking a look at
why<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.600> might<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:04.739> are

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
why that might be and I think there are

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.020 
why that might be and I think there are
three<00:01:05.040> things<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.580> worth<00:01:05.820> talking

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
three things that are worth talking

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.420 
three things that are worth talking
about<00:01:06.409> if<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.560> thinking<00:01:07.920> about<00:01:07.979> using

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
about if you're thinking about using

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.210 
about if you're thinking about using
sales<00:01:08.840> simulations<00:01:10.010> one<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.810> realism<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.220> think

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
sales simulations one is realism I think

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.410 
sales simulations one is realism I think
there's<00:01:14.369> probably<00:01:14.549> no<00:01:14.880> other<00:01:15.090> training

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
there's probably no other training

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
there's probably no other training
methodology<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.350> does<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> better<00:01:16.710> job<00:01:16.830> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
methodology that does a better job in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.969 
methodology that does a better job in
sort<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.180> dragging<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> real<00:01:19.110> world<00:01:19.439> into<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
sort of dragging the real world into the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.399 
sort of dragging the real world into the
classroom<00:01:20.009> than<00:01:20.700> sales<00:01:20.939> simulations<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
classroom than sales simulations the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.620 
classroom than sales simulations the
people<00:01:22.710> who<00:01:22.830> go<00:01:22.979> through<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.310> program

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
people who go through the program

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
people who go through the program
literally<00:01:24.630> experience<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.220> same<00:01:26.490> kind<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
literally experience the same kind of

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.420 
literally experience the same kind of
challenges<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.990> objections<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.070> issues

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
challenges and objections and issues

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
challenges and objections and issues
they<00:01:30.060> face<00:01:30.299> every<00:01:30.720> day<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.619> field<00:01:31.890> if

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
they face every day out in the field if

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
they face every day out in the field if
you're<00:01:32.850> using<00:01:33.090> state-of-the-art<00:01:33.720> sales

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
you're using state-of-the-art sales

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.319 
you're using state-of-the-art sales
simulations<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.850> whole<00:01:36.000> idea<00:01:36.150> of

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
simulations so this whole idea of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.740 
simulations so this whole idea of
realism<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.439> one<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> factors<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.360> second

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
realism is one of the factors the second

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.230 
realism is one of the factors the second
is<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.470> programs<00:01:40.920> tend<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.700> optimize

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
is the programs tend to optimize

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.719 
is the programs tend to optimize
practice<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.960> feedback<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.740> think<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
practice and feedback I think one of the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.460 
practice and feedback I think one of the
things<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> we've<00:01:45.210> everybody<00:01:46.049> has<00:01:46.200> learned

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
things that we've everybody has learned

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.050 
things that we've everybody has learned
has<00:01:46.680> been<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.040> business<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> sales

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
has been in the business is the sales

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
has been in the business is the sales
reps<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.509> particularly<00:01:48.960> impatient<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
reps are particularly impatient and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.210 
reps are particularly impatient and
sitting<00:01:50.759> through<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:51.210> program<00:01:51.720> with<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> 90

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
sitting through some program with a 90

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.880 
sitting through some program with a 90
PowerPoint<00:01:53.880> slide<00:01:54.180> deck<00:01:54.560> where<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
PowerPoint slide deck where the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.260 
PowerPoint slide deck where the
instructor<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.399> doing<00:01:56.670> most<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> talking

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
instructor is doing most of the talking

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.780 
instructor is doing most of the talking
and<00:01:57.689> they're<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.079> listening<00:01:58.790> sale

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and they're just listening sale

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.690 
and they're just listening sale
simulations<00:02:00.479> probably<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.170> methodology<00:02:01.890> do

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
simulations probably is a methodology do

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.850 
simulations probably is a methodology do
a<00:02:02.729> better<00:02:03.000> job<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.540> optimizing<00:02:03.960> practice<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
a better job in optimizing practice and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.290 
a better job in optimizing practice and
feedback<00:02:06.500> than<00:02:07.500> any<00:02:07.740> other<00:02:07.979> kind<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.459> training

the third reason is really resolved the
first<00:02:14.520> two<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.030> people<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:15.900> them<00:02:16.110> know

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
first two is people just like them know

when<00:02:16.980> we've<00:02:17.160> done<00:02:17.190> surveys<00:02:17.850> afterwards<00:02:18.570> of

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
when we've done surveys afterwards of

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.100 
when we've done surveys afterwards of
asking<00:02:20.370> sales<00:02:20.610> rep<00:02:20.820> what<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.210> think<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.840> this

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
asking sales rep what you think of this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.230 
asking sales rep what you think of this
of<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.740> experience<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.550> answer<00:02:23.850> was<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.180> was

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
of this experience the answer was it was

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.020 
of this experience the answer was it was
great<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.140> things<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.980> didn't<00:02:26.790> where<00:02:26.910> they

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
great so things like I didn't where they

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.190 
great so things like I didn't where they
want<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> come<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.570> first<00:02:27.720> place<00:02:28.020> but

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
want to come in the first place but

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.090 
want to come in the first place but
after<00:02:28.350> being<00:02:28.620> here

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
after being here

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.670 
after being here
it<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.400> pretty<00:02:29.580> good<00:02:29.820> or<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.660> learned<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.350> lot

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
it was pretty good or I learned a lot

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.610 
it was pretty good or I learned a lot
more<00:02:31.920> than<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.160> thought<00:02:32.340> was<00:02:32.610> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.030> or<00:02:33.840> no<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
more than I thought was going to or no I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.290 
more than I thought was going to or no I
actually<00:02:34.920> enjoyed<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.910> first<00:02:36.060> piece

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
actually enjoyed this so the first piece

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.850 
actually enjoyed this so the first piece
of<00:02:36.480> sales<00:02:36.720> training<00:02:36.900> I've<00:02:37.140> enjoyed<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> long

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
of sales training I've enjoyed in a long

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.450 
of sales training I've enjoyed in a long
time

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
time

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.790 
time
those<00:02:38.940> are<00:02:39.120> great<00:02:39.240> answers<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.900> tough<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.560> get

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
those are great answers and tough to get

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.340 
those are great answers and tough to get
as<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.520> from<00:02:41.850> sales<00:02:42.330> reps<00:02:42.600> who<00:02:42.840> are

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
as we all know from sales reps who are

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.240 
as we all know from sales reps who are
indeed<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> demanding<00:02:44.130> audience<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:46.170> do<00:02:47.130> they

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
indeed a demanding audience so do they

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.230 
indeed a demanding audience so do they
work<00:02:47.460> yes

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
work yes

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.990 
work yes
why<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.810> think<00:02:49.020> three<00:02:49.440> reasons<00:02:49.830> realism<00:02:50.520> they

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
why I think three reasons realism they

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.580 
why I think three reasons realism they
optimize<00:02:51.420> practice<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.020> feedback<00:02:52.170> and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
optimize practice and feedback and

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.210 
optimize practice and feedback and
people<00:02:53.250> find<00:02:53.700> them<00:02:53.880> compelling<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:55.800> second

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
people find them compelling the second

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.680 
people find them compelling the second
thing<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.730> wanted<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.150> touch<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.570> before

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
thing I wanted to just touch on before

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.900 
thing I wanted to just touch on before
we<00:02:57.990> leave<00:02:58.200> today<00:02:58.400> was<00:02:59.400> are<00:02:59.580> they<00:02:59.730> being

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
we leave today was are they being

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.340 
we leave today was are they being
underutilized<00:03:00.210> and<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.080> answer

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
underutilized and I think the answer

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.830 
underutilized and I think the answer
that<00:03:01.500> maybe<00:03:01.710> yes<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:02.160> well<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.640> think<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.720> you

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
that maybe yes as well I think if you

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.380 
that maybe yes as well I think if you
look<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> past<00:03:04.530> most<00:03:05.490> companies<00:03:06.270> have

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
look in the past most companies have

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.070 
look in the past most companies have
used<00:03:06.810> sales<00:03:07.200> simulations<00:03:07.830> primarily<00:03:08.550> as

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
used sales simulations primarily as

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.680 
used sales simulations primarily as
advanced<00:03:10.080> training<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:10.560> senior<00:03:11.190> salespeople

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
advanced training for senior salespeople

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.910 
advanced training for senior salespeople
because<00:03:12.690> they're<00:03:12.840> expensive<00:03:13.260> they're<00:03:13.710> hard

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
because they're expensive they're hard

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.430 
because they're expensive they're hard
to<00:03:13.950> put<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.600> want<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> focus<00:03:16.080> where

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
to put on and you want to focus where

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.500 
to put on and you want to focus where
you<00:03:16.500> get<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.740> most<00:03:16.890> impact<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.640> think<00:03:18.300> if<00:03:18.420> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
you get the most impact I think if you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.640 
you get the most impact I think if you
look<00:03:18.660> at<00:03:18.780> state-of-the-art<00:03:19.290> sale

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
look at state-of-the-art sale

that's<00:03:21.510> probably<00:03:21.870> being<00:03:22.470> under<00:03:22.740> leveraged

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
that's probably being under leveraged

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.260 
that's probably being under leveraged
today<00:03:25.070> sales<00:03:26.070> simulations<00:03:26.640> can<00:03:26.760> be<00:03:26.910> done<00:03:27.090> very

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
today sales simulations can be done very

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.410 
today sales simulations can be done very
cost-effectively<00:03:28.280> they<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.460> be<00:03:29.550> done<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:30.030> one

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
cost-effectively they can be done in one

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.510 
cost-effectively they can be done in one
or<00:03:30.540> two<00:03:30.720> days<00:03:30.960> versus<00:03:31.560> three<00:03:31.770> or<00:03:31.890> four<00:03:32.100> days<00:03:32.310> so

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
or two days versus three or four days so

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.650 
or two days versus three or four days so
you<00:03:32.580> don't<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.940> time<00:03:33.150> out<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.450> field

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you don't have the time out of the field

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.770 
you don't have the time out of the field
problem<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:34.980> my<00:03:35.130> sense<00:03:35.460> is<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.760> almost<00:03:36.420> every

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
problem so my sense is that almost every

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.260 
problem so my sense is that almost every
training<00:03:37.260> situation<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.130> face<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.730> the
