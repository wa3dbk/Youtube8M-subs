stained pond but I doubt that you would

and<00:01:03.809> interestingly<00:01:04.110> scientists<00:01:05.100> aren't

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
and interestingly scientists aren't

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.940 
and interestingly scientists aren't
totally<00:01:05.640> sure<00:01:06.030> why<00:01:06.390> Lake<00:01:06.780> Hillier<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.470> rosy

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
totally sure why Lake Hillier is so rosy

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.100 
totally sure why Lake Hillier is so rosy
but<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.520> probably<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:09.810> ten

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
but it's probably because it's about ten

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.899 
but it's probably because it's about ten
times<00:01:10.140> saltier<00:01:10.590> than<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> ocean<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.670> thus

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
times saltier than the ocean and thus

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.600 
times saltier than the ocean and thus
the<00:01:12.270> lake<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.750> chock<00:01:13.170> full<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.830> salt<00:01:14.189> loving
