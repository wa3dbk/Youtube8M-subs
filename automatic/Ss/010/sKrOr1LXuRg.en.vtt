00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that was so very wonderful but I really

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.870

didn't enjoy the degree course very much

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because it was very nice to be working

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.609 
because it was very nice to be working
alongside<00:01:20.460> young<00:01:21.030> people<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
alongside young people and that was a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.550 
alongside young people and that was a
great<00:01:22.890> education<00:01:23.149> but<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> time<00:01:27.270> of

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
great education but it was a time of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.139 
great education but it was a time of
conceptual<00:01:28.560> art<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.609> Liz<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
conceptual art which is the Liz and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.149 
conceptual art which is the Liz and
anyway<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.180> continued<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.859> my<00:01:35.100> degree

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
anyway I continued and I got my degree

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.620 
anyway I continued and I got my degree
of<00:01:35.640> course<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.930> part<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.630> education

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
of course but the part of the education

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.959 
of course but the part of the education
that<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.350> enjoyed<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> foundation
