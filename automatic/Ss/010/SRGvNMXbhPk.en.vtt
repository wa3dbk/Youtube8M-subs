00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
use about like a cup and a half just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.620 
use about like a cup and a half just
first<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.860> kind<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.120> they're<00:02:42.270> fresh

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
first just kind of like if they're fresh

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.970 
first just kind of like if they're fresh
you<00:02:42.840> want<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.080> use<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.320> probably<00:02:43.650> about<00:02:43.800> a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
cup and a half and then I've used like a

an<00:02:49.490> absolutely<00:02:50.490> fantastic<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.540> do<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
an absolutely fantastic one to do I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.000 
an absolutely fantastic one to do I
think<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.810> lot<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.230> ones<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.590> you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
think like a lot of the ones that you

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.410 
think like a lot of the ones that you
could<00:02:56.130> mix<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.580> bunch<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.880> them<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:57.300> keep

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
could mix a bunch of them you can keep

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.090 
could mix a bunch of them you can keep
them<00:02:57.630> separate<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.500> could<00:02:58.650> use<00:02:58.800> them<00:02:58.980> all

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
them separate but you could use them all

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.000 
them separate but you could use them all
together<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.870> like<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.350> could<00:03:01.530> drink<00:03:01.769> this

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
