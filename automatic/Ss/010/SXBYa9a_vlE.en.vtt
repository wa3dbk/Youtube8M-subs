 because that's the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.600
 apply our base 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.670

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.100
 down 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.570

 on the eyelid 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.580
 and I'm going to take a flat brush 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.830
 We were going to take the gold color and we are going to apply it on the inside of the eye 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 concentrating the color only in this part 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:16.079
 we are going to take the color also dark of the three that we are using 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.329
 I'm going to take another flat streak 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.819
 clean and I will apply this color on the rest of the eyelid to the basin of 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:24.529
 eye 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.629
 If the color does not have the intensity they want 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.179
 they can go back 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.899
 to the color and will continue to apply until you acquire the desired intensity 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.689
 I'm going to take a feat 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.779
 pay to 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.739
 would blur would be using the dishonesty george weah blur 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.919
 all these poor so they do not look 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.369
 2 p no girls 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.369
 in the makeup 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.739
 I'm going to take the color adam tan I'm going to apply it in the middle of color 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.879
 dark and the lighter color this is going to create a 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.989
 transition 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.489
 of color 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 very does not invest echen 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.319
 to apply a little bit the other colors 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.479
 and then I'm going to blur one more time 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.979
 after this I will take the gypsy a duo will be made in baseball 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.900
 the two colors are listed the reason why they say this 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.900
 it's because I did not have the color I wanted it was 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.479
 a brown position 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.289
 and I'm going to apply this 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.609
 on the border 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.359
 from the eye socket and this is going to create a pub lucky the warm to the makeup 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.299
 I'm going to take a brush can use anything they want to 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.079

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.269
 my color to illuminate 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.929
 that will be that color of the palette of huÃ©lamo still in tandil 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.639
 and can fumigate this wine color 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.449
 what's worse, I've done this 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.039
 use the color milani is a pencil and you can apply it only in the part of 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.039

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.509
 I will also apply it on the bottom 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.460
 and inside the party 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.340
 It can lift a little crazy 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.340
 this is a clear optional step is 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.050
 I will not take a pencil bag 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:59.139
