00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.940
*Wiggle, wiggle* *Wiggle, wiggle* The moon burns. There, dreams become real. *Twingle, twingle*

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.400
Hey, hey. Hey, hey. The moon shakes. Again, I’ve just escaped

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.420
*Dizzy, dizzy* I touch the moon; it’s cold. I was there

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.740
*Flap, flap* I disappear in the moon; I melt on the surface. Something disappeared, but what?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.760
Before I realize, inside the wind, the stars wave. I hear someone talking

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.980
In front of me, as if lined up, they started walking. I am here

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.020
But, but, but they’re standing in a row. Yes, they were connected

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.120
Facing each other, but forming a line, ah, the rabbits got serious

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.360
Mountain rabbits, rabbits at left, soaring rabbit, cute rabbit, hanging their heads

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.600
Black rabbits, green rabbits, kickass rabbit, silent rabbit, excited

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.680
Horned rabbits, skinny rabbits, silent rabbit, immobile rabbit, becoming red

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.760
Floating rabbits, jumping rabbit, dancing in the sky, noble rabbit, rabbits *crackle crackle*!

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.420
*Spin, spin* *Spin, spin* The moon turns. There, I hear “He he”

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.000
Hey, hey. The moon shakes. Again, I’ve already escaped

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.800
*Waver, waver* *Waver, waver* Burning in red. There, on my way home, I’m cold

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.320
Hey, hey. Hey, hey. The moon shakes. There, in front of me, crouching

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.300
*Dizzy, dizzy*I touch the moon; it’s cold. I was there

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.820
*Flap, flap* I disappear in the moon; I melt on the surface. Something disappeared, but what?

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.720
But, but, but they’re standing in a row. Yes, they were connected

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.800
Facing each other, they step forwards, ah, the rabbits got serious

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.720
Before I realize, inside a dream, stars appear. They were so beautiful

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.120
In front of me, as if lined up, they started walking. They are everywhere

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.240
But, but, but they’re standing in a row. Yes, they were connected

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.280
Facing each other, but forming a line, ah, the rabbits are flying

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.300
CRASH!　We can do it!　To the escape! Our daily life is already over

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:34.580
SPARK!　We can do it!　To the escape! The daily life I can see

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.620
MOVE!　We can do it!　To the escape!  Our daily life is already over

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:50.760
FLASH!　We can do it!　To the escape! Our daily life fulfilled

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:59.080
White rabbits, yellow rabbits, soaring rabbit, cute rabbit, hanging their heads

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:07.200
New rabbits, jealous rabbits, kickass rabbit, silent rabbit, excited

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:15.380
Newborn rabbits, screaming rabbits, silent rabbit, immobile rabbit, becoming red

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.480
Brave rabbits, stern rabbit, dancing in the sky, noble rabbit, rabbits *crackle crackle*!
