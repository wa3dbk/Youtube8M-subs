00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
done previously we've got new characters

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.410 
done previously we've got new characters
new<00:01:35.159> different<00:01:35.369> tabs<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.850> zombies<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.240> Steph

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
new different tabs of zombies and Steph

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.149 
new different tabs of zombies and Steph
different<00:01:36.810> stuff<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> basically<00:01:37.530> they

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
different stuff like that basically they

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
different stuff like that basically they
could<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.429> doing<00:01:38.639> a<00:01:38.729> whole<00:01:38.759> new<00:01:39.689> story<00:01:39.990> line

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
could be doing a whole new story line

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.109 
could be doing a whole new story line
that<00:01:40.560> doesn't<00:01:41.069> relate<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.429> anything<00:01:41.729> we've

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
that doesn't relate to anything we've

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.969 
that doesn't relate to anything we've
done<00:01:42.149> previously<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.139> don't<00:01:43.499> think<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:43.829> would

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
done previously I don't think they would

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.800 
done previously I don't think they would
do<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.219> I<00:01:44.549> don't<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:44.969> that<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.389> black<00:01:45.600> ops

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
do that I don't think that the black ops

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.929 
do that I don't think that the black ops
2<00:01:45.960> zombies<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:47.280> know<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.609> zombies

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
2 zombies or you know the zombies

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.340 
2 zombies or you know the zombies
storyline<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.359> we've<00:01:48.600> had<00:01:48.719> before<00:01:48.869> has

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
storyline that we've had before has

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.010 
storyline that we've had before has
ended<00:01:49.859> for<00:01:50.039> me<00:01:50.459> and<00:01:50.759> my<00:01:51.179> opinion<00:01:51.569> origins

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
ended for me and my opinion origins

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.249 
ended for me and my opinion origins
wasn't<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.490> actual<00:01:53.700> ending<00:01:54.389> so<00:01:54.569> I<00:01:54.749> think<00:01:55.139> they

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
wasn't the actual ending so I think they

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.989 
wasn't the actual ending so I think they
definitely<00:01:55.439> will<00:01:55.859> be<00:01:56.039> carrying<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.700> what

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
definitely will be carrying on with what

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.429 
definitely will be carrying on with what
we've<00:01:57.119> had<00:01:57.240> previously<00:01:57.719> although<00:01:57.959> like<00:01:58.289> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
we've had previously although like I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.719 
we've had previously although like I
said<00:01:58.619> there's<00:01:58.979> still<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.249> chance<00:01:59.429> that<00:01:59.639> it

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
said there's still the chance that it

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
said there's still the chance that it
could<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.999> brand<00:02:00.420> new<00:02:00.569> storyline<00:02:01.109> another

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
could be a brand new storyline another

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.749 
could be a brand new storyline another
thing<00:02:01.560> some<00:02:01.799> people<00:02:01.829> thought<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.429> black

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
thing some people thought is that black

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.219 
thing some people thought is that black
ops<00:02:02.939> 3<00:02:03.090> zombies<00:02:03.119> could<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.749> taking<00:02:04.079> place

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
ops 3 zombies could be taking place

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.529 
ops 3 zombies could be taking place
after<00:02:04.529> the<00:02:04.829> map<00:02:05.219> moon<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.029> is<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.179> reason

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
after the map moon now there is a reason

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.090 
after the map moon now there is a reason
as<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.659> why<00:02:06.959> this<00:02:07.020> could<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.499> happening<00:02:07.619> but

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
as to why this could be happening but

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.889 
as to why this could be happening but
there<00:02:08.220> are<00:02:08.280> also<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.550> few<00:02:08.670> reasons<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.690> why

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
there are also a few reasons as to why

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.720 
there are also a few reasons as to why
this<00:02:10.050> won't<00:02:10.560> happen<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.039> first<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.459> at

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this won't happen the first one is at

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.330 
this won't happen the first one is at
the<00:02:11.819> end<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.060> moon<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.569> black<00:02:13.050> ops<00:02:13.230> 1

zombies eyes turned
blue<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.110> remember<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.920> take<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> look

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
blue if you remember if you take a look

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.410 
blue if you remember if you take a look
at<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.400> gameplay<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.030> screen<00:02:21.210> know<00:02:21.360> you

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
at the gameplay up on screen know you

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.700 
at the gameplay up on screen know you
can<00:02:21.600> see<00:02:21.690> other<00:02:21.870> zombies<00:02:22.170> eyes<00:02:22.290> are<00:02:22.500> yellow

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
can see other zombies eyes are yellow

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.830 
can see other zombies eyes are yellow
which<00:02:23.010> means<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.400> month<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.940> control<00:02:24.210> so

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
which means a month is in control so

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.390 
which means a month is in control so
basically<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.560> my<00:02:25.680> opinion<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.250> reason

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
basically in my opinion for that reason

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.250 
basically in my opinion for that reason
we<00:02:26.910> won't<00:02:27.150> be<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.780> know<00:02:27.900> straight

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
we won't be going you know straight

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.630 
we won't be going you know straight
after<00:02:28.590> moon<00:02:28.740> although<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.190> would<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.400> awesome

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
after moon although it would be awesome

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.280 
after moon although it would be awesome
I<00:02:29.940> would<00:02:30.060> love<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.540> seen<00:02:30.690> what<00:02:31.020> will<00:02:31.170> be

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
I would love to have seen what will be

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.230 
I would love to have seen what will be
happening<00:02:31.410> with<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.520> characters<00:02:32.970> are<00:02:33.060> they

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
happening with the characters are they

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.420 
happening with the characters are they
still<00:02:33.570> stuck<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.110> moon<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.770> have<00:02:34.920> no<00:02:35.100> idea

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
still stuck on the moon we have no idea

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.740 
still stuck on the moon we have no idea
because<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.760> really<00:02:36.030> haven't<00:02:36.240> heard<00:02:36.390> anything

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
because we really haven't heard anything

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.900 
because we really haven't heard anything
from<00:02:37.110> them<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.590> also<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.190> map<00:02:38.370> nuketown

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
from them and also the map nuketown

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.510 
from them and also the map nuketown
zombies<00:02:38.940> did<00:02:39.690> take<00:02:39.930> place<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.250> know<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
zombies did take place to you know the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310 
zombies did take place to you know the
exact<00:02:41.850> same<00:02:42.060> time<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.360> moon<00:02:42.690> take<00:02:42.900> place<00:02:43.140> we

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
exact same time that moon take place we

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.020 
exact same time that moon take place we
knew<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.620> because<00:02:44.070> we<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.580> hear<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.850> same

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
knew this because we can hear the same

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.940 
knew this because we can hear the same
audio<00:02:45.420> logs<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.840> are<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.050> moon<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.830> map

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
audio logs that are on moon on the map

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.860 
audio logs that are on moon on the map
nuketown<00:02:47.340> zombies<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.910> also<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.540> zombies

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
nuketown zombies and also the zombies

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.320 
nuketown zombies and also the zombies
eyes<00:02:48.990> change<00:02:49.650> blue<00:02:49.950> at<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> exact<00:02:50.760> same<00:02:51.030> time

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
eyes change blue at the exact same time

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.180 
eyes change blue at the exact same time
I<00:02:51.510> say<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:52.050> actually<00:02:52.320> change<00:02:52.590> blue<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
I say they actually change blue on the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.320 
I say they actually change blue on the
moon<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.760> black<00:02:53.970> ops<00:02:54.150> 3<00:02:54.300> zombies

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
moon so the black ops 3 zombies

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.940 
moon so the black ops 3 zombies
storyline<00:02:54.720> could<00:02:55.050> also<00:02:55.170> take<00:02:55.470> place<00:02:55.650> after

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
storyline could also take place after

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
uniform almost like so it we could be

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.770

become in charge of the zombies and we

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.680 
become in charge of the zombies and we

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
know that he does if we take a look

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.830 
know that he does if we take a look
unburied<00:04:04.550> we<00:04:05.550> actually<00:04:05.880> do<00:04:06.030> see<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.690> does

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
unburied we actually do see that it does

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.480 
unburied we actually do see that it does
take<00:04:07.230> control<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.710> zombies<00:04:07.980> eventually<00:04:08.370> so

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
take control the zombies eventually so

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.550 
take control the zombies eventually so

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
anyway I know it's confusing but it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.990 
anyway I know it's confusing but it
could<00:04:10.680> be<00:04:10.740> taking<00:04:10.980> place<00:04:11.100> after<00:04:11.370> origins

after<00:04:27.419> buried<00:04:27.990> max's<00:04:28.710> takes<00:04:28.950> control<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
after buried max's takes control of the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.370 
after buried max's takes control of the
zombies<00:04:29.880> if<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.180> remember<00:04:30.600> at<00:04:30.960> the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
zombies if you remember at the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.460 
zombies if you remember at the
and<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.370> zombies<00:04:32.520> eyes<00:04:32.820> turn<00:04:33.150> orange<00:04:33.480> now

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
and and the zombies eyes turn orange now

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.080 
and and the zombies eyes turn orange now
we<00:04:34.530> can<00:04:34.920> see<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.190> on<00:04:35.370> besides<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.820> screen

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
we can see this on besides on screen

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.240 
we can see this on besides on screen
know<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.390> gameplay<00:04:36.750> they<00:04:37.110> seem<00:04:37.380> yellow<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.890> me

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
know the gameplay they seem yellow to me

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.010 
know the gameplay they seem yellow to me
so<00:04:38.520> that's<00:04:38.790> not<00:04:39.030> really<00:04:39.390> a<00:04:39.420> massive

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
so that's not really a massive

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.270 
so that's not really a massive
possibility<00:04:40.620> although<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.040> could<00:04:41.160> be

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
possibility although it could be

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.950 
possibility although it could be
happening<00:04:41.460> after<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.060> barrier<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:42.450> a<00:04:42.600> max<00:04:42.840> is

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
happening after a barrier to a max is

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.510 
happening after a barrier to a max is
take<00:04:43.170> charge<00:04:43.470> although<00:04:44.070> there<00:04:44.280> are<00:04:44.370> two

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
take charge although there are two

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.090 
take charge although there are two
endings<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.180> buried<00:04:45.480> so<00:04:45.690> Edward<00:04:46.200> finally

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
endings to buried so Edward finally

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.800 
endings to buried so Edward finally
takes<00:04:47.340> charge<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.790> zombies<00:04:48.210> eyes<00:04:48.330> turn<00:04:48.570> blue

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
takes charge and zombies eyes turn blue

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.880 
takes charge and zombies eyes turn blue
and<00:04:48.840> again<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.170> can<00:04:49.230> see<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.500> zombies<00:04:49.650> eyes

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
and again you can see the zombies eyes

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.920 
and again you can see the zombies eyes
aren't<00:04:50.250> blue<00:04:50.340> here<00:04:50.700> so<00:04:50.880> they<00:04:51.330> are<00:04:51.480> yellow<00:04:51.780> in

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
aren't blue here so they are yellow in

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.390 
aren't blue here so they are yellow in
my<00:04:52.080> opinion<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.710> won't<00:04:52.920> be<00:04:52.980> taking<00:04:53.130> place

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
my opinion it won't be taking place

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.070 
my opinion it won't be taking place
after<00:04:53.640> buried<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.420> won't<00:04:54.570> be<00:04:54.630> taking<00:04:54.750> place

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
after buried it won't be taking place

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.840 
after buried it won't be taking place
after<00:04:55.260> moon<00:04:55.710> because<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.070> zombies<00:04:56.460> eyes<00:04:56.580> are

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
after moon because the zombies eyes are

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.440 
after moon because the zombies eyes are
not<00:04:57.210> blue<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.720> there<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.470> also<00:04:59.180> origins<00:05:00.180> in

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
not blue and there and also origins in

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.810 
not blue and there and also origins in
my<00:05:00.600> opinion<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.200> only<00:05:01.380> real<00:05:01.920> place<00:05:02.220> we<00:05:02.640> do

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
my opinion is the only real place we do

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.080 
my opinion is the only real place we do
have<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.180> go<00:05:03.330> after<00:05:03.540> origins<00:05:04.260> or<00:05:04.910> we're<00:05:05.910> just

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
have to go after origins or we're just

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.090 
have to go after origins or we're just
going<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.270> be<00:05:06.360> starting<00:05:06.750> somewhere<00:05:07.110> else<00:05:07.410> you
