00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.670
 and very good to all I'm fury we're 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.510
 in online gta and let's see how to do 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.060
 reappear this character from the theft of 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.090
 banks will soon add in some 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.619
 type of dlc or some kind of 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.990
 update we have to stick in 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.579
 online in options and see the place of 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.439
 occurrence have in our apartment 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.029
 we can also do it with the button 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.160
 select leaving it tight as we are going to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.070
 see below and put the address 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.280
 from our house now this character 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.109
 Well, as I said, it will be from the imagination 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.550
 that will be the hacker's not going to 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.829
 help to do this type of missions 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.769
 this type of bank robbery and not 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.789
 will appear in our apartment 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.969
 making this little clichÃ© this 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.589
 little trick does not always come to us 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.449
 the first one we have to do it several 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.339
 Sometimes I tell you that we do not have to see 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.800
 repeat as five or six seven times 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.749
 until this character came out and well 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.100
 as you have seen at the beginning of the video 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.870
 put the place of appearances in my 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.059
 apartment as I did not have it saved 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.890
 simply or abandon gta online or 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.530
 address button below to load a 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.510
 character of the campaign and once you're 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.630
 in the campaign start online and play 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.579
 online or for example session 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.020
 let's go to our apartment and it 's 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.659
 in the room where it will appear 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.039
 this character that I have told you a 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.570
 Once we are already within our 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.670
 apartment the only thing that we have to 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.070
 do good here I'm checking that 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.039
 I have place of appearance in here is the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.770
 address of the apartment we will give to 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.539
 start we are going to put in the store and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.479
 once we give it to accept we are going to 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.670
 give many times to the back button in 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.039
 play 3 would be the circle in xbox would be 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.840
 albert we go back back back 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.149
 back back while this is 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.770
 loading and we will reappear in 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.020
 our apartment the only thing we have 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.490
 what to do is enter this room 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.560
 as you well know the rope opposite 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.149
 is would be the door to go to the garage and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.849
 the door on the right is that of this 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.200
 room and as you see I want to put you 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.060
 the example that will make us the first and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.789
 here there is no character would come out 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.560
 sitting in the corner chair and so 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.979
 that we repeat again the same 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.840
 process we would start or we would go to the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.819
 store and while loading we give 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.980
 back backwards until when entering 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.750
 this room as you see here yes it comes out 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.850
 the character but it goes a little google 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.140
 it comes out a little there that works out very well 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.390
 put still 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.250
 and here can a girl come out 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.310
 a boy can go out different 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.780
 characters come out as floating does not have 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.160
 feet 2 in bullfighting I would have to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.870
 be sitting with arms raised 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.390
 as if it had a keyboard but not 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.980
 there is no keyboard or anything and if you go with 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.540
 You can get rid of the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.340
 chair and it's funny because this 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.560
 character would go as climbing not up 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.930
 have your head on the roof but good 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.120
 in the end I could just remove it here 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.430
 I did it again I did not go back into the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.709
 shop back back ago I went back in 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.690
 to see if another character came out and here 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.310
 another girl appeared to me then it seems to me 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.959
 a boy simply raised as 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.269
 I checked several times to verify that 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.769
 it really worked only that it does not come out to 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.140
 the first one has to be repeated several times 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.940
 times and here if you go slow as well I have 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.560
 said baseball abiec takes away the chair 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.180
 and viabilities stays floating is 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.150
 my mother and if you approach little by little 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.680
 would this idea go up little to 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.750
 little until he stayed there floating 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.790
 with his head even on the roof and everything 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.250
 it's worth nothing guys a little 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.739
 gta curiosity online to see if they put 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.630
 already the dlc update or whatever 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.610
 but we want to steal banks because 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.440
 we have been many months since it came out 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.910
 the gta 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.050
 and it's at least something that I'm 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.180
 waiting for quite some time 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.980
 because that has been everything I hope that I have 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.910
 liked see you in the next video 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.910
 And until next time
