how to do a really fast bun that I love
to<00:05:04.190> do<00:05:07.630> simply<00:05:08.630> choose<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.500> part

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:32.450 

rub<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:16.130> back<00:05:17.130> your<00:05:17.370> hand<00:05:17.639> around<00:05:17.790> it

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:47.670 

both<00:05:33.460> in<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:33.910> four<00:05:34.090> corners

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.980 

and<00:05:48.190> this<00:05:48.370> is<00:05:48.490> just<00:05:48.699> my<00:05:48.970> version<00:05:49.000> of<00:05:49.660> doing<00:05:49.900> the

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
and this is just my version of doing the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.340 
and this is just my version of doing the
bun<00:05:50.199> but<00:05:50.500> never<00:05:50.919> you<00:05:51.310> like<00:05:51.610> to<00:05:52.600> do<00:05:52.780> it<00:05:52.930> yourself

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
bun but never you like to do it yourself

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.379 
bun but never you like to do it yourself
if<00:05:53.530> you<00:05:53.680> have<00:05:53.860> a<00:05:53.889> different<00:05:54.310> technique<00:05:54.669> you

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
if you have a different technique you

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.710 
if you have a different technique you
must<00:05:55.600> definitely<00:05:55.780> can<00:05:56.320> use<00:05:56.530> that<00:05:57.419> but<00:05:58.419> I<00:05:58.449> just

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
must definitely can use that but I just

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.640 
must definitely can use that but I just
like<00:05:58.930> mine<00:05:59.199> very<00:05:59.530> messy<00:05:59.830> very<00:06:00.639> undone<00:06:01.650> that's

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
like mine very messy very undone that's

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.499 
like mine very messy very undone that's
just<00:06:02.800> my<00:06:02.979> style<00:06:03.220> if<00:06:03.669> you<00:06:03.820> like<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.120> have<00:06:04.270> more

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
just my style if you like to have more

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.529 
just my style if you like to have more
of<00:06:04.539> a<00:06:04.860> nicer<00:06:05.860> classic<00:06:06.370> but<00:06:06.880> you<00:06:07.300> definitely

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
of a nicer classic but you definitely

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.180 
of a nicer classic but you definitely
can<00:06:07.750> do<00:06:08.020> that<00:06:08.199> this<00:06:08.800> look<00:06:09.070> goes<00:06:09.310> with<00:06:09.520> me<00:06:11.190> okay

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
can do that this look goes with me okay

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.320 
can do that this look goes with me okay
so<00:06:12.250> then<00:06:12.669> you're<00:06:12.759> just<00:06:12.910> gonna<00:06:13.000> take<00:06:13.210> your

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
so then you're just gonna take your

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.969 
so then you're just gonna take your
curling<00:06:13.600> iron<00:06:13.810> shape<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:15.520> little<00:06:15.850> pieces

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
curling iron shape the little pieces

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:25.500 
curling iron shape the little pieces
however<00:06:17.979> you<00:06:18.160> want<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:22.830> one<00:06:24.180> very<00:06:25.180> easy

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
however you want and one very easy

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.409 
however you want and one very easy
things<00:06:26.470> might<00:06:27.220> look<00:06:27.340> a<00:06:27.460> little<00:06:27.490> more<00:06:27.789> choppier

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
things might look a little more choppier

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.040 
things might look a little more choppier
and<00:06:29.410> that's<00:06:29.590> because<00:06:29.949> my<00:06:30.460> layers<00:06:30.910> are<00:06:31.210> very

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
and that's because my layers are very

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.529 
and that's because my layers are very
choppy<00:06:32.410> and<00:06:32.979> I<00:06:33.370> haven't<00:06:33.789> really<00:06:34.000> had<00:06:34.180> an

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
choppy and I haven't really had an

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.750 
choppy and I haven't really had an
actual<00:06:35.050> classic<00:06:35.770> haircut<00:06:36.160> in<00:06:36.250> a<00:06:36.340> long<00:06:36.490> time

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
actual classic haircut in a long time

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760 
actual classic haircut in a long time
because<00:06:37.300> I<00:06:37.449> always<00:06:37.660> cut<00:06:37.960> my<00:06:38.080> own<00:06:38.139> so<00:06:38.530> I<00:06:38.560> just

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
because I always cut my own so I just

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.290 
because I always cut my own so I just
kind<00:06:39.039> of<00:06:39.099> like<00:06:39.280> trim<00:06:39.610> the<00:06:39.699> ends<00:06:39.940> a<00:06:40.000> little<00:06:40.120> bit

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
kind of like trim the ends a little bit

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.980 
kind of like trim the ends a little bit
but<00:06:41.169> for<00:06:41.979> the<00:06:42.130> ones<00:06:42.310> that<00:06:42.520> I<00:06:42.550> do<00:06:42.669> cut<00:06:43.180> your<00:06:43.539> your
