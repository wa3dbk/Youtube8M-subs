00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
now a lot of this may not get on my

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.479 
now a lot of this may not get on my
Frankenstein<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:47.629> they<00:00:48.629> may<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.440> may<00:00:49.980> add<00:00:50.160> more

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
Frankenstein or they may I may add more

or separate not sure which ID i want ok
i<00:01:13.290> drew<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> uni<00:01:14.820> brow<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.600> might

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
i drew it as a uni brow but I might

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.670 
i drew it as a uni brow but I might
change<00:01:15.990> my<00:01:16.140> mind<00:01:16.790> feathers<00:01:17.790> either<00:01:18.180> /<00:01:18.630> hair<00:01:18.869> or

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
change my mind feathers either / hair or

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.429 
change my mind feathers either / hair or
maybe<00:01:20.040> fake<00:01:20.369> fur<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:21.090> maybe<00:01:21.600> even<00:01:21.689> foam<00:01:22.170> bit

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
maybe fake fur or maybe even foam bit

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.730 
maybe fake fur or maybe even foam bit
fits<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.520> again<00:01:23.970> i'm<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:24.750> sure<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.439> i<00:01:25.590> have

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
fits so again i'm not sure but i have

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
fits so again i'm not sure but i have
three<00:01:25.979> options<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.729> i<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.750> i<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
three options and i can when i get to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.039 
three options and i can when i get to
this<00:01:28.380> stage<00:01:28.530> i<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.159> remember<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this stage i can remember what I

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.429 
this stage i can remember what I
brainstorm<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.979> try<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.079> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
brainstorm to try it out and I just you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.200 
brainstorm to try it out and I just you
know<00:01:34.500> knows<00:01:34.890> those<00:01:35.520> might<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.970> different

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
know knows those might be a different

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.219 
know knows those might be a different
color<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.290> stitches<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.579> i<00:01:38.880> jot<00:01:39.570> down<00:01:39.600> some

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
color and stitches so i jot down some

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.560 
color and stitches so i jot down some
ideas<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.640> draw<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.759> brainstorm<00:01:44.759> about<00:01:45.000> my

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
ideas as I draw and brainstorm about my

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.319 
ideas as I draw and brainstorm about my
different<00:01:45.960> options<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.590> each<00:01:46.920> part<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.640> then

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
different options for each part and then

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.080 
different options for each part and then
I'll<00:01:48.540> come<00:01:48.810> back<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.549> when<00:01:50.549> i<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
I'll come back and when i get to the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.350 
I'll come back and when i get to the
details<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.960> can

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
details I can

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.660 
details I can
experiment<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> materials<00:01:55.260> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
experiment with the materials and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
experiment with the materials and
remember<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> brainstormed<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:58.800> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
remember what I brainstormed in the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.410 
remember what I brainstormed in the
beginning<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.780> um<00:02:01.400> we're<00:02:02.400> aiming<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
beginning so um we're aiming for this

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.280 
beginning so um we're aiming for this
and<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.930> did<00:02:04.680> accomplish<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.930> behind<00:02:06.930> me<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and I did accomplish it behind me and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.400 
and I did accomplish it behind me and
you'll<00:02:07.770> see<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.160> my<00:02:08.310> later<00:02:08.520> videos<00:02:09.410> exactly

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
you'll see it in my later videos exactly

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.620 
you'll see it in my later videos exactly
what<00:02:10.560> he<00:02:10.649> looks<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.340> end<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.240> have

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
what he looks like in the end and I have

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.630 
what he looks like in the end and I have
to<00:02:12.810> say<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.260> pretty<00:02:13.709> much<00:02:13.830> followed<00:02:14.280> this

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
to say that I pretty much followed this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.800 
to say that I pretty much followed this
picture<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> gene<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.390> always

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
picture to a gene and so it's always

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.050 
picture to a gene and so it's always
important<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.320> have<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.560> rough<00:02:19.860> idea<00:02:20.100> what

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
important to have a rough idea what

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000 
important to have a rough idea what
direction<00:02:21.270> you're<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.260> materials<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
direction you're going the materials you

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.199 
direction you're going the materials you
may<00:02:23.190> need<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.640> gather<00:02:24.230> or<00:02:25.230> put<00:02:26.130> together<00:02:26.310> for

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
may need to gather or put together for

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.930 
may need to gather or put together for
the<00:02:27.930> details<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.160> keep<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.640> flow<00:02:29.910> going

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the details so you keep the flow going

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.150 
the details so you keep the flow going
as<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.630> make<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.989> puppet<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.620> aren't

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
as you make this puppet and aren't

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.650 
as you make this puppet and aren't
running<00:02:32.459> around<00:02:33.620> during<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.769> making<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
running around during the making and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.370 
running around during the making and
slowing<00:02:36.660> down<00:02:36.810> your<00:02:36.989> process<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.230> there<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.350> go

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
slowing down your process so there we go

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.060 
slowing down your process so there we go
on<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.459> next<00:02:41.730> video
