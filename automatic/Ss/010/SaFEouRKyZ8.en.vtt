like<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
like I have right there so I'm going to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.359 
like I have right there so I'm going to
go<00:01:05.460> pretty<00:01:05.640> huge<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.979> needs<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.189> be

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
go pretty huge here because needs to be

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.330 
go pretty huge here because needs to be
and<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.650> tap<00:01:11.130> on

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and then all you do is you just tap on

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.070 
and then all you do is you just tap on
it<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> already

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it and you see right there it already

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
it and you see right there it already
shrunk<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.640> go<00:01:14.790> overboard

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
shrunk a little bit don't go overboard

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.170 
shrunk a little bit don't go overboard
because<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.979> make<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> look<00:01:17.490> really

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
because that can make it look really

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.240 
because that can make it look really
weird<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:19.259> don't<00:01:19.350> want<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:20.040> want

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
weird we don't want to do that we want

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.840 
weird we don't want to do that we want
to<00:01:20.310> make<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.490> look<00:01:20.820> natural<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.770> still<00:01:22.850> make

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to make it look natural but still make

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
to make it look natural but still make
things<00:01:24.119> smaller<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> nose<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
things smaller as you see the nose is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.149 
things smaller as you see the nose is
now<00:01:25.860> much<00:01:26.340> smaller<00:01:26.369> than<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.030> was<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.979> just

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.399 
now much smaller than it was and just
keep<00:01:29.369> retouching<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.259> want

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
keep retouching on it and then we want

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
and with this tool it's probably not

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.060 
and with this tool it's probably not
going<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.240> work<00:01:49.450> see<00:01:49.810> here<00:01:50.049> it's<00:01:50.229> making<00:01:50.649> it

looks<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.579> little<00:01:52.240> weird<00:01:52.659> but<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.649> great<00:01:53.860> thing

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
looks a little weird but the great thing

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.319 
looks a little weird but the great thing
about<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.880> can<00:01:54.909> go<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.659> can

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
about this is you can go and you can

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.249 
about this is you can go and you can
grab<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:59.159> brush<00:02:00.159> up<00:02:00.399> on<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> top<00:02:00.939> left<00:02:01.810> and

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
grab the brush up on the top left and

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.859 
grab the brush up on the top left and
that<00:02:03.039> is<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.399> reconstruction<00:02:03.909> Allah<00:02:04.569> brush

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
that is a reconstruction Allah brush

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.160 
that is a reconstruction Allah brush
which<00:02:05.350> will<00:02:06.060> erase<00:02:07.060> basically<00:02:07.780> what<00:02:08.019> you<00:02:08.140> just

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
which will erase basically what you just

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.100 
which will erase basically what you just
did<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.550> brings<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.910> back<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.299> normal<00:02:10.690> there

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
did so it brings it back to normal there

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.920 
did so it brings it back to normal there
