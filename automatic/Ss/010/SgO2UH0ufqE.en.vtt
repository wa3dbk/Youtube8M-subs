 this 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.610
 going back to the super classic 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.950

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.090
 previous match against student who 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.220
 no one gives away anything and you play a thousand 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 so we 're going to take it from that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 way and hopefully take it forward if 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.460
 surely there are many beautiful things 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.010

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 guys that are coming are 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.390
 they are good players so let's wait 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.190
 they formed a nice group like the one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.009
 we have more people that are arriving and 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.380
 do things well as what they do 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.560
 they make decisions of them us 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.600
 we try to look at ourselves and against 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 Who we play who play no no no 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.440
 we are interested and we try to 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.080
 do our game 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.820
 and make them the same groups the 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.200
 same players we have the same 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.350
 same mentality is what you want 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.570
 marcelo that we keep trying to do that 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.410
 game that we were showing and maintaining 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.680
 most of all very nice compete that 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.240
 that cup is going to be very important for 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.560
 the personal thing for me that is the first 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.120
 time it's my turn to play it and I think 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.100
 for the group you will also die 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.830
 I am not grateful 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.860
 to the people for the love but here is 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.860
 great players who are idols 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.140
 today today he returned there is sea is the sea with 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.840
 us and good if you can tell him 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.640
 the things that got me I keep 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.010
 working and I try to do things 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.410
 good to keep getting things here 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.840
 the best that can happen to us 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.900
 players is to have players who arrive 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.230
 and what not and that we created a competition 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.780
 healthy that's not very important so that 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.700
 nobody relax and try to find the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.800
 maximum level and after you decide 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.050
 it's always marcelo so it's very good 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.519
 the arrival of new players and what 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.500
 good thing is that the group is followed 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.959
 maintaining for the competitions that 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.900
 we have forward not equal i am thinking 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.410
 that we all win that love so 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.600
 that we got the team showed that 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.970
 that he had a lot of attitude and when he could 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.950
 playing he did it in the best way and for 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.080
 there people felt identified in 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.120
 that's why today he recognizes us in the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.340
 work that we did to all yes 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.290
 surely he had said it in notes 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.830
 previous that this group goes for more 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.110
 has has a very strong character and and 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.630
 good show it trained them in everything 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.610
 side that does not relax and keeps thinking 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.040
 forwards so the idea of ​​ours and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.010
 we hope to get that yes surely 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.510
 not talking about idols as we are 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 we are talking about forming us more and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.080
 it's very important for the group not like that 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.570
 that shows it in the matches what 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.700
 demonstrated with students that he is 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.890
 It's very good and let's hope it continues well 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.660
 for good of us if what is 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.480
 saw out there the matches he played not 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.060
 I think he's a player of a one against 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.120
 a very good one where it unbalances a lot 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.220
 a lot of speed and well let's hope that it 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.680
 adapt quickly to the team and give us what 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.510
 that what gave hurricane to gray and 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.270
 surely we are going with the idea of ​​improving 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.190
 better if we play well and win not 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.410
 that 's what we all want 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.550
 out there these games you have to win it 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.200
 to continue to gain confidence and as 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.120
 Karman said the important thing is also 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.930
 do well in a good way so 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.930
 let's hope we get to that
