00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.079 

our<00:00:02.310> guys<00:00:02.580> got<00:00:03.239> the<00:00:03.590> transmission<00:00:04.590> in<00:00:04.879> as<00:00:05.879> you

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
our guys got the transmission in as you

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.510 
our guys got the transmission in as you
can<00:00:06.240> see<00:00:07.280> my<00:00:08.280> god<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:08.700> thing<00:00:08.760> weighs<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.150> ton

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
can see my god this thing weighs a ton

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.360 
can see my god this thing weighs a ton
so<00:00:12.440> so<00:00:13.440> pretty<00:00:13.650> much<00:00:13.830> when<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.130> get<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
so so pretty much when you get the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.860 
so so pretty much when you get the
transmission<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.180> there<00:00:16.130> you're<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.490> to

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:17.870 
transmission in there you're going to

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.779 
transmission in there you're going to
torque<00:00:18.870> these<00:00:19.020> moves<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.650> at<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.280> certain

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
torque these moves here at a certain

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.350 
torque these moves here at a certain
spec<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.440> not<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.800> back<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.360> these

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
spec this is not right back here these

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.390 
spec this is not right back here these
are<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.570> bigger<00:00:24.810> 8th<00:00:25.230> grades<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.160> they're

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
are the bigger 8th grades so they're

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.520 
are the bigger 8th grades so they're
going<00:00:26.520> to<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.730> around<00:00:27.199> actually<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.260> looked<00:00:28.380> up

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
going to be around actually I looked up

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.189 
going to be around actually I looked up
online<00:00:28.710> it's<00:00:29.100> 50<00:00:29.430> foot-pounds<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.750> torque<00:00:30.810> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
online it's 50 foot-pounds of torque so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.599 
online it's 50 foot-pounds of torque so
they<00:00:31.470> need<00:00:31.680> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.830> torqued<00:00:32.129> to<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:32.609 
they need to be torqued to that and

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.149 
they need to be torqued to that and
there's<00:00:32.730> gonna<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.149> there<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:34.159> on

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:35.159 
there's gonna be one there and one on

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.729 
there's gonna be one there and one on
the<00:00:35.999> other<00:00:36.030> side<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.449> it<00:00:36.749> if<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.260> can't<00:00:37.469> see<00:00:37.710> it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the other side of it if you can't see it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.969 
the other side of it if you can't see it
or<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.819> your<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.120> are<00:00:39.479> they<00:00:39.979> now

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:40.979 
or not it's your right are they now

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:45.770 
or not it's your right are they now
these<00:00:41.190> smaller<00:00:41.600> bolts<00:00:42.649> here<00:00:44.269> you<00:00:45.269> do<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.539> want

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
these smaller bolts here you do not want

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.889 
these smaller bolts here you do not want
to<00:00:45.839> torque<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.229> to<00:00:46.940> 50<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.059> want<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> torque

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
to torque that to 50 you want to torque

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.829 
to torque that to 50 you want to torque
that<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.489> 25<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> 35<00:00:50.969> foot-pounds<00:00:51.510> its<00:00:51.629> work

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
that to 25 to 35 foot-pounds its work

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.500 
that to 25 to 35 foot-pounds its work
and<00:00:52.049> that's<00:00:52.679> pretty<00:00:52.920> much<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.249> to<00:00:53.309> be

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
and that's pretty much going to be

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
and that's pretty much going to be
wrapping<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.749> perimeter<00:00:55.229> from<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
wrapping the perimeter from kind of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
wrapping the perimeter from kind of
clockwise<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.089> bottom<00:00:57.359> so<00:00:57.510> there's<00:00:57.690> about

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
clockwise to the bottom so there's about

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
clockwise to the bottom so there's about
eight<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> those<00:00:58.260> nuts

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
eight of those nuts

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.110 
eight of those nuts
get<00:01:00.299> those<00:01:00.449> torque<00:01:00.839> down<00:01:01.019> so<00:01:01.999> pretty<00:01:02.999> much

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
get those torque down so pretty much

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.620 
get those torque down so pretty much
right<00:01:03.299> now<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.719> moment<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.199> truth<00:01:05.600> what<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
right now is the moment of truth what I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.330 
right now is the moment of truth what I
am<00:01:06.899> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.469> at<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.740> moment<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:08.250> I'm

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
am going to do at this moment what I'm

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.249 
am going to do at this moment what I'm
going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> show<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.899> right

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
going to show you as you can see right

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.740 
going to show you as you can see right
here<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.890> attachment<00:01:14.789> for<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
here this is the attachment for the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.029 
here this is the attachment for the
lever<00:01:16.250> I'm<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.299> engage<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.500> throw<00:01:19.859> out

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
lever I'm going to engage the throw out

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.779 
lever I'm going to engage the throw out
bearing<00:01:20.719> to<00:01:21.719> the<00:01:21.869> actual<00:01:22.229> clutch<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
bearing to the actual clutch and this is

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.120 
bearing to the actual clutch and this is
what<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> mean<00:01:24.299> after<00:01:24.630> installation<00:01:25.109> of<00:01:25.649> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
what I mean after installation of the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.940 
what I mean after installation of the
valve<00:01:26.759> housing<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.500> need<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
valve housing this is when you need to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
valve housing this is when you need to
engage<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:30.890> bearing<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.159> fudge<00:01:32.399> so<00:01:32.759> we

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
engage the bearing to the fudge so we

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
engage the bearing to the fudge so we
uses<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.929> slower<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.609> this<00:01:35.759> lever

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
uses a slower here we have this lever

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.240 
uses a slower here we have this lever
and<00:01:36.350> that's<00:01:37.350> what's<00:01:37.619> supposed<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.070> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and that's what's supposed to go in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.480 
and that's what's supposed to go in
there<00:01:38.369> anyway<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.859> you<00:01:40.859> take<00:01:41.039> this<00:01:41.189> lever<00:01:41.399> and

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
there anyway so you take this lever and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.080 
there anyway so you take this lever and
right<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:46.070> noticeable<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.609> if<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.789> didn't

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
right and noticeable and see if I didn't

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.719 
right and noticeable and see if I didn't
really<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.890> butter<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.249> wind<00:01:50.460> there's<00:01:50.670> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
really go butter in the wind there's a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.160 
really go butter in the wind there's a
little<00:01:50.939> groove<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.539> slides<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:51.929> in

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
little groove that just slides right in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.489 
little groove that just slides right in
there<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.759> see<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.990> pretty<00:01:55.350> much

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
there so see right now it's pretty much

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.139 
there so see right now it's pretty much
loose<00:01:56.659> feel<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.929> just<00:01:58.079> moving<00:01:58.229> around<00:01:59.149> it's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
loose feel it's just moving around it's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.330 
loose feel it's just moving around it's
not<00:02:00.390> even<00:02:00.630> engaged<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.469> there<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.039> you<00:02:02.100> see

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
not even engaged in there so you see

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
not even engaged in there so you see
that<00:02:02.490> clearance<00:02:03.119> back<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.899> quite<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that clearance back there it's quite a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.099 
that clearance back there it's quite a
bit<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.679> clearance<00:02:05.310> from<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:06.539> point<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
bit of clearance from that point to that

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.980 
bit of clearance from that point to that
point<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.240> what<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.360> want<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.570> do<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.870> you<00:02:09.960> can

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
point so what you want to do is you can

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:20.600 
point so what you want to do is you can
grab<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.890> wrench<00:02:12.980> usually<00:02:13.980> I'll<00:02:14.280> grab<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:19.610> 7/8

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
grab a wrench usually I'll grab a 7/8
