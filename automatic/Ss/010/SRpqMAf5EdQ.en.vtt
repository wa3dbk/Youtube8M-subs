said<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.050> why<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
said you know what why is it out in the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.229 
said you know what why is it out in the
question<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.099> know<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.369> need<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
question you know we need to get out and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.910 
question you know we need to get out and
get<00:00:33.329> exercise<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.380> doesn't<00:00:34.620> happen

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
get exercise and it just doesn't happen

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700 
get exercise and it just doesn't happen
when<00:00:35.309> you're<00:00:35.489> working<00:00:35.820> long<00:00:36.030> hours<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
know excited to be working long hours so

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
know excited to be working long hours so
you<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.750> make<00:00:39.899> yourself<00:00:40.350> go<00:00:40.500> exercise

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
you have to make yourself go exercise

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.860 
you have to make yourself go exercise

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and this is a good way to do it with the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.779 
and this is a good way to do it with the
Hudson<00:00:43.079> River<00:00:43.260> being<00:00:43.770> such<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> congested

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
Hudson River being such a congested

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.660 
Hudson River being such a congested
waterway<00:00:45.379> safety<00:00:46.379> around<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.890> vessels<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
waterway safety around other vessels is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.029 
waterway safety around other vessels is
a<00:00:47.730> concern<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.629> got<00:00:49.020> both<00:00:49.230> moving<00:00:49.530> fast<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
a concern you got both moving fast you

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.400 
a concern you got both moving fast you
got<00:00:50.280> cruise<00:00:51.149> ships<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.140> know<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
got cruise ships you got you know the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.869 
got cruise ships you got you know the
oil<00:00:52.440> thing<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.949> mean<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.190> these<00:00:53.370> things<00:00:53.610> coming

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
oil thing I mean all these things coming

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.840 
oil thing I mean all these things coming
in<00:00:54.059> all<00:00:54.149> different<00:00:54.329> directions<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.579> we<00:00:56.579> try<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
in all different directions so we try to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
in all different directions so we try to
go<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.420> early<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> morning

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
go you know really early in the morning

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.650 
go you know really early in the morning
and<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.710> late<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.010> night<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.510> can

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and really late at night so that we can

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
and really late at night so that we can
avoid<00:01:00.840> most<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.530> obviously

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
avoid most of that because obviously

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
avoid most of that because obviously
they<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.460> motors<00:01:02.760> they're<00:01:02.940> moving<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> lot

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
they have motors they're moving a lot

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.000 
they have motors they're moving a lot
faster<00:01:03.359> they're<00:01:03.809> bigger<00:01:03.989> than<00:01:04.170> us<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.920> don't

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
faster they're bigger than us they don't

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.450 
faster they're bigger than us they don't
always<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.549> us<00:01:06.350> but<00:01:07.350> again<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> comes<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
always see us but again it comes down to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.149 
always see us but again it comes down to
being<00:01:08.700> smart<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.860> probably

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
being smart all right so there probably

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
being smart all right so there probably
aren't<00:01:11.310> too<00:01:11.460> many<00:01:11.670> folks<00:01:11.939> using<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.510> type<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
aren't too many folks using this type of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.830 
aren't too many folks using this type of
transportation<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.340> fact<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.390> probably

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
transportation in fact it's probably

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.440 
transportation in fact it's probably
just<00:01:16.020> these<00:01:16.290> two<00:01:16.500> guys<00:01:16.970> but<00:01:17.970> they're<00:01:18.119> hoping

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
just these two guys but they're hoping

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
just these two guys but they're hoping
that<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.810> will<00:01:18.930> change<00:01:19.259> word<00:01:20.220> has<00:01:20.490> started

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that that will change word has started

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
that that will change word has started
to<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.299> out<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> some
