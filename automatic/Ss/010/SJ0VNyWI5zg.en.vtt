inside<00:01:23.870> of<00:01:23.930> each<00:01:24.290> of<00:01:24.470> these<00:01:24.560> mouths<00:01:24.890> which

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
inside of each of these mouths which

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.460 
inside of each of these mouths which
layers<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:27.130> have<00:01:28.300> an<00:01:29.300> entire<00:01:29.659> group<00:01:30.170> layer

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
layers I have an entire group layer

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.370 
layers I have an entire group layer
which<00:01:31.250> if<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:31.760> were<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:31.940> debut<00:01:32.600> user<00:01:32.870> you<00:01:33.200> could

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
which if you were a debut user you could

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.100 
which if you were a debut user you could
use<00:01:33.620> a<00:01:33.650> bone<00:01:34.070> layer<00:01:34.340> instead<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.030> then<00:01:35.840> inside

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
use a bone layer instead and then inside

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.910 
use a bone layer instead and then inside
of<00:01:36.320> each<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.830> group<00:01:37.040> layer<00:01:37.280> there's<00:01:37.670> a

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
of each of the group layer there's a

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.160 
of each of the group layer there's a
rest<00:01:39.920> vector<00:01:40.490> are<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.780> vector<00:01:41.780> layer<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:42.049> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
rest vector are a vector layer of the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.350 
rest vector are a vector layer of the
actual<00:01:42.500> mouth<00:01:42.740> itself<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.610> then<00:01:43.850> one<00:01:44.090> for<00:01:44.330> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
actual mouth itself and then one for the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.230 
actual mouth itself and then one for the
teeth<00:01:44.690> one<00:01:45.110> for<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.620> tongue<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.460> one<00:01:46.909> for<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
teeth one for the tongue and one for the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.359 
teeth one for the tongue and one for the
inside<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:47.990> mouth<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.920> reason<00:01:49.220> for

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
inside of the mouth and the reason for

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.039 
inside of the mouth and the reason for
doing<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.760> that<00:01:49.940> way<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.180> if<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.690> wanted<00:01:50.990> to

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
doing it that way is if I wanted to

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.840 
doing it that way is if I wanted to
create<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.710> different<00:01:52.280> character<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:54.850> can

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
create a different character I can

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.200 
create a different character I can
create<00:01:56.299> one<00:01:56.500> for<00:01:57.500> example<00:01:57.590> like<00:01:58.190> with<00:01:58.640> just<00:01:58.970> a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
create one for example like with just a

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.640 
create one for example like with just a
some<00:02:00.140> buck<00:02:00.350> teeth<00:02:00.619> or<00:02:00.909> no<00:02:01.909> top<00:02:02.240> row<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.260> teeth

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
some buck teeth or no top row of teeth

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.370 
some buck teeth or no top row of teeth
which<00:02:04.159> gives<00:02:04.460> them<00:02:04.640> kind<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.210> dumb<00:02:05.869> look<00:02:06.140> to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
which gives them kind of a dumb look to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.460 
which gives them kind of a dumb look to
them<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.299> just<00:02:08.539> helps<00:02:08.899> me<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.080> create<00:02:09.439> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
them so it just helps me to create a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.350 
them so it just helps me to create a
bunch<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.039> different<00:02:10.429> characters<00:02:10.580> real<00:02:11.060> fast

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
bunch of different characters real fast

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.630 
bunch of different characters real fast
you<00:02:12.230> can<00:02:12.409> use<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.769> one<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:12.950> comes<00:02:13.400> with<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
you can use the one that comes with the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.150 
you can use the one that comes with the
program<00:02:14.770> but<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:16.099> like<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.790> do<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.150> way

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
program but I like to do it this way

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.580 
program but I like to do it this way
here's<00:02:19.090> an<00:02:19.240> example<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.690> what<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.900> mean<00:02:20.200> here's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
here's an example of what I mean here's

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.260 
here's an example of what I mean here's
a<00:02:20.920> character<00:02:21.460> that's<00:02:21.700> supposed<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.240> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
a character that's supposed to have a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.930 
a character that's supposed to have a
