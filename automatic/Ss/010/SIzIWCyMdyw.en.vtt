kind of flattened this down a little bit

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.890 
kind of flattened this down a little bit
because<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.550> wig<00:05:08.760> does<00:05:09.000> look<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.390> little<00:05:09.630> bit

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
because the wig does look a little bit

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.230
