00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
than Rex Grossman we've seen that he is

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.750 
than Rex Grossman we've seen that he is
very<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:33.750> quick<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.890> Grossman<00:00:35.309> brings<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
very very quick but Grossman brings in a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.100 
very very quick but Grossman brings in a
lot<00:00:35.880> more<00:00:35.940> experience<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> seems<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.079> very

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
very confident absolutely that was a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.420 
very confident absolutely that was a
dramatic<00:00:39.210> pause<00:00:39.420> though<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.739> think<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.250> saw

dramatic pause though I think we saw
that<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.790> terms<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.149> how<00:00:42.270> Grossman<00:00:42.750> can

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that in terms of how Grossman can

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.119 
that in terms of how Grossman can
