00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.010
 twenty extraordinary minutes that they have made 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.570
 my task is extremely simple 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.420
 that of alternating the players on 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.250
 field and probably never had 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.039
 showed twenty minutes of this 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.660
 intensity energy and quality 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.609
 alternating players on the parquet 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 keeping unchanged if possible 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.019
 even increasing the quality of the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.080
 our game as i went by 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.410
 minutes putting in awe 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.960
 our adversaries and playing said 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.379
 perhaps the best twenty minutes of this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 our season and then what is with dell 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.190
 and this work when things start 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.600
 to get complicated and everything seems 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.530
 incredibly difficult where you have to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 have the strength to hold on to things 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.940
 the simplest ones they can 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.640
 really serve the team that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.859
 then the analysis obviously goes 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.190
 inside second time but in 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.990
 particular an ending 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.120
 the tension and frustration perhaps of 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.040
 relive the experts of a final of 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.010
 game that could have taken us away 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.890
 what we deserve has done as it has 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.480
 we helped you committed even mo 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.120
 more errors than it was permissible 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.490
 expect especially those that I 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.800
 I want to hope to be easily 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.690
 correctable as errors from 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.240
 lunette or errors in the management of 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.430
 possess when our adversaries 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.830
 forced to commit fouls themselves 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.750
 visas delivered in the hand of balloons 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.060
 they paradoxically offered 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.970
 even the possibility of two seconds 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.690
 at the end of having the shot 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.360
 of the hypothetical draw 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.550
 as I said I think for the path 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.050
 what we are doing with the first twenty 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.210
 minutes are a bit and the prize of 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.190
 those or even the poster of those 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.950
 which may be the potential of 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.680
 this team but the second half if 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.600
 we have the ambition to compete up 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.440
 in the end at these levels and it is not 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.690
 due to recriminations 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.720
 that there were already in the epilogue 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.190
 of strange games like that of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.930
 istanbul these errors well 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.750
 we have a duty not to commit them 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.290
 because I believe that we do not deserve then 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.620
 finish this phase of the lived euroleague 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.020
 with an excitement level of 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 enthusiasm for participation inside 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.800
 of the team outside I talk about 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.930
 public in an extraordinary way 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.480
 but we must not think at all 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.270
 to end up with the recrimination of 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.470
 have been guilty of errors and that 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.980
 are correctable or that anyway from 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.550
 a team like ours and I think it is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.489
 just pretend that he isn't there 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.380
 few, however, do not repeat and nothing 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.900
 so now it is right that the boys 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.940
 have space for them to have the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.590
 chance to celebrate a great one 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.739
 victory because he said we have them 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.020
 kept under for 40 minutes we talk about 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.670
 one of the best teams in Europe and 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.220
 perhaps the only one he had shown 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.290
 together with real madrid this year of 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.720
 have one more step compared to us 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.690
 and instead these first twenty minutes 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.640
 above all and the final victory 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.980
 show that this group is there 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.970
 we begin to take ours 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.100
 position 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.440
 we begin to be comfortable but 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.530
 as we said we want to play all of them 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.050
 chance until the end that I am not 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.019
 closely linked to the qualification 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.769
 but also to the ability to raise the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.730
 our game 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.340
 what has been so is certain 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.730
 first twenty minutes and unfortunately 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.730
 intermittent in the following ones
