00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Vitalis in the Bundesliga and there are the wolves Freiburg so is the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.609
 Team of the hour seven victories have been played from the last ten matches 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.730
 Friday a surprising victory in the Ahrensburger the BvR mourning Starz and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.450
 yesterday went against a direct competitor in the fight for the 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.450
 Playoffs against the Lusatian foxes 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.400
 wolf coach use the result in comparison with the Lusatian foxes 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.289
 he only plays a victory against the direct competitor 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.820
 but the success of the past games really valuable 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.899
 Round his cracks have understood 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.899
 and the industrial nations 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.260
 his shot over there can not hold on to the industry's lectured 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.780
 Dust no problems 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.560
 all rooms and night 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 in the French 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 because at the second, exactly after eleven minutes Korpus Kiel turned again 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.870
 in action this time in reverse order of the industry on the El 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.629
 Domo board 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.629
 and the ex white water Niesslein against the old colleagues 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.020
 beautiful interaction of the two parade striker Dorsten also needed Peter 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.020
 salmik 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.270
 in the exuberance of the feelings of her the wolves then but a little 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.260
 Overpopulating too many players on the ice small bank penalty for Freiburg 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.520
 The guests, who have been up to now, love the gift with thanks 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.960
 Shot Choir Flame Christoph Mathis leaves the disc like the expert 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.579
 Cabbage on 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.530
 and Christopher Straube pushes the puck into the empty goal no question that thing goes 

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:30.770
 to the account of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.040
 yet this eventful first does not come to an end it follows that 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.470
 piece of cake 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 vernascht 1 2 3 Lausitzer flossen 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 a sensational hit to 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.030
 Margret the council 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 through the middle against astonished foxes two-goal lead 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.520
 In the first third 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 Brenner doubted that the wolves were here tonight 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.490
 we're in the middle third that's just 22 seconds Joker gets there 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.330
 the good mood already a fighter 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.919
 Marvin Tepper meets the Wolves sleepy start for White Water 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.849
 benefit from their own sleepiness but school branch minutes later 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.709
 Peter Mare sword in the back of the defense and sees the disc 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:32.199
 When looking at the coach he does not seem to be right tonight 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.399
 to trust and to have justice also for the Saxons is this game one 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.899
 six-point game and the foxes tracks are invulnerable to the wolves 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:43.279
 Light Danny Ocean 4 30 she bleeds again the line-up 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.469
 What's wrong with the Freiburg defender are all Becht from Krupp 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.410
 for the players 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.829
 Christoph Mathis left alone 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.829
 Goal-scoring made easy is the clock in things use 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.829
 but the game continues to follow the proven industry 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.060
 two-goal-scoring connecting goal two-goal connecting goal and 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.069
 responsible this time the Alster 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.579
 be five to three years 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.039
 30 minutes fall 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.409
 necessarily under the category 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.709
 but what the wolves are after the middle third again 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.709
 everything points to a continuation of the winning streak 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.439
 the wolves stay 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.919
 we remember 2 20 seconds are needed in the second third for one 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:30.720
 guests results 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.120
 the final point behind Vettel after 26 seconds 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.409
 The scorer is called Kenny rotten again 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.559
 and again he sat down against three 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:39.739
 Freiburg by 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.099
 For the fourth time the foxes succeed in closing matches 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.389
 This time, they are using the proven 604 minute Preston Mizzi knitting pattern 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.019
 Tasks Maaseik 15 5 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.249
 who give up in Lausitz have the game actually doing well 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.759
 It pays to look at the emergence of the gate quite unhappy for the 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.459
 Wolves Rudi Borgo lands the puck they suspect on the gloves 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.090
 Finger break at the defender 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.090
 and to top it all, a Rudi racket from Freiburg behind 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.679
 For the guests 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:14.579
 Peter Salmik now pulls the emergency brake with a break around his boys yet 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.780
 time to the importance 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.049
 This is a six-point game to change its hit in the regular 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.720
 Playing time was no longer enough foxes Gloriole McDonald he holds 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.809
 clean his chest 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:28.539
 and so the game from Freiburg's point of view is completely unnecessary 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.449
 renewal 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.680
 in the overtime which is operated Xolair are so compelling the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.599
 Actions of the Cracks in red but not more 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.470
 Some blocked the committee 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.830
 instead the same chance for the foxes 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.659
 Christopher Straube relieved 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.539
 Nokia prefer 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.169
 the next foxes kickoff, however, ends happier for returnees 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.939
 Carsten Gosdeck with a beating blow Kilian has decided 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.830
 for the Freiburg are convinced of it 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.830
 that this shot does not have electricity 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.470
 24 pictures per second 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.470
 too little to follow the trajectory of the pub more closely 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.029
 Fact is the wolves lose 6 to 5 after extra time 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.270
 this defeat 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.270
 attributable 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:17.229
 only the post belongs from behind and because opinion can say Norbert 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.300
 the referee decides that had to go 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.900
 Bobo booked and I no longer served them at all praising them 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.210
 which can still give out of hand 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.410
 China had been unfocused for three minutes, but too much and that 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.410
 was actually totally unnecessary doors to the start 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.409
 it does not have to be so slow 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.830
 we just have to concentrate from game to game and still have processes 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.719
 ten games 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.849
 because she also thinks that giving everything else is easy 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.359
 only pluses for us a Melinda would seem to judge us 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.660
 three wins in a row, this point loss is a small damper Â» 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.900
 Next weekend it will be against Bremerhaven this will look like again against 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.150
 direct competitors 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
 in the fight for a playoff place 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.520
 write winterish make
