00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
when I got out of it that's probably the

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.700 
when I got out of it that's probably the
best<00:01:23.039> thing<00:01:23.249> to<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.549> doing<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:27.710> always

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
best thing to be doing I always

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.929 
best thing to be doing I always
struggled<00:01:29.399> with<00:01:30.109> dyslexia<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> dyslexic

struggled with dyslexia and dyslexic

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.849 
struggled with dyslexia and dyslexic
which<00:01:33.719> is<00:01:33.869> why<00:01:33.990> I'm<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.319> holding<00:01:34.649> cards

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
which is why I'm not holding cards

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:40.700 
which is why I'm not holding cards
already<00:01:35.249> I<00:01:35.969> think<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.840> says<00:01:37.109> I<00:01:39.530> left<00:01:40.530> school

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710

when<00:01:40.859> I<00:01:41.219> was<00:01:41.520> 13<00:01:42.030> years<00:01:42.149> old<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:43.289> of<00:01:43.439> this

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
when I was 13 years old because of this

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.489 
when I was 13 years old because of this
really<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.700> easier<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.179> me<00:01:45.359> to<00:01:45.749> get

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
really so it was easier for me to get

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.330 
really so it was easier for me to get
kicked<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.950> class<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:47.670> two<00:01:48.829> no<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:49.859> knew

taught me a little bit about their
secret<00:06:02.390> ingredient<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:04.390> maybe<00:06:05.390> how<00:06:05.600> I<00:06:05.630> can

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
secret ingredient and maybe how I can
