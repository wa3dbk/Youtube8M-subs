something I predicted in an earlier
video<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.950> saw<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.640> kind

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
video I just kind of like saw the kind

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
video I just kind of like saw the kind
of<00:00:41.940> trend<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.450> were<00:00:42.540> taking<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.079> some

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of trend that they were taking with some

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.900 
of trend that they were taking with some
really<00:00:43.559> random<00:00:43.770> camos<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:44.879> of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
really random camos and I kind of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
really random camos and I kind of
expected<00:00:45.420> something<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.960> unicorn<00:00:46.469> it's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
probably expect on a camera and actually

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.750

look colourful as well and as always the
reticles<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.860> these<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> most

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
reticles on these are not the most

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490 
reticles on these are not the most
helpful<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.479> never<00:01:09.720> tend<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
helpful they never tend to be and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
helpful they never tend to be and
they're<00:01:10.890> definitely<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.820> actual

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
they're definitely not good for actual

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
they're definitely not good for actual
like<00:01:12.510> gunfights<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.200> stuff<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.650> mean<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:13.950> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
like gunfights and stuff I mean this is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.560 
like gunfights and stuff I mean this is
okay<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.760> probably<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> best<00:01:15.420> out

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
okay it's probably one of the best out

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.999 
okay it's probably one of the best out
of<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> packs<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.530> dot<00:01:16.830> with

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
of the packs it's got a little dot with

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.770 
of the packs it's got a little dot with
like<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.310> crescent<00:01:17.610> underneath<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.689> so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
like a little crescent underneath it so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.210 
like a little crescent underneath it so
it's<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.020> too<00:01:19.229> bad<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.650> hasn't<00:01:19.860> got<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> massive

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it's not too bad it hasn't got a massive

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
it's not too bad it hasn't got a massive
object<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:20.970> still<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.049> dot

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
object you can still kind of see the dot

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
object you can still kind of see the dot
but<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.680> all<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.549> generally<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
but in all in all it's generally not the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
but in all in all it's generally not the
best<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> use<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.380> also<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.799> the

black ops 2 but I don't think ghost has
the<00:02:44.610> capabilities<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.390> do<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.810> play<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.260> last

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the capabilities to do it play with last

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.560 
the capabilities to do it play with last
generation<00:02:47.250> consoles<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.209> hope<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
generation consoles but I hope the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.940 
generation consoles but I hope the
advanced<00:02:48.840> warfare<00:02:49.320> will<00:02:49.500> be<00:02:49.650> able<00:02:49.830> to
