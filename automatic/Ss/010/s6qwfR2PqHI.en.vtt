do<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.990> we'll<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.860> i<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.219> right

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
do that we'll see if i can do it right

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.940 
do that we'll see if i can do it right
that's<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.390> okay<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:02.130> will<00:02:02.460> unclick<00:02:03.000> place

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
that's so okay so we will unclick place

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.789 
that's so okay so we will unclick place
or<00:02:04.950> we'll<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.189> click<00:02:05.549> portrait<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.619> this

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
or we'll just click portrait and this

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.339 
or we'll just click portrait and this
will<00:02:07.950> bring<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.550> portrait<00:02:09.479> everything<00:02:10.200> so

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
will bring up the portrait everything so

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.720 
will bring up the portrait everything so
basically<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.280> circle<00:02:11.610> here

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
basically you see I have a circle here

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.850 
basically you see I have a circle here
so<00:02:12.360> right<00:02:12.660> here<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.470> would<00:02:13.650> do

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so right here what I would do

so right here what I would do
do<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.100> click<00:02:14.850> where<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> want<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.570> centered

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
do is click where I want it centered

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.440 
do is click where I want it centered
around<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.070> i'll<00:02:17.160> click<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.640> between<00:02:17.760> Colm

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
around so i'll click it in between Colm

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.670 
around so i'll click it in between Colm
and<00:02:18.860> Lou<00:02:19.860> because<00:02:20.580> I'm<00:02:20.700> going<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.060> them<00:02:21.360> in

and Lou because I'm going to get them in

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.070 
and Lou because I'm going to get them in
there<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.520> focused<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.510> them<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.020> can

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
there to be focused on them and I can

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.880 
there to be focused on them and I can
actually<00:02:25.580> use<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.610> pinch<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.450> zoom<00:02:27.480> or<00:02:28.470> even

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
actually use that pinch to zoom or even

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.100 
actually use that pinch to zoom or even
just<00:02:29.210> basically<00:02:30.210> pinch<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.750> zoom<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.080> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
just basically pinch to zoom in a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.060 
just basically pinch to zoom in a
circular<00:02:31.380> motion<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.240> want<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.540> really

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
circular motion so if I want to really

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.370 
circular motion so if I want to really
just<00:02:35.070> get<00:02:35.310> them<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:36.410> do<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.300> even

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
just get them in there do that and even

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.410 
just get them in there do that and even
if<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.560> really<00:02:41.220> wanted<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.700> up<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.970> aperture

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
if I really wanted to up the aperture

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.300 
if I really wanted to up the aperture
it's<00:02:42.990> where<00:02:43.140> everybody<00:02:43.650> else<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:44.010> grayed<00:02:44.280> out

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310

their<00:03:06.720> photos<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.230> now<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.410> have<00:03:07.530> nature<00:03:08.100> so

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
their photos so now we have nature so

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.520 
their photos so now we have nature so
let's<00:03:09.300> do<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.200> again<00:03:10.290> here<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:12.350> here's<00:03:13.350> I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
let's do it again here and here's I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.320 
let's do it again here and here's I
think<00:03:13.890> where<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.600> do<00:03:15.600> some<00:03:15.630> twisting<00:03:17.330> okay

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
think where we can do some twisting okay

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.090 
think where we can do some twisting okay
a<00:03:19.370> little<00:03:20.370> bit<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:20.640> trouble<00:03:21.000> if<00:03:21.090> there<00:03:21.390> we<00:03:21.600> go

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
a little bit of trouble if there we go

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.250 
a little bit of trouble if there we go
so<00:03:23.100> if<00:03:23.280> i<00:03:23.400> wanted<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.820> keep<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.480> line<00:03:24.720> there

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
so if i wanted to keep the line there

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.539 
so if i wanted to keep the line there
and<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.540> i<00:03:30.600> could<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.230> blow<00:03:31.890> out<00:03:32.070> everybody

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
and so i could really blow out everybody

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.750 
and so i could really blow out everybody
now<00:03:33.450> here<00:03:33.810> i<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:34.200> pinch<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.799> zoom<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.310> bring

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
now here i can pinch the zoom to bring

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.979 
now here i can pinch the zoom to bring
it<00:03:35.850> in<00:03:35.970> closer<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.660> pretty

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
it in closer it's pretty

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.530 
it in closer it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:37.489> here<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.269> play

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
around with it and the reset tool is

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.699 
around with it and the reset tool is
going<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.600> be<00:03:42.720> your<00:03:42.900> best<00:03:43.080> friend<00:03:43.790> there<00:03:45.140> ok<00:03:46.140> so

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
here we have nature focus to reset that

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.680 
here we have nature focus to reset that
everything<00:03:51.959> will<00:03:52.140> reset<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.680> where<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> was

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
everything will reset to where I was

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.910 
everything will reset to where I was
architecture<00:03:54.799> same<00:03:55.799> thing<00:03:57.200> bring<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.410> here

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.350 

that<00:04:01.920> creates<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.340> little<00:04:02.580> bit<00:04:02.700> more<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.120> blur

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
that creates a little bit more of a blur

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.200 
that creates a little bit more of a blur
I<00:04:03.799> will<00:04:04.799> do<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:06.000> reset<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.110> that<00:04:10.190> oops

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210
