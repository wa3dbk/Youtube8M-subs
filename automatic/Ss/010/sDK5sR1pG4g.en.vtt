00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
channel we actually got told by a link

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.380 
channel we actually got told by a link
that<00:02:42.100> there<00:02:42.310> were<00:02:42.370> going<00:02:42.490> to<00:02:42.550> be<00:02:42.610> aliens<00:02:43.120> of

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
kind of an enormous thing but they

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.980 
kind of an enormous thing but they
basically<00:02:54.459> told<00:02:54.970> us<00:02:55.240> that<00:02:55.540> they<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.959> know

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
basically told us that they you know

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.680 
basically told us that they you know
they<00:02:56.320> saw<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.220> running<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.820> there<00:02:58.450> were<00:02:58.510> aliens

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
they saw it running in there were aliens

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.500 
they saw it running in there were aliens
but<00:02:59.410> they<00:02:59.920> didn't<00:03:00.190> know<00:03:00.310> super<00:03:00.700> melt<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:01.150> melt

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
but they didn't know super melt and melt

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.570 
but they didn't know super melt and melt
cells<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.260> what<00:03:02.590> they<00:03:02.709> basically<00:03:03.100> Ford<00:03:03.430> it

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
cells and what they basically Ford it

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.670 
cells and what they basically Ford it
was<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> part<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.239> campaign<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:04.989> really

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
was a part of the campaign and it really

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.310 
was a part of the campaign and it really
wasn't<00:03:06.130> but<00:03:06.430> these<00:03:06.970> things<00:03:07.030> happen<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.840> just

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320

through each area and i was like some

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.670 
through each area and i was like some
parts<00:04:12.820> we<00:04:12.970> must<00:04:13.299> have<00:04:13.450> rerecorded<00:04:14.230> like<00:04:14.440> a

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
parts we must have rerecorded like a

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.240 
parts we must have rerecorded like a
dozen<00:04:15.160> times<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.730> crap<00:04:16.630> you<00:04:16.840> not<00:04:17.140> because<00:04:17.560> it's

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
really hard to get it's really hard to

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.920 
really hard to get it's really hard to
repeat<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.440> same<00:04:23.650> thing<00:04:23.979> on<00:04:24.300> rampages<00:04:25.300> let's

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
repeat the same thing on rampages let's

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.020 
repeat the same thing on rampages let's
put<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.200> way<00:04:26.320> so<00:04:26.700> when<00:04:27.700> we<00:04:27.789> got<00:04:27.910> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
put it that way so when we got the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.580 
put it that way so when we got the
grenades<00:04:28.330> abilities<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.050> then<00:04:29.229> we<00:04:29.410> had<00:04:29.560> to

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
grenades abilities and then we had to

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.010 
grenades abilities and then we had to
restart<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.220> game<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.430> couple<00:04:30.760> of<00:04:31.030> times<00:04:31.300> and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
restart the game a couple of times and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.490 
restart the game a couple of times and
I<00:04:32.819> don't<00:04:33.819> think<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.180> can<00:04:34.360> ever<00:04:34.509> tell<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.229> how
