00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
contrasting characters and that's

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.490 
contrasting characters and that's
basically<00:02:18.819> what's<00:02:19.480> going<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.019> transit

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
basically what's going on in transit

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.960 
basically what's going on in transit
we've<00:02:20.980> got<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.250> two<00:02:21.400> different<00:02:21.730> set<00:02:21.879> of

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
we've got the two different set of

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.040 
we've got the two different set of
instructions<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.599> two<00:02:22.780> different

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
instructions the two different

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.460 
instructions the two different
achievements<00:02:23.200> tower<00:02:23.950> Babel<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:25.470> I'm

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
achievements tower Babel and I'm

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.840 
achievements tower Babel and I'm
imagining<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.190> storyline<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:27.790> to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
imagining the storyline is going to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.570 
imagining the storyline is going to
carry<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.440> based<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.710> campaign

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
carry on based on the campaign

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.610 
carry on based on the campaign
but<00:02:31.580> we<00:02:31.670> saw<00:02:31.939> there<00:02:32.420> were<00:02:32.599> many<00:02:32.810> different<00:02:33.260> not

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
but we saw there were many different not

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.350 
but we saw there were many different not
the<00:02:33.830> zombie<00:02:34.069> campaign<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.579> campaign<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
the zombie campaign the campaign the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.210 
the zombie campaign the campaign the
actual<00:02:35.629> black<00:02:35.810> ops<00:02:36.019> 2<00:02:36.200> there<00:02:36.980> were<00:02:37.069> many

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
actual black ops 2 there were many

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.339 
actual black ops 2 there were many
different<00:02:37.640> paths<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.780> could<00:02:38.900> take<00:02:39.140> through

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
different paths you could take through

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.509 
different paths you could take through
the<00:02:39.439> game<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:39.920> think<00:02:40.129> they<00:02:40.189> might<00:02:40.340> be<00:02:40.400> doing

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
the game and I think they might be doing

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.970 
the game and I think they might be doing
a<00:02:40.640> similar<00:02:40.879> thing<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.450> transit<00:02:42.049> if<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.650> helped

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
a similar thing in transit if you helped

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.770 
a similar thing in transit if you helped
ripped<00:02:43.220> off<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.549> on<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:43.790> map<00:02:44.060> for<00:02:44.299> example

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
ripped off and on this map for example

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.420 
ripped off and on this map for example
something<00:02:45.709> different<00:02:46.010> will<00:02:46.099> happen<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
something different will happen in the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.940 
something different will happen in the
next<00:02:46.610> map<00:02:46.909> then<00:02:47.720> again<00:02:47.810> if<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.110> complete<00:02:48.500> both

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
next map then again if you complete both

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.770 
next map then again if you complete both
Easter<00:02:49.549> eggs<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.879> imagine<00:02:50.269> something

be<00:03:23.090> killed<00:03:23.239> by<00:03:23.389> both<00:03:23.569> so<00:03:24.409> that<00:03:24.560> could<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:24.859> him

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
be killed by both so that could like him

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.039 
be killed by both so that could like him
to<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:25.250> next<00:03:25.489> map<00:03:25.670> if<00:03:25.909> you<00:03:26.120> don't<00:03:26.359> do<00:03:26.870> this

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
to the next map if you don't do this

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.330 
to the next map if you don't do this
Easter<00:03:27.409> Egg<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.590> can't<00:03:27.859> do<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.069> next<00:03:28.220> one

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
Easter Egg you can't do the next one

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.649

to help you and all kind of stuff like
that<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.070> reminds<00:04:16.340> me<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.519> Dempsey<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.440> I'm

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
that so it reminds me of Dempsey so I'm

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.599 
that so it reminds me of Dempsey so I'm
gonna<00:04:18.620> say<00:04:18.829> that<00:04:19.010> I'm<00:04:19.070> going<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.250> say<00:04:19.430> that<00:04:19.579> I

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
gonna say that I'm going to say that I

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.099 
gonna say that I'm going to say that I
think<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:19.970> character<00:04:20.449> could<00:04:20.599> potentially

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
think that character could potentially

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.909 
think that character could potentially
be<00:04:21.229> Dempsey<00:04:22.330> but<00:04:23.349> yeah<00:04:24.349> I<00:04:24.380> think<00:04:24.470> that's<00:04:24.770> one

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
be Dempsey but yeah I think that's one

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.290 
be Dempsey but yeah I think that's one
more<00:04:25.099> character<00:04:25.760> as<00:04:25.849> well<00:04:26.000> who<00:04:26.120> doesn't

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
more character as well who doesn't

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.080 
more character as well who doesn't
talking<00:04:26.780> but<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.139> the<00:04:28.010> whole<00:04:28.159> as<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.610> said<00:04:28.849> we're

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
talking but on the whole as I said we're

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.200 
talking but on the whole as I said we're
a<00:04:29.120> bit<00:04:29.300> behind<00:04:29.780> on<00:04:30.139> transit<00:04:31.090> storyline<00:04:32.090> at<00:04:32.150> the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
a bit behind on transit storyline at the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.689 
a bit behind on transit storyline at the
moment<00:04:32.510> but<00:04:33.320> it<00:04:33.530> goes<00:04:33.770> on<00:04:33.979> as<00:04:34.220> far<00:04:34.460> as<00:04:34.520> i<00:04:34.580> know

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
moment but it goes on as far as i know

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.399 
moment but it goes on as far as i know
the<00:04:34.820> nav<00:04:35.000> Cubs<00:04:35.300> don't<00:04:35.419> know<00:04:35.479> what<00:04:35.570> they<00:04:35.659> do<00:04:35.720> but

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
the nav Cubs don't know what they do but

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.459 
the nav Cubs don't know what they do but
and<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.800> bus<00:04:36.949> drivers<00:04:37.280> quite<00:04:37.490> weird<00:04:37.729> he<00:04:38.240> um<00:04:38.469> he

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469 
and the bus drivers quite weird he um he

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:40.870 
and the bus drivers quite weird he um he
sort<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:39.800> leads<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.130> around<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.400> map<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.729> the
