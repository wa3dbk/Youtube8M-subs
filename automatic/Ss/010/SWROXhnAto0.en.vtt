00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello hdblog.it we are in new york at 20 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.940
 acer next stations and this is the new one 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.440
 aspire r11 boom of slips c version 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.940
 smaller more compact than the model 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.389
 released last year the feature 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.700
 main 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.470
 as you can see it is the hinge that can be 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.869
 because it rotates 360 degrees and therefore 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
 lets you do things like this 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.039
 used in mode mode 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.289
 tablet and grasshopper mode you can 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.090
 really let us do what that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.369
 you want this model is offered in more 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 colors this is the version is the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.960
 blue version but here with me I also have a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.520
 a white model that will be put on 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.680
 trade a little more advanced a 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.239
 friend and a little bit more is nicer and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 instead I want to use when to 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.410
 make videos because I think it's a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.300
 little more successful a matte finish 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.829
 rough anti fingerprints so it is not 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.899
 very light, let's say it's a notebook 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.000
 in other words, even the thickness is traditional 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.309
 what is so much that you notice the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.300
 presence of the internet portal that 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.070
 rare enough to try this 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.210
 moment for the rest we have three these 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.120
 bike I also love the 3.0 and so sori 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.320
 interpetri celeron pentium the usual ones 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.119
 those we have also seen in the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.500
 past generation is a model 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.299
 economic however clearly look 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.119
 this white person really looks more 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.670
 and more it convinces me to a good phono mine 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 acer talks about 7 8 hours a screen 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.409
 traditional 1036 if you hear the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.319
 pixel support with 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.689
 not touchscreen as an anti matte screen 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.710
 footprints this is one of the 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.810
 main features of this 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.369
 model that therefore remains enough 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.170
 valid in short for use in 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.079
 mobility of that thing that has me 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.880
 hit most of all, however, is the la 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.159
 keyboard because the keyboard very much 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.969
 stable that is the laptop is not 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.709
 thin is not another can 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.719
 bring an ultrabook this is 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.979
 really really convenient and even the taxi 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.539
 especially how big and bigger it is 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.490
 of the space bar and it is 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.130
 a combination that in my opinion, in short 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.030
 promises promises 20 will be a while to 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.079
 elaborate on 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.539
 what is the thing I liked least 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.099
 instead the is not a false one 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.530
 internal mindset there is also a hard disk 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.729
 here nothing traditional ssd of course 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.849
 be in hand I feel right there 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.219
 vibration of the disk wheel 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.319
 magnetic that is inside and therefore it is not 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.110
 just this point to the appearance that it 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.789
 it belongs to a category that can 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.920
 passed let's say shaman the band 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.870
 mainstream industry sector 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.239
 laptop prices will depend then 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.160
 from configuration to availability 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.810
 as this also announced in 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.420
 italy should should be around 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.310
 in short, 300 euros in that band 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.730
 price is for a convertible with 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.900
 in short, this flexibility is 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.519
 absolutely a pressure something from 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.989
 keep an eye on 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.660
 look how clever this thing 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.440
 to put rubbers here under the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.000
 zippers that allow to avoid that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.680
 when you then go to the place it 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.959
 selling models sung lainate for 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.100
 place it this green avoid 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.410
 tap with 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.060
 the piano the keyboard that ruins the per 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.310
 more information including the price 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.240
 of sales and configurations intended 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.830
 to italy
