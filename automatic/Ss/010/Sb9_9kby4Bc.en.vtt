I racked it one more time left little

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
I racked it one more time left little
more<00:00:20.760> sediment<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.240> bottom<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.720> put

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
ready to put it in bottles trying to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.589 
ready to put it in bottles trying to
leave<00:00:25.650> all<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.920> sediment<00:00:26.130> behind<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:27.390> we're

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
leave all that sediment behind now we're

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.810 
leave all that sediment behind now we're
ready<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> go<00:00:28.050> while<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> was<00:00:28.980> racking<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.519> did

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
ready to go while I was racking I did

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.089 
ready to go while I was racking I did
taste<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> wine<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:30.750> more<00:00:30.900> time<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
taste the wine one more time and it

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
taste the wine one more time and it
tastes<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.700> wine<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.450> little

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
tastes like wine it's a little

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.389 
tastes like wine it's a little
disjointed<00:00:33.960> acids<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.190> high<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
disjointed acids a little high the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
disjointed acids a little high the
tannins<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> little<00:00:36.120> strong<00:00:36.420> part<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
tannins are a little strong part of that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840 
tannins are a little strong part of that
is<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.620> because<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.980> needs<00:00:38.160> time<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> settle

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
is just because it needs time to settle

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.360 
is just because it needs time to settle
so<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:39.360> hoping<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.739> bottle<00:00:41.040> has

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
so I'm hoping that as the bottle has

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430 
so I'm hoping that as the bottle has
time<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> mature<00:00:41.940> it'll<00:00:42.450> come<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.780> come<00:00:43.200> along

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
time to mature it'll come on come along

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
time to mature it'll come on come along
instructor<00:00:43.950> metal<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.180> why<00:00:45.420> why

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
instructor metal up that is why why

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.029 
instructor metal up that is why why
isn't<00:00:46.020> released<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.530> Lance<00:00:46.739> bottle

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
isn't released right Lance bottle

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
isn't released right Lance bottle
because<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> does<00:00:47.610> mellow<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.180> sits<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
because it does mellow as it sits so

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
because it does mellow as it sits so
that<00:00:49.110> should<00:00:49.320> mellow<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.620> nicely<00:00:49.890> should

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that should mellow out nicely should

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
that should mellow out nicely should
really<00:00:50.820> bring<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> flavors<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.449> make<00:00:51.690> some

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
really bring the flavors out make some

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.479 
really bring the flavors out make some
nice<00:00:52.020> wine<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.410> we'll<00:00:52.860> only<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> couple

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
nice wine but we'll only know a couple

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.790 
nice wine but we'll only know a couple
months<00:00:53.670> when<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.910> try<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.270> again<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.809> got

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
months when I try this out again so got

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
months when I try this out again so got
this<00:00:55.949> all<00:00:56.100> set<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> ready<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.760> go<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.239> only

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
this all set up and ready to go the only

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.970 
this all set up and ready to go the only
new<00:00:57.660> piece<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> equipment<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.649> I've

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
new piece of equipment here I've

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
new piece of equipment here I've
attached<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.850> bottle<00:01:00.359> filling<00:01:00.629> system<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
attached this bottle filling system to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
attached this bottle filling system to
the<00:01:01.379> end<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> Mike<00:01:01.800> siphon<00:01:02.160> tube<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the end of Mike siphon tube it's just a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
the end of Mike siphon tube it's just a
little<00:01:03.329> plastic<00:01:03.539> tube<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.110> got<00:01:04.350> nozzle<00:01:04.830> on

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
little plastic tube that's got nozzle on

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
little plastic tube that's got nozzle on
the<00:01:04.979> bottom<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.390> start<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.720> stop<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the bottom so it can start and stop the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
the bottom so it can start and stop the
flow<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.650> when<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.830> put<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> touches

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
flow so when you put that in and touches

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.399 
flow so when you put that in and touches
the<00:01:09.060> bottom<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> bottle<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.930> starts<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the bottom of the bottle it starts to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200 
the bottom of the bottle it starts to
flow<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> pull<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:11.790> off<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
flow I'm going to pull it up off the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
flow I'm going to pull it up off the
bottom<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.689> I'll<00:01:12.840> stop<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.680> go

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
bottom and I'll stop that way I can go

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.109 
bottom and I'll stop that way I can go
from<00:01:13.979> bottle<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> bottle<00:01:14.490> without<00:01:14.729> creating

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
from bottle the bottle without creating

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
from bottle the bottle without creating
a<00:01:15.180> giant<00:01:15.509> mess<00:01:15.659> 11th<00:01:16.049> floor<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.740> having

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
a giant mess 11th floor I'm not having

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.410 
a giant mess 11th floor I'm not having
to<00:01:17.100> restart<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> sizing<00:01:17.820> system<00:01:17.939> every<00:01:18.240> time

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to restart the sizing system every time

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
to restart the sizing system every time
that's<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.259> theory<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.549> if

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that's the theory now we have to see if

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.749 
that's the theory now we have to see if
it<00:01:20.729> works<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.070> we<00:01:23.070> go<00:01:23.189> ahead<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.400> put<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> in

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
it works so we go ahead and put it in

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.510 
it works so we go ahead and put it in
the<00:01:23.850> bottom<00:01:24.229> get<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.380> bottle<00:01:25.740> set<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
ready to go and start my sights on

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.640 
ready to go and start my sights on
system<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.390> let's<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.659> stable<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
system so let's get this stable and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:40.690 
system so let's get this stable and
we'll<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.159> works

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.209 

alright<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.539> bottle<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:41.960> filling<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:43.189> a

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
alright the bottle is filling it's a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.789 
alright the bottle is filling it's a
good<00:01:43.340> first<00:01:43.610> step<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:45.140> can<00:01:45.259> see<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.500> level<00:01:45.619> of

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
good first step you can see the level of

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.230 
good first step you can see the level of
line<00:01:46.070> count<00:01:46.369> up<00:01:46.490> here<00:01:46.670> we're<00:01:46.909> going<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.090> want

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
line count up here we're going to want

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.880 
line count up here we're going to want
to<00:01:47.329> get<00:01:47.509> filled<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.320> there's<00:01:48.500> only<00:01:48.590> about<00:01:48.710> an

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
to get filled so there's only about an

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.620 
to get filled so there's only about an
inch<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.310> air<00:01:49.520> between<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.969> top<00:01:50.329> of<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.509> wine

trick<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.700> just<00:03:04.940> turn<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.209> bottle<00:03:05.329> upside

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
trick is to just turn the bottle upside

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.059 
trick is to just turn the bottle upside
down<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.109> shove<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.410> down<00:03:06.680> really<00:03:06.980> hard

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
down and shove it down really hard

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.949 
down and shove it down really hard
against<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.579> ground<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:08.090> helps<00:03:08.510> push<00:03:08.810> the

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
against the ground it helps push the

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.300 
against the ground it helps push the
cork<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.319> little<00:03:09.590> bit<00:03:09.680> further<00:03:09.859> into<00:03:10.160> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
cork a little bit further into the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.740 
cork a little bit further into the
bottle<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.760> end<00:03:11.120> up<00:03:11.209> with<00:03:11.359> him<00:03:11.480> looking

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
bottle and you end up with him looking

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.430 
bottle and you end up with him looking
much<00:03:11.989> nicer<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:14.480> final<00:03:14.780> step<00:03:14.870> before<00:03:14.989> we<00:03:15.319> can

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
much nicer the final step before we can
