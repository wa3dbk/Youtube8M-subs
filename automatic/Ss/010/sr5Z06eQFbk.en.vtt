00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
fail even though all of us fail

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.979 
fail even though all of us fail
sometimes<00:00:40.399> but<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.550> long<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.780> our

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989

sometimes but as long as we have our
victorious<00:00:43.950> moments<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.300> ok<00:00:45.690> just

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
doesn't work properly remember when I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
doesn't work properly remember when I
did<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.970> next<00:01:42.420> attempt<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.560> map<00:01:43.829> when<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
did my next attempt on this map when I

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.850 
did my next attempt on this map when I
was<00:01:44.610> learning<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.450> died<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.290> same<00:01:46.560> way

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.940 
was learning it I died the same way
twice<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:49.079> button<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> gondola

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
twice because the button on the gondola

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.370 
twice because the button on the gondola
is<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.790> delayed<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.780> need<00:01:51.990> at<00:01:52.290> least

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
is so delayed like you need at least

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.850 
is so delayed like you need at least
five<00:01:53.009> seconds<00:01:53.579> ahead<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.659> zombies<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.590> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
five seconds ahead of the zombies if you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.810 
five seconds ahead of the zombies if you
want<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.189> use<00:01:56.310> gondola<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.689> get<00:01:57.960> killed
