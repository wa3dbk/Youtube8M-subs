been<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.369> drummers<00:01:48.110> say<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.259> get<00:01:49.409> really

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
been there as drummers say we get really

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.039 
been there as drummers say we get really
nervous<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.430> our<00:01:50.790> hands<00:01:51.030> start<00:01:51.299> sweating<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
nervous and our hands start sweating and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.880 
nervous and our hands start sweating and
then<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.470> start<00:01:52.740> getting<00:01:53.520> worried<00:01:54.000> about

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
then we start getting worried about

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.020 
then we start getting worried about
dropping<00:01:55.890> our<00:01:56.009> sticks<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.640> their<00:01:56.880> hands

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
dropping our sticks because their hands

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
dropping our sticks because their hands
are<00:01:57.240> slick<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.229> even<00:01:58.439> more

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
are slick and then we get even more

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.709 
are slick and then we get even more
nervous<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.549> start<00:01:59.820> sweating<00:02:00.479> more

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
nervous and then we start sweating more

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.709 
nervous and then we start sweating more
and<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.860> vicious<00:02:02.280> cycle<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.479> these

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and it's a vicious cycle well on these

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.260 
and it's a vicious cycle well on these
the<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.500> sweat<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.700> better<00:02:05.939> grip

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the more you sweat the better grip

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.440 
the more you sweat the better grip

heavier up front I know the taper starts
way<00:03:13.880> back<00:03:14.090> there<00:03:14.360> maybe<00:03:14.600> they<00:03:14.780> had<00:03:14.870> some<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.230> do

pad now let's go see how they feel on

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.580 
pad now let's go see how they feel on
the<00:03:56.730> drumset<00:03:56.970> all<00:03:57.960> right<00:03:58.170> let's<00:03:58.350> see<00:03:58.470> what

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
the drumset all right let's see what

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:25.520 
the drumset all right let's see what
these<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.920> do<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:23.930> don't<00:04:24.930> know<00:04:24.960> what<00:04:25.290> it<00:04:25.410> is

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
these can do I don't know what it is

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.560 
these can do I don't know what it is
about<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:26.730> front<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.150> don't<00:04:27.270> know<00:04:27.360> if<00:04:27.420> they're

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
about the front I don't know if they're

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.150 
about the front I don't know if they're
heavier<00:04:27.930> I'm<00:04:28.170> just<00:04:28.350> imagining<00:04:28.560> things<00:04:28.980> but

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
heavier I'm just imagining things but

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
and I know I keep saying that but it's

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560 
and I know I keep saying that but it's
like<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.290> seems<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.800> go<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.100> four-stroke<00:04:35.790> as

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
like it seems you go to a four-stroke as

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.930 
like it seems you go to a four-stroke as
soon<00:04:36.900> as<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.710> goes<00:04:37.830> just<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.340> little<00:04:38.610> bit<00:04:38.760> that

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
soon as it goes just a little bit that

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.760 
soon as it goes just a little bit that
way<00:04:39.150> you've<00:04:39.390> got<00:04:39.419> gravity<00:04:40.110> as<00:04:40.260> your<00:04:40.440> friend

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
way you've got gravity as your friend

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.640 
way you've got gravity as your friend
and<00:04:40.919> these<00:04:41.010> top-heavy<00:04:41.460> sticks<00:04:41.940> it<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.140> snaps

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
and these top-heavy sticks it just snaps

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.050 
and these top-heavy sticks it just snaps
the<00:04:43.890> drums<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.520> sounds<00:04:44.790> like<00:04:44.910> you're

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
the drums and it sounds like you're

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.090 
the drums and it sounds like you're
playing<00:04:45.300> with<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> baseball<00:04:46.410> bats<00:04:46.680> but

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
playing with the baseball bats but

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.010 
playing with the baseball bats but
really<00:04:47.880> these<00:04:48.030> are<00:04:48.090> not<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.570> heaviest

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
really these are not that heaviest

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.260 
really these are not that heaviest
sticks<00:04:49.380> but<00:04:50.040> just<00:04:50.520> because<00:04:50.790> they<00:04:50.970> put<00:04:51.120> the

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
sticks but just because they put the

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.860 
sticks but just because they put the
weight<00:04:51.510> up<00:04:51.810> front<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:53.070> just<00:04:53.780> comes<00:04:54.780> down

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
weight up front it just comes down

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.960 
weight up front it just comes down
naturally<00:04:55.320> it's<00:04:55.830> so<00:04:55.950> easy<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.430> get<00:04:56.520> volume

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
naturally it's so easy to get volume

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:12.900 
naturally it's so easy to get volume
that<00:04:57.360> is<00:04:57.570> very<00:04:57.810> cool<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.140> like<00:04:58.410> that

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.580 

these<00:05:13.910> are<00:05:14.150> awesome<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.780> another<00:05:15.169> thing<00:05:15.380> is

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
these are awesome and another thing is

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.189 
these are awesome and another thing is
just<00:05:16.370> as<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.610> also<00:05:17.000> suspected<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.900> more<00:05:18.080> I'm

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
playing my hands are starting to get a

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.960 
playing my hands are starting to get a
little<00:05:20.240> bit<00:05:20.389> clammy<00:05:20.720> TMI<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.979> know<00:05:22.100> but<00:05:22.699> yeah

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 
yes let's play how that grinder actually

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.670 
yes let's play how that grinder actually
does<00:06:47.090> and<00:06:47.450> then<00:06:47.540> see<00:06:47.750> if<00:06:47.840> these<00:06:47.960> actually<00:06:48.470> like
