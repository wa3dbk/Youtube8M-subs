00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 a salute to all the boys today vi 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.400
 we'll show the repair on an hp 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.849
 pavilion g6 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:17.789
 as you can see from here and do not know if ok 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.699
 readable which presents the defect as 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.150
 cooling fan lock 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.480
 the moment it is turned on 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.969
 it comes out as an error message 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:37.640
 system fan 90 b after a few seconds the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.640
 computer gets locked up and turns off 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 we will proceed to disassembly 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.219
 of the same we will verify precisely 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.550
 together with you what that which is the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.550
 problems 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 ok guys here we are again at 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.969
 computer almost as disassembled as you can 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 see something that immediately went missing 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.039
 to the eye during the disassembly phase 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.619
 and that presents a lot of dust to his 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.840
 I don't think you can do it from here 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.540
 maybe to notice but here above all 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.000
 see on the Venturino as well as normal 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.530
 that is 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.240
 the problem however remains the fact that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.990
 once a car is turned on 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.119
 desktop 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.119
 there is on the monitor from that error 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.820
 note how the fan remains 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.640
 completely still on the monitor 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.030
 you can continue to read the same 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.780
 mistake just then there is a 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.280
 message that invites us precisely to 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.550
 to continue 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.140
 pressing enter but at our risk e 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.200
 danger 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.550
 nothing now we will proceed to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.970
 complete disassembly of the board in 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.300
 so see what not to work 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.300
 the fan 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.250
 here we are again guys we have 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:11.020
 just finished just checking out what 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.080
 prevents the fan from turning later 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.300
 have the board completely disassembled 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.890
 we found that what not 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 precisely to allow fortune to 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.340
 getting started was nothing but 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:31.690
 this beautiful dust cap I do n't know if from 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:35.070
 here to be able to see how precisely said 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.090
 at the beginning of the video simply 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.560
 partly disassembled the laptop yes 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.350
 he understood that it is used in places 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.239
 nothing particularly dusty that 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.000
 that we have done just now is 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.250
 state to remove the dust cap 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.100
 completely clean the fan e 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.820
 we all say the underlying basis of the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.239
 portable 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.280
 now we will re-assemble it e 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.950
 we will verify with you precisely the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.760
 correct operation already anyway 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:14.750
 you can see how operating it here 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.700
 the fan is working properly 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.610
 we no longer have on the screen 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.090
 that mistake this moment a year 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.720
 detects the hard disk because it is not 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.770
 connected 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.360
 there is nothing but the problem 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:36.000
 the initial problem has not been solved 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.500
 it is more obviously verifying how 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 see the fan continues to work 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.010
 quietly see you later like this 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.890
 we will then verify the operation of the 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.130
 all once completed reassembled 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.630
 point the pc 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.450
 ok guys it's the final part 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.190
 of the video we reassembled 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:03.020
 completely the car as you can 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.020
 see now we're going to test them together 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:12.270
 as you can see it no longer gives any 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:16.109
 error loads windows perfectly and the 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:19.019
 everything was solved within a short time 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.380
 time simply by cleaning one 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.380
 fan 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.000
 thanks for watching the next video
