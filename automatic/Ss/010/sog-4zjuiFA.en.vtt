00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.730
 we have to work with 50 and this 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.850
 once with the second chapter of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.320
 decorations 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.900
 this time I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.120
 cook but like them grab those 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.130
 materials they see on screen 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.410
 and so it is good you decide each 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.810
 who again like in the dining room what 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.100
 things they want to use and that but there are 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.170
 more or less they are giving the idea 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.450
 the first thing they do that structure I hope 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.790
 have seen it but if not then it 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.530
 come back and see her in those things simulate 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.390
 well the little boxes that you should 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.770
 have in your kitchens imagine because 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.600
 I put so many ovens because then I 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.550
 I guess it is not what we use most 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.100
 because we melted several materials and that 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.980
 there I will teach them how to be good is a 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.230
 cool type yes yes dispenses things and serves 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.000
 if they put the little button if it goes well, 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.710
 It's just something that you put him 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.320
 what they want if they want to lever 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.330
 that stays open if they want from a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.770
 button so that you no longer bite him and there 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.960
 where I tell him that the button I put him 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.490
 they search because I like it more than just there is a 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.800
 problem when they put something up 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.970
 but good but that's already going to happen 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.160
 count in a little while 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.970
 kraft easy table I put but little 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.190
 Hence they had wood but 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.600
 you good if you like it with glass 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.280
 Well they leave you with glass but I like it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.830
 so give a good chingÃ³n stove effect 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.020
 now they will see you 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.010
 they like it as well as what 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.890
 they can do is that I decorate I love 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.040
 decorate prey 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.860
 you just have to put us obviously 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.840
 is you cover it and put something 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.430
 so that it does not look there they see the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.900
 way ball without stuck to the side that does not 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.450
 give your home more of a tree something that 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.340
 tape why positive and from outside 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.680
 that's the only one but that has to do it 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.300
 that way but they had to face what 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.920
 chin 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.810
 I'm pulling those moms that I'm going to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.870
 occupy and we already see that the front look 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.430
 fregÃ³n now there's the kraft table are 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.900
 doing more we occupy one if you 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.300
 they want to put more because they put more but 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.340
 normally no more and they use one that's why I 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.990
 I just put it there if I do not forget I think 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.510
 put your hand there are the lawyers 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.510
 and now it 's there 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.480
 but I remember I was doing a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.730
 the cupboards cupboards you the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.099
 they can do as they want there there is only 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.349
 but if they want to put chests they have 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.120
 that leaving a block up can be 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.800
 put they have to put stairs but 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 below right now they are not going to see you there 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.260
 they put those grids so that it moves 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.330
 so the door is there is where that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.430
 is the problem they put grid each time 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.620
 who want the lava button to be refri 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.690
 he's going to shit it because he's going to 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.040
 get off but well it's a matter of 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.530
 you see how you like it already there 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.170
 it's also how you want 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.780
 put it like that or whatever I want, I think 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.100
 I put it on the five of a chest in 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.330
 half of my body what yes 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.330
 if the medium 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.290
 and those not only give the appearance 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.140
 of half and that can still put a 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.930
 table as the tutorial of the dining room I think 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.879
 they do know how what I tell them that 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.890
 if they want those chests to open they 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.780
 they have to put that way the problem is that 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.640
 their houses to maintain a second floor 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.709
 the floor of the second floor is going to see my 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.480
 mother adored because it is going to see well what 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.010
 would have to do is to cover it like 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.560
 that with a banquet right now they will see 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.780
 there and then I cover it with a stool and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.700
 Well, to fix the problem 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.319
 There is no quarrel but then you 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.400
 they have to see that because they suppose that 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.440
 attend your home today 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.200
 Imagine seeing a gap there in the middle of 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.930
 I do not say anything that occurs to me, but 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.709
 as you see sometimes and I will see 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.299
 so they can cover that make a vaquita 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.829
 as they want to a flowerpot like 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.439
 Would you like that they put in the dining room 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.659
 well so the other above the 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.939
 reflotting this to put 12 colors or 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.680
 just leave them with nothing they can put 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.260
 stone slabs and is thus the 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.970
 stove service in ovens 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.000
 and then also know father but for the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.370
 things that you like as well 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.650
 they put a good table if it is that 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.599
 they want like the kind of bs like 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.879
 Eduard well in the middle so you do not lose 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.310
 the look like this does not look so alone 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.880
 the kitchen is put on a table like this 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.600
 father is going to see him scrubbing I think 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.000
 It is a table, you already know that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.120
 table always but then you guys 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.620
 decorate as you want 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.620
 they have to be like me 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.180
 and I was going to tell you 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.889
 episodes of 4 x 10 zeros we have not 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.770
 been unable to climb so often 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.810
 because here two photos the grunt xxi the 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.090
 funny are they fighting and then 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.880
 achieving that in recording together because it 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.980
 angry girls 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.830
 but no problem because one of these 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.940
 days we upload videos more than 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.540
 for if the truth right now we have not 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.980
 recorded none of that and about about if 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.510
 let's do more series and I'll have 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.080
 color collaboration with subscribers 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.790
 clear more manna its your messages that 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.090
 they want me to record their world and that already 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.090
 between all 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.860
 is equal to they can be accommodating them 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.070
 I say that you can put stone slabs 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.070
 chests things to your liking as you 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.080
 want and the other thing that they could do 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.830
 that is me as I have it in the white house 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.240
 that big one this is that good the floor 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.990
 because it is different, that is, they are like a 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.540
 double floor 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.070
 the roof is of stone and arribita of the 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.780
 ua stone wood so there is no problem 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.720
 with the chests because it is much more 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.370
 I put stone and already, but if you 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.260
 they make the houses so the roof is 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.510
 wood and the wooden floor because I 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.180
 I imagine they put us a capita but 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.950
 Well, there in that house , no, I did not 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.510
 so for this one they will realize equal and 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.820
 They know I'm going there 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.770
 I did it and the boss arrangement because 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.330
 Well, I feel like that, it looks better 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.810
 and I think it would be very good 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.910
 Princess 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.160
 to see how is how is it that 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.720
 I tell you 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.700
 then it is a matter of taste as 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.130
 you are going to want to do it 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.320
 then I say it 's like you 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.760
 want they already saw the other one is that you 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:23.520
 so put a pressure dish how are they going to 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:25.620
 go but the bad thing is that there was nothing 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.650
 stupid but but if I put things 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.000
 but it's fine and you saw I forgot 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.710
 they also want to put like this booklets 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.690
 so it looks like recipes and those 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.880
 things and so decorate or look father 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.010
 they put them in some things is that 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.020
 look and also the pictures and see 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.600
 that's what I mean if you look 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.210
 up to me I have the one so it's double 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.800
 so double layer the soil and because the 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.050
 roof is stone and wooden floor 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.910
 but if you do not have your house like that 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.550
 they just do the whole national scene 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.310
 put copper yes already 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.960
 then as I told them to put her that mother 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.810
 of the ladder and they already cover it with 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.300
 something from above and I'm going to fire 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.500
 if you liked it, comment like
