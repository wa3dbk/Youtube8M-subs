now this they come with some other
cables<00:02:47.590> now<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.430> main<00:02:48.730> cable<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.750> main

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
cables now the main cable that the main

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.250 
cables now the main cable that the main
plug<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.770> has<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.190> timer<00:02:51.850> plug<00:02:52.260> which

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
plug that it has is the timer plug which

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.990 
plug that it has is the timer plug which
is<00:02:53.440> mostly<00:02:53.740> used<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.100> airsoft<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:57.550> also<00:02:57.700> comes

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
is mostly used for airsoft it also comes

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.090 
is mostly used for airsoft it also comes
with<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.210> small<00:02:59.050> timer<00:02:59.290> plug<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.890> you<00:02:59.920> can

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
with a small timer plug so you can

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.500 
with a small timer plug so you can
charge<00:03:00.310> batteries<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.850> have<00:03:00.910> small<00:03:01.270> timer

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
charge batteries that have small timer

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.680 
charge batteries that have small timer
plugs<00:03:02.220> mine<00:03:03.220> came<00:03:03.490> with<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.760> American<00:03:04.480> style

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
plugs mine came with the American style

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.150 
plugs mine came with the American style
plugs<00:03:06.600> along<00:03:07.600> with<00:03:07.840> these<00:03:08.020> kind<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.980> guess

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
plugs along with these kind of I guess

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.590 
plugs along with these kind of I guess
jumper<00:03:09.700> cable<00:03:10.360> looking<00:03:10.630> things<00:03:11.700> open<00:03:12.700> up<00:03:12.820> snap

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
jumper cable looking things open up snap

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.700

onto battery or something time a plug on
the<00:03:17.860> end<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:19.020> basically<00:03:20.020> what<00:03:20.230> this<00:03:20.350> does<00:03:20.410> it

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
the end so basically what this does it

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.970 
the end so basically what this does it
just<00:03:20.980> plugs<00:03:21.220> into<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.470> there<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.560> go

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.290 

now<00:03:26.980> let<00:03:27.190> me<00:03:27.280> go<00:03:27.370> ahead<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:27.640> plug<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:27.820> in<00:03:28.120> and

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
now let me go ahead and plug this in and

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.370 
now let me go ahead and plug this in and
show<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.750> what<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:28.959> looks<00:03:29.080> like<00:03:29.200> when

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
show you what it looks like when

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:40.620 
show you what it looks like when
charging

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.210 

and<00:03:43.260> when<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.350> don't<00:03:44.530> have<00:03:44.620> anything<00:03:44.890> plugged

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
and when you don't have anything plugged

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.780 
and when you don't have anything plugged
in<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:46.660> LED<00:03:47.200> light<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.710> it<00:03:47.860> has<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.340> going<00:03:48.700> to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
in the LED light that it has is going to

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.930 
in the LED light that it has is going to
be<00:03:48.910> blinking<00:03:49.210> green<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:50.400> then<00:03:51.400> once<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.760> have

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
be blinking green and then once you have

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.720 
be blinking green and then once you have
something<00:03:52.210> plugged<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.900> will<00:03:53.080> be<00:03:53.490> red<00:03:54.490> if

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
something plugged in it will be red if

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.350 
something plugged in it will be red if
the<00:03:55.210> battery<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.600> not<00:03:55.780> charged<00:03:56.500> all<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:56.740> way

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
the battery is not charged all the way

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.540 
the battery is not charged all the way
so<00:03:58.360> let<00:03:58.600> me<00:03:58.660> go<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:58.870> show<00:03:58.960> you<00:04:01.800> got<00:04:02.800> my<00:04:02.920> 9.6

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
so let me go and show you got my 9.6

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.720 
so let me go and show you got my 9.6
battery<00:04:03.850> pack<00:04:04.060> plug<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:05.460> the<00:04:06.460> LED

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
battery pack plug it in and the LED

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.250 
battery pack plug it in and the LED
light<00:04:07.360> turns<00:04:08.080> red<00:04:09.810> now<00:04:10.810> there's<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.080> couple

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
light turns red now there's a couple

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260 
light turns red now there's a couple
other<00:04:11.590> things<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.700> LED<00:04:12.850> light<00:04:13.030> tells

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
other things that the LED light tells

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.100 
other things that the LED light tells
you<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:15.250> when<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.640> done<00:04:15.850> when<00:04:16.300> it's<00:04:16.450> done<00:04:16.570> it

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
you so when the done when it's done it

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.979 
you so when the done when it's done it
will<00:04:17.260> be<00:04:17.350> green<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:18.510> then<00:04:19.510> if<00:04:19.690> there's<00:04:19.930> a

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
will be green and then if there's a

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.020 
will be green and then if there's a
defect<00:04:20.290> with<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.770> charger<00:04:21.220> or<00:04:21.460> there's<00:04:21.790> a

defect with the charger or there's a

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.310 
defect with the charger or there's a
problem<00:04:22.420> with<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.630> charger<00:04:23.020> there's<00:04:23.260> a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
problem with the charger there's a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.740 
problem with the charger there's a
problem<00:04:23.590> with<00:04:23.680> your<00:04:23.800> battery<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:25.240> LED<00:04:25.570> light

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
problem with your battery this LED light

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.450 
problem with your battery this LED light
will<00:04:25.960> actually<00:04:26.110> be<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.970> blinking<00:04:27.970> red<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:29.460> one

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
will actually be a blinking red and one

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.390 
will actually be a blinking red and one
more<00:04:30.610> thing<00:04:30.820> on<00:04:30.940> this

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
more thing on this

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.580 
more thing on this
when<00:04:33.400> you're<00:04:33.520> charging<00:04:34.110> first<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.290> all<00:04:35.410> don't

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
when you're charging first of all don't

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.400 
when you're charging first of all don't
charge<00:04:35.860> on<00:04:36.070> carpet<00:04:36.520> which<00:04:37.330> isn't<00:04:37.810> which<00:04:38.260> is

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
charge on carpet which isn't which is

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.160 
charge on carpet which isn't which is
what<00:04:38.560> I'm<00:04:38.680> doing<00:04:38.860> don't<00:04:39.250> do<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.870> now<00:04:40.870> put<00:04:41.050> on

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
what I'm doing don't do that now put on

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.820 
what I'm doing don't do that now put on
the<00:04:41.290> metal<00:04:41.740> or<00:04:42.570> maybe<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.900> strong<00:04:44.500> wood

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
the metal or maybe a strong wood

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.230 
the metal or maybe a strong wood
something<00:04:45.460> that's<00:04:45.640> not<00:04:45.760> going<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:45.940> catch<00:04:46.120> on

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
something that's not going to catch on

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.720 
something that's not going to catch on
fire<00:04:46.270> very<00:04:46.720> easily<00:04:46.960> now<00:04:47.950> this<00:04:48.130> actually<00:04:48.550> has<00:04:48.700> a

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
fire very easily now this actually has a

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.000 
fire very easily now this actually has a
temperature<00:04:49.390> sensor<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.530> what<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.770> do<00:04:50.920> with

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
temperature sensor and what you do with

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.250 
temperature sensor and what you do with
the<00:04:51.100> temperature<00:04:51.340> sensor<00:04:51.790> is<00:04:52.540> basically<00:04:53.020> you

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
the temperature sensor is basically you

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.440 
the temperature sensor is basically you
just<00:04:53.440> put<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.710> battery<00:04:53.830> on<00:04:54.160> top<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.670> and

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
just put the battery on top of it and

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.660 
just put the battery on top of it and
then<00:04:56.380> just<00:04:56.560> lay<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.770> down<00:04:56.830> make<00:04:57.400> sure<00:04:57.430> the

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
then just lay it down make sure the

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.050 
then just lay it down make sure the
temps<00:04:58.090> your<00:04:58.180> sister<00:04:58.510> sensor<00:04:59.080> is<00:04:59.670> below<00:05:00.670> it<00:05:00.880> and

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
temps your sister sensor is below it and

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.660 
temps your sister sensor is below it and
is<00:05:01.750> actually<00:05:02.020> in<00:05:02.380> contact<00:05:02.950> with<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.310> battery

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
is actually in contact with the battery

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.730 
is actually in contact with the battery
to<00:05:03.910> ensure<00:05:04.210> proper<00:05:04.960> charging<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:07.590> what<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
to ensure proper charging and what the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.530 
to ensure proper charging and what the
temperature<00:05:09.070> sensor<00:05:09.490> basically<00:05:09.970> does<00:05:10.180> is<00:05:10.510> it

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
temperature sensor basically does is it

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.210 
temperature sensor basically does is it
just<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.960> text<00:05:11.230> of<00:05:11.350> temperature<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.040> if<00:05:12.100> it

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
just the text of temperature and if it
