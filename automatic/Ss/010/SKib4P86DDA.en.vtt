00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
I made it to the ridge line up to kala

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.339 
I made it to the ridge line up to kala
it's<00:02:59.250> pretty<00:02:59.549> steep<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:00.120> actually<00:03:00.930> had<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.290> use

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
it's pretty steep I actually had to use

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.890 
it's pretty steep I actually had to use
some<00:03:02.069> ropes<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.790> Flex<00:03:03.030> electrical<00:03:03.540> cable

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
some ropes with Flex electrical cable

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.990 
some ropes with Flex electrical cable
and<00:03:04.590> somebody<00:03:04.890> had<00:03:04.980> left<00:03:05.159> for<00:03:05.670> some<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:05.940> those

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
and somebody had left for some of those

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.449 
and somebody had left for some of those
deeper<00:03:06.299> parts<00:03:06.830> I'll<00:03:07.830> give<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:08.220> little<00:03:08.340> idea

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
deeper parts I'll give you a little idea

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.289 
deeper parts I'll give you a little idea
what<00:03:08.790> looks<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:10.640> white<00:03:11.640> power<00:03:11.910> poles<00:03:12.150> down

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
what looks like white power poles down

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.970 
what looks like white power poles down
there<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.569> where<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> came<00:03:12.840> up<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.739> now<00:03:13.860> I'm

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
there is where I came up and now I'm

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.160 
there is where I came up and now I'm
following<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.459> ridgeline<00:03:14.879> straight<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:15.900> here

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170

Ridge North it's all the way up I do

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.890 
Ridge North it's all the way up I do
hear<00:03:37.190> water<00:03:38.190> down<00:03:38.430> there<00:03:38.609> then<00:03:39.599> there's<00:03:39.810> a

Ridgeline pretty intense climb pretty
hairy<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.510> spots<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:49.349> kind<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.590> wondering<00:03:49.769> how

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
hairy in spots I'm kind of wondering how

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.680 
hairy in spots I'm kind of wondering how
going<00:03:50.400> downhill<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.849> gonna<00:03:51.000> be<00:03:51.120> because<00:03:51.480> it's

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
going downhill is gonna be because it's

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.839 
going downhill is gonna be because it's
very<00:03:51.870> muddy<00:03:52.140> very<00:03:52.440> slippery<00:03:52.680> but<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.700> the

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
very muddy very slippery but in the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.430 
very muddy very slippery but in the
worst<00:03:54.060> spots<00:03:54.390> there's<00:03:54.750> two<00:03:54.989> spots<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.349> I

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
worst spots there's two spots that I

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.440 
worst spots there's two spots that I
found<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.799> far<00:03:56.010> there<00:03:56.250> are<00:03:56.400> some<00:03:57.060> little<00:03:57.180> ropes

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
found so far there are some little ropes

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.050 
found so far there are some little ropes
and<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:58.290> should<00:03:58.440> be<00:03:58.560> helpful<00:03:58.859> so<00:03:59.069> looks<00:03:59.880> like

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
and that should be helpful so looks like

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.449 
and that should be helpful so looks like
I<00:04:00.180> just<00:04:00.239> need<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.660> hump<00:04:01.069> go<00:04:02.069> over<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> couple

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
I just need to hump go over a couple

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.720 
I just need to hump go over a couple
more<00:04:02.609> humps<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.660> then<00:04:03.810> I'll<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:04.019> at<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.169> top

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
more humps and then I'll be at the top

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.520 
more humps and then I'll be at the top
flat<00:04:05.730> kind<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.120> bog<00:04:06.299> land<00:04:06.630> it's<00:04:06.870> at<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.079> top<00:04:07.349> of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
flat kind of bog land it's at the top of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.180 
flat kind of bog land it's at the top of
the<00:04:07.620> plateau<00:04:08.069> it's<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.819> flat<00:04:09.030> feet<00:04:09.269> up<00:04:09.419> there<00:04:09.569> so

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
the plateau it's a flat feet up there so

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.420 
the plateau it's a flat feet up there so
getting<00:04:11.190> close<00:04:12.079> along<00:04:13.160> everything<00:04:14.160> at<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
getting close along everything at the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.280 
getting close along everything at the
top<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.790> column<00:04:15.380> that's<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.560> pretty<00:04:16.799> flat<00:04:16.979> peak

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.660 

we're<00:04:22.290> up<00:04:22.350> in<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.500> clouds<00:04:22.560> today<00:04:22.950> so<00:04:23.130> there's

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
we're up in the clouds today so there's

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.650 
we're up in the clouds today so there's
not<00:04:23.790> much<00:04:23.850> but<00:04:24.860> hike<00:04:25.860> was<00:04:26.190> definitely<00:04:26.730> a<00:04:26.970> very

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
not much but hike was definitely a very

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.080 
not much but hike was definitely a very
unique<00:04:28.320> one<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.890> last<00:04:29.100> bit<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.910> was

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
unique one the last bit of it was

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.860 
unique one the last bit of it was
through<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> log<00:04:34.190> interesting<00:04:35.570> algae<00:04:36.570> or

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
through a log interesting algae or

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.660 
through a log interesting algae or
whatever<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.290> was<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.560> was<00:04:37.650> bright<00:04:37.890> blue<00:04:38.160> along

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
whatever it was it was bright blue along

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.360 
whatever it was it was bright blue along
the<00:04:38.820> trail<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.360> walk<00:04:40.350> along<00:04:40.590> boards<00:04:41.100> that

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
the trail you walk along boards that

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.520 
the trail you walk along boards that
pretty<00:04:41.910> much<00:04:42.090> protect<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.660> from<00:04:42.840> with<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
pretty much protect you from with the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.080 
pretty much protect you from with the
bog<00:04:44.420> which<00:04:45.420> is<00:04:45.540> essentially<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.500> big<00:04:46.710> mud<00:04:47.090> mud

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
bog which is essentially a big mud mud

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.640 
bog which is essentially a big mud mud
field<00:04:48.390> and<00:04:50.600> but<00:04:51.600> before<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.140> you<00:04:52.380> have<00:04:52.530> to

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
field and but before that you have to

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.370 
field and but before that you have to
climb<00:04:52.920> straight<00:04:53.400> up<00:04:53.550> where<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.570> not<00:04:55.020> sure<00:04:55.290> if

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
climb straight up where you not sure if

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.840 
climb straight up where you not sure if
there<00:04:55.530> is<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.650> trail<00:04:55.950> but<00:04:56.190> sure<00:04:56.430> enough<00:04:56.610> was<00:04:56.760> the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
there is a trail but sure enough was the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.430 
there is a trail but sure enough was the
trail<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.150> goes<00:04:57.210> straight<00:04:57.420> up<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:58.320> have

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
trail that goes straight up and you have

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.660 
trail that goes straight up and you have
to<00:04:58.580> pull<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.730> ropes<00:05:00.770> slip<00:05:01.770> on<00:05:01.950> mud<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.550> it's

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
to pull on ropes slip on mud and it's

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.070 
to pull on ropes slip on mud and it's
very<00:05:02.910> precarious<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:03.600> there's<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.810> lot<00:05:03.960> of

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
very precarious and there's a lot of

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.400 
very precarious and there's a lot of
exposure<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.700> was<00:05:05.850> pretty<00:05:06.150> hairy<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:06.840> I

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
exposure and that was pretty hairy so I

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.310 
exposure and that was pretty hairy so I
