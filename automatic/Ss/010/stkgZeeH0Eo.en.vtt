okay<00:00:15.110> now<00:00:15.709> today<00:00:15.769> we're<00:00:16.190> gonna<00:00:16.309> talk<00:00:16.550> about

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
okay now today we're gonna talk about

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.060 
okay now today we're gonna talk about
load<00:00:17.480> sampling<00:00:18.110> now<00:00:18.320> I<00:00:18.440> know<00:00:18.530> a<00:00:18.650> lot<00:00:18.860> of<00:00:18.890> guys

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
load sampling now I know a lot of guys

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.890 
load sampling now I know a lot of guys
out<00:00:19.310> there<00:00:19.370> don't<00:00:19.880> talk<00:00:20.090> a<00:00:20.120> lot<00:00:20.360> about<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:20.780> they

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
out there don't talk a lot about it they

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.320 
out there don't talk a lot about it they
mostly<00:00:21.170> cover<00:00:21.440> placer<00:00:21.950> sampling<00:00:22.400> I<00:00:22.580> think

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
mostly cover placer sampling I think

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.520 
mostly cover placer sampling I think
it's<00:00:23.450> important<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:23.840> you<00:00:23.960> know<00:00:24.170> load

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
it's important that you know load

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.020 
it's important that you know load
sampling<00:00:25.040> because<00:00:25.100> you<00:00:25.310> never<00:00:25.430> know<00:00:25.700> when

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
sampling because you never know when

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.610 
sampling because you never know when
you're<00:00:26.120> gonna<00:00:26.180> come<00:00:26.300> across<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:27.080> rich<00:00:27.440> deposit

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 
you're gonna come across a rich deposit

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.260 
you're gonna come across a rich deposit
laying<00:00:28.400> on<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:28.640> ground<00:00:28.790> and<00:00:29.090> everybody's

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
laying on the ground and everybody's

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.060 
laying on the ground and everybody's
been<00:00:29.600> walking<00:00:30.020> over<00:00:30.140> because<00:00:30.650> nobody's

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
been walking over because nobody's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.799 
been walking over because nobody's
taking<00:00:31.370> the<00:00:31.430> time<00:00:31.610> to<00:00:31.760> sample<00:00:31.970> it<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:32.750> I'm

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
taking the time to sample it so I'm

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:33.910 
taking the time to sample it so I'm
gonna<00:00:32.930> show<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.380> tools<00:00:33.620> you're<00:00:33.829> gonna

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
gonna show you the tools you're gonna

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.170 
gonna show you the tools you're gonna
need<00:00:34.130> to<00:00:34.250> do<00:00:34.400> it<00:00:34.520> it's<00:00:34.670> really<00:00:34.730> not<00:00:35.030> that

need to do it it's really not that

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.090 
need to do it it's really not that
difficult<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:36.050> once<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.620> start<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:36.890> get<00:00:36.980> the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
difficult and once you start to get the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.830 
difficult and once you start to get the
hang<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:37.400> it<00:00:37.520> you'll<00:00:37.760> be<00:00:37.910> sampling<00:00:38.390> before<00:00:38.600> you

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
hang of it you'll be sampling before you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.420 
hang of it you'll be sampling before you
know<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:39.320> here<00:00:39.620> we<00:00:39.680> go<00:00:39.800> okay<00:00:42.220> first<00:00:43.220> thing

deposits<00:01:08.840> inside<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.350> these<00:01:09.440> samples<00:01:09.920> you're

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
deposits inside of these samples you're

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.320

gonna<00:01:10.310> want<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.700> remember<00:01:10.909> where<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.299> came

from people log on where it came from
next<00:01:14.600> you're<00:01:15.229> gonna<00:01:15.290> need<00:01:15.530> one<00:01:15.650> of<00:01:15.680> these<00:01:15.830> guys

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
next you're gonna need one of these guys

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.020 
next you're gonna need one of these guys
it's<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.060> mortar<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:17.650> pestle<00:01:18.650> I<00:01:19.100> recommend

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
it's a mortar and pestle I recommend

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.910 
it's a mortar and pestle I recommend
getting<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.360> large<00:01:20.600> one<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.470> reason<00:01:21.799> being

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
getting the large one the reason being

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.740 
getting the large one the reason being
is<00:01:22.159> I've<00:01:22.369> tried<00:01:22.580> two<00:01:22.700> small<00:01:22.970> one<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.570> just

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
is I've tried two small one and it just

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.480 
is I've tried two small one and it just
simply<00:01:24.110> isn't<00:01:24.290> big<00:01:24.560> enough<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.830> handle<00:01:25.130> the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
simply isn't big enough to handle the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.370 
simply isn't big enough to handle the
type<00:01:25.729> of<00:01:25.880> samples<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.360> like<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.690> do<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.110> get<00:01:27.260> the

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
type of samples I like to do so get the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.870 
type of samples I like to do so get the
larger<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:27.950> two<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.369> can<00:01:28.580> find<00:01:28.760> them

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
larger of the two you can find them

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.850 
larger of the two you can find them
anywhere<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.479> got<00:01:30.080> this<00:01:30.170> one<00:01:30.380> from<00:01:30.500> Keene

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
anywhere I got this one from Keene

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.289 
anywhere I got this one from Keene
engineering<00:01:31.430> they<00:01:31.610> make<00:01:31.790> some<00:01:31.939> really<00:01:32.090> good

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
engineering they make some really good

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.920 
engineering they make some really good
ones<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:33.320> they're<00:01:33.500> heavy-duty<00:01:34.240> next<00:01:35.240> you're

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
ones and they're heavy-duty next you're

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.690 
ones and they're heavy-duty next you're
going<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.110> need<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.530> classifying<00:01:37.159> screen<00:01:37.490> I

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
going to need a classifying screen I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.330 
going to need a classifying screen I
like<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.479> number<00:01:38.810> eight<00:01:39.080> classifying<00:01:39.979> screen

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
like the number eight classifying screen

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.950 
like the number eight classifying screen
and<00:01:40.549> there's<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.119> reason<00:01:41.390> why<00:01:41.479> they<00:01:41.630> call<00:01:41.659> it

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
and there's a reason why they call it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.990 
and there's a reason why they call it
that<00:01:41.990> number<00:01:42.650> four<00:01:42.920> number<00:01:43.130> eight<00:01:43.460> what<00:01:43.790> have

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
that number four number eight what have

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.109 
that number four number eight what have
you<00:01:44.150> all<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.080> have<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.409> do<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.740> remember<00:01:46.119> if

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
you all you have to do is remember if

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.580 
you all you have to do is remember if
you<00:01:47.240> get<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.479> tape<00:01:48.170> measure<00:01:48.200> out<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:50.590> basically

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
you get a tape measure out the basically

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.429 
you get a tape measure out the basically
the<00:01:51.799> size<00:01:52.040> of<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.310> screen<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:53.540> dictated<00:01:54.409> by

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
the size of the screen is dictated by

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.679 
the size of the screen is dictated by
how<00:01:54.770> many<00:01:55.009> square<00:01:55.430> openings<00:01:56.030> there<00:01:56.210> are<00:01:56.390> and

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
how many square openings there are and

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.149 
how many square openings there are and
each<00:01:57.409> linear<00:01:57.860> inch

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
each linear inch

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
each linear inch
so<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so you all you have to do is if it's a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
so you all you have to do is if it's a
number<00:02:01.710> eight<00:02:02.039> screen<00:02:02.670> there's<00:02:03.180> eight<00:02:03.539> square

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
number eight screen there's eight square

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.279 
number eight screen there's eight square
openings<00:02:04.920> per<00:02:05.250> linear<00:02:05.759> inch<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:07.140> how

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
openings per linear inch and that's how

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.749 
openings per linear inch and that's how
you<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.619> tell<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> different<00:02:08.280> size<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you can tell the different size of the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.870 
you can tell the different size of the
screen<00:02:09.090> whether<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.660> sixteen<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:11.340> or

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
screen whether it's a sixteen or a or

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.120 
screen whether it's a sixteen or a or
four<00:02:12.239> or<00:02:12.390> what<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.920> using

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
four or what have you so I like using

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.860 
four or what have you so I like using
the<00:02:14.400> number<00:02:14.640> eight<00:02:14.819> gets<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> down<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the number eight gets it down to the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.750 
the number eight gets it down to the
size<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.410> consistency<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.190> really<00:02:17.550> like

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
size and consistency that I really like

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.660 
size and consistency that I really like
and<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.840> course<00:02:19.080> last<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:19.709> least<00:02:20.040> every

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
and of course last but not least every

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
prospect has got to have one of these

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.620 
prospect has got to have one of these

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
because that iron is heavy like the gold

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.940 
because that iron is heavy like the gold
sometimes<00:05:28.660> if<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.170> gold<00:05:29.380> is<00:05:29.500> small<00:05:29.800> enough

sometimes if the gold is small enough

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.090 
sometimes if the gold is small enough
it'll<00:05:30.280> actually<00:05:30.700> sit<00:05:31.060> right<00:05:31.300> on<00:05:31.360> top<00:05:31.920> and<00:05:32.920> if<00:05:33.010> I

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
it'll actually sit right on top and if I

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.350 
it'll actually sit right on top and if I
haven't<00:05:33.310> mentioned<00:05:33.730> it<00:05:33.790> before<00:05:33.910> make<00:05:34.330> sure

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
haven't mentioned it before make sure

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.030
