00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
to happen there there could also be a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.790

some higher specifications obviously all

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
some higher specifications obviously all
models<00:02:37.010> usually<00:02:37.190> offer<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:38.090> lot<00:02:38.420> of

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
video unfortunately this these specs

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.920 
video unfortunately this these specs
don't<00:02:50.840> necessarily<00:02:51.760> meet<00:02:52.760> with<00:02:52.910> my<00:02:53.060> hopes<00:02:53.360> of

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
don't necessarily meet with my hopes of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.610 
don't necessarily meet with my hopes of
a<00:02:54.110> thinner<00:02:54.320> design<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:55.180> SSD<00:02:56.180> based<00:02:56.620> macbook

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
a thinner design of SSD based macbook

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.700 
a thinner design of SSD based macbook
pro<00:02:58.060> what<00:02:59.060> were<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.210> other<00:02:59.330> two<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.840> does<00:03:00.290> me<00:03:00.470> a

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
pro what were the other two it does me a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.580 
pro what were the other two it does me a
faster<00:03:01.310> processor<00:03:01.820> which<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.060> wanted<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.590> had

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
faster processor which I wanted I had

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.910 
faster processor which I wanted I had
suspected<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.430> possibly<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.060> core<00:03:05.630> i3<00:03:06.440> we're

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
suspected it possibly a core i3 we're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.950 
suspected it possibly a core i3 we're
getting<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.190> on<00:03:07.250> 5<00:03:07.720> according<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.780> these

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
getting it on 5 according to these

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.360 
getting it on 5 according to these
specifications<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.770> that's<00:03:09.980> definitely<00:03:10.160> a

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
specifications so that's definitely a

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.690

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
that's the way that I see the macbook

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.500 
that's the way that I see the macbook
pro<00:03:27.800> going<00:03:28.310> in<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.459> future<00:03:28.640> not<00:03:28.970> necessarily
