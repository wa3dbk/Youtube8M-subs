first<00:00:19.680> season<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:20.100> I'm<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.400> sure<00:00:20.430> who<00:00:20.789> has

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
what now with this I think Funimation

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.370 
what now with this I think Funimation
just<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.800> season<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.580> sent<00:00:27.539> I'd<00:00:27.689> has<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
just as season one and sent I'd has a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.620 
just as season one and sent I'd has a
season<00:00:29.070> 2<00:00:29.189> m3

season<00:01:15.670> three<00:01:16.180> which<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:17.050> got<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.350> mail<00:01:17.530> first

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
season three which I got the mail first

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
season three which I got the mail first
I<00:01:18.160> swapped<00:01:19.000> out<00:01:19.210> with<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.710> case<00:01:20.710> from<00:01:20.890> another

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
I swapped out with a case from another

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.870 
I swapped out with a case from another
set<00:01:22.600> which<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:24.310> should<00:01:24.520> have<00:01:24.610> kept<00:01:24.790> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
set which I should have kept the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.060 
set which I should have kept the
styrofoam<00:01:25.420> if<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.750> get<00:01:25.960> these<00:01:26.110> keep<00:01:26.920> the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
styrofoam if you get these keep the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.440 
styrofoam if you get these keep the
styrofoam<00:01:27.580> because<00:01:27.850> sometimes<00:01:28.210> when<00:01:28.330> you

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
styrofoam because sometimes when you

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.300 
styrofoam because sometimes when you
open<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.810> case<00:01:29.020> they're<00:01:29.290> all<00:01:29.410> sliding<00:01:30.070> around

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
open the case they're all sliding around

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.390 
open the case they're all sliding around
cuz<00:01:30.640> I'd<00:01:30.759> fallen<00:01:31.000> out<00:01:31.470> stack<00:01:32.470> packs<00:01:32.800> are<00:01:33.160> the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
cuz I'd fallen out stack packs are the

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.870 
cuz I'd fallen out stack packs are the
worst<00:01:34.470> packaging<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.680> you<00:01:36.130> can<00:01:36.369> get<00:01:36.729> an

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
worst packaging that you can get an

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.469 
worst packaging that you can get an
anime<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:37.600> talk<00:01:38.500> bad<00:01:38.710> about<00:01:38.740> Slayers<00:01:39.430> in<00:01:39.850> my

anime I talk bad about Slayers in my
previous<00:01:40.869> unboxing<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.640> this<00:01:42.940> is<00:01:43.179> just<00:01:43.210> much

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
previous unboxing but this is just much

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.499 
previous unboxing but this is just much
worse<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:44.710> can't<00:01:45.429> even<00:01:45.490> get<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.910> disc<00:01:46.179> out<00:01:46.360> of

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
worse I can't even get the disc out of

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.760 
worse I can't even get the disc out of
here<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.630> feel<00:01:46.840> like<00:01:46.929> I'm<00:01:47.080> going<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.259> snap<00:01:47.530> it

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770

I'm<00:01:48.610> gonna<00:01:48.880> do<00:01:49.090> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.160 

it's<00:01:55.080> just<00:01:55.350> ridiculous<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.900> like<00:01:58.050> I'm

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
it's just ridiculous it was like I'm

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
it's just ridiculous it was like I'm
bending<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.860> disc<00:01:59.190> oh<00:02:01.250> but<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> should<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.670> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
bending the disc oh but I should have to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
bending the disc oh but I should have to
put<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.029 

especially<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.859> series<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.289> actually

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
especially on a series that is actually

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.369 
especially on a series that is actually
pretty<00:02:10.250> rare<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:11.629> hard<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.959> find<00:02:12.200> it

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
pretty rare and it's hard to find it

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:21.970 
pretty rare and it's hard to find it
pretty<00:02:12.739> cheap<00:02:14.860> ok<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.920> first<00:02:19.129> disc

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.770 

which<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.640> beautiful

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:42.800 

a<00:02:26.900> second<00:02:27.830> disc

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.110 

third<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.099> far<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.459> disks<00:02:44.760> are<00:02:44.910> just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
third is so far the disks are just

00:02:45.120 --> 00:03:05.750 
third is so far the disks are just
beautiful

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.360 

and<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.629> is<00:03:06.810> that's<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.319> last<00:03:07.500> disc<00:03:07.830> I'm<00:03:08.189> not
