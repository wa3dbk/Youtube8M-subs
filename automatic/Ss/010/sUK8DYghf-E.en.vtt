is surf-and-turf which works well when
your<00:04:29.550> subject<00:04:29.760> is<00:04:30.060> just<00:04:30.330> moving<00:04:30.540> horizontally

on a level surface like soccer big
altitude<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.070> best<00:04:35.340> for<00:04:35.550> stuff<00:04:35.850> with<00:04:36.120> vertical

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
altitude is best for stuff with vertical

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.690 
altitude is best for stuff with vertical
movement<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.200> snowboarding<00:04:37.980> or<00:04:38.130> flying<00:04:38.460> our

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
movement like snowboarding or flying our

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.810

mode<00:04:42.060> locks<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:43.020> tilt<00:04:43.290> completely<00:04:44.130> so<00:04:44.670> you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
mode locks the tilt completely so you

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.150 
mode locks the tilt completely so you
just<00:04:45.060> get<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.300> smooth<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.080> perfect<00:04:46.470> pan<00:04:46.710> and

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
just get a smooth and perfect pan and

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.520 
just get a smooth and perfect pan and
finally<00:04:48.060> there's<00:04:48.300> barrel<00:04:48.780> mode<00:04:48.990> which<00:04:49.350> is

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
finally there's barrel mode which is

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.900 
finally there's barrel mode which is
meant<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.860> keep<00:04:49.980> you<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.400> shot<00:04:50.640> while

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
meant to keep you in the shot while

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.120 
meant to keep you in the shot while
surfing<00:04:51.180> barrel<00:04:51.750> waves<00:04:51.960> now<00:04:52.590> unfortunately

we<00:04:53.670> didn't<00:04:53.850> get<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.060> test<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.540> one<00:04:54.720> out<00:04:54.900> so

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
we didn't get to test that one out so

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.830 
we didn't get to test that one out so
I'm<00:04:55.290> curious<00:04:55.560> about<00:04:55.920> how<00:04:56.250> well<00:04:56.490> it<00:04:56.610> works<00:04:56.850> now
