00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
they're basically treating it like a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
they're basically treating it like a
pretty<00:00:37.980> much<00:00:38.130> of<00:00:38.280> course<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.730> code<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.750> goes

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
pretty much of course is code so it goes

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.660 
pretty much of course is code so it goes
straight<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.560> little<00:00:40.770> subdued<00:00:41.220> verse

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
and then you don't start the a chord

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.370 
and then you don't start the a chord
here<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.490> right<00:02:23.450> there<00:02:23.690> service

here that that a right there service
that<00:02:25.010> opening<00:02:25.550> chords<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.030> figure<00:02:26.270> so<00:02:26.390> you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
that opening chords the figure so you

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.110 
that opening chords the figure so you
jump<00:02:26.959> right<00:02:27.170> into<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.560> pool

on the third time of coming up to these
chords<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.610> just<00:02:46.849> do<00:02:46.939> them<00:02:47.120> continuously

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.060

they according while you're doing that

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.770 
they according while you're doing that
didn't<00:04:36.560> start<00:04:36.740> symbol<00:04:37.070> Oh<00:04:37.280> ticket<00:04:38.240> on<00:04:38.420> that

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
didn't start symbol Oh ticket on that

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.260 
didn't start symbol Oh ticket on that
open<00:04:39.170> first<00:04:39.410> ring<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.920> we<00:04:40.580> go<00:04:40.730> all<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:40.970> way<00:04:41.090> up

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
open first ring and we go all the way up

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.100 
open first ring and we go all the way up
like<00:04:41.360> this

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.020 

so<00:04:48.830> what<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:50.229> matter<00:04:51.229> G<00:04:51.560> open<00:04:52.460> G<00:04:52.870> -<00:04:55.030> I'm

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
so what is that matter G open G - I'm

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.580 
so what is that matter G open G - I'm
thirsting<00:04:56.689> all<00:04:56.870> these<00:04:57.050> are<00:04:57.199> on<00:04:57.319> the<00:04:57.409> third

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
thirsting all these are on the third

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.589 
thirsting all these are on the third
string<00:04:57.889> two<00:04:58.599> four<00:05:00.340> five<00:05:02.199> seven<00:05:04.300> so<00:05:05.300> think<00:05:05.569> of

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
string two four five seven so think of

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.050 
string two four five seven so think of
that<00:05:05.719> -<00:05:05.930> five<00:05:06.199> four<00:05:06.500> five<00:05:06.889> seven<00:05:07.310> basically<00:05:08.000> we

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
that - five four five seven basically we

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.050 
that - five four five seven basically we
do<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.300> same<00:05:08.479> thing<00:05:08.719> up<00:05:08.840> here<00:05:09.789> just<00:05:10.789> one<00:05:10.939> on

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
do the same thing up here just one on

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.980 
do the same thing up here just one on
the<00:05:11.150> pyruvate

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
the pyruvate

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.520 
the pyruvate
where's<00:05:12.379> the<00:05:12.560> 12<00:05:13.509> 14<00:05:14.509> 16<00:05:16.120> seven<00:05:17.120> we<00:05:18.080> keep<00:05:18.259> going

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
where's the 12 14 16 seven we keep going

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.040 
where's the 12 14 16 seven we keep going
up<00:05:18.710> here<00:05:19.069> to<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.370> 90

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.260 

and<00:05:25.050> you<00:05:25.110> do<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.290> band<00:05:25.590> at<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.830> 21st<00:05:26.430> fret<00:05:26.970> on

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
and you do a band at the 21st fret on

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.870 
and you do a band at the 21st fret on
the<00:05:27.360> third-string

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.550 

give<00:05:33.880> some<00:05:34.030> tremolo<00:05:34.449> on<00:05:34.600> and<00:05:34.840> then<00:05:34.960> ended<00:05:35.470> by

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
give some tremolo on and then ended by

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:45.750 
give some tremolo on and then ended by
doing<00:05:35.800> some<00:05:35.919> vibrato<00:05:36.280> on<00:05:36.580> it<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:43.680> that<00:05:44.680> now<00:05:45.460> is

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
doing some vibrato on it and that now is

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.250 
doing some vibrato on it and that now is
where<00:05:45.940> he<00:05:46.060> does<00:05:46.240> all<00:05:46.389> that<00:05:46.510> chaos<00:05:46.720> up<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.169> down

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
where he does all that chaos up and down

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.340 
where he does all that chaos up and down
to<00:05:47.320> 30

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
to 30

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.200 
to 30

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
free time there and then but after that

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.420 
free time there and then but after that
becomes<00:05:59.979> a<00:06:00.040> big<00:06:01.290> number<00:06:02.290> a<00:06:02.410> power<00:06:02.800> chord<00:06:03.100> you

on that a last a power important zero
all<00:06:39.060> right<00:06:39.240> and<00:06:39.390> that's<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.930> for<00:06:40.140> a<00:06:40.200> hopper
