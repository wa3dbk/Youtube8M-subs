00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that to me was was one of the most

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.800 
that to me was was one of the most
important<00:01:07.470> goals<00:01:08.030> at<00:01:09.030> first<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.660> ball

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
important goals at first I got the ball

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.169 
important goals at first I got the ball
from<00:01:09.990> robear<00:01:10.649> he<00:01:11.220> gave<00:01:11.399> it<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.580> me<00:01:11.789> from<00:01:11.970> from

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
from robear he gave it to me from from

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.859 
from robear he gave it to me from from
the<00:01:12.330> side<00:01:12.539> gave<00:01:13.440> it<00:01:13.560> inside<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.210> found<00:01:15.570> I

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the side gave it inside and I found I

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.389 
the side gave it inside and I found I
thought<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> ball<00:01:16.679> was<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.190> more

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
thought the ball was a little bit more

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.020 
thought the ball was a little bit more
too<00:01:18.300> much<00:01:18.479> behind<00:01:18.929> me<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.220> had<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> turn<00:01:20.819> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
too much behind me so I had to turn to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.800 
too much behind me so I had to turn to
control<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
control it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.499 
control it
touch<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> ball<00:01:22.470> past<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.920> defender<00:01:23.399> and<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
touch the ball past the defender and the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.389 
touch the ball past the defender and the
quickest<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.530> towards<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.009> ball<00:01:26.159> was

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
quickest way to go towards the ball was

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.370 
quickest way to go towards the ball was
turning<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.330> way<00:01:27.509> instead<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.080> way

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
turning that way instead of that way

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.980 
turning that way instead of that way
so<00:01:29.100> definitely<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.819> it<00:01:30.780> looked<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.140> bit<00:01:31.550> yeah

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
so definitely it it looked a bit yeah

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.830 
so definitely it it looked a bit yeah
special<00:01:33.990> or<00:01:34.140> strange<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.740> nice<00:01:35.149> but<00:01:36.149> that<00:01:36.509> was

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
special or strange or nice but that was

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.630 
special or strange or nice but that was
for<00:01:37.080> me<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.289> only<00:01:37.409> option<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.310> quickest

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
for me the only option and the quickest

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.459 
for me the only option and the quickest
way<00:01:38.670> towards<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.300> ball<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.720> towards<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> goal

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
way towards the ball in towards the goal

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.630 
way towards the ball in towards the goal
and<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> finish<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:41.969> just<00:01:43.159> yeah<00:01:44.159> just

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and and the finish was just yeah just

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.690 
and and the finish was just yeah just
try<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.710> past<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> goalkeeper<00:01:47.280> in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
try to get it past the goalkeeper in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.389 
try to get it past the goalkeeper in
such<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.450> he<00:01:48.630> can't<00:01:48.810> reach<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
such a way that he can't reach it and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.149 
such a way that he can't reach it and
the<00:01:50.399> whole<00:01:50.579> move<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.770> probably<00:01:52.770> in

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the whole move was was probably in

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.709 
the whole move was was probably in
perfect<00:01:53.789> but<00:01:53.969> but<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.420> could<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.689> gone

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
perfect but but it could have gone

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.620 
perfect but but it could have gone
completely<00:01:55.680> wrong<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.430> at<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.270> time<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
completely wrong but at that time it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
completely wrong but at that time it
worked
