00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.210 

let's<00:00:07.020> talk<00:00:07.259> real<00:00:07.560> quick<00:00:07.799> about<00:00:07.830> the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
let's talk real quick about the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.419 
let's talk real quick about the
chocolate<00:00:09.050> now<00:00:10.050> you'd<00:00:10.860> mention<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.400> that

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
chocolate now you'd mention here that

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.890 
chocolate now you'd mention here that
the<00:00:11.580> chocolate<00:00:12.090> will<00:00:12.210> not<00:00:12.389> flow<00:00:12.690> up<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the chocolate will not flow up the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.780 
the chocolate will not flow up the
center<00:00:13.290> cylinder<00:00:13.799> there's<00:00:14.250> only<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.549> few

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
center cylinder there's only a few

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.279 
center cylinder there's only a few
reasons<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.540> chocolate<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.080> not

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
reasons that the chocolate would not

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.170 
reasons that the chocolate would not
flow<00:00:16.529> up<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.680> center<00:00:17.039> cylinder<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.670> first<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
flow up the center cylinder the first is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.939 
flow up the center cylinder the first is
if<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.660> chocolate<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.199> too<00:00:19.410> thick

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
if the chocolate is too thick

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.740 
if the chocolate is too thick
the<00:00:20.400> reason<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> chocolate<00:00:21.300> would<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.539> too

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
the reason the chocolate would be too

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.990 
the reason the chocolate would be too
thick<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.740> wasn't<00:00:22.920> melted<00:00:23.490> enough<00:00:23.609> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
thick is if it wasn't melted enough and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.849 
thick is if it wasn't melted enough and
I'm<00:00:24.150> building<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.109> because<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.560> say<00:00:25.769> it

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
I'm building on this because you say it

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.730 
I'm building on this because you say it
just<00:00:26.099> sits<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> bottom<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:28.260> chocolate

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
just sits at the bottom the chocolate

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710 
just sits at the bottom the chocolate
would<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.130> sit<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.460> bottom<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
would just sit at the bottom for a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.870 
would just sit at the bottom for a
couple<00:00:31.050> reasons<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.520> flow<00:00:32.790> up

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
couple reasons as well as not flow up

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.479 
couple reasons as well as not flow up
the<00:00:33.030> top<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.450> again<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.170> too<00:00:34.410> thick<00:00:34.739> it

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the top and again if it was too thick it

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.330 
the top and again if it was too thick it
would<00:00:35.790> not<00:00:35.969> flow<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.140> we've<00:00:37.980> created

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
would not flow we have we've created

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.420 
would not flow we have we've created
tapered<00:00:39.090> bottoms<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.320> bowl<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.890> our<00:00:41.100> fountain

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
tapered bottoms the bowl of our fountain

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.520 
tapered bottoms the bowl of our fountain
is<00:00:41.520> tapered<00:00:42.000> meaning<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.450> angled<00:00:42.930> down<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
is tapered meaning it's angled down and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.619 
is tapered meaning it's angled down and
the<00:00:43.920> chocolate<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.700> melted<00:00:45.059> properly

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the chocolate if it's melted properly

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.020 
the chocolate if it's melted properly
would<00:00:46.110> float<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.829> toward<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> center

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
would float down toward the center

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.940 
would float down toward the center
cylinder<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> chocolate

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
cylinder and up but if the chocolate

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250 
cylinder and up but if the chocolate
hasn't<00:00:50.489> been<00:00:50.610> melted<00:00:51.030> properly<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:51.840> enough

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
hasn't been melted properly or enough

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
hasn't been melted properly or enough
it's<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.520> want<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.730> flow<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it's not going to want to flow to the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.650 
it's not going to want to flow to the
bottom<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> lot<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.590> times<00:00:55.829> people<00:00:56.100> think

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
bottom now a lot of times people think

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.340 
bottom now a lot of times people think
they<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.899> looked<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.230> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
they would have looked at this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.799 
they would have looked at this
previously<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.010> saw<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> just<00:01:00.539> didn't

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
previously and saw that it just didn't

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.060 
previously and saw that it just didn't
have<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> perfect<00:01:01.440> curtain<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:01.949> would

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
have a perfect curtain and they would

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
have a perfect curtain and they would
think<00:01:02.309> I've<00:01:02.699> got<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> crank<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> heat<00:01:03.629> up

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
think I've got to crank the heat up

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
think I've got to crank the heat up
let's<00:01:04.080> melt<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> chocolate<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.339> what

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
let's melt the chocolate more but what

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
let's melt the chocolate more but what
ends<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.790> happening<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.659> chocolate<00:01:07.350> scorches

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
ends up happening is chocolate scorches

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.039 
ends up happening is chocolate scorches
after<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> hundred<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.479> thirty<00:01:09.689> two<00:01:09.930> degrees

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
after a hundred and thirty two degrees

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.980 
after a hundred and thirty two degrees
and<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> crank<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.729> heat<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.180> what

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and so as you crank that heat up what

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.539 
and so as you crank that heat up what
you're<00:01:13.110> actually<00:01:13.560> doing<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.979> burning<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
you're actually doing is burning the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.300 
you're actually doing is burning the
chocolate<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.570> chocolate<00:01:16.049> burns<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.950> gets

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
chocolate and as chocolate burns it gets

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.429 
chocolate and as chocolate burns it gets
thicker<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.000> takes<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> toothpaste<00:01:19.110> type

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
thicker it takes on a toothpaste type

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.969 
thicker it takes on a toothpaste type
consistency<00:01:20.720> now<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.439> case<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
consistency now in this case there is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.440 
consistency now in this case there is
another<00:01:23.310> reason<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> chocolate<00:01:24.330> would

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
another reason that the chocolate would

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.880 
another reason that the chocolate would
not<00:01:24.630> flow<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> center<00:01:25.439> cylinder

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
not flow up the center cylinder

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.740 
not flow up the center cylinder
sometimes<00:01:26.670> people<00:01:27.060> opt<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> use<00:01:27.570> other

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
sometimes people opt to use other

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
sometimes people opt to use other
chocolate<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.350> our<00:01:28.470> fountains<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.310> save<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
chocolate in our fountains you save a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.609 
chocolate in our fountains you save a
little<00:01:29.820> money<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.780> you've<00:01:31.049> also<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
little money but you've also got to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.010 
little money but you've also got to
break<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.310> also<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> break<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.540> your

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
break it you also have to break out your

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
break it you also have to break out your
double<00:01:34.619> boiler<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.159> which<00:01:35.460> case<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
double boiler in which case a lot of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.179 
double boiler in which case a lot of
times<00:01:36.180> even<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.960> name<00:01:37.170> itself<00:01:37.500> implies<00:01:37.680> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
times even the name itself implies that

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
times even the name itself implies that
you're<00:01:38.280> having<00:01:38.490> boiling<00:01:39.119> water<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.720> melt<00:01:39.900> your

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
you're having boiling water to melt your

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.539 
you're having boiling water to melt your
chocolate<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.250> would<00:01:41.340> then

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
chocolate which to use that would then

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
chocolate which to use that would then
if<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.150> set<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.689> chocolate<00:01:43.110> you'd<00:01:43.290> have

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
if it's not set for chocolate you'd have
