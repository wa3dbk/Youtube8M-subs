something challenging and rewarding like

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.859 
something challenging and rewarding like
teaching<00:00:24.949> but<00:00:25.220> they<00:00:25.850> only<00:00:26.060> have<00:00:26.269> a<00:00:26.300> commitment

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
teaching but they only have a commitment

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.210 
teaching but they only have a commitment
of<00:00:26.960> several<00:00:27.650> years<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:29.500> what<00:00:30.500> happens<00:00:30.890> is

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
of several years and and what happens is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.880 
of several years and and what happens is
the<00:00:31.640> charter<00:00:31.939> schools<00:00:32.180> hire<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.419> lot<00:00:32.720> of<00:00:32.890> Teach

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
the charter schools hire a lot of Teach

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.680 
the charter schools hire a lot of Teach
for<00:00:33.920> America<00:00:34.070> teachers<00:00:35.020> and<00:00:36.820> they<00:00:37.820> tend<00:00:38.630> to

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
for America teachers and they tend to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.470 
for America teachers and they tend to
have<00:00:38.899> longer<00:00:39.110> work<00:00:39.950> hours<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:40.940> work<00:00:41.149> years

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
have longer work hours and work years

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.540 
have longer work hours and work years
than<00:00:41.809> traditional<00:00:42.440> public<00:00:42.800> schools<00:00:43.129> which<00:00:43.430> is

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
than traditional public schools which is

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.069 
than traditional public schools which is
the<00:00:43.700> benefit<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.329> students<00:00:44.809> but<00:00:45.020> the

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
the benefit to the students but the

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.100 
the benefit to the students but the
teachers<00:00:45.559> are<00:00:46.270> working<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:47.570> hard<00:00:47.690> but

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
teachers are working really hard but

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.889 
teachers are working really hard but
they<00:00:48.320> do<00:00:48.440> have<00:00:48.649> a<00:00:48.710> high<00:00:48.920> burnout<00:00:49.340> rate<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:49.899> so

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
they do have a high burnout rate and so

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.110 
they do have a high burnout rate and so
every<00:00:51.710> three<00:00:52.100> or<00:00:52.190> four<00:00:52.399> years<00:00:52.670> you're<00:00:52.879> kind<00:00:53.059> of

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
every three or four years you're kind of

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.270 
every three or four years you're kind of
recycling<00:00:53.719> a<00:00:54.050> high<00:00:54.469> proportion<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:55.160> your

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
recycling a high proportion of your

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.180 
recycling a high proportion of your
teachers<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:56.780> know<00:00:57.440> there's<00:00:57.860> certainly<00:00:58.129> a

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
teachers and I know there's certainly a

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.010 
teachers and I know there's certainly a
lot<00:00:58.370> there's<00:00:58.760> certainly<00:00:59.390> some<00:00:59.629> people<00:00:59.660> that

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
lot there's certainly some people that

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.740 
lot there's certainly some people that
are<00:01:00.170> concerned<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:01.270> it<00:01:02.270> might<00:01:02.480> ultimately

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
are concerned that it might ultimately

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.070 
are concerned that it might ultimately
affect<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.920> quality<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.399> the<00:01:04.660> education<00:01:05.660> it's

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
affect the quality of the education it's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.140 
affect the quality of the education it's
hard<00:01:06.380> if<00:01:06.590> there's<00:01:07.039> something<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:07.880> has<00:01:08.119> a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
hard if there's something that has a

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.450 
hard if there's something that has a
high<00:01:08.360> burnout<00:01:08.720> rate<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.080> it's<00:01:09.320> hard<00:01:09.530> to

high burnout rate it's it's hard to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.190 
high burnout rate it's it's hard to
build<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:10.760> as<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.060> sustainable<00:01:11.630> model<00:01:11.780> is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
about it I've read several articles one

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.960 
about it I've read several articles one
in<00:01:19.009> particular<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.430> member<00:01:19.670> from<00:01:19.759> New<00:01:19.850> Orleans

in particular a member from New Orleans

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.640 
in particular a member from New Orleans
about<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.570> charter<00:01:20.990> school<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:21.320> was

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
about a charter school that was

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.580 
about a charter school that was
experiencing<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:22.970> issue<00:01:23.210> they<00:01:23.600> had<00:01:23.780> very

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
experiencing this issue they had very

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.539 
experiencing this issue they had very
very<00:01:25.540> highly<00:01:26.540> motivated<00:01:27.229> energetic<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:28.070> and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
very highly motivated energetic and and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.330 
very highly motivated energetic and and
great<00:01:29.060> young<00:01:29.270> teachers<00:01:29.540> but<00:01:30.280> they<00:01:31.280> were

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
great young teachers but they were

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.399 
great young teachers but they were
burning<00:01:31.700> out<00:01:31.790> faster<00:01:32.659> than<00:01:32.810> than<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.259> would

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
burning out faster than than you would

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.270 
burning out faster than than you would
have<00:01:33.500> hoped<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:36.229> thing<00:01:36.710> with<00:01:36.860> charter

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
have hoped and the thing with charter

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.950 
have hoped and the thing with charter
schools<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.850> think<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.360> it's<00:01:38.540> almost<00:01:38.720> too

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
schools I think is that it's almost too

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.260 
schools I think is that it's almost too
new<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.710> say<00:01:40.159> whether<00:01:40.430> or<00:01:40.670> not<00:01:40.820> it's<00:01:41.060> going<00:01:41.210> to

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
new to say whether or not it's going to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.910 
new to say whether or not it's going to
be<00:01:41.329> sustainable<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:42.140> mean<00:01:42.320> here<00:01:42.680> in<00:01:42.770> New<00:01:42.860> York

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
be sustainable I mean here in New York

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.100 
be sustainable I mean here in New York
they've<00:01:43.729> only<00:01:43.880> been<00:01:44.090> around<00:01:44.329> for<00:01:44.570> ten<00:01:44.750> years

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
they've only been around for ten years

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.370 
they've only been around for ten years
so<00:01:45.759> some<00:01:46.759> schools<00:01:47.030> might<00:01:47.420> have<00:01:47.570> cycled

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
so some schools might have cycled

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.840 
so some schools might have cycled
through<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.560> high<00:01:49.009> proportion<00:01:49.430> of<00:01:49.700> their

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
through a high proportion of their

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.370 
through a high proportion of their
teachers<00:01:50.210> but<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.600> think<00:01:50.899> it's<00:01:51.020> going<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.170> take

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
teachers but I think it's going to take

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.130 
teachers but I think it's going to take
another<00:01:51.680> five<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.280> ten<00:01:52.460> years<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.909> see<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:53.630> this

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
another five to ten years to see is this

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.730 
another five to ten years to see is this
kind<00:01:54.470> of<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.710> growing<00:01:54.950> pains<00:01:55.340> thing<00:01:56.119> or<00:01:56.450> or<00:01:57.320> is

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
kind of a growing pains thing or or is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.469
