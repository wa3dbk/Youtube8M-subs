the<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:36.139> chickpeas<00:04:36.500> would<00:04:36.740> pretty<00:04:37.370> much<00:04:37.460> be

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
the the chickpeas would pretty much be

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.689 
the the chickpeas would pretty much be
cooked<00:04:38.030> already<00:04:38.389> being<00:04:38.960> in<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.259> can<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.580> it's

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
cooked already being in the can so it's

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:41.890 
cooked already being in the can so it's
not<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.880> matter<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.210> worrying<00:04:41.570> about<00:04:41.690> that

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900

canned chickpeas for this and this is

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.400 
canned chickpeas for this and this is
one<00:04:44.360> of<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.509> reasons<00:04:44.780> why<00:04:44.930> we're<00:04:45.229> using

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
one of the reasons why we're using

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.920
