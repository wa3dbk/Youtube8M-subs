00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.320 

okay<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.200> pain<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.950> drying<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:33.150> going

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
okay well that pain is drying I'm going

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.160 
okay well that pain is drying I'm going
to<00:01:33.390> start<00:01:33.630> working<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.290> ceiling<00:01:34.710> fan

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
to start working on the ceiling fan

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.810 
to start working on the ceiling fan
ceiling<00:01:37.170> fans<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.909> difficult<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.229> install<00:01:40.820> or

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
ceiling fans not difficult to install or

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880 
ceiling fans not difficult to install or
you<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.149> dealing<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.630> power<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.470> have

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you are dealing with power so you have

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
you are dealing with power so you have
to<00:01:44.009> make<00:01:44.189> sure<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.180> no<00:01:45.360> power

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
to make sure that you have no power

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.490 
to make sure that you have no power
going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.710> warriors<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:51.659> my<00:01:52.049> breakers

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
going to your warriors and my breakers

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.820 
going to your warriors and my breakers
off<00:01:56.270> I've<00:01:57.270> already<00:01:57.600> got<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> bracket<00:01:58.470> screwed

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
off I've already got the bracket screwed

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.020 
off I've already got the bracket screwed
up<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.130> there<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:02.190> planning<00:02:02.700> on

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
up in there and I was planning on

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.169 
up in there and I was planning on
putting<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.420> fan<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.050> so<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.319> have<00:02:04.679> a

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
putting a fan in here so I have a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.960 
putting a fan in here so I have a
support<00:02:06.179> up<00:02:06.390> there<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:08.190> wires<00:02:08.580> already

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
support up there and the wires already

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.759 
support up there and the wires already
run<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.880> should<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.299> quick<00:02:12.780> easy<00:02:13.140> install

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
run so it should be a quick easy install

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:21.740 
run so it should be a quick easy install
here<00:02:16.100> I've<00:02:17.100> got<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> blades<00:02:19.760> all<00:02:20.760> assembled

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
here I've got the blades all assembled

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.080 
here I've got the blades all assembled
here<00:02:21.930> ready<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.739> go<00:02:22.950> up<00:02:25.340> okay<00:02:26.340> with<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.850> fan

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
here ready to go up okay with the fan

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.490 
here ready to go up okay with the fan
hooked<00:02:27.569> up<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:28.640> hanging<00:02:30.140> I'm<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.380> show

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
hooked up here hanging I'm going to show

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.220 
hooked up here hanging I'm going to show
you<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.739> wiring<00:02:32.220> here<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.049> pretty

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
you the wiring here this is pretty

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.740 
you the wiring here this is pretty
simple<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.890> color<00:02:35.070> coded<00:02:36.380> you've<00:02:37.380> got<00:02:38.750> green

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
simple it's color coded you've got green

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.840 
simple it's color coded you've got green
which<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.410> ground<00:02:40.709> those<00:02:41.400> are<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.640> ground

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
which is ground those are the ground

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.150 
which is ground those are the ground
wire

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
wire

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.520 
wire
you<00:02:44.160> got<00:02:44.340> black<00:02:44.640> goes<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> black<00:02:46.170> which<00:02:46.500> is

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you got black goes to the black which is

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.319 
you got black goes to the black which is
the<00:02:46.829> power<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.260> you've<00:02:50.070> got<00:02:50.370> white<00:02:50.790> which<00:02:51.120> is

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
the power and you've got white which is

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.880 
the power and you've got white which is
neutral<00:02:51.690> goes<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.880> white<00:02:53.880> wire<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:57.890> it's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
neutral goes to the white wire so it's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:21.650 
neutral goes to the white wire so it's
fairly<00:02:59.070> simple

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.300 

okay<00:03:22.660> got<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.020> wire<00:03:23.170> nuts<00:03:23.530> on<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.800> wires

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.990 

ready<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.430> put<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.760> cover<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:30.400> fan<00:03:30.610> does

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
ready to put the cover on this fan does

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.770 
ready to put the cover on this fan does
have<00:03:31.510> another<00:03:31.840> blue<00:03:32.170> wire<00:03:32.410> here<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:34.600> is

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
have another blue wire here and that is

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.580 
have another blue wire here and that is
for<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.220> light<00:03:36.900> I'm<00:03:37.900> not<00:03:38.170> going<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.410> use

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
for the the light I'm not going to use

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.960 
for the the light I'm not going to use
the<00:03:38.770> light<00:03:38.950> I'm<00:03:39.130> just<00:03:39.340> going<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.520> put<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.700> cap

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
the light I'm just going to put a cap

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.130 
the light I'm just going to put a cap
here<00:03:41.730> because<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.270> ceiling<00:03:43.690> height<00:03:43.900> I

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
here because of the ceiling height I

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.020 
here because of the ceiling height I
don't<00:03:44.350> want<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.800> light<00:03:44.980> sticking<00:03:45.459> down<00:03:45.610> I'd

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
don't want the light sticking down I'd

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.240 
don't want the light sticking down I'd
rather<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.840> be<00:03:46.900> up<00:03:47.140> further<00:03:47.380> so<00:03:47.860> that's<00:03:48.100> what

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
rather it be up further so that's what
