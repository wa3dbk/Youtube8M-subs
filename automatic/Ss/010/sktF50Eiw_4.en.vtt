00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
is not gonna have anything to stick to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.890 
is not gonna have anything to stick to
shiny<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.980> slippery<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.700> paint<00:02:45.480> doesn't<00:02:45.660> like

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.120 
slippery Pena has to stick to something
that's<00:02:50.519> why<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.850> use<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> mildly<00:02:51.569> abrasive

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
that's why you use a mildly abrasive

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.539 
that's why you use a mildly abrasive
scuffing<00:02:53.130> pad<00:02:54.200> pretty<00:02:55.200> much<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.310> paint

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
scuffing pad pretty much so the paint

can have something to adhere to just

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.009 
can have something to adhere to just
think<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:01.880> scuffing<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.209> little<00:03:03.750> tiny

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
think is scuffing it is little tiny

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.130
