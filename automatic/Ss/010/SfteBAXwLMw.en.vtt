00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 and then people here said Peter and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.980
 welcome more video here on the channel 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.390
 of the games is doing its part in 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.799
 I'll start right away just to warn you that 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.570
 it's a video as much as different them 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.040
 common on the brazilian channel subscribed more 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.200
 you will remember that I made a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 video then spoke of the start before 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 consoles and everything else that really made me 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.900
 accompanies you know that I made a video on 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.980
 another channel that never bug that talking 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.980
 the luck of the consoles 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.570
 'both videos focus neither showing 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.360
 tatsuo the very focus is to show the evolution 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.370
 chips from the oldest to the most 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.809
 recent I'll get this idea is 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.610
 transform a single frame framework 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.620
 shows evolution of something let's 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.370
 have a game the evolution of a console and 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.839
 everything else 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.850
 this is already the first video where I will go 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.670
 show evolution in the film franchise 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.280
 then you tell jealous now there speaks 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.769
 It's going to be routines on youtube. 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.050
 the support and I came to present this 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.780
 video for you since the tac that does not 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.449
 could once again by the stump reasons 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.449
 while I have called you 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.009
 little girls said that because this mix is 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.920
 little girl thing 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:11.140
 But let's start the video with the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.140
 evolution of game introductions 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.720
 the place 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.510
 to roll 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.430
 ae 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.800

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
 Hmm 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.350

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.780

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.780

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.360
 So people, I'm still here and 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.360
