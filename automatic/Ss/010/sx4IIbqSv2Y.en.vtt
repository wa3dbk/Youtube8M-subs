told<00:01:59.609> me<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.909> about<00:01:59.939> these<00:02:00.389> parts<00:02:01.039> you<00:02:02.039> know

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
told me all about these parts you know

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.289 
told me all about these parts you know
look<00:02:02.249> can<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.459> look<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.729> hood<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:02.999> let's<00:02:03.179> take

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
look can we look the hood up let's take

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.330 
look can we look the hood up let's take
a<00:02:03.329> look<00:02:03.569> at<00:02:03.719> what<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.740> looks<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:05.039> what

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
a look at what it all looks like what

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.230 
a look at what it all looks like what
it's<00:02:05.459> all<00:02:05.579> together<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:06.539> a<00:02:06.569> problem

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
it's all together not a problem

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.870 
it's all together not a problem
so<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.710> has<00:02:09.890> our<00:02:10.040> full<00:02:10.190> exhaust<00:02:10.490> system<00:02:10.820> you

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
so this has our full exhaust system you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.700 
so this has our full exhaust system you
know<00:02:10.940> it's<00:02:11.030> got<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> y-pipe<00:02:11.570> single<00:02:12.110> pipe<00:02:12.290> it's

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
know it's got a y-pipe single pipe it's

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.380 
know it's got a y-pipe single pipe it's
going<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.980> our<00:02:13.100> lightweight<00:02:13.370> mufflers<00:02:13.790> just

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
going of our lightweight mufflers just

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.160 
going of our lightweight mufflers just
like<00:02:14.510> all<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.750> our<00:02:14.810> other<00:02:14.900> lightweight

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
like all of our other lightweight

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.660 
like all of our other lightweight
mufflers<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.770> offers<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.070> little<00:02:16.370> bit<00:02:16.490> deeper

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
mufflers it offers a little bit deeper

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.920 
mufflers it offers a little bit deeper
throw<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.060> your<00:02:17.210> sound<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:17.780> still

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
throw to your sound but it's still

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.030 
throw to your sound but it's still
reasonable<00:02:18.470> it's<00:02:18.560> not<00:02:18.710> something<00:02:18.980> that's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
reasonable it's not something that's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
reasonable it's not something that's
gonna<00:02:19.220> get<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.490> in<00:02:19.580> trouble<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:19.940> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
gonna get you in trouble with the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.820 
gonna get you in trouble with the
authorities<00:02:20.090> things<00:02:20.750> like<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.110> gonna<00:02:21.710> be

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
authorities things like that gonna be

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.530 
authorities things like that gonna be
trail<00:02:22.070> safe<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.670> biggest<00:02:23.000> most<00:02:23.150> important

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
trail safe the biggest most important

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.820 
trail safe the biggest most important
part<00:02:23.750> would<00:02:23.900> probably<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.320> cylinders<00:02:24.680> on

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
part would probably be the cylinders on

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.550 
part would probably be the cylinders on
this<00:02:24.980> kit<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.750> cylinders<00:02:27.110> appear<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.470> be

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
this kit the cylinders appear to be

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.170 
this kit the cylinders appear to be
stock<00:02:27.800> that's<00:02:28.400> because<00:02:28.730> they're<00:02:28.850> just<00:02:28.970> uh

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
stock that's because they're just uh

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.990 
stock that's because they're just uh
they're<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> stock<00:02:29.870> 700<00:02:30.800> whether<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.700> be<00:02:31.790> fire

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
they're a stock 700 whether it be fire

CNC we poured them in our CNC shop just

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.270 
CNC we poured them in our CNC shop just
to<00:02:41.390> ensure<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.750> every<00:02:42.740> cylinder<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.160> goes

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
to ensure that every cylinder that goes

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.280 
to ensure that every cylinder that goes

out the door is the same yeah your
quality<00:02:45.650> controls<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.250> great<00:02:46.490> then<00:02:46.700> exactly

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
quality controls is great then exactly

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.790 
quality controls is great then exactly
it's<00:02:47.510> not<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:47.930> not<00:02:48.140> all<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.530> one<00:02:48.680> was

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
it's not you know not all that one was

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.740 
it's not you know not all that one was
bored<00:02:49.040> too<00:02:49.130> good<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.310> one<00:02:49.550> was<00:02:49.640> bored<00:02:49.880> bad<00:02:50.120> we

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
bored too good that one was bored bad we

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.300 
bored too good that one was bored bad we
we<00:02:51.020> have<00:02:51.140> control<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.740> by<00:02:51.890> doing<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.220> via

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
we have control of that by doing it via

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.530 
we have control of that by doing it via

the<00:02:53.780> other<00:02:53.900> great<00:02:54.080> thing<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.320> we<00:02:54.530> do<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.770> we

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the other great thing that we do is we

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.740 
the other great thing that we do is we
use<00:02:55.040> an<00:02:55.220> actual<00:02:55.460> stock<00:02:55.790> artic<00:02:56.240> cat<00:02:56.270> cast

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750
