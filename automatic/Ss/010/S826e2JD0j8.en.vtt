00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.930
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.220
 Hmm 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.970

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.970
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:23.090
 Yes Hello, my name is Nakajima a 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:28.369
 It's been a long time, so when I give you a video every time , I 'm feeling the first grade, but how is it 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.150
 About 10 days is as a professor does not advance or Once I have entered it going or up every day 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.880
 Although I 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.030
 Oh yes I'm going to go yes 8 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:43.160
 I bought a microphone 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.950
 I bought a microphone to get a sound on the pc 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 It is here Sony pc microphone 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.570
 The product called electret condenser microphone bcm pcv 80 u 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:02.130
 I want to introduce 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:06.510
 Yes, it looks like it always opens up and floats like it was like taking vinyl 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.970
 The box is cool It is a feeling of luxury and soft feeling 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.840
 Yes 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.050
 It is more than what is contained in the manual rewards room 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:20.320
 This is the main body of the microphone 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:24.430
 It will be the microphone stand of the table like this when assembled It comes with this one 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.740
 So here's usb and why it feels like usb 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.310
 Here 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.290
 Here to the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.520
 There is also a model number in the so-called usb audio box and uab 80 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.020
 It is said 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.480
 You can see this here right here 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.840
 It is usb and insert the mini usb 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.110
 here 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:53.850
 Mike and a thread 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:58.770
 I will pierce the face of the speaker or the headphone that I 'll let you say so from that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:02.820
 That can be connected with sb flow to the personal computer in the human usb 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.100
 It is a box, and the contents are all by this 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:12.640
 I bought a microphone at the Nanyo Show 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:16.640
 I'd like to do an audio test as soon as it's too boring to return . 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:22.990
 This time , connect to pc and pc's 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.990
 I would like to record one hobby in that while capturing the screen 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:32.859
 I am-now Sony's condenser microphone 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.680
 I'm recording using a pcv 80 u microphone 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:42.620
 I said while doing a catcher in the video just before Tico. 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:49.159
 Right now this does not become the recording while capture 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:54.050
 8 You can use the software called Sony music acid to record microphones normally 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:56.550
 The sound has been brought in to that state to 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.820
 8 That 's right 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.860
 I 'm using the audio box audio box 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.990
 I prepared the best sound I could do the most 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.040
 so 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.850
 The 3.5mm jack is locked on with a usb connection instead of being directly inserted. 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.540
 I will 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.549
 What do you think 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.549
 Is the sound beautiful? 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:31.390
 Yes Well it has been locked on now 3.5 mm jack Toshimashite comparison 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.050
 How is it? I feel that the upper index is riding quite 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.890
 However 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:46.280
 Basically , 3.5 mm if you want to live and live while the live broadcast or its bgm 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:52.100
 The most preferred to do in a state in which the insert the jack and easy to do or say has been said is 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.760
 It is said that I think that the sound quality will be in this state, just an ordinary microphone 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.040
 More than 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.610
 Wonder 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:03.360
 I wonder if it's going to be beautiful 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:07.080
 bgm Toka those who are after the game play-by-play will come piled up its its leave another bgm 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.170
 Because I do not care about noise unexpectedly 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.120
 That 's all right 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.880
 I think that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:21.900
 This just talking and narrating like this while narrating bgm behind 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:27.510
 You may be worried about the noise method if you can not ride anything 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.220
 Well, even if it is within the allowable range, we can not connect usb after all. 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.620
 Yes 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.250
 If you are worried about it, don't use the audio interface to get rid of noise 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.490
 a little 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:42.510
 It may be better to raise the microphone volume 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.830
 I'm just 3.5 mm 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.300
 How do you do the sound quality test 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.599
 I wonder how it was. 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:05:01.320
 Isn't it quite easy to take a picture 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:03.740
 Is this Mike the people who are watching this video have this movie 's video title now ? 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.750
 How much banned 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.700
 I think that there are a lot of people who think that it takes a while before pcv 80 u robin 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.150
 is not it 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:19.960
 If you are doing everyone on youtube or someone else, maybe half 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:24.700
 Are you or I thought I wonder if not that this mic I 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:30.430
 Many people say that this microphone is good no matter where you look, and you are using this microphone at sunset 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:33.729
 I think that I will not miss it 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:39.400
 I have chosen the most selected one 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:45.610
 But if it's a fault , the stand will come true 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.889
 Those that can not be adjusted in what little can not be adjusted even this I'm either as low as about bonus 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.800
 Because 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:54.880
 This is a bit lower for the tabletop 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.569
 Put it on the desk and put it on 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.169
 Even if I aim 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:08.560
 This in turn hit here but quite Mukundesu 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:12.370
 A considerable I is Tsukun burden to the action I Do not put this little burden so much is the 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.860
 Where we want this time of the angle in the multiplying Yet 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:23.510
 A little of'd end with a here 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:25.090
 Dear I think the design Khan at the time this was thought Naa short a little 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:31.270
 it's here 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:33.360
 I would like to introduce this video in the next video So thank you for watching everyone 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.360
 The
