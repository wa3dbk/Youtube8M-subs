00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.880 
and the back with the design paper I
added<00:04:23.640> a<00:04:23.790> silver<00:04:24.450> extra<00:04:24.870> large<00:04:25.080> eyelet<00:04:25.590> and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
added a silver extra large eyelet and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.090 
added a silver extra large eyelet and
then<00:04:26.220> added<00:04:26.550> some<00:04:26.580> seam<00:04:27.000> binding<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:28.100> then

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
then added some seam binding and then

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.910 
then added some seam binding and then
this<00:04:29.790> was<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.030> die<00:04:30.360> cut<00:04:30.660> from<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.410> pack<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.800> was

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
this was a die cut from the pack it was

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.540 
this was a die cut from the pack it was
a<00:04:31.950> cake<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:33.180> added<00:04:33.420> those<00:04:34.250> white<00:04:35.250> flat

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
a cake and I added those white flat

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.140 
a cake and I added those white flat
flowers<00:04:36.380> around<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.590> cake<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.760> I'd<00:04:38.910> loved

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
flowers around the cake and I'd loved

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.680 
flowers around the cake and I'd loved
how<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.360> came<00:04:39.720> out<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.230> then<00:04:40.920> I<00:04:41.010> added<00:04:41.690> these

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
how it came out and then I added these

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.070 
how it came out and then I added these
pieces<00:04:43.220> again<00:04:44.220> from<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.610> die<00:04:44.760> cut<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.720> piece

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
pieces again from the die cut this piece

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.960 
pieces again from the die cut this piece
right<00:04:46.230> here<00:04:46.290> was<00:04:46.530> actually<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.920> flower<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.610> just

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
right here was actually a flower I just

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.840 
right here was actually a flower I just
cut<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.180> apart<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.960> make<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.980> as<00:04:50.160> if<00:04:50.490> it's<00:04:50.640> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
cut it apart and make it as if it's the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.010 
cut it apart and make it as if it's the
tray<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.900> cake<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:53.210> then<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.600> put<00:04:54.810> two

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
tray of the cake and then I put two

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.380 
then again it fits right into the pillow
box<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.750> then<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.870> closes<00:05:04.050> like<00:05:04.470> this<00:05:05.330> it's<00:05:06.330> a

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390
