range<00:01:36.929> and<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.319> have<00:01:37.410> to<00:01:37.500> start<00:01:37.709> over<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.009> then

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
range and I have to start over and then

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.279 
range and I have to start over and then
it<00:01:38.220> kills<00:01:38.429> me<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.539> spawn<00:01:39.869> I'm<00:01:40.020> trying<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
it kills me then I spawn I'm trying to

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.479 
it kills me then I spawn I'm trying to
figure<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.470> where<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.709> is<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.830> then<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.399> it

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:41.489 
figure out where it is and then there it

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:43.490 
figure out where it is and then there it
is<00:01:41.580> so<00:01:41.819> but<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.569> can<00:01:42.660> see<00:01:42.810> i<00:01:42.840> am<00:01:42.929> hacking<00:01:43.410> it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
is so but as you can see i am hacking it

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.499 
is so but as you can see i am hacking it
from<00:01:43.619> quite<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.489> know<00:01:44.580> far<00:01:44.940> distance<00:01:45.360> away

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
from quite a you know far distance away

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.210 
from quite a you know far distance away
and<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.170> shooting<00:01:46.619> at<00:01:46.709> me<00:01:46.890> because<00:01:47.009> i'm

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and it's not shooting at me because i'm

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.419 
and it's not shooting at me because i'm
a<00:01:47.250> little<00:01:47.759> far<00:01:48.030> away<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> basically<00:01:49.830> it's<00:01:50.340> just

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
a little far away so basically it's just

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.650 
a little far away so basically it's just
like<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> launcher<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.270> fact<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
like a launcher and the fact that it

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.320 
like a launcher and the fact that it
takes<00:01:51.810> two<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.380> take<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.069> a<00:01:53.099> chopper<00:01:53.640> it'll

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
takes two to take out a chopper it'll

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.969 
takes two to take out a chopper it'll
take<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.989> take<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.289> it<00:01:55.410> like<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> sentry

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
take one to take out it like a sentry

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.350 
take one to take out it like a sentry
gun<00:01:56.160> or<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> guardian<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:56.880> something<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.239> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
gun or a guardian or something as you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.910 
gun or a guardian or something as you
can<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.840> i'm<00:01:58.020> trying<00:01:58.410> to<00:01:58.619> hack<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
can see here i'm trying to hack the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.680 
can see here i'm trying to hack the
sentry<00:01:59.280> gun<00:01:59.429> through<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.940> but<00:02:00.300> i<00:02:00.330> think<00:02:00.569> it's

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
sentry gun through here but i think it's

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.969 
sentry gun through here but i think it's
kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.080> through<00:02:01.200> two<00:02:01.679> different

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
kind of going through two different

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.469 
kind of going through two different
surfaces<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.910> maybe<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.270> what's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
surfaces and maybe that's what's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.449 
surfaces and maybe that's what's
blocking<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.080> once<00:02:04.530> i<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:04.830> out<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.280> i'm

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
blocking it once i get out here i'm

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.190 
blocking it once i get out here i'm
still<00:02:05.879> a<00:02:05.940> pretty<00:02:06.179> safe<00:02:06.479> distance<00:02:06.959> away<00:02:07.080> from

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
still a pretty safe distance away from

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.930 
still a pretty safe distance away from
it<00:02:07.500> can't<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.220> me<00:02:08.369> or<00:02:08.489> anything<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
it can't see me or anything like that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390 
it can't see me or anything like that
and<00:02:09.330> i<00:02:09.720> take<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> century<00:02:10.560> gun<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and i take out the century gun but the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.430 
and i take out the century gun but the
problem<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> does<00:02:12.510> take<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> while<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
problem is is it does take a while to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.130 
problem is is it does take a while to
actually<00:02:13.590> hack<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.660> it's<00:02:15.660> kind<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.959> not

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
actually hack it so it's kind of not

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.720 
actually hack it so it's kind of not
really<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.530> great<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.950> my<00:02:17.069> opinion<00:02:17.099> as<00:02:17.580> far

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
really that great in my opinion as far

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.820 
really that great in my opinion as far
as<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:18.000> goes<00:02:18.060> when<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> EMP<00:02:19.349> grenade<00:02:19.650> will

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
as that goes when the EMP grenade will

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.680 
as that goes when the EMP grenade will
take<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.160> out<00:02:20.250> really<00:02:20.610> quickly<00:02:20.849> plus<00:02:21.480> it'll

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
take it out really quickly plus it'll

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.960 
take it out really quickly plus it'll
EMP<00:02:22.230> any<00:02:22.410> nearby<00:02:22.709> enemies<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.849> can

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
EMP any nearby enemies and as you can

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.910 
EMP any nearby enemies and as you can
see<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.209> EMP<00:02:24.599> lasts<00:02:25.020> for<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> pretty<00:02:25.410> decent

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
see the EMP lasts for a pretty decent

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.580 
see the EMP lasts for a pretty decent
amount<00:02:26.129> of<00:02:26.250> time<00:02:26.599> I'm<00:02:27.599> waiting<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.989> heal<00:02:28.290> here

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
amount of time I'm waiting to heal here

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.500 
amount of time I'm waiting to heal here
so<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:28.769> can<00:02:28.890> pull<00:02:29.129> out<00:02:29.219> the<00:02:29.370> Guardian<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.879> test

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
so I can pull out the Guardian and test

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.930 
so I can pull out the Guardian and test
the<00:02:31.230> EMP<00:02:31.650> grenade<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.159> the<00:02:32.310> Guardian

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the EMP grenade on the Guardian

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.520 
the EMP grenade on the Guardian
and<00:02:33.300> as<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.570> can<00:02:33.720> see<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.050> will<00:02:34.140> take<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.440> out

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and as you can see it will take it out

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.370 
and as you can see it will take it out
in<00:02:34.710> one<00:02:34.950> EMP<00:02:35.760> grenade<00:02:36.090> as<00:02:36.210> well<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.870> basically

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
in one EMP grenade as well so basically

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.110 
in one EMP grenade as well so basically
the<00:02:37.500> conclusion<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.070> I've<00:02:38.250> come<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.090> that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the conclusion that I've come to is that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.240 
the conclusion that I've come to is that
the<00:02:39.450> black<00:02:39.630> hat<00:02:39.870> PDA<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.800> only<00:02:41.010> useful

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the black hat PDA really is only useful

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.510 
the black hat PDA really is only useful
for<00:02:41.490> taking<00:02:42.000> out<00:02:42.150> air<00:02:42.390> support<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.190> don't

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
for taking out air support if you don't

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.460 
for taking out air support if you don't
want<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> run<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.240> launcher<00:02:45.720> as<00:02:45.840> your<00:02:45.990> secondary

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
want to run a launcher as your secondary

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.560 
want to run a launcher as your secondary
like<00:02:46.770> say<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.010> actually<00:02:47.460> run<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> cap<00:02:48.210> 40

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
like say you actually run like a cap 40

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.460 
like say you actually run like a cap 40
or<00:02:48.690> something<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.110> for<00:02:49.380> your

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
or something like that for your

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.010 
or something like that for your
secondary<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.190> don't<00:02:50.430> want<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.900> know

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
secondary and you don't want to you know

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.800 
secondary and you don't want to you know
change<00:02:52.860> out<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.520> secondary<00:02:54.060> for<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> launcher

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
change out that secondary for a launcher

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.690 
change out that secondary for a launcher
or<00:02:54.840> something<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.350> could<00:02:55.620> swap<00:02:55.920> out<00:02:56.100> while

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
or something you could swap out while

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.580 
or something you could swap out while
your<00:02:56.880> tactical<00:02:57.300> slot<00:02:57.570> for<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.750> black<00:02:57.990> hat<00:02:58.200> PDA

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
your tactical slot for the black hat PDA

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.340 
your tactical slot for the black hat PDA
and<00:02:58.890> take<00:02:59.340> out<00:02:59.490> air<00:02:59.700> support<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.080> can

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
and take out air support and you can

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.840 
and take out air support and you can
take<00:03:01.620> out<00:03:01.740> sentry<00:03:02.100> guns<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.460> stuff<00:03:02.520> with<00:03:02.820> it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
take out sentry guns and stuff with it

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.640 
take out sentry guns and stuff with it
as<00:03:03.030> well<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.600> as<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:03.960> see<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.230> EMP

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
as well but as you can see the EMP

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.230 
as well but as you can see the EMP
grained<00:03:04.890> was<00:03:05.070> much<00:03:05.340> faster<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.910> you're<00:03:06.120> not

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
grained was much faster and you're not

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.640 
grained was much faster and you're not
just<00:03:06.450> sitting<00:03:06.600> there<00:03:06.750> holding<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.320> thing<00:03:07.500> in

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
just sitting there holding that thing in

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.170 
just sitting there holding that thing in
your<00:03:07.770> hand<00:03:07.860> vulnerable<00:03:08.460> to<00:03:08.580> enemy<00:03:08.700> shooting

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
your hand vulnerable to enemy shooting

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.800 
your hand vulnerable to enemy shooting
you<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.480> back<00:03:09.690> or<00:03:09.930> things<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.770> so

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
you in the back or things like that so

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.630 
you in the back or things like that so
like<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.930> said<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.260> black<00:03:13.590> hat<00:03:13.770> PDA<00:03:14.070> is<00:03:14.160> not<00:03:14.370> bad

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
like I said the black hat PDA is not bad

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.450 
like I said the black hat PDA is not bad
but<00:03:14.970> really<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.720> don't<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.260> too<00:03:16.710> much<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.250> use

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
but really I don't see too much of a use

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.340 
but really I don't see too much of a use
for<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:18.030> think<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.510> EMP<00:03:18.870> grenades<00:03:19.200> are

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
for it I think the EMP grenades are

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.380 
for it I think the EMP grenades are
better<00:03:19.560> as<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.310> whole<00:03:20.670> obviously<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.150> can't

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
better as a whole obviously you can't

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.090 
better as a whole obviously you can't
take<00:03:21.540> out<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> helicopter<00:03:22.230> with<00:03:22.320> EMP<00:03:22.740> grenades

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
take out a helicopter with EMP grenades

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.780 
take out a helicopter with EMP grenades
but<00:03:23.700> that's<00:03:24.690> kind<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.020> bottom<00:03:25.290> line<00:03:25.500> there

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
but that's kind of the bottom line there

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.580 
but that's kind of the bottom line there
the<00:03:26.790> EMP<00:03:27.180> grenades<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.600> think<00:03:27.840> are<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.380> much

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
the EMP grenades I think are a much

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.050 
the EMP grenades I think are a much
better<00:03:28.830> bet<00:03:29.040> for<00:03:29.070> taking<00:03:29.490> out<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.730> sentry

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
better bet for taking out the sentry

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.430 
better bet for taking out the sentry
guns<00:03:30.240> and<00:03:30.420> Guardians<00:03:30.810> as<00:03:30.960> opposed<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.350> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
guns and Guardians as opposed to the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.800 
guns and Guardians as opposed to the
black<00:03:31.620> hat<00:03:31.830> PDA<00:03:32.190> would<00:03:32.490> be<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.450> basically

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
black hat PDA would be so basically

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.910 
black hat PDA would be so basically
that's<00:03:33.960> just<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.320> know<00:03:34.410> some<00:03:34.590> information

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
that's just you know some information

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.260 
that's just you know some information

decipher you know what you want to use

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.320 
decipher you know what you want to use
or<00:03:38.190> how<00:03:38.280> you'd<00:03:38.459> want<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.730> use<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:39.090> things

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
or how you'd want to use it in things

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.760 
or how you'd want to use it in things
like<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.720> but<00:03:39.900> that's<00:03:40.020> just<00:03:40.080> kind<00:03:40.739> of

like that but that's just kind of
