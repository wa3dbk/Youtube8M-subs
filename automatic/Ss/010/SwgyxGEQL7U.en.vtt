more computer updates in the future or
gaming<00:05:00.280> gaming<00:05:01.870> benchmarks<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.020> stuff<00:05:03.260> but<00:05:03.590> i

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
gaming gaming benchmarks and stuff but i

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.650 
gaming gaming benchmarks and stuff but i
like<00:05:05.389> the<00:05:05.570> graphics<00:05:06.050> card<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.800> only<00:05:06.979> thing<00:05:07.220> is

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
like the graphics card the only thing is

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.790 
like the graphics card the only thing is
is<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:09.190> when<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.430> kick<00:05:10.789> it<00:05:10.910> in<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.800> volume

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
is the when you kick it in the volume

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.150 
is the when you kick it in the volume
kicks<00:05:13.370> up<00:05:14.020> like<00:05:15.020> right<00:05:15.530> now<00:05:15.710> it's<00:05:15.889> probably

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
kicks up like right now it's probably

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.779 
kicks up like right now it's probably
like<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.340> forty-eight<00:05:16.970> percent<00:05:17.150> let's<00:05:18.789> stick

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
like a forty-eight percent let's stick

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:20.990 
like a forty-eight percent let's stick
this<00:05:19.910> up

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
this up

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.280

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
it kicked in and it's not that that's

00:05:51.060 --> 00:06:00.690 
it kicked in and it's not that that's
acceptable<00:05:51.750> loud<00:05:52.380> right<00:05:52.860> now<00:05:56.150> now

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.110

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
and that's a little bit of vibration I

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.910 
and that's a little bit of vibration I
don't<00:06:07.120> know<00:06:07.180> if<00:06:07.390> it's<00:06:07.570> a<00:06:07.800> imbalance<00:06:08.800> or

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
don't know if it's a imbalance or

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.100 
don't know if it's a imbalance or
something<00:06:09.310> but<00:06:09.760> at<00:06:09.940> sixty<00:06:10.330> percent<00:06:10.480> it<00:06:10.870> has<00:06:11.080> a

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
something but at sixty percent it has a

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.940 
something but at sixty percent it has a
little<00:06:11.350> bit<00:06:11.500> of<00:06:11.560> a<00:06:13.560> little<00:06:14.670> frequency<00:06:15.670> issue

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
little bit of a little frequency issue

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:25.900 
little bit of a little frequency issue
and

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.660

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
and you can hear the frequency there's

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.640 
and you can hear the frequency there's
something<00:06:29.120> there<00:06:29.960> has<00:06:30.170> to<00:06:30.320> be<00:06:30.380> something

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
something there has to be something

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.850 
something there has to be something
rattling<00:06:31.070> in<00:06:31.430> there<00:06:31.610> but<00:06:32.000> I<00:06:32.380> think<00:06:33.380> for<00:06:33.530> out

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
rattling in there but I think for out

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.730 
rattling in there but I think for out
it's<00:06:34.370> sometimes<00:06:35.030> other<00:06:35.270> time<00:06:35.510> when<00:06:36.380> you<00:06:36.500> hit

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
it's sometimes other time when you hit

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.410 
it's sometimes other time when you hit
different<00:06:37.220> frequencies<00:06:37.730> so<00:06:37.850> i<00:06:37.940> can<00:06:38.180> let<00:06:38.300> it

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
different frequencies so i can let it

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.020 
different frequencies so i can let it
start<00:06:41.590> yeah<00:06:42.590> you<00:06:42.920> can<00:06:43.100> that's<00:06:43.370> that's

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
start yeah you can that's that's

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.630 
start yeah you can that's that's
slightly<00:06:44.360> annoying<00:06:44.780> but<00:06:45.290> it<00:06:45.800> never<00:06:46.250> gets<00:06:46.460> that

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
slightly annoying but it never gets that

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:54.570 
slightly annoying but it never gets that
high<00:06:47.710> let's<00:06:48.710> do<00:06:48.860> 81<00:06:51.640> now<00:06:52.640> it<00:06:53.090> went<00:06:53.270> quieter<00:06:53.810> you

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
high let's do 81 now it went quieter you

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.280 
high let's do 81 now it went quieter you
one<00:06:55.580> faster<00:06:56.090> but<00:06:56.270> it<00:06:56.300> went<00:06:56.570> quieter<00:06:56.960> it's<00:06:57.170> a

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
one faster but it went quieter it's a

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.500 
one faster but it went quieter it's a
frequency<00:06:57.890> problem<00:06:58.340> that's<00:06:58.730> the<00:06:58.880> only<00:06:59.150> thing

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
frequency problem that's the only thing

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.650 
frequency problem that's the only thing
I'm<00:06:59.720> hearing<00:07:00.500> you<00:07:00.740> can<00:07:01.610> hear<00:07:01.820> it<00:07:01.940> go<00:07:02.150> faster

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660 
I'm hearing you can hear it go faster

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.290 
I'm hearing you can hear it go faster
but<00:07:04.240> there's<00:07:05.240> just<00:07:05.300> a<00:07:05.480> frequency<00:07:06.020> issue<00:07:07.300> she

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
but there's just a frequency issue she

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.380 
but there's just a frequency issue she
had<00:07:08.390> to<00:07:08.510> be<00:07:09.130> I've<00:07:10.130> never<00:07:10.370> heard<00:07:10.640> my<00:07:10.820> fan<00:07:11.060> get<00:07:11.270> up

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.390 
had to be I've never heard my fan get up

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:17.410 
had to be I've never heard my fan get up
that<00:07:11.570> high<00:07:14.170> hey<00:07:15.820> now<00:07:16.820> you<00:07:16.880> can<00:07:17.090> hear<00:07:17.270> the

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.420 
that high hey now you can hear the

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.480 
that high hey now you can hear the
frequency<00:07:17.960> go<00:07:18.110> up<00:07:18.230> again<00:07:18.560> on<00:07:18.680> the<00:07:19.430> rattle<00:07:19.990> as

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490 
frequency go up again on the rattle as

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:29.310 
frequency go up again on the rattle as
200

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.800 

I<00:07:29.500> need<00:07:30.190> a<00:07:30.250> double<00:07:30.910> check<00:07:31.150> if<00:07:31.510> there's

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
I need a double check if there's

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.800 
I need a double check if there's
something<00:07:32.140> that's<00:07:32.530> rattling<00:07:33.220> that's<00:07:33.810> causing

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810 
something that's rattling that's causing

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.730 
something that's rattling that's causing
it<00:07:34.930> or<00:07:34.960> is<00:07:35.290> it<00:07:35.440> the<00:07:35.620> fans<00:07:35.890> themselves<00:07:36.250> but
