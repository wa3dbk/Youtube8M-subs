here<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> GE<00:00:11.179> Philips<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:13.080> Sylvania

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
here we have a GE Philips and a Sylvania

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.340 
here we have a GE Philips and a Sylvania
and<00:00:13.910> we'll<00:00:14.910> start<00:00:15.210> off<00:00:15.360> right<00:00:15.570> now<00:00:15.719> with<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
and we'll start off right now with the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.510 
and we'll start off right now with the
GE<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:17.119> don't<00:00:18.119> really<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.750> GE<00:00:18.960> ones<00:00:19.520> they

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
GE I don't really like the GE ones they

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.060 
GE I don't really like the GE ones they
don't<00:00:20.730> work<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.119> too<00:00:21.420> well

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
don't work out too well

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.620 
don't work out too well
I'll<00:00:23.070> shut<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> light<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.119> get<00:00:24.330> started

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
I'll shut off the light and get started

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.440 
I'll shut off the light and get started
with<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.019> show<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.039> go<00:00:31.790> these<00:00:32.790> GE<00:00:33.090> ones

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
with the show here we go these GE ones

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.510 
with the show here we go these GE ones
are<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.200> good<00:00:36.860> they<00:00:37.860> put<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> lot<00:00:38.340> of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
are just not good they put a lot of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.450 
are just not good they put a lot of
stress<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.120> those<00:00:39.329> electrodes<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.460> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
stress on those electrodes and the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
stress on those electrodes and the
starters<00:00:41.910> are<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.210> too<00:00:42.420> good<00:00:42.660> either<00:00:44.480> just

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
starters are not too good either just

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.369 
starters are not too good either just
just<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.020> good<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:48.539> take<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.960> one

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
just not good so we will take that one

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.240 
just not good so we will take that one
out<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.960> put<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.940> Philips<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.530> they

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
out and put in the Philips this one they

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.990 
out and put in the Philips this one they
glued<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.390> tubes<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.949> part<00:00:59.309> slanted

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
glued the tubes on to this part slanted

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.560 
glued the tubes on to this part slanted
so<00:01:01.010> there<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> go<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.969> slanted

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
so there you go you can see it's slanted

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.880 
so there you go you can see it's slanted
and<00:01:03.949> here<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.040> go<00:01:09.200> somewhat<00:01:10.200> blink<00:01:10.470> happy<00:01:10.860> I
