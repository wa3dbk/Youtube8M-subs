00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.270
 hello everyone, you have n't done that for a long time 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.150
 that i shoot myself on iphone because 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.270
 Logia, in principle, do not take off or do 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.220
 very rare here but by the way 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.930
 asked to even remove the vlog because 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.690
 Apparently people like Vloga 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.699
 only I'm not taking it off but I thought 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.949
 why not you can remove the vlog at least 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.300
 for a change but today is a weekend 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.879
 Sunday 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.550
 and I just came from grocery 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.460
 the store to buy ingredients for 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.520
 Cookies decided just the same here as 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.590
 I bake teaching to remove the recipe by the way 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.809
 not mine of course not mine firstly what 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.579
 nikulin me what the second because 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.820
 I saw this recipe 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.960
 Anand and he is not very pleased with the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.090
 tom he is light 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.500
 remember this and fast remember this and 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.840
 let's actually start to bake ours 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.030
 cookies we need three ingredients 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.259
 The first is for the sake of peanut butter 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.369
 whom and went very far but i 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.170
 still drank it of course second course 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.140
 sugar because it is a cookie without 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.190
 sugar sharply yes there is probably 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.140
 probably here's a chain my dog ​​barks and 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.080
 the third is one egg and all this is needed 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.410
 mix right now with you mix 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.759
 hey well that means we moved 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.940
 to the table and 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:37.720
 we need a bowl then a cup which 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.920
 I'm not here so I took a mug of it 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.039
 wax knife egg sugar and peanut butter 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.610
 and you can't even imagine i'm shooting everything 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:53.070
 it is on the iphone of course that block 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.500
 but what kind of tripod how do I say 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.560
 just built it just 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:06.060
 see so now for starters take sugar and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.649
 a mug and we need to spoonful of sugar in 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.690
 general sugar you now need a good cup 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.760
 go we will all interfere now we need 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.070
 peanut butter and also a glass in my 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.760
 case of the handler but if you will do 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:31.200
 better with a glass is that and above were 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:34.920
 it is exactly stacks the pancake smells very tasty 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.510
 but in short I have a peanut allergy and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.550
 In general, today I want so much 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.780
 be productive enough in terms of 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.620
 to shoot some videos for sure 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.390
 I will shoot today 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.880
 conversational videos because I already have 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.820
 there are some ideas well here i am reading the same and 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:59.870
 there are no banks and the tour is somehow not enough 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.870
 put on a share is enough 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.170
 now all this needs to be shifted to sugar 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.000
 yes maybe it's strange that i'm first from 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.210
 banks shifted in a mug and then 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.120
 shifted in this arrow 9 mishanova 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.780
 change the general I'm not measuring differently 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.920
 but I could not do these things 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.360
 pleasure is not always the shell 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.460
 suite never learn to break eggs 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.780
 exactly now all this must be mixed 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.700
 to get such a homogeneous mass 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.980
 in the background a dog barked at me 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.580
 nothing i set the oven warm up 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.650
 up to 180 degrees, in general, got it all 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.370
 Silicone cups which not only 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.150
 In general, there is this mask 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.190
 somehow spread out on these molds to 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.800
 they are not stuck together to give cookies that us 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.570
 it will turn out but I will decompose and then 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.370
 I will return to you because I was wild 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.860
 uncomfortable to do with a huge heavy 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.570
 the camera 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.959
 molds here and made such balls 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.660
 here is just such type of layers 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.260
 put but now the most important bake 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.800
 it's all 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.080
 and put in the oven for 15 minutes here I 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.489
 set the timer for 15 minutes 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.260

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.540

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.159
 claustrophobia I'm like you've already been in it and 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.110
 she became so positive 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:03.370
 emotions we passed her 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.319
 our team passed it was just 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.149
 chic if there is something in your city

 cool time spending you passed 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.439
 claustrophobic as i said but 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:20.069
 hurt that we only have one location 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:22.240
 so far 2 in development 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.060

 you we were you in different quests 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.590
 that's what I got in 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.080
 Generally, I want to say that I already 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.680
 I tried cookies they are very very 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.630
 very sweet and I don't know if they are 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.850
 everyone will like it because they 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:58.789
 too sweet well in principle to me 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.789
 ok so the recipe is cool
