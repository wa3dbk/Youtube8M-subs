00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.559
 star trek new worlds the changeful 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.320
 history of this real-time strategy 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.490
 now comes to a good conclusion 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.240
 here's a look at the federation 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.369
 campaign 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.420
 the new colony is still standing on 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.110
 the beginning of your development 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.110
 but not for much longer 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.280
 initially, however, have become hostile 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.029
 units time for one 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.029
 small fireworks 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.420
 the worksheets which are here 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.070
 meanwhile are unmoved 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.579
 busy new buildings 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.579
 pulling up 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.120
 here the Klingon campaign with 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.460
 demonstrations of stepless zoom 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.320
 function in this case on one 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.560
 completely unknown and mysterious 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.940
 opponents, especially in the 3D view on 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.940
 that is very lifelike 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.369
 It has seldom been so much fun 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.369
 to give one enemy over the turnip
