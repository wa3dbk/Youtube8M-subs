the tire texture against the road if you

the tire texture against the road if you

will Frode what does that feel like as

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.850 
will Frode what does that feel like as
well<00:02:03.390> as<00:02:03.569> chassis<00:02:03.959> vibrations<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.649> things

I've<00:02:05.700> been<00:02:05.849> lucky<00:02:06.179> enough<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.539> be<00:02:06.720> working

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
I've been lucky enough to be working

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.449 
I've been lucky enough to be working
with<00:02:07.110> Chris<00:02:07.319> for<00:02:07.349> about<00:02:07.649> five<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.039> six<00:02:08.220> years

with Chris for about five or six years

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.309 
with Chris for about five or six years
now<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.149> off<00:02:09.240> three<00:02:09.479> different<00:02:09.810> times<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
now on and off three different times and

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.330 
now on and off three different times and
you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.530> we've<00:02:10.740> developed<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you know we've developed here a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
you know we've developed here a
fantastic<00:02:11.849> simulator<00:02:12.270> which<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.349> know

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
fantastic simulator which is you know

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.949 
fantastic simulator which is you know
for<00:02:13.680> me<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.830> utilize<00:02:14.340> huge<00:02:15.180> liter<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.840> my

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
for me I utilize huge liter to my

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.690 
for me I utilize huge liter to my
benefit<00:02:16.440> similar<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.010> flight<00:02:17.220> simulators<00:02:17.640> I

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
benefit similar to flight simulators I

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.040 
benefit similar to flight simulators I
mean<00:02:17.819> how<00:02:17.910> many<00:02:17.970> people<00:02:18.209> enjoy<00:02:18.569> going<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
mean how many people enjoy going and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.990 
mean how many people enjoy going and

a 747 or flying a Cessna or whatever it
is<00:02:23.880> they<00:02:24.030> might<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.300> doing<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.810> they<00:02:24.990> very

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
is they might be doing but they very

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.170 
is they might be doing but they very
rarely<00:02:25.349> or<00:02:25.830> don't<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> pilot's<00:02:26.819> licence

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
fly and you know it's the same thing

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.979 
fly and you know it's the same thing
with<00:02:29.880> racing<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.690> similar

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
with racing you know it's a similar

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.930

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
decelerate and as you accelerate it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.530 
decelerate and as you accelerate it
starts<00:02:47.189> to<00:02:47.310> loosen<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.790> seatbelts<00:02:48.269> as<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
starts to loosen the seatbelts as you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.020 
starts to loosen the seatbelts as you
would<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.989> real<00:02:49.140> race<00:02:49.319> car<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.799> well<00:02:50.030> it's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
would in a real race car as well it's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.839 
would in a real race car as well it's
pretty<00:02:51.209> amazing<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.659> closeness<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.639> car

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
pretty amazing that closeness of the car

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.030 
pretty amazing that closeness of the car
on<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> simulation<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.870> real<00:02:55.079> life<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.469> now<00:02:55.680> very

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
on a simulation to real life is now very

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.069 
on a simulation to real life is now very
advanced<00:02:56.549> so<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.760> know<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.209> characteristics

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
advanced so you know the characteristics

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.569 
advanced so you know the characteristics
are<00:02:58.170> quite<00:02:58.319> close<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:58.829> it's<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.069> easiest<00:02:59.400> way

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
are quite close so it's the easiest way

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.280 
are quite close so it's the easiest way
