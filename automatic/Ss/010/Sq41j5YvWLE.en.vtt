00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.680
 that Carlos Bianchi taught me 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.800
 the first lesson that Carlos taught me 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.550
 bianchi is that respect in football 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.550
 bring respect 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.200
 the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 Seriousness receives seriousness and commitment 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.500
 but what I have most in mind is that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.770
 skill that Carlos had for 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.050
 squeeze the best out of every player in 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.309
 each position and the simplicity with which 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.629
 did that that marked me marked me because 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.400
 because I had had many technicians 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.950
 that work very hard in many 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.740
 aspects 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.240
 carlos First he took the lead in the 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.420
 way I chose your players in 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.510
 that was fantastic Carlos always read 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.760
 the matches before they happened 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.500
 and in 15 minutes before each game you 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.329
 He gave the keys sometimes what would 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.370
 pass said today we're going to play this 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.019
 way the visitor has these 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.119
 arguments we have to play from 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.950
 this way and we're going to try to 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.049
 position ourselves of this other attention with 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.159
 this with this and with this to release it from 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.509
 15 minutes but the talks to the grain 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.440
 anticipating what will happen by 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.360
 that in many parties 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.520
 when things happened the court I 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.650
 I looked at him because I said he can not 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.440
 be that time knows what will happen 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.260
 before especially for example I remember 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.420
 a lot in the final against Real Madrid 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.490
 in Tokyo because carlos in his talk 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.369
 minute by minute I almost say what's going to 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.650
 pass and I told the teacher that he has 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.200
 lot of luck and in the end he told me not the 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.670
 luck there is no jorge the ability to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.369
 the concentration and arguments of 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.810
 you and the little that can help you 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.810
 see what was a lot that did not help 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.049
 before the palm trees faith trust 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.229
 the penitentiary of Palmeira bring me many 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.789
 memories brings great confidence and I 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.990
 It brought security gave me a lot 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.750
 security because I knew it was for 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.080
 us and it was that conviction that 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.980
 it took to kick it the way it started 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.480
 and before after palm tree the joy 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.500
 that I can not translate into words I do not 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.930
 a memory kick 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.969
 a match that I play in the stadium 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.120
 of rosario in you is played with the 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:34.280
 newell's shirt and before mouth and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.319
 forward of the other team the number 9 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.200
 I was such Carlos Tevez 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.880
 Carlos was in his fullness in his 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.370
 youth took the ball from the midfield 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.270
 is removed on shoe that was 5 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.420
 our badge shoe and faced me was the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.860
 ball or the man threw the ball for a 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.130
 side logically he knew it was a lot 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.480
 faster than me at that time and I what 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.760
 The only thing I did was to look at humanity 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.470
 and turn the body and with the shoulder 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.150
 I stuck in the hand here in the chamomile 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.840
 I think the manzanita that he turned into 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.840
 two pieces 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.270
 the web movement and a sound with a 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.520
 dry sound sounded that way 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.790
 I raised the hand of gerard and then I 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.410
 it was not Yoko 's fault I say yellow and 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.230
 then I got to think the way 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.580
 that I did not say Wednesday less badly 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.920
 I was the one who bounced in that way 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.780
 because the blow was so strong so dry 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.130
 that pity half of stable meat 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.510
 and the apology and everything but the blow 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.430
 I was given 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.420
 a team of eleven formed by ex 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.060
 comrades to see 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.800
 the one logically would be oscar cÃ³rdoba 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.560
 I do not have any doubt 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.380
 the right side of the 4 would be 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.209
 mister bitch I do not think I'm going to 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.840
 repeat from memory will be very easy 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.340
 for me the central one by left is going to 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.800
 to be walter samuel 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.430
 no doubt the left side will be 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.220
 the lining spins without any doubt the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.700
 central steering wheel 5 is going to be the chicho 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.069
 serna 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.470
 there is no doubt that it was the best steering wheel 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.640
 central with which we had the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.379
 opportunity to share it I had the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.209
 opportunity to share in my career 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.639
 sports now here starts here starts 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.190
 the good thing the steering wheel by right would be 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.720
 frei corner 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.790
 it would be freddy corner because for me it was 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.550
 the best player the most complete player 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.430
 what I do Colombian soccer until today 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.280
 there has not been another like the steering wheel for 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.139
 left me that steering wheel for left 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.700
 that the steering wheel sign on the left 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.240
 I would give it to the years 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.860
 but lozano a spectacular player 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.480
 spectacular really is true in 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.310
 all aspects in all fields 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.800
 that there was in Brazil and there was in Spain the 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.449
 champion of the cup of the king- great player 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.029
 the hook 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.499
 I would play with two hooks I would not play 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:01.340
 crowned lying I do not have to choose 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:04.580
 to one and it is very difficult to choose the 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.589
 heart sends and the heart invites Juan 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.900
 roman riquelme in the banco pibe 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:12.199
 Valderrama but the son to Juan Roman 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.840
 riquelme and the forwards fix the 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:18.430
 front is a 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.380
 a tremendous choice the front but 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.770
 the forward on the outside would be Faustian 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.560
 asprilla 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.490
 and 9 would be martÃ­n palermo I think that with 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.560
 that team we ride in a concorde 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.120
 in whatever we are going to a design or another 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.379
 planet and we beat whoever they put us 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.379
 up to 30 we beat him 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.050
 a greeting to all people for the 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.880
 mouth voices 2.0 it 's a pleasure 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.640
 privilege to share with you 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.680
 experiences anecdotes experiences and what 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.680
 better on my part until then
