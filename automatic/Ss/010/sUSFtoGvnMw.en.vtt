00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
touchdown but let's take a closer look

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.610 
touchdown but let's take a closer look
first<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.239> freeze<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.900> see<00:02:22.109> that<00:02:22.140> Ingram

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
first we freeze it and see that Ingram

first we freeze it and see that Ingram
sees<00:02:22.859> there's<00:02:23.040> not<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> lot<00:02:23.489> there<00:02:23.760> take<00:02:24.239> some

let's take a look at why that's the case

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.479 
let's take a look at why that's the case
great<00:02:39.209> separation<00:02:39.689> really<00:02:40.590> nice<00:02:40.739> catch<00:02:40.980> great

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
productive back in the NFL but this is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.899 
productive back in the NFL but this is
going<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.799> keep<00:03:04.950> him<00:03:05.099> from<00:03:05.250> being<00:03:05.489> one<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
going to keep him from being one of the

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.479 
going to keep him from being one of the
premier<00:03:06.480> guys<00:03:09.169> so<00:03:10.169> that's<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.829> really<00:03:11.040> like

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
premier guys so that's it I really like

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.009 
premier guys so that's it I really like
Mark<00:03:11.730> Ingram<00:03:11.879> I<00:03:12.180> think<00:03:12.389> he's<00:03:12.510> going<00:03:12.689> to<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.870> an

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
Mark Ingram I think he's going to be an

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.750 
Mark Ingram I think he's going to be an
exceptional<00:03:13.590> back<00:03:13.769> at<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> next<00:03:14.280> level<00:03:14.430> but

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
exceptional back at the next level but

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.909 
exceptional back at the next level but
not<00:03:14.970> any<00:03:15.239> elite<00:03:15.540> back<00:03:15.870> as<00:03:16.109> I<00:03:16.379> pointed<00:03:16.709> out<00:03:16.859> in

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
not any elite back as I pointed out in

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.039 
not any elite back as I pointed out in
the<00:03:17.040> film<00:03:17.280> doesn't<00:03:17.909> quite<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.419> that<00:03:18.449> extra

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
the film doesn't quite have that extra

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.500 
the film doesn't quite have that extra
gear<00:03:19.229> that<00:03:19.440> breakaway<00:03:19.859> speed<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.150> look

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
gear that breakaway speed that you look

they going to be they're not exceptional
back<00:03:42.629> to<00:03:42.840> their<00:03:42.959> themselves<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.470> think<00:03:43.500> Ingram

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
back to their themselves I think Ingram

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.250 
back to their themselves I think Ingram
was<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.069> step<00:03:44.340> up<00:03:44.489> from<00:03:44.609> either<00:03:44.819> of<00:03:44.940> them<00:03:45.239> if<00:03:46.109> he

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
was a step up from either of them if he

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.140 
was a step up from either of them if he
gets<00:03:46.409> past<00:03:46.590> Miami<00:03:47.099> I<00:03:47.340> think<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:47.909> very

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
gets past Miami I think it's very

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.670 
gets past Miami I think it's very
possible<00:03:48.479> he<00:03:48.870> could<00:03:49.019> get<00:03:49.139> picked<00:03:49.319> up<00:03:49.470> by<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
possible he could get picked up by the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.619 
possible he could get picked up by the
packs<00:03:50.069> or<00:03:50.519> by<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:50.909> Seahawks

who are good but not great and I think

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.509

Mark<00:04:00.629> Ingram<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.199> step<00:04:01.470> above<00:04:01.650> either<00:04:02.189> of

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
Mark Ingram is a step above either of

Mark Ingram is a step above either of
those<00:04:02.790> teams<00:04:03.500> stable<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.650> running<00:04:04.680> backs<00:04:05.120> if

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
those teams stable of running backs if

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.390 
those teams stable of running backs if
he<00:04:06.299> continues<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.750> slip<00:04:07.139> he<00:04:07.799> could<00:04:07.979> go<00:04:08.159> all<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
he continues to slip he could go all the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.740 
he continues to slip he could go all the
way<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.759> end<00:04:08.909> of<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.090> round<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.509> if<00:04:09.629> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
way to the end of the round and if the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.839 
way to the end of the round and if the
Green<00:04:09.959> Bay<00:04:10.109> Packers<00:04:10.139> see<00:04:10.919> him<00:04:11.159> there<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.639> think

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
Green Bay Packers see him there I think

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:12.980 
Green Bay Packers see him there I think

there I think they really need to think

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.810 
there I think they really need to think
about<00:04:36.810> picking<00:04:37.290> them<00:04:37.410> up<00:04:37.530> still<00:04:37.920> I<00:04:38.130> do<00:04:38.400> expect

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
about picking them up still I do expect

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.060 
about picking them up still I do expect
them<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.090> be<00:04:39.270> gone<00:04:39.510> long<00:04:39.840> before<00:04:40.290> that<00:04:40.500> be

them to be gone long before that be
