 certain changes for example have been removed 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.970
 what are the Google apps that are the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 google applications so that we have 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.550
 memory space and can pose 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.240
 in the description link I will leave you as 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.770
 it was placea and I said yes I want the rule 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.770
 of the restart of the youtube application 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.640
 megas of internal memory and the importer 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.610
 it's things from the living well we're going to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.850
 see it a bit like that above 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.990
 testing your criteria in the history of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.080
 an android version is 4.1.1 a 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.140
 official came out two days ago good team 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.910
 from laxi 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.700
 the truth is very fluid the truth is that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.439
 we are much better than me 10 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.899
 well let's go with the application we do not see 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.159
 that has almost nothing applications just 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.570
 the basics that are the music the 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.960
 calendar the camera then we are going to 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.940
 try it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.040
 It does not work for me because in theory 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.280
 the video works also and the camera 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.940
 but 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.840
 but I do not know 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.260
 here then activated this let's take the 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.260
 Photo 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.730
 do not get approved because according to them 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.730
 but it gave me an error before 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.820
 Well finally let's walk if the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.760
 photo that che 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.979
 and you try the video until it's not 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.520
 buses provide the video to see how they 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.120
 and good will see that the fluid 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120
 widgets 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.150
 the message 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.150
 [Music] 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.780
 willis here 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.209
 the truth if it's okay they say that is 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.760
 point 14.12 application settings 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.620
 we go to what storage is 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.870
 we know we have 178 total space and 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.160
 125 megabytes available since there is a good 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.799
 available space the truth is that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.910
 was in this version have made a good 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.030
 work 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.970
 and you have to try it as everyone wants 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.319
 and analyze them because I'll leave the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.819
