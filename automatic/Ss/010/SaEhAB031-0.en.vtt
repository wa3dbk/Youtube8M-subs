00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.590
 in this video we are going to learn how 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.109
 the waves of minions work and how 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.490
 we can manipulate them in our favor 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.650
 It is critical to understand how it works 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.049
 because they are a source of experience 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.849
 constant that we can have in addition to the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.240
 only way to tear down structures without 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.619
 presence of heroes 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.270
 let's start with the concepts 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.360
 basic to understand the concepts 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.830
 complexes more easily 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.440
 how the loneliness of minutes work 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.810
 the minions are generated every 30 seconds 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.910
 Each wave will have 6 videos of the 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.460
 which three will be thousands and three casters 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.190
 in every third wave there will also be a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.870
 minimum canon los vÃ©lez have higher 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.760
 resistances but less damage than 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.820
 caster the canons are the ones that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.160
 resistance and damage have a surge of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 minions takes 26 seconds from the nexus 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.690
 up to our first top line tower 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.600
 and up to the first rival tower another 16 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.230
 seconds in me would be 18 seconds + 12 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.510
 extra 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.090
 wave behavior there are two types 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.829
 of waves the balanced surge and the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.540
 surge that pushes a surge of 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.280
 balanced is the one that faces the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.200
 same number of minions of the same type 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.030
 and with the same life a wave that 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.060
 push is the one that has more children than the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.759
 rival wave and the two waves have their 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.979
 own rule of behavior rule of 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.630
 equality in equality of minions the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.170
 surge that is closer to your base 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.479
 push the other 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.030
 inequality rule the surge that 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.759
 have more minions will push the surge 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.649
 rival and the rule of equality always 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.479
 is met but the inequality 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.240
 you need one of the following five 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.100
 scenarios to be fulfilled that the surge 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.920
 have more videos be on your side of the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.630
 mode starting from the center of the line and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.520
 up to two and a half seconds in the direction 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.770
 to the tribal tower have a million 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.049
 advantage 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.359
 from the center and up to 5 seconds in 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.120
 direction to the rival tower need 2 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.310
 advantage miles 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.110
 from the center and up to 8 seconds in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.120
 direction to the rival tower three minutes 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.970
 of advantage or two being one of them a 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.710
 canon trillion and finally a surge with 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.560
 four minutes of advantage will push in 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.720
 any part of the line 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.060
 with everything learned we will analyze and 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.050
 correct the most frequent failure 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.090
 to surge control 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.860
 here we see what to kill the six 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.200
 children when a balanced surge 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.970
 your intention comes to the center of the line 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.500
 is that your children generate pressure on 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.100
 your rivals but what you just did 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.100
 is to create 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.250
 because we have generated a giant surge 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.350
 against the motive has been that at 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.030
 ride the six minimums we send our 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.040
 first wave without so a child against 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.630
 his second wave if he has it though 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.370
 our third wave comes a little 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.330
 before the rival is not enough to 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.980
 counteract the way 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.750
 as we see when the fifth wave arrives 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.310
 there are many children of the four 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.870
 previous we have created a surge 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.580
 giant against as we could 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.480
 have made sure to create a surge 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.700
 of bids in our favor 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.920
 killing them casters and leaving the thousands 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.170
 views this makes our surge 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.580
 practically does not take damage and that is not 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.470
 immediately against the 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.239
 second wave rival these seconds 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.159
 extras without advancing makes our 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.030
 second wave reinforce the remains of the 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.030
 first and gender 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.080
 if we can only keep a 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.310
 concept of everything spoken in the video 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.830
 for 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.690
 our games would never kill a 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.520
 whole surge and always leave the means 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.110
 books remember the rules of 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.580
 wave behavior and their 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.590
 different scenarios can be 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.569
 complicated but independently of in 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.550
 what part of the map are you if you kill the 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.490
 Greek castes plus ministrium these 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.830
 Indians will build their reality 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.450
 still the underlying message and more 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.280
 important is that the skills of 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.050
 children handled correctly are 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.030
 able to exercise the same version that 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.830
 a sixth player with no one to 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.830
 there comes a point where they will destroy the base 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.140
 I hope the video you liked this 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.970
 is the first in a series that 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.730
 will deepen in surge control 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.350
 view rotations and in general how 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.570
 create pressure on the map 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.950
 so subscribe not to miss 2 if 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.840
 you want to comment on anything 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.760
 add my twitter and if you are interested in knowing 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.390
 more about the topics that I speak, give him a 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.390
 glance itself
