it down like this again yep in what else

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.550 
it down like this again yep in what else
just<00:03:24.609> check<00:03:24.760> out<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.000> back<00:03:25.180> for<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.420> second

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
just check out the back for a second

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.800 
just check out the back for a second
you've<00:03:27.100> got<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.459> battery<00:03:27.850> really<00:03:28.030> support<00:03:28.569> a

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
you've got the battery really support a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.380 
you've got the battery really support a
lot<00:03:29.350> this<00:03:29.980> section<00:03:30.459> I'm<00:03:30.549> guessing<00:03:30.910> opens<00:03:31.239> up

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
lot this section I'm guessing opens up

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.069 
lot this section I'm guessing opens up
for<00:03:31.720> replacing<00:03:32.290> Iran<00:03:32.799> were<00:03:33.100> upgrading<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:34.079> but

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
for replacing Iran were upgrading it but

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.539 
for replacing Iran were upgrading it but
it's<00:03:35.200> got<00:03:35.350> like<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.500> vent<00:03:35.799> on<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.010> side<00:03:36.280> and

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
it's got like a vent on the side and

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.400 
it's got like a vent on the side and
stuff<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.299> reason<00:03:37.540> we<00:03:37.630> bought<00:03:37.840> this<00:03:38.079> over

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
stuff but the reason we bought this over

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.680 
stuff but the reason we bought this over
the<00:03:38.530> other<00:03:38.739> options<00:03:39.340> was<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.910> has<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.090> CD<00:03:40.450> drive

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
the other options was it has a CD drive

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.160 
the other options was it has a CD drive
which<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.620> really<00:03:41.859> slim<00:03:42.190> like<00:03:42.430> right<00:03:42.609> there<00:03:43.170> so

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
which is really slim like right there so

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.289 
which is really slim like right there so
yeah<00:03:44.319> let's<00:03:44.590> go<00:03:44.680> over<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.889> port's<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.700> got

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
yeah let's go over the port's you got

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.509 
yeah let's go over the port's you got
one<00:03:46.620> super<00:03:47.620> speed<00:03:47.889> USB<00:03:47.920> 3.0<00:03:48.790> port<00:03:49.440> HDMI<00:03:50.519> normal

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
one super speed USB 3.0 port HDMI normal

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.809 
one super speed USB 3.0 port HDMI normal
thing<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.389> power<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.250> just<00:03:54.549> a<00:03:54.639> giant

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
thing the power this is just a giant

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.069 
thing the power this is just a giant
vent<00:03:55.560> after<00:03:56.560> net<00:03:56.739> oh<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:58.299> this<00:03:58.450> Ethernet<00:03:58.840> it

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
vent after net oh and this Ethernet it

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.250 
vent after net oh and this Ethernet it
looks<00:03:59.230> small<00:03:59.709> because<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.220> um<00:04:00.750> it's<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.900> spring

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
looks small because it um it's a spring

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.259 
looks small because it um it's a spring
sort<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:03.010> thing<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.819> front<00:04:04.209> there's<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:04.870> an

sort of thing the front there's just an
SD<00:04:07.269> card<00:04:07.299> slot<00:04:07.600> thing<00:04:08.049> there<00:04:08.290> that's<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.950> and

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
SD card slot thing there that's it and

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.050 
SD card slot thing there that's it and

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
let's open this yeah so this is a

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.629 
let's open this yeah so this is a
touchscreen<00:04:28.810> notebook<00:04:29.500> we<00:04:30.129> just<00:04:30.310> lift<00:04:30.490> this

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
touchscreen notebook we just lift this

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.640 
touchscreen notebook we just lift this
off<00:04:30.819> it's<00:04:31.360> very<00:04:31.690> nice<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.199> think<00:04:32.530> it's

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
off it's very nice that you think it's

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.050 
off it's very nice that you think it's
got<00:04:32.800> aluminum<00:04:33.039> so<00:04:34.030> it's<00:04:34.210> very<00:04:34.449> nice<00:04:34.690> finish<00:04:36.060> so

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
got aluminum so it's very nice finish so

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.790 
got aluminum so it's very nice finish so
it<00:04:37.300> has<00:04:37.479> it<00:04:37.810> does<00:04:37.990> come<00:04:38.199> with<00:04:38.259> a<00:04:38.379> bit<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.530> power

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
it has it does come with a bit of power

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.969 
it has it does come with a bit of power
source<00:04:39.190> pretty<00:04:39.550> nice<00:04:39.669> as<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:41.259> can<00:04:41.379> see<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> very

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
source pretty nice as you can see a very

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.980 
source pretty nice as you can see a very
quick<00:04:42.310> start<00:04:42.669> up<00:04:42.789> because<00:04:42.970> it's<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.479> built<00:04:43.810> in

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
quick start up because it's the built in

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.180 
quick start up because it's the built in
SSD<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:45.930> let's<00:04:46.930> just<00:04:47.139> move<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.800> camera<00:04:48.069> up<00:04:48.099> a

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
SSD so let's just move the camera up a

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.700 
SSD so let's just move the camera up a
bit<00:04:50.789> just<00:04:51.789> into<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.120> screen<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:53.289> is<00:04:53.379> touched

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
bit just into the screen it is touched

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.700 
bit just into the screen it is touched
so<00:04:54.099> should<00:04:54.819> be<00:04:54.849> figure<00:04:55.270> it's<00:04:56.020> got<00:04:56.199> sonic

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
so should be figure it's got sonic

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.770 
so should be figure it's got sonic
master<00:04:57.130> not<00:04:57.310> sure<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:57.639> is<00:04:57.819> but<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.419> does<00:04:58.569> have

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
master not sure that is but it does have

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.450 
master not sure that is but it does have
the<00:04:58.930> Nvidia<00:05:00.750> take<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.780> closer<00:05:01.960> look<00:05:02.080> here<00:05:02.460> ge

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
the Nvidia take a closer look here ge

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.540 
the Nvidia take a closer look here ge

force GT 635 m 2 gigabyte graphics card
which<00:05:09.699> is<00:05:09.960> typically<00:05:10.960> pretty<00:05:11.169> good<00:05:11.380> anyway<00:05:12.599> ok

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
which is typically pretty good anyway ok

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.600 
which is typically pretty good anyway ok
so<00:05:13.659> it<00:05:14.289> looks<00:05:14.500> like<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.009> power<00:05:15.250> brick<00:05:15.490> is

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
so it looks like the power brick is

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.770 
so it looks like the power brick is
slightly<00:05:15.819> raised<00:05:16.150> here

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
slightly raised here

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.320 
slightly raised here
not<00:05:17.469> sure<00:05:17.620> why<00:05:17.770> did<00:05:17.949> it<00:05:18.069> did<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.550> but<00:05:18.880> you

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
not sure why did it did that but you

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.610 
not sure why did it did that but you
know<00:05:19.419> there's<00:05:19.659> long<00:05:19.870> as<00:05:19.960> Scott<00:05:20.139> good<00:05:20.349> back<00:05:20.500> to

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
know there's long as Scott good back to

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.249 
know there's long as Scott good back to
life<00:05:20.800> so<00:05:21.490> it's<00:05:21.580> got<00:05:21.729> the<00:05:21.909> um<00:05:22.139> looking<00:05:23.139> at<00:05:23.199> the

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
life so it's got the um looking at the
