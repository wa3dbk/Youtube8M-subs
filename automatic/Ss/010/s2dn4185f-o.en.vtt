perhaps<00:02:36.630> absolutely<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.959> them<00:02:38.079> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
perhaps absolutely it's one of them the

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
main reasons why I make circles it's

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.970

precisely what role you play and in the
whole<00:05:45.010> phenomena<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:46.920> can<00:05:47.920> be<00:05:48.100> a<00:05:48.910> little

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
whole phenomena it can be a little

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.250 
whole phenomena it can be a little
confusing<00:05:49.510> at<00:05:50.050> times<00:05:50.110> I<00:05:51.300> get<00:05:52.300> I<00:05:52.750> guess<00:05:53.080> I'm

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
confusing at times I get I guess I'm

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.830 
confusing at times I get I guess I'm
fairly<00:05:53.710> confused<00:05:54.370> as<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:54.610> what<00:05:54.910> what<00:05:55.570> role<00:05:55.810> I

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
fairly confused as to what what role I

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.010 
fairly confused as to what what role I
play<00:05:57.000> I'd<00:05:58.000> like<00:05:58.240> to<00:05:58.390> think<00:05:58.600> that<00:05:58.810> there<00:05:58.930> was

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
play I'd like to think that there was

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.920 
play I'd like to think that there was
something<00:05:59.730> bigger<00:06:00.730> and<00:06:00.970> greater<00:06:01.210> out<00:06:01.600> there

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
something bigger and greater out there

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.750 
something bigger and greater out there
as<00:06:02.140> I<00:06:02.500> think<00:06:02.770> perhaps<00:06:03.420> everyone<00:06:04.420> would<00:06:04.810> I

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
as I think perhaps everyone would I

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.660 
as I think perhaps everyone would I
think<00:06:06.760> the<00:06:06.850> whole<00:06:07.000> whole<00:06:07.450> thing<00:06:07.690> resides<00:06:08.050> in

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
think the whole whole thing resides in

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.050 
think the whole whole thing resides in
land<00:06:09.670> art<00:06:10.050> ultimately<00:06:11.050> has<00:06:11.410> an<00:06:11.500> authorship

land art ultimately has an authorship

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.540 
land art ultimately has an authorship

more<00:06:21.190> powerful<00:06:21.700> they<00:06:22.420> um<00:06:22.720> they<00:06:23.490> are<00:06:24.490> crop

more powerful they um they are crop

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.080 
more powerful they um they are crop

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
circles not art which I find

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.020 
circles not art which I find
particularly<00:06:28.510> interesting<00:06:29.250> if<00:06:30.250> they<00:06:30.520> become

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
particularly interesting if they become

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.920 
particularly interesting if they become
art<00:06:31.450> or<00:06:31.840> land<00:06:32.200> art<00:06:32.940> they<00:06:33.940> lose<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.210> lot<00:06:34.480> of<00:06:34.630> their

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930

their mystique their paranormal powers

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.670 
their mystique their paranormal powers
people<00:06:39.250> are<00:06:39.310> less<00:06:39.460> likely<00:06:39.490> to<00:06:39.940> believe<00:06:40.680> in

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
people are less likely to believe in

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.950 
people are less likely to believe in
something<00:06:42.550> happening<00:06:43.420> and<00:06:43.540> I<00:06:43.600> think<00:06:43.810> that's

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
something happening and I think that's

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.960 
something happening and I think that's
very<00:06:44.050> important<00:06:44.800> that<00:06:45.750> if<00:06:46.750> you're<00:06:47.200> wanting<00:06:47.410> to

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
very important that if you're wanting to

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.450 
very important that if you're wanting to
experience<00:06:48.970> something<00:06:49.450> you<00:06:50.140> have<00:06:50.320> to<00:06:50.350> go<00:06:50.620> into

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
experience something you have to go into

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.080 
experience something you have to go into
it<00:06:51.670> with<00:06:51.790> an<00:06:51.910> open<00:06:52.420> mind<00:06:52.840> and<00:06:53.790> not<00:06:54.790> a<00:06:54.820> closed

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
it with an open mind and not a closed

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.790 
it with an open mind and not a closed
mind<00:06:55.450> do<00:06:56.410> people<00:06:56.850> will<00:06:57.850> come<00:06:58.090> and<00:06:58.530> I<00:06:59.530> wouldn't

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
mind do people will come and I wouldn't

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.950 
mind do people will come and I wouldn't
use<00:06:59.890> perhaps<00:07:00.220> a<00:07:00.370> stronger<00:07:00.730> word<00:07:00.910> is<00:07:01.120> worship

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
use perhaps a stronger word is worship

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.950 
use perhaps a stronger word is worship
but<00:07:02.950> they'll<00:07:03.610> bring<00:07:03.910> a<00:07:04.210> whole<00:07:04.540> manner<00:07:04.780> of

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
but they'll bring a whole manner of

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.860 
but they'll bring a whole manner of
beliefs<00:07:05.320> be<00:07:05.680> it<00:07:05.800> dowsing<00:07:06.100> or<00:07:07.030> meditation<00:07:07.780> and

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
beliefs be it dowsing or meditation and

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.260 
beliefs be it dowsing or meditation and
or<00:07:10.870> just<00:07:10.900> simply<00:07:11.530> wanting<00:07:12.190> to<00:07:12.340> experience<00:07:12.820> a

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
or just simply wanting to experience a

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.720 
or just simply wanting to experience a
particular<00:07:14.140> change<00:07:14.710> in<00:07:15.420> atmosphere<00:07:16.420> or

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.730 
particular change in atmosphere or

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.190 
particular change in atmosphere or
energy<00:07:18.730> and<00:07:20.310> that<00:07:21.310> is<00:07:21.580> I<00:07:22.270> think<00:07:22.330> perhaps<00:07:22.690> one

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
energy and that is I think perhaps one

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.920 
energy and that is I think perhaps one
of<00:07:23.230> the<00:07:23.380> bigger<00:07:23.670> successes<00:07:24.670> of<00:07:24.700> crop<00:07:25.450> circles

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
of the bigger successes of crop circles

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.519 
of the bigger successes of crop circles
that<00:07:26.140> they<00:07:26.290> can<00:07:26.440> bring

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:27.529 
that they can bring

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:29.589 
that they can bring
together<00:07:28.339> a<00:07:28.429> lot<00:07:28.669> of<00:07:28.759> people<00:07:28.909> who<00:07:29.179> want<00:07:29.389> to

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 
together a lot of people who want to

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.239 
together a lot of people who want to
experience<00:07:30.559> these<00:07:31.249> things<00:07:31.809> and<00:07:33.069> a<00:07:34.069> lot<00:07:34.099> of

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:34.249 
experience these things and a lot of

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:35.889 
experience these things and a lot of
enjoyment<00:07:34.669> when<00:07:34.999> people<00:07:35.329> do<00:07:35.449> experience
