00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
as you can see the wire wrap is actually

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
as you can see the wire wrap is actually
a<00:00:21.480> design<00:00:21.779> element<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.619> made<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> bail

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
a design element that I made the bail

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.269 
a design element that I made the bail
and<00:00:23.789> then<00:00:23.939> brought<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.300> down<00:00:24.480> over<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.800> cap<00:00:26.010> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you can see there's multiples drop down

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.750 
you can see there's multiples drop down
in<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> same<00:00:36.660> fashion<00:00:37.250> these<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.399> all<00:00:38.520> top

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
in the same fashion these are all top

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
in the same fashion these are all top
drills<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.120> I'm<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> show<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
drills and I'm going to show you in a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.450 
drills and I'm going to show you in a
minute<00:00:39.870> how<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.040> today<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.370> going

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
minute how to do that so today I'm going

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.119 
minute how to do that so today I'm going
to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> taking<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.059> piece<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:43.620> rutilated

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to be taking this piece of rutilated

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.850 
to be taking this piece of rutilated
quartz<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.170> I'm<00:00:46.170> gonna<00:00:46.320> make<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> pendant<00:00:46.800> out

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
quartz and I'm gonna make a pendant out

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.200 
quartz and I'm gonna make a pendant out
of<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.440> thing<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:50.149> important<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
of it so one thing that's important to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.689 
of it so one thing that's important to
learn<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.140> initially<00:00:52.770> took<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> 24

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
learn is that I initially took a 24

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.200 
learn is that I initially took a 24
gauge<00:00:53.879> wire<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:55.469> went<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.039> side<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:57.059> my

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
gauge wire and it went in one side of my

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.939 
gauge wire and it went in one side of my
top<00:00:57.420> drill<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:58.230> didn't<00:00:58.469> come<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> other

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
top drill but didn't come out the other

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.040 
top drill but didn't come out the other
which<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.609> very<00:00:59.879> very<00:01:00.000> typical<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.629> briolette

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
which is very very typical of briolette

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.950 
which is very very typical of briolette
styles<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> needed<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> take<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.239> 26<00:01:03.780> gauge

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
styles so I needed to take a 26 gauge

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.780 
styles so I needed to take a 26 gauge
wire<00:01:05.360> which<00:01:06.360> fits<00:01:06.630> nicely<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
wire which fits nicely through so the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.230 
wire which fits nicely through so the
technique<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> top<00:01:09.570> drill<00:01:10.820> is<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> put<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
technique with a top drill is to put the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.320 
technique with a top drill is to put the
wire<00:01:12.390> through<00:01:13.189> leave<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.430> short<00:01:14.729> side<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.180> one

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
wire through leave one short side in one

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.380 
wire through leave one short side in one
long<00:01:15.509> side<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.520> then<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> bring<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.180> two

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
long side and then you bring the two

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.920 
long side and then you bring the two
together<00:01:19.100> above<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.939> peak<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> bead<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
together above the peak of the bead and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
together above the peak of the bead and
you<00:01:22.799> make<00:01:22.950> an<00:01:23.070> X<00:01:23.280> across<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.460> with<00:01:26.460> my

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you make an X across right here with my

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.920 
you make an X across right here with my
chain<00:01:26.790> nose<00:01:27.000> pliers<00:01:27.240> I'm<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> grasp

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
chain nose pliers I'm going to grasp

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.249 
chain nose pliers I'm going to grasp
directly<00:01:28.530> above<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> X<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:30.090> at<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
directly above the X not at not at the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.630 
directly above the X not at not at the
wire<00:01:31.409> crossing<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.070> else<00:01:32.189> you'll<00:01:32.340> break<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
wire crossing or else you'll break the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
wire crossing or else you'll break the
wire<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.000> right<00:01:33.180> above<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> I'm<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
wire but right above it I'm going to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.240 
wire but right above it I'm going to
utilize<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.100> bead<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.579> I'm<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:37.250> twist

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
utilize the bead and I'm going to twist

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.219 
utilize the bead and I'm going to twist
the<00:01:38.400> wires<00:01:38.579> together<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the wires together you can see that the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
the wires together you can see that the
twist<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.680> crawling<00:01:41.100> down<00:01:41.220> towards<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.479> peak

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
twist is crawling down towards the peak

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.800 
twist is crawling down towards the peak
of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> bead<00:01:43.399> then<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> cut<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.390> my

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.969 
wire I'm going to take my round nose I'm
going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> grasp<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.939> perpendicular<00:02:00.979> when

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
going to grasp that perpendicular when

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.080 
going to grasp that perpendicular when
you're<00:02:02.100> doing<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.610> you're<00:02:02.670> making<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you're doing this and you're making a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
you're doing this and you're making a
bail<00:02:03.329> which<00:02:03.930> bail<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.740> means<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.189> goes

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
bail which bail just means that it goes

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.139 
bail which bail just means that it goes
over<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.600> necklace<00:02:06.990> chain<00:02:07.819> you're<00:02:08.819> actually

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
over the necklace chain you're actually

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
over the necklace chain you're actually
going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.569> consider<00:02:10.229> where<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.220> round

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
going to consider where on the round

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.619 
going to consider where on the round
nose<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.819> grabbed<00:02:12.090> because<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
nose that you grabbed because the

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.610 
nose that you grabbed because the
further<00:02:12.840> up<00:02:13.050> gives<00:02:13.319> you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
further up gives you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.990 
further up gives you
jebel<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.129> if<00:02:14.190> you've<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.430> some<00:02:14.580> really<00:02:14.790> heavy

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
jebel so if you've got some really heavy

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.430 
jebel so if you've got some really heavy
chin<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.659> keep<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.049> mind<00:02:16.230> in

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
chin you have to keep that in mind in

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.110 
chin you have to keep that in mind in
this<00:02:17.010> instance<00:02:17.430> I've<00:02:17.549> got<00:02:17.580> some<00:02:17.940> pretty

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
this instance I've got some pretty

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.570 
this instance I've got some pretty
delicate<00:02:18.599> chain<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:20.159> gonna<00:02:20.250> put<00:02:20.489> this

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
delicate chain that I'm gonna put this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.610 
delicate chain that I'm gonna put this
guy<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.930> what<00:02:22.049> I'm<00:02:22.140> gonna<00:02:22.230> do<00:02:22.379> is<00:02:22.500> I'm<00:02:22.560> gonna

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
guy on so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.080 
guy on so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
use<00:02:22.860> my<00:02:23.010> hand<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:23.489> gonna<00:02:23.580> bring<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> wire

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
use my hand and I'm gonna bring the wire

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.190 
use my hand and I'm gonna bring the wire
over<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.599> top<00:02:25.099> of<00:02:26.099> my<00:02:26.370> tool<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.390> I'm<00:02:27.959> going<00:02:28.140> to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
over the top of my tool and I'm going to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.289 
over the top of my tool and I'm going to
twist<00:02:28.440> my<00:02:29.220> right<00:02:29.400> hand<00:02:29.610> wrist<00:02:29.819> just<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.120> bit

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
twist my right hand wrist just a bit

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.410 
twist my right hand wrist just a bit
whilst<00:02:30.750> tucking<00:02:31.819> at<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.970> same<00:02:33.150> time

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
whilst tucking at the same time

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.500 
whilst tucking at the same time
underneath<00:02:34.379> with<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.829> wire<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:36.030> complete<00:02:36.390> my

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
underneath with the wire to complete my

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.430 
underneath with the wire to complete my
loop<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:39.180> even<00:02:39.329> double<00:02:39.629> check<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:40.140> I'd<00:02:40.260> like

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
loop I can even double check if I'd like

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.910 
loop I can even double check if I'd like
to<00:02:40.769> make<00:02:41.010> sure<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.819> loop<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
to make sure that that loop is going to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.119 
to make sure that that loop is going to
fit<00:02:44.129> with<00:02:44.220> my<00:02:44.370> chain<00:02:45.349> so<00:02:46.349> now<00:02:46.650> I'm<00:02:46.859> going<00:02:47.040> to

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
fit with my chain so now I'm going to

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.500 
fit with my chain so now I'm going to
stabilize<00:02:47.609> this<00:02:47.819> loop<00:02:48.030> since<00:02:48.239> I've<00:02:48.359> got<00:02:48.480> a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
stabilize this loop since I've got a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.920 
stabilize this loop since I've got a
nice<00:02:48.720> loop<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.260> by<00:02:49.440> stabilizing<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:50.129> mean<00:02:50.310> you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
nice loop and by stabilizing I mean you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.530 
nice loop and by stabilizing I mean you
grab<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.170> your<00:02:52.319> round<00:02:52.560> nose<00:02:53.090> across<00:02:54.090> both

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
grab with your round nose across both

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.069 
grab with your round nose across both
sides<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.739> your<00:02:56.609> bail<00:02:56.849> or<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.120> round<00:02:57.329> part<00:02:57.599> I'm

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
sides of your bail or the round part I'm

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.710 
sides of your bail or the round part I'm
gonna<00:02:58.260> take<00:02:58.500> my<00:02:58.650> chain<00:02:58.890> nose<00:02:59.359> I'm<00:03:00.359> gonna<00:03:00.510> grab

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
gonna take my chain nose I'm gonna grab

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.630 
gonna take my chain nose I'm gonna grab
it<00:03:00.750> at<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.019> end<00:03:01.200> very<00:03:01.799> tip<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.129> wire<00:03:02.310> and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
it at the end very tip of the wire and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.630 
it at the end very tip of the wire and
I'm<00:03:02.730> going<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.030> start<00:03:03.739> at<00:03:04.739> my<00:03:05.040> loop<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.519> work

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
I'm going to start at my loop and work

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.559 
I'm going to start at my loop and work
down<00:03:05.879> towards<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.769> bead<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:09.030> what<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.359> does

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
down towards the bead and what this does

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.240 
down towards the bead and what this does
is<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.870> actually<00:03:10.170> covers<00:03:10.470> your<00:03:10.769> original

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
is it actually covers your original

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.759 
is it actually covers your original
twist<00:03:11.549> don't<00:03:12.420> be<00:03:12.510> afraid<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.810> pull<00:03:13.140> while<00:03:13.650> you

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
twist don't be afraid to pull while you

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.960 
twist don't be afraid to pull while you
twist<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:15.030> original<00:03:15.450> twist<00:03:15.750> kind<00:03:16.019> of

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
twist and the original twist kind of

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.379 
twist and the original twist kind of
effects<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:19.910> how<00:03:20.910> far<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.829> how<00:03:23.180> much<00:03:24.180> wire

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
effects then how far and how much wire

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.530 
effects then how far and how much wire
you<00:03:24.599> need<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:26.130> successfully<00:03:26.489> get<00:03:26.880> all<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.419> way

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
you need to successfully get all the way

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.229 
you need to successfully get all the way
to<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.079> top<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.620> bead<00:03:28.829> so<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:29.879> takes<00:03:30.090> a

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
to the top of the bead so that takes a

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.890 
to the top of the bead so that takes a
little<00:03:30.269> bit<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.629> thought<00:03:30.720> process<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
little bit of thought process so it's a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.449 
little bit of thought process so it's a
little<00:03:34.019> kiddy<00:03:34.260> Wumpus<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:34.950> can<00:03:35.129> straighten

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
little kiddy Wumpus but I can straighten

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.460 
little kiddy Wumpus but I can straighten
that<00:03:35.669> out<00:03:35.730> I'm<00:03:36.599> going<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.780> take<00:03:36.959> my<00:03:37.139> cutters

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
that out I'm going to take my cutters

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.830 
that out I'm going to take my cutters
I'm<00:03:38.190> gonna<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.609> there<00:03:38.790> I'm<00:03:39.359> gonna<00:03:39.540> cut<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
I'm gonna get in there I'm gonna cut the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.530 
I'm gonna get in there I'm gonna cut the
little<00:03:40.019> tail<00:03:40.230> off<00:03:40.730> I'm<00:03:41.730> gonna<00:03:41.879> take<00:03:42.120> my<00:03:42.269> chain

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
little tail off I'm gonna take my chain

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.650 
little tail off I'm gonna take my chain
nose<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> pinch<00:03:44.280> pinch<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.449> little

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
nose and on a pinch pinch the little

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.390 
nose and on a pinch pinch the little
tail<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.319> under<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.889> that<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.099> doesn't

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
tail in and under so that it doesn't

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.189 
tail in and under so that it doesn't
catch<00:03:47.579> on<00:03:47.730> anybody's<00:03:48.150> skin<00:03:48.329> or<00:03:48.569> clothing<00:03:48.720> and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.809 
then you can see here see how I've got a
little<00:03:52.019> bit<00:03:52.109> of<00:03:52.169> a<00:03:52.230> twist<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.650> my<00:03:52.799> thing<00:03:53.010> as

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
little bit of a twist in my thing as

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.089 
little bit of a twist in my thing as
long<00:03:54.030> as<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.209> stabilize<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.230> can

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
long as I stabilize that I can

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.729 
long as I stabilize that I can
straighten<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:58.019> here<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.349> have<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> wire

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
straighten it so here you have a wire

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.240 
straighten it so here you have a wire
wrap<00:03:59.010> gemstone<00:04:00.500> wire<00:04:01.500> wrap<00:04:01.680> gemstone<00:04:02.129> that

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
wrap gemstone wire wrap gemstone that

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.520 
wrap gemstone wire wrap gemstone that
you<00:04:02.370> can<00:04:02.519> then<00:04:02.910> dangle<00:04:03.329> on<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.750> chain<00:04:04.049> to

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
you can then dangle on to a chain to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.170 
you can then dangle on to a chain to
become<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.769> necklace<00:04:05.099> which<00:04:05.819> is<00:04:05.940> what<00:04:06.060> I'm

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180

need is a clasp and I'm all set this is
another<00:04:16.109> technique<00:04:16.560> for<00:04:16.829> gemstone<00:04:17.430> wire

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
another technique for gemstone wire

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.719 
another technique for gemstone wire
wrapping<00:04:18.320> for<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.349> necklace<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.949> as<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.609> can

see<00:04:20.789> this<00:04:21.389> is<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.599> classic<00:04:22.039> linked<00:04:23.039> chain<00:04:23.360> with

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
see this is a classic linked chain with

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.850 
see this is a classic linked chain with
wire<00:04:24.630> wrap<00:04:24.840> sections<00:04:25.500> but<00:04:25.770> what<00:04:25.919> I've<00:04:26.010> done

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
wire wrap sections but what I've done

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.129 
wire wrap sections but what I've done
because<00:04:27.039> I've<00:04:27.129> taken<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.430> briolette<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:28.150> in

because I've taken a briolette and in
this<00:04:29.229> instance<00:04:29.439> it's<00:04:29.860> pyrite<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.580> I've<00:04:31.210> done

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
this instance it's pyrite and I've done

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.240 
this instance it's pyrite and I've done
a<00:04:31.389> top<00:04:31.659> drill<00:04:31.990> while<00:04:32.169> I<00:04:32.199> rap<00:04:32.469> to<00:04:32.800> dangle<00:04:33.009> it

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
a top drill while I rap to dangle it

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.219 
a top drill while I rap to dangle it
from<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.610> chain<00:04:33.849> at<00:04:34.120> different<00:04:34.599> moments<00:04:34.810> and

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
from the chain at different moments and

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:44.190 
from the chain at different moments and
points<00:04:35.620> for<00:04:35.819> a<00:04:36.819> really<00:04:37.060> interesting<00:04:37.270> look
