 and years 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.010
 you are as important to me as I 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.430
 it was for his mother and father and I swore to them 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.430
 that I would protect it and I have not done it 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.849
 the mayor is going to fire him in the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.220
 spring seriously 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.520
 but he is a hero a war hero and 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.150

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.810

 because when it happens they are going to ask 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.699
 how they thought they could live so 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.390
 luxuriously mind and leave either for the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.390
 rest of us 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.540
 what does this rebellion mean 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.329
 when Gothic turns to ashes 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.329
 You will have my permission to die 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.850
 do not 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.409
 good
