00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.130
 developers give money for download 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.059
 applications on a smartphone or tablet 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.130
 do you want a link in the description attention to ios 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.190
 need to download the application from the browser 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.039
 safari otherwise payment will not be on android 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 can use any browser be 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.560
 Hi everyone, this is a rubric 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.730
 the secrets in it I will tell you what 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.590
 probably did not know 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.859
 if at least one secret was unfamiliar to you 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.529
 Like if you know everything from you 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.469
 dizlaik I'm waiting 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.559
 so the topic of this release gta 2 noticed 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.600
 do you play gta 2 what is the sign of the letter y 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.719
 local church where you are allowed 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.579
 persist sometimes flash and instead from 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.579
 life safe can be seen 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.440
 you are safe which points us to the fact 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.800
 that the church serves as a place in the game 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.420
 save progress passing 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.090
 having rummaged in resources and gnawed on such 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.579
 craftsmen found there unused 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.640
 sprite that person could talk to us 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.180
 apparently this is a policeman why is this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.280
 A hare not used until now unclear 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.640
 cool and even divine roller beginning 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 games 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.850
 starred specifically rockstar like intro 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.159
 for the game 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 many people think that this is a piece from the movie but 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.509
 There is also an opinion that the main character 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.229
 video is a claude from the third part of the game 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.360
 video he says truth and communicates claude 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.320
 was not my cut parts like u remembers but 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.750
 at the end of the video 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.180
 Indra This character gets shot in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 back that fan speculation can 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 cause injury which ultimately 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.259
 led to dumbness heroes the next 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.390
 secret disagree with this theory because 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.060
 that the time of action doesnâ€™t coincide 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.100
 not many thought that locked 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.189
 actually there runs in gta 2 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.140
 he's so cute and nobody cares who it is 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.420
 in general such a claudian 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.909
 speed so his name is here 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.770
 traced the curious fact of hero 3 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.909
 parts of bits I have already said are also called 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.850
 Claude is unknown in gta 2 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.640
 yard CSE 2013 in gta 3 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.770
 it is 2001 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.750
 that maybe one point a character but 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.480
 previous secret a little bit does not match 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.910
 on dates shot down 3 occurs earlier than 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.920
 gta 2 and therefore basically if claude 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.300
 spoke in the second part and got shot in 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.150
 back and then numb 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.650
 then it happened later than when he was already 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.380
 was not mine in gta 3 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.209
 2001 that is curious gameplay 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.180
 chips were not noticed by many players 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.230
 for example, when you press the tab key, the main 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.110
 the hero will burp 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.480
 and sorry for the expression fart like 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.400
 old grandfather well if you leave the keyboard 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.310
 no attention and no press 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.130
 the character will start to smoke noise you score 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.380
 a release and a comment that I missed or 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.880
 which may not have known, thanks for 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.880
 viewing and and happily
