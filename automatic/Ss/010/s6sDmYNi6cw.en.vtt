next you need to connect the phone with
this<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.910> arm<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.410> connector

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
this to this arm to the connector

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.480 
this to this arm to the connector
so<00:02:25.730> using<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.150> size<00:02:26.360> small<00:02:26.630> connector<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.530> H

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
so using this size small connector and H

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.240 
so using this size small connector and H
L<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.340> connect<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.760> your<00:02:31.910> phone<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:33.190> now<00:02:34.190> you
