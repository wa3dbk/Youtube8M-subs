those getting plays there was a way
around<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.700> think<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> could<00:01:33.390> look<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
around it I think you could look it up I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.870 
around it I think you could look it up I
don't<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> was<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.310> somebody

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
don't know what it was I know somebody

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.200 
don't know what it was I know somebody
from<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.650> from<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> Europe<00:01:38.159> knew<00:01:38.759> how<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> get

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
from the from the Europe knew how to get

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.670 
from the from the Europe knew how to get
around<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.960> could<00:01:40.110> watch<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> videos

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
around it and you could watch the videos

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.960 
around it and you could watch the videos
I<00:01:40.829> guess<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.490> change<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.759> location

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
I guess if you just change your location

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
I guess if you just change your location
to<00:01:42.390> United<00:01:42.810> States<00:01:43.079> somewhere<00:01:43.619> else<00:01:43.829> like

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
to United States somewhere else like

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190 
to United States somewhere else like
Australia<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:44.939> something<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.420> guess<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
Australia or something I guess that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
Australia or something I guess that

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
an energy sword it's a bowl true so i

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.250 
an energy sword it's a bowl true so i
guess<00:04:54.420> that's<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.660> best<00:04:54.720> way<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.080> put<00:04:55.200> it

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
guess that's the best way to put it

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.040

or spraying with an XP are 50 I've
always<00:05:36.720> been<00:05:36.960> against<00:05:37.350> sniper<00:05:38.010> rifles<00:05:38.430> that

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
always been against sniper rifles that

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.030 
always been against sniper rifles that
have<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.940> full<00:05:39.150> auto<00:05:39.420> semi-auto<00:05:40.290> capability

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
have the full auto semi-auto capability

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.520 
have the full auto semi-auto capability
because<00:05:41.370> they<00:05:41.610> are<00:05:41.700> very<00:05:41.760> cheap<00:05:42.060> and

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
because they are very cheap and

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.290 
because they are very cheap and
overpowered<00:05:43.530> I<00:05:43.710> think<00:05:44.610> this<00:05:44.700> commentary<00:05:45.150> is

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
overpowered I think this commentary is

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.810 
overpowered I think this commentary is
closing<00:05:45.840> coming<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> close<00:05:46.920> so<00:05:47.640> if<00:05:47.730> you

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
closing coming to a close so if you

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.340 
closing coming to a close so if you
