also<00:01:50.170> note<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:50.439> acceleration<00:01:51.159> I<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:52.810> think

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
also note the acceleration I don't think

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.529 
also note the acceleration I don't think
you<00:01:53.140> can<00:01:53.319> see<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.740> really<00:01:54.039> but<00:01:54.340> when<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.209> starts

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
you can see it really but when it starts

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.999 
you can see it really but when it starts
up<00:01:55.689> it<00:01:56.200> gives<00:01:56.380> us<00:01:56.500> break<00:01:57.509> pretty<00:01:58.509> fun<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.860> can

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
up it gives us break pretty fun you can

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.870 
up it gives us break pretty fun you can
get<00:02:00.159> it<00:02:00.280> right<00:02:00.489> next<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.909> someone<00:02:02.549> turn<00:02:03.549> it<00:02:03.700> on
