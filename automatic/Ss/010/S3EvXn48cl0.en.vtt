00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
the pictures of highlights in there but

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.640 
the pictures of highlights in there but
that's<00:03:19.060> what<00:03:19.360> makes<00:03:19.630> me<00:03:19.900> comfortable<00:03:20.230> that's

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
that's what makes me comfortable that's

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.500 
that's what makes me comfortable that's
the<00:03:20.860> only<00:03:21.250> way<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> can<00:03:21.640> study<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.030> plus<00:03:22.360> if

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
the only way I can study and plus if

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.580 
the only way I can study and plus if
you're<00:03:22.630> writing<00:03:22.870> out<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.170> notes<00:03:23.380> and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
you're writing out the notes and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.680 
you're writing out the notes and
organizing<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.730> make<00:03:24.910> sense<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.570> you

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
organizing it to make sense to you

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.300 
organizing it to make sense to you
you're<00:03:25.989> actually<00:03:26.350> learning<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.769> while<00:03:27.160> you're

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
you're actually learning it while you're

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.550 
you're actually learning it while you're
doing<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.970> then<00:03:28.660> people<00:03:28.870> actually<00:03:29.170> find

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
doing it and then people actually find

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.830 
doing it and then people actually find
it<00:03:29.739> better<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:29.950> write<00:03:30.340> off<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.610> dog<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:31.060> can't

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
it better to write off the dog I can't

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.750 
it better to write off the dog I can't
do<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.410> because<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.890> really<00:03:33.190> pisses<00:03:33.430> me<00:03:33.730> off

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
do that because it really pisses me off

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.840 
do that because it really pisses me off
to<00:03:34.030> do<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.410> actually<00:03:36.130> excuse<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.700> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
to do that so I actually excuse that and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.400 
to do that so I actually excuse that and
I<00:03:36.910> stick<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.209> my<00:03:37.360> colors<00:03:37.840> if<00:03:37.989> you're<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.170> visual

now<00:03:42.760> but<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.180> did<00:03:43.420> run<00:03:43.600> for<00:03:43.630> drunk<00:03:43.959> pictures<00:03:44.320> of

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
now but I did run for drunk pictures of

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.890 
now but I did run for drunk pictures of
these<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:45.280> houses<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:46.269> kind<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.600> remind

these and houses to kind of remind
myself<00:03:47.140> like<00:03:47.470> oh<00:03:47.620> yeah<00:03:47.890> this<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.400> how<00:03:48.549> you

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
myself like oh yeah this is how you

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.449 
myself like oh yeah this is how you
remember<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.650> theory<00:03:50.650> or<00:03:50.920> all<00:03:51.100> of<00:03:51.280> these

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
remember this theory or all of these

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.670 
remember this theory or all of these
theories<00:03:51.760> just<00:03:52.030> make<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.420> sentence<00:03:52.959> out<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.410> the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
theories just make a sentence out of the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.039 
theories just make a sentence out of the
first<00:03:54.070> letters<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.880> every<00:03:55.630> single<00:03:55.900> theory

that<00:03:56.200> I<00:03:56.290> remember<00:03:56.920> there<00:03:57.579> were<00:03:57.670> just<00:03:57.850> so<00:03:58.060> many

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
that I remember there were just so many

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.810 
that I remember there were just so many
goofy<00:03:58.660> ways<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:59.200> I<00:03:59.500> thought<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.190> today

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
goofy ways that I thought of today

goofy ways that I thought of today
remember<00:04:01.150> these<00:04:01.299> things

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
remember these things

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.490 
remember these things
understand<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.640> material<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:04.390> just<00:04:04.960> memorize

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
understand the material so just memorize

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.590 
understand the material so just memorize
that<00:04:05.860> I<00:04:05.950> learned<00:04:06.280> from<00:04:06.340> experience<00:04:06.550> that<00:04:07.150> it

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
that I learned from experience that it

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.420 
that I learned from experience that it
really<00:04:07.810> screws<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.560> over<00:04:08.590> when<00:04:08.980> it<00:04:09.100> comes<00:04:09.280> to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
really screws you over when it comes to

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.950 
really screws you over when it comes to
the<00:04:09.550> thinking<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.000> application<00:04:10.450> questions

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
the thinking and application questions

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.870 
the thinking and application questions
like<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.530> get<00:04:11.680> my<00:04:11.800> friends<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.400> don't<00:04:12.520> know

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
whatever you can understand theory but

you<00:04:27.250> cannot<00:04:27.820> apply<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.360> your<00:04:28.780> sole<00:04:29.230> skirt<00:04:29.710> I

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
you cannot apply it your sole skirt I

you cannot apply it your sole skirt I
learned<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.730> hard<00:04:31.000> way<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.770> honestly

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
learned that the hard way and honestly

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.650 
learned that the hard way and honestly
just<00:04:33.130> understand<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.150> allowed<00:04:34.390> me<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.540> use

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
just understand it's allowed me to use

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.930 
just understand it's allowed me to use
it<00:04:34.960> in<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.200> future<00:04:35.410> because<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.430> find<00:04:36.820> that

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
it in the future because but I find that

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.550 
it in the future because but I find that
when<00:04:37.210> you're<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.450> school<00:04:37.630> for<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.230> a<00:04:38.350> lot<00:04:38.530> of

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
when you're in school for it a lot of

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.070 
when you're in school for it a lot of
the<00:04:38.740> courses<00:04:39.180> interlink<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.360> each<00:04:40.510> other<00:04:40.750> and

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
the courses interlink to each other and

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.290 
the courses interlink to each other and
actually<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.800> content<00:04:42.040> is<00:04:42.520> more<00:04:42.970> repetitive

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
actually the content is more repetitive

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.390 
actually the content is more repetitive
in<00:04:43.720> different<00:04:44.020> courses<00:04:44.170> that<00:04:44.290> you<00:04:44.500> take<00:04:44.740> for

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
in different courses that you take for

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.580 
in different courses that you take for
example<00:04:45.490> for<00:04:46.030> pop<00:04:46.180> sculptures<00:04:46.690> I<00:04:46.930> thought

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
example for pop sculptures I thought

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.930 
example for pop sculptures I thought
that<00:04:47.740> after<00:04:47.830> that<00:04:48.070> class<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.460> would<00:04:48.610> never<00:04:48.730> use

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
that after that class I would never use

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.570 
that after that class I would never use
the<00:04:49.060> constants<00:04:49.450> again<00:04:49.660> oh<00:04:49.840> no<00:04:49.990> no<00:04:50.440> no<00:04:50.620> no<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:51.190> was
