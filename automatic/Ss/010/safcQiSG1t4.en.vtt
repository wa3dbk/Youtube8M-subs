00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.130
 [Music] 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.049
 and well hello to all of you 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.040
 maxims two video game cracks I hope 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.320
 that you're fine 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.330
 me it's going very well I hope that 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.960
 your return went well 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.480
 and yes back to reality but that 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.640
 do not prevent me from making you more 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.380
 videos to present you today a 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.800
 new crash is today about the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.440
 game out so is it before starting the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.890
 just make a little precision 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.239
 is that as you could see on 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.870
 the other videos I'm doing a gameplay 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.190
 for all the games at the end of the video but 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.080
 unfortunately for this game I do not have 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.420
 could recover the gameplay simply 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.980
 is that the software has bugged several 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.610
 times when I wanted to save 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.050
 the game so it sucked me so much of the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.760
 redo each time so I decided 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.190
 to drop so if you want 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.050
 see a gameplay of this game so 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.200
 do not hesitate to go see on youtube y 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.270
 is full I think so that's it then 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.590
 it's gone so you go in the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.100
 description just below the video 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.040
 as usual where you will go on the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.740
 mega website or irhal archives so you 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.550
 click on download so it takes 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.860
 a second not even that's so you 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.250
 have licked so obviously I 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.430
 advise to download install or 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.850
 a rare it is really a software of 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.940
 base to be able to add archives 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.979
 anchored extracting archives etc etc 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.260
 so as you can see in 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.799
 archived there is the back and crack that I have 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.479
 put in case 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.450
 so there is just an extension of 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.460
 the application the torrent file and the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.940
 complicates so first look at the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.180
 config 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.159
 it's really the main thing to 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.650
 watch before downloading a game 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.560
 so here it is that appears on the screen 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.760
 but anyway you have it too 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.549
 then you double click on the 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.100
 torrent file and this without will 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.890
 automatically in the software a 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.420
 micro torrent so it's 3 giga so 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.280
 it's going really fast in half an hour 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.980
 you have it if you have a good 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.680
 connection good slope bandwidth 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.480
 you have it 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.609
 so that's after once these 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.760
 download so you have the game 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.680
 you install it then me it is 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.319
 usually in the 2 of which the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.390
 folder downloads so to the east 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.849
 wal mart 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.010
 so you have the information file 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.530
 and the iso file so you can 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.420
 delete information files 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.599
 do not need it double click is 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.500
 simply on the iso file so 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.629
 obviously for this game you have to 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.819
 to have mentawaÃ¯ which I repeat to 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.739
 every time or other software that you 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.549
 prefer to be able to mount 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.669
 virtual drives 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.760
 so there the virtual drive appeared 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:05.290
 here so be you double click on it 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.169
 so I'm doing them is so you run 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.189
 this app automatically 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.230
 anyway you do not have the 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.709
 choice you must open 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.870
 a file 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.090
 but usually if you have 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.400
 other games that asks you 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.620
 to run set-up automatically you 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.919
 click or you go directly 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.720
 in your virtual drive and you 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.449
 launch the application by double clicking 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.760
 here so we go we do yes for the 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:33.579
 administration right 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.840
 so there a horrible music which I 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.329
 will cut his editing because it's 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.359
 really a music that I hate 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.370
 so we do a stall and we wait 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.709
 so it'll take a few minutes so 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.150
 I'm going to cut the video we end up 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.750
 right away for the continuation and end of 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.879
 Installation 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.189
 Well it is now found to 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.109
 the rest and the end of the installation 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.870
 so you go to your hard drive 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.220
 not that we click here 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.439
 so as you can see the name of the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.849
 game automatically appears too you 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.280
 do not need to go in the 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.799
 folder program files so you double 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.599
 click on the name of the game you go 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:12.129
 in the folder by now with win32 so 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.250
 we put that aside now you 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.310
 go to your virtual drive here 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.639
 you go to the walt matt folder 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.470
 been ariz win32 and here you have the 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.000
 crack so it's exactly the same 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.520
 also that are in the archived 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.230
 it's just that I put in case if 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.370
 you do not have it you never know 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.770
 so we slip this in there and we do 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.300
 copy and replaced and here you have 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.930
 the game in your possession 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.220
 so he has bets so so you just have 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.440
 to double click on it if it does not 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.630
 not work you run it as 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.190
 as administrator and if it works 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.220
 still not enough that you do not have 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.820
 the right configuration for 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.790
 play this game so check be as 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:01.030
 check your configuration before 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.470
 to play the game and even of course 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.840
 before installing and 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.940
 Download 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.650
 it's something to do for all 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.480
 games that crack so here I have 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.370
 finished for this tutorial so do not hesitate 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.040
 to put a green thumb to put a 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.950
 comment if you like these kinds of 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.230
 game there if you do not know this game there 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.830

 considerable difference between the page and the twitter

 the world but I answer them 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.670
 when there is a tweet I do not answer 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.420
 all the time so that's afterwards for the
