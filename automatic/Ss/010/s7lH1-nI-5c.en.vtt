now we have the increasing diesel price
prices<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:21.040> have<00:01:21.220> really<00:01:21.579> put<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.820> stop<00:01:22.090> to

some things people can't afford to go

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.910 
some things people can't afford to go
out<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.249> look<00:01:24.579> around<00:01:24.700> for<00:01:25.060> fish<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.619> that

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
out and look around for fish so that

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.859 
out and look around for fish so that
industry<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.520> really<00:01:27.729> being<00:01:28.119> challenged<00:01:28.630> and

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
able to eat fresh fish you know that's

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.499 
able to eat fresh fish you know that's
that's<00:01:59.499> big<00:02:00.340> reasons<00:02:00.759> why<00:02:00.819> people<00:02:01.329> come<00:02:01.450> here

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
that's big reasons why people come here

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.149 
that's big reasons why people come here
to<00:02:01.689> Monterey<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.229> what<00:02:02.409> separates<00:02:02.770> Monterey

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
to Monterey and what separates Monterey

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.870 
to Monterey and what separates Monterey
from<00:02:03.459> other<00:02:03.639> other<00:02:04.450> areas<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:05.979> so<00:02:06.639> there's

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
from other other areas and so so there's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.940 
from other other areas and so so there's
that<00:02:06.969> linkage<00:02:07.389> as<00:02:07.539> well<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.470> city<00:02:08.709> is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
that linkage as well and the city is

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.370 
that linkage as well and the city is
doing<00:02:09.160> basically<00:02:10.149> all<00:02:10.390> its<00:02:10.539> can<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.990> support

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
doing basically all its can to support

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.800 
doing basically all its can to support
that<00:02:11.500> industry<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.310> work<00:02:13.209> out<00:02:13.390> creative
