i<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.329> EMPs<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.740> i<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.369> playing

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
i have EMPs because i right now playing

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.999 
i have EMPs because i right now playing
a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.630> drop<00:01:39.840> zone<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.530> i<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.740> fun

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
a lot of drop zone because i have fun

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.889 
a lot of drop zone because i have fun
with<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.610> normally<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.600> slot

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
with that but normally in that slot

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.760 
with that but normally in that slot
would<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.470> tactical<00:01:44.220> insertions<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.770> i'm

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
would be tactical insertions and i'm

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.230 
would be tactical insertions and i'm
gonna<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.130> EMP<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> rest<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.030> class

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
gonna have EMP and the rest of my class

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
gonna have EMP and the rest of my class
because<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.259> plane<00:01:49.439> drops<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.920> i

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
because that's one plane drops on like i

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.530 
because that's one plane drops on like i
said<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.490> i'm<00:01:50.850> not<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.180> mention<00:01:51.329> it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
said but i'm not going to mention it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.080 
said but i'm not going to mention it
because<00:01:52.430> tactical<00:01:53.430> insertion<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.939> take

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
because tactical insertion will take

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.670 
because tactical insertion will take

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
at a disadvantage let's just say for

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.850 
at a disadvantage let's just say for
example<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.790> get<00:04:55.940> a<00:04:55.970> hitmarker<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:57.770> know

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
example you get a hitmarker you know

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.170 
example you get a hitmarker you know
that<00:04:58.070> hit<00:04:58.310> marker<00:04:58.670> is<00:04:58.790> probably<00:04:59.000> going<00:04:59.120> to

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
that hit marker is probably going to

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.960 
that hit marker is probably going to
cost<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.480> your<00:04:59.600> life<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.370> know<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.400> try<00:05:01.940> to

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.330 
the as50 is my second favourite sniper
rifle<00:05:19.430> other<00:05:19.700> than<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.450> MSR<00:05:20.900> they<00:05:21.740> have<00:05:21.890> 50<00:05:22.310> I

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
rifle other than the MSR they have 50 I

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.010 
rifle other than the MSR they have 50 I
probably<00:05:22.760> have<00:05:22.970> more<00:05:23.000> quad<00:05:23.420> feeds<00:05:23.690> with<00:05:23.870> it

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
probably have more quad feeds with it

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.050 
probably have more quad feeds with it
than<00:05:24.260> any<00:05:24.470> other<00:05:24.650> sniper<00:05:24.950> rifle<00:05:25.370> is<00:05:25.490> just<00:05:25.760> so

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
than any other sniper rifle is just so

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.630 
than any other sniper rifle is just so
funny<00:05:26.330> use<00:05:26.570> I<00:05:26.720> like<00:05:26.900> using<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.950> default<00:05:28.310> scope

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
funny use I like using the default scope

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.450 
funny use I like using the default scope
the<00:05:28.880> little<00:05:29.210> zoom<00:05:29.420> I<00:05:29.710> just<00:05:30.710> feel<00:05:30.890> a<00:05:31.130> lot<00:05:31.430> more

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
the little zoom I just feel a lot more

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.360 
the little zoom I just feel a lot more
comfortable<00:05:31.880> like<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.480> and<00:05:32.990> by<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.410> way<00:05:33.530> I'm

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
comfortable like that and by the way I'm

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.640 
comfortable like that and by the way I'm
lazy<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:35.090> all<00:05:35.390> admitted<00:05:35.840> i<00:05:36.170> don't<00:05:36.440> like

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
lazy I all admitted i don't like

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.500 
lazy I all admitted i don't like
spawning<00:05:37.010> in<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.550> you<00:05:37.790> know<00:05:37.910> zooming<00:05:38.360> in

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
spawning in and you know zooming in

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.580 
spawning in and you know zooming in
pressing<00:05:38.960> B<00:05:40.600> so<00:05:41.600> you<00:05:41.660> know<00:05:42.020> that's<00:05:42.230> most

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
pressing B so you know that's most

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.030 
pressing B so you know that's most
mostly<00:05:43.960> why<00:05:44.960> he's<00:05:45.110> a<00:05:45.140> little<00:05:45.410> scope<00:05:45.680> as<00:05:45.830> well

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
mostly why he's a little scope as well

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.460 
mostly why he's a little scope as well
but<00:05:46.310> overall<00:05:46.790> it's<00:05:47.060> just<00:05:47.300> this<00:05:47.720> is<00:05:47.780> just<00:05:47.960> a

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
but overall it's just this is just a

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.470 
but overall it's just this is just a
beast<00:05:48.770> of<00:05:48.950> weapon<00:05:49.370> I<00:05:49.520> rarely<00:05:49.760> get<00:05:50.000> hit<00:05:50.150> markers

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
beast of weapon I rarely get hit markers

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.510 
beast of weapon I rarely get hit markers
with<00:05:50.630> it<00:05:50.810> and<00:05:51.080> it's<00:05:51.440> just<00:05:51.620> overall<00:05:52.010> really<00:05:52.310> fun

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
with it and it's just overall really fun

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.870 
with it and it's just overall really fun
and<00:05:52.730> have<00:05:52.880> marksmen<00:05:53.450> on<00:05:53.480> it<00:05:53.950> I<00:05:54.950> don't<00:05:55.760> know

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
and have marksmen on it I don't know

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.610 
and have marksmen on it I don't know
steady<00:05:56.540> aim<00:05:56.690> really<00:05:56.960> doesn't<00:05:57.290> do<00:05:57.350> it<00:05:57.440> for<00:05:57.470> me

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
steady aim really doesn't do it for me

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.770 
steady aim really doesn't do it for me
with<00:05:57.860> like<00:05:58.070> semi<00:05:58.610> automatics<00:05:59.180> it's<00:05:59.510> more<00:05:59.720> of

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
with like semi automatics it's more of

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.750 
with like semi automatics it's more of
bolt<00:06:00.230> actions<00:06:00.650> where<00:06:00.830> I<00:06:00.860> like<00:06:01.100> using<00:06:01.250> studying

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
bolt actions where I like using studying

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.540 
bolt actions where I like using studying
so<00:06:02.030> there<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.330> go<00:06:02.360> with<00:06:02.630> that<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:03.140> here<00:06:04.040> my

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
so there you go with that and here my
