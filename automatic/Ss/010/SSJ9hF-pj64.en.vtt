to be the Ferrari f50 you can see trying
to<00:01:09.070> get<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:09.310> sideways<00:01:09.700> in<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.880> first<00:01:10.149> corner

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
to get it sideways in the first corner

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.540 
to get it sideways in the first corner
but<00:01:10.780> can't<00:01:11.140> really<00:01:11.409> can't<00:01:11.920> really<00:01:12.130> do<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.310> it's

but can't really can't really do it it's
very<00:01:12.880> difficult<00:01:13.179> to<00:01:13.509> get<00:01:13.690> this<00:01:13.840> car<00:01:14.080> sideways

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
very difficult to get this car sideways

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.310 
very difficult to get this car sideways
very<00:01:15.070> difficult<00:01:15.610> just<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.690> way<00:01:16.810> it's<00:01:16.990> set<00:01:17.259> up

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
very difficult just the way it's set up

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.210 
very difficult just the way it's set up
with<00:01:18.130> its<00:01:18.280> mid<00:01:19.090> engine<00:01:19.450> configuration<00:01:20.259> and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
with its mid engine configuration and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.850 
with its mid engine configuration and
its<00:01:21.399> suspension<00:01:21.820> setup<00:01:22.390> it's<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.259> great<00:01:23.440> grip

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
its suspension setup it's a great grip

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.270 
its suspension setup it's a great grip
car<00:01:24.160> but<00:01:24.899> not<00:01:25.899> that<00:01:26.229> great<00:01:26.470> for<00:01:26.530> drifting<00:01:27.130> if

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
car but not that great for drifting if

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.810 
car but not that great for drifting if
you<00:01:27.369> know<00:01:27.490> what<00:01:27.580> I<00:01:27.610> mean<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:29.399> it's<00:01:30.399> in<00:01:30.700> this

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
you know what I mean but it's in this

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.899 
you know what I mean but it's in this

comments if you guys would prefer these
videos<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.729> telemetry<00:01:40.330> or<00:01:40.899> without

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
videos with telemetry or without

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.800 
videos with telemetry or without
telemetry<00:01:41.710> because<00:01:42.310> i<00:01:42.429> did<00:01:43.149> not<00:01:43.179> use<00:01:43.569> it<00:01:43.720> in

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
telemetry because i did not use it in

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.630 
telemetry because i did not use it in
the<00:01:43.899> previous<00:01:44.200> video<00:01:44.409> but<00:01:44.920> i<00:01:44.950> am<00:01:45.130> using<00:01:45.369> it<00:01:45.549> in

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
the previous video but i am using it in

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.210 
the previous video but i am using it in
this<00:01:45.759> video<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.420> i<00:01:46.630> think<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:46.899> might<00:01:47.049> help<00:01:48.040> you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
this video and i think it might help you

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.920 
this video and i think it might help you
guys<00:01:48.369> out<00:01:48.610> because<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.119> can<00:01:49.270> see<00:01:49.540> when<00:01:49.899> i

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
guys out because you can see when i

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.870 
guys out because you can see when i
apply<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.409> gasps<00:01:50.710> when<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.100> apply<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.549> brake

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
apply to gasps when I apply the brake

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.350 
apply to gasps when I apply the brake
when<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.119> use<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.630> clutch<00:01:53.549> how<00:01:54.549> much<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:54.939> counter

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
when I use the clutch how much I counter

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.660 
when I use the clutch how much I counter
steer<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.680> just<00:01:56.860> think<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.159> might<00:01:57.310> help<00:01:57.520> you

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
steer and I just think it might help you

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.850 
steer and I just think it might help you
guys<00:01:57.820> out<00:01:58.060> by<00:01:58.450> see<00:01:58.810> being<00:01:59.200> able<00:01:59.439> to<00:01:59.500> see<00:01:59.680> that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
guys out by see being able to see that

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.090 
guys out by see being able to see that
telemetry<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:02.170> can<00:02:02.320> see<00:02:02.500> trying<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.890> get<00:02:03.009> it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
telemetry you can see trying to get it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.830 
telemetry you can see trying to get it
sideways<00:02:03.490> there<00:02:03.729> again<00:02:04.060> but<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.390> car<00:02:04.600> just

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
sideways there again but the car just

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.139 
sideways there again but the car just
does<00:02:05.049> not<00:02:05.259> want<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.490> kick<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.390> back<00:02:07.570> end<00:02:07.840> out

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
does not want to kick the back end out

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.130 
does not want to kick the back end out
and<00:02:10.980> under<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.070> covered<00:02:12.370> bridge<00:02:12.900> give<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.989> a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
and under the covered bridge give it a

the for a mid-engine car the Ford GT
really<00:02:32.530> really<00:02:33.130> surprised<00:02:33.579> me<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.230> impressed

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
me as far as this this drift challenge

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.660 
me as far as this this drift challenge
goes<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.910> mean<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:41.380> was<00:02:41.500> my<00:02:41.680> personal<00:02:42.190> favorite

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
goes I mean it was my personal favorite

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.240 
goes I mean it was my personal favorite
out<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.000> three<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:44.799> this<00:02:44.920> video

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
out of the three in this in this video

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.110 
out of the three in this in this video
and<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:46.660> was<00:02:47.170> really<00:02:47.380> amazed<00:02:47.799> because<00:02:48.040> if<00:02:48.609> you

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
and it was really amazed because if you

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.750 
and it was really amazed because if you
see<00:02:49.359> here<00:02:49.600> watch<00:02:49.840> here<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.260> really<00:02:50.650> holds<00:02:51.370> that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
see here watch here it really holds that

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.970 
see here watch here it really holds that
drift<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.449> whole

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
drift and whole

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.520 
drift and whole
that<00:02:53.129> angle<00:02:53.489> well<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:54.420> lot<00:02:54.959> better<00:02:55.200> than<00:02:55.440> I

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
that angle well a lot better than I

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.199 
that angle well a lot better than I
thought<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.800> would<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.250> certainly<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:57.000> lot

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
thought it would and certainly a lot

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.140 
thought it would and certainly a lot
better<00:02:57.510> than<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.680> f50<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.879> that's<00:03:00.810> probably

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
better than the f50 and that's probably

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.240 
better than the f50 and that's probably
due<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.450> fact<00:03:03.629> that<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:04.250> supercharged

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
due to the fact that it's supercharged

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.420 
due to the fact that it's supercharged
and<00:03:06.620> you're<00:03:07.620> getting<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:07.950> little<00:03:08.280> bit<00:03:08.400> of

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
and you're getting that little bit of

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.180 
and you're getting that little bit of
extra<00:03:08.610> boost<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.230> as<00:03:10.470> you're<00:03:10.739> drifting

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
extra boost as you as you're drifting

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.400 
extra boost as you as you're drifting
and<00:03:11.280> as<00:03:11.400> you're<00:03:11.580> initiating<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.810> drift<00:03:13.080> and

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
and as you're initiating the drift and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.150 
and as you're initiating the drift and
it<00:03:14.099> helps<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.459> keep<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.849> rear<00:03:15.060> wheels<00:03:16.160> just
