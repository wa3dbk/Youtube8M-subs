like to do sometimes depending on the
two<00:02:34.870> fabrics<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.410> I've<00:02:35.620> used<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.640> can<00:02:36.880> see

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
two fabrics that I've used you can see

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.570 
two fabrics that I've used you can see
the<00:02:37.540> colors<00:02:37.959> from<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.680> fabric<00:02:39.160> underneath

the colors from the fabric underneath

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.420 
the colors from the fabric underneath
showing<00:02:40.150> through<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.600> usually<00:02:41.380> like<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.650> iron<00:02:42.220> a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
showing through I usually like to iron a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.630 
showing through I usually like to iron a
little<00:02:42.550> piece<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.019> stabilizer<00:02:44.019> or

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
little piece of stabilizer or

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.699 
little piece of stabilizer or
interfacing<00:02:45.640> on<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.720> notice<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.350> and

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
interfacing on that if I notice that and

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.850 
interfacing on that if I notice that and
then<00:02:48.519> when<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.760> sew<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.299> it<00:02:49.750> brightens<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.530> up<00:02:50.709> a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
then when I sew it it brightens it up a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.400 
then when I sew it it brightens it up a
little<00:02:51.040> bit<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.690> do<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.019> the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
little bit so you can do that the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.350 
little bit so you can do that the
instructions<00:02:54.280> for<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.610> pattern<00:02:54.940> don't<00:02:55.150> say

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
that that's something I've learned since

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.050 
that that's something I've learned since
the<00:02:57.580> pattern<00:02:57.790> was<00:02:58.150> written<00:02:59.640> I'm<00:03:00.640> just<00:03:00.910> gonna

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
the pattern was written I'm just gonna

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.320 
the pattern was written I'm just gonna
stick<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.540> couple<00:03:01.840> pins<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.470> there<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.150> I'm

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
a top and a bottom make sure that when

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.500 
a top and a bottom make sure that when
you<00:03:28.750> sew<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.410> you've<00:03:30.040> got<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.489> top<00:03:30.700> here<00:03:31.330> so

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
you sew it you've got the top here so

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.820 
you sew it you've got the top here so
that<00:03:32.350> when<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.739> flip<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.070> over

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
that when you flip it over

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.190 
that when you flip it over
tapas<00:03:34.340> this<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.390> top<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.900> border

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
tapas this is the top of the border

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.680 
tapas this is the top of the border
because<00:03:36.560> when<00:03:37.190> we<00:03:37.370> make<00:03:37.640> our<00:03:37.820> wallet<00:03:38.390> it's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
because when we make our wallet it's

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.440 
because when we make our wallet it's
going<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.530> close<00:03:39.890> like<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.880> this<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.300> the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
going to close like that so this is the

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.390 
going to close like that so this is the
part<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.720> you'll<00:03:42.020> see<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:43.190> pattern

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
part that you'll see so just the pattern

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.920 
part that you'll see so just the pattern
explains<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.240> you<00:03:44.480> but<00:03:44.600> make<00:03:44.780> sure

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
explains that to you but make sure

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.270 
explains that to you but make sure
you've<00:03:45.110> got<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.350> positioned<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.250> right

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
you've got that positioned in the right

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.210 
you've got that positioned in the right
place<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.450> now<00:03:47.630> we're<00:03:47.810> ready<00:03:47.990> to<00:03:48.350> add<00:03:48.560> the

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
place and now we're ready to add the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.040 
place and now we're ready to add the
loop<00:03:49.430> size<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:51.350> piece<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.860> velcro<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:53.050> we

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
loop size of the piece of velcro and we

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.890 
loop size of the piece of velcro and we
are<00:03:54.110> going<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.770> put<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.310> right<00:03:55.520> below<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.690> line

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
are going to put it right below the line

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.780 
are going to put it right below the line
that<00:03:57.260> we<00:03:57.380> marked<00:03:57.620> five<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.280> three-quarter

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
that we marked five and three-quarter

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.490 
that we marked five and three-quarter
inch<00:03:58.940> from<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.270> top<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.750> we<00:03:59.870> want<00:04:00.080> it<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.230> be

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
inch from the top and we want it to be

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.160 
inch from the top and we want it to be
centered<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.970> should<00:04:02.270> be<00:04:02.480> about<00:04:02.780> two

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
centered so it should be about two

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.500 
centered so it should be about two
inches<00:04:03.200> from<00:04:03.800> each<00:04:04.040> side<00:04:06.820> on<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.000> bottom<00:04:08.360> of

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
inches from each side on the bottom of

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.490 
inches from each side on the bottom of
that<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:13.270> couldn't<00:04:14.270> live<00:04:14.390> without<00:04:14.570> my<00:04:14.930> washable

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
that I couldn't live without my washable

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.890 
that I couldn't live without my washable
glue<00:04:15.530> stick<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:19.220> I'm<00:04:19.640> just<00:04:19.910> going<00:04:20.150> to<00:04:20.299> align

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
glue stick and I'm just going to align

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.130 
glue stick and I'm just going to align
right<00:04:21.820> there<00:04:24.190> after<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.250> have<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.870> one<00:04:27.020> in
