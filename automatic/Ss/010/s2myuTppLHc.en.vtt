00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.450
 there are as many challenges as trees in the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.450
 forest 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.040
 the roads are narrow the slopes 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.960
 they are steep and your load is heavy you are 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.939
 away from everything that resembles the 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.790
 civilization and you 're at the mercy of the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.500
 mother nature you should pay attention 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.600
 to each and every one of the curves 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.879
 pronounced and soft ditches 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.880
 the rocks the trunks and the branches 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.270
 hanging 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.710
 there is no difficult decision what 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 extreme is your routine 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.809
 and there is nobody else but you 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.940
 but you 're not alone you have one of the 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.200
 stronger and more reliable partners with 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.200
 those that can work 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.520
 and you know it will take you where you want and 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.929
 always has always done it 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.409
 because the 738 rods is designed to 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.409
 full 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 and when you are strong you must assume 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.780
 responsibilities for that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.970
 the most powerful scania engine 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.299
 satisfies the most demanding demands of the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.299
 world without yielding a horsepower 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:49.590
 leaders advance by materialists 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.590
 and we never make concessions
