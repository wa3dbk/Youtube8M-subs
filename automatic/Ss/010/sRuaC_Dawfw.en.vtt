problem<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.370> sometimes<00:02:59.880> it's

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
problem here is that sometimes it's

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.310 
problem here is that sometimes it's
difficult<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:01.250> relax<00:03:02.250> when<00:03:02.700> putting<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.420> these

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
difficult to relax when putting on these

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.520 
difficult to relax when putting on these
shirts<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:05.070> Mattel<00:03:05.670> makes<00:03:06.030> because<00:03:06.530> they

difficult<00:03:08.070> but<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.370> time<00:03:08.670> around<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.269> think

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
difficult but this time around I think

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.160 
difficult but this time around I think
this<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.110> new<00:03:10.920> shirt<00:03:11.220> design<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.630> new

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170

way<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.380> clamp<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.070> but<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:14.489> as

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
way to clamp it but it's just as

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.470 
way to clamp it but it's just as
difficult<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:16.310> really<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.970> Brock

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
