00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
go on landscape orientation but i found

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
go on landscape orientation but i found
that<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> b<00:01:09.630> button<00:01:09.780> didn't<00:01:10.170> work<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that the b button didn't work on that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.890 
that the b button didn't work on that
and<00:01:11.040> also<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.880> kind<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> hard<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.720> because

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and also was kind of hard to see because

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
and also was kind of hard to see because
it<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.229> invisible<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
it was invisible and it was on the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
it was invisible and it was on the
screen<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.720> ahead<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.110> into<00:01:16.229> portrait

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
screen so go ahead and go into portrait

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
screen so go ahead and go into portrait
too<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.759> bigger<00:01:17.970> than<00:01:18.030> portrait

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
too because it's bigger than portrait

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.929 
too because it's bigger than portrait
one<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:19.860> realistic<00:01:20.159> looking<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
one and it's more realistic looking and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.800 
one and it's more realistic looking and
all<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> buttons<00:01:22.320> work<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
all the buttons work so we're going to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:37.410
