00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.080
 salad and rice salad ferdinand breed 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.349
 the same plants are treated 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.590
 cold germ that means they need 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.789
 for a week, a cold period of five 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 to ten degrees 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.100
 That could be a cupboard so if you are there 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.630
 can easily move for a while 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.269
 can you do that? 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.109
 I have a nice location with me 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.109
 in the neighboring building 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:42.030
 Of course that goes into a room 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 greenhouse with a corresponding 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.710
 hood you can also use marine cups 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.950
 yogurt mug use 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.149
 I'll planting pots filled out with 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.309
 earth why earth and none 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:00.000
 Compost of this earth is weak 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.680
 the plants are getting used to them 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.809
 train the root for nutrients 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.659
 Search and only when the plants 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.670
 strong enough then the fertilizer comes 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.670
 and liquid of the addition 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.930
 method elaborate a glass a whole 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:31.850
 conventional venue earth again 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:41.310
 push and distribute farest better 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:44.179
 and the less afterwards isolate the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.940
 Cover with a thin layer of earth 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:52.429
 half a centimeter is enough and 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:58.709
 fall down and again with the girls 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:02:00.979
 you could easily press this 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:05.330
 But there the seed feels again 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.330
 It actually is a game of chance 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.019
 and now my junkyard is coming too 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.620
 again for use 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:23.510
 set up rules now are the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.510
 plant a nice climate 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.030
 that's just the alternative to go 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.030
 As before, ordered a bag of dollars
