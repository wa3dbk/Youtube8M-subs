Statue of Liberty and as we were coming
back<00:00:19.279> ready<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.580> back<00:00:21.390> into<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> dock<00:00:22.130> we<00:00:23.130> we

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
back ready to back into the dock we we

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.390 
back ready to back into the dock we we
saw<00:00:23.999> this<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.480> saw<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.499> plane<00:00:25.919> and<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
saw this I I saw the plane and the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.329 
saw this I I saw the plane and the
helicopter<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.300> very<00:00:27.689> close<00:00:27.960> proximity<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.829> I

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
helicopter in very close proximity and I

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:30.800 
helicopter in very close proximity and I
thought<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.999> really<00:00:30.359> close<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.749> I

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
thought this is really close and I

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.030 
thought this is really close and I
wanted<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.079> take<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> picture<00:00:31.409> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> two

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
wanted to take a picture of the two

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.040 
wanted to take a picture of the two
together<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> same<00:00:33.300> photograph<00:00:33.810> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
together in the same photograph and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.529 
together in the same photograph and
instead<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.890> ended<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.340> taking<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.970> picture<00:00:36.390> of

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
instead I ended up taking the picture of

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.319 
instead I ended up taking the picture of
the<00:00:36.690> crash<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.260> did<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.190> look<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.609> you<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the crash and did it look to you as the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.439 
the crash and did it look to you as the
mayor<00:00:39.510> said<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.379> was<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.949> plane<00:00:41.449> that

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
mayor said that it was the plane that

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.389 
mayor said that it was the plane that
essentially<00:00:42.989> rear-ended<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> helicopter

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
essentially rear-ended the helicopter

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.209 
essentially rear-ended the helicopter
that's<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> looks<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.010> wing

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that's what it looks like the the wing

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.369 
that's what it looks like the the wing
of<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.579> plane<00:00:47.760> seemed<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.780> come<00:00:49.019> down<00:00:49.050> as

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
of the plane seemed to have come down as

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.779 
of the plane seemed to have come down as
you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.769> from<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.039> photographs<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you can see from the photographs the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.130 
you can see from the photographs the
plane<00:00:51.059> seemed<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.690> bit<00:00:51.899> higher

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
plane seemed to be a little bit higher

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.979 
plane seemed to be a little bit higher
than<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> helicopter<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> plane<00:00:54.120> first<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
than the helicopter the plane first the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.169 
than the helicopter the plane first the
wing<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.589> plane<00:00:55.679> first<00:00:56.100> came<00:00:56.339> down<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
wing of the plane first came down the

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.000 
wing of the plane first came down the
plane<00:00:57.420> started<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> come<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.589> then<00:00:58.769> in<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
plane started to come down and then in a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.329 
plane started to come down and then in a
later<00:00:59.129> picture<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.760> see<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.710> propellers

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
later picture you see the the propellers

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.579 
later picture you see the the propellers
of<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> helicopter<00:01:03.329> starting<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.230> separate

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
of the helicopter starting to separate

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
of the helicopter starting to separate
right<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.820> picture

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
right there that for now that picture

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.730 
right there that for now that picture
can<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.930> back<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.440> picture<00:01:07.710> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
can we just go back to the picture that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.319 
can we just go back to the picture that
we<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.100> had<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> air<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
we just had on the air there was that

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:10.730 
we just had on the air there was that
the<00:01:09.509> picture<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.140> took<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the picture that you took when you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.469 
the picture that you took when you
notice<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.430> plane<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.820> helicopter

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
notice that this plane in the helicopter

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.569 
notice that this plane in the helicopter
were<00:01:12.659> sort<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.079> close<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> each<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.369> this

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
were sort of close to each other so this

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.120 
were sort of close to each other so this
picture<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.659> actually<00:01:15.869> taken<00:01:16.530> literally

picture here is actually taken literally

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670 
picture here is actually taken literally
seconds<00:01:17.850> before<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.600> plane<00:01:18.840> clipped<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
seconds before the plane clipped the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.240 
seconds before the plane clipped the
helicopters<00:01:20.310> before<00:01:21.049> this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.259> right<00:01:22.619> after

you saw the way you saw the wing fall
off<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.009> plane<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.399> zoom<00:01:32.759> out

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
off of the plane if you zoom out

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.600 
off of the plane if you zoom out
actually<00:01:33.509> there's<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.869> photograph<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.950> the

plane was descending it was it was
lowering<00:02:12.610> its<00:02:12.790> altitude<00:02:13.269> could<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.540> tell

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
lowering its altitude could you tell

lowering its altitude could you tell
it's<00:02:13.989> really<00:02:14.200> hard<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.709> say<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.190> happened<00:02:15.700> so

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
it's really hard to say it happened so

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's really hard to say it happened so
quickly<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.660> was<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.019> trying<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.290> get<00:02:17.470> my

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
quickly and I was just trying to get my

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.470 
quickly and I was just trying to get my
camera<00:02:17.860> ready<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.400> take<00:02:18.670> pictures<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.030> both<00:02:19.299> of

them in the same shot so it's really

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.190

thinking when you were looking up into

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.380 
thinking when you were looking up into
the<00:02:35.650> sky<00:02:35.739> well<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.430> was<00:02:36.640> thinking<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.030> could<00:02:37.239> be

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the sky well I was thinking it could be

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.150

from<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.810> movie<00:02:38.200> or<00:02:38.319> something<00:02:38.709> because<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.099> know

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
from a movie or something because I know

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
York but when I realized that it was
