here's the other one so this one we were
on<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.869> power<00:01:42.079> plug<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.710> moves<00:01:43.009> really

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
on the power plug this moves really

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.770 
on the power plug this moves really
effective<00:01:43.700> one<00:01:43.790> power-play<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.270> see<00:01:44.540> what<00:01:44.750> I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
effective one power-play I see what I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.359 
effective one power-play I see what I
tend<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.259> do<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:45.590> play<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.070> puck<00:01:46.189> down

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
tend to do is just play the puck down

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.490 
tend to do is just play the puck down
low<00:01:46.579> a<00:01:46.610> lot<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.090> then<00:01:47.270> once<00:01:47.570> they've<00:01:47.840> AI<00:01:48.320> a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
low a lot and then once they've AI a

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.520 
low a lot and then once they've AI a
tendency<00:01:49.220> go<00:01:49.549> ups<00:01:49.759> see<00:01:50.450> right<00:01:50.899> here<00:01:51.110> this<00:01:51.350> was

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
tendency go ups see right here this was

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.889 
tendency go ups see right here this was
in<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.799> second<00:01:52.070> period<00:01:52.189> i<00:01:52.340> thinkin<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.750> i

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
in the second period i thinkin it a i

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.170 
in the second period i thinkin it a i
pinched<00:01:54.619> down

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
pinched down

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.220 
pinched down
and<00:01:55.300> Eric<00:01:56.020> pinches<00:01:56.350> in<00:01:56.500> gets<00:01:56.830> in<00:01:57.040> easy<00:01:57.460> easy

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
and Eric pinches in gets in easy easy

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.940 
and Eric pinches in gets in easy easy
one<00:01:59.230> timer<00:01:59.440> so<00:01:59.680> another<00:02:00.160> angle<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> eyes

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
one timer so another angle to a eyes

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.980 
one timer so another angle to a eyes
come<00:02:03.190> after<00:02:03.460> me<00:02:03.580> plus<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.030> human<00:02:04.360> because

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
come after me plus the human because

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.240 
come after me plus the human because
he's<00:02:05.140> just<00:02:05.410> thinking<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.770> I'm<00:02:05.890> going<00:02:05.980> to<00:02:06.070> try

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
he's just thinking that I'm going to try

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.130 
he's just thinking that I'm going to try
to<00:02:06.280> escape<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.790> that<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.150> be<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.390> hero<00:02:07.690> with<00:02:07.960> it

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
to escape to that and be a hero with it

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.139 
to escape to that and be a hero with it
so<00:02:08.710> there's<00:02:09.220> three<00:02:09.460> of<00:02:09.550> them<00:02:09.610> added<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.970> play

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
so there's three of them added to play

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.210 
so there's three of them added to play
the<00:02:10.330> other<00:02:10.420> computers<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.050> front<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.620> eric

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
the other computers in front and eric

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.860 
the other computers in front and eric
gets<00:02:12.370> an<00:02:12.520> easy<00:02:12.670> one<00:02:12.910> time<00:02:13.120> or<00:02:13.300> no<00:02:13.390> chance<00:02:13.690> with

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
gets an easy one time or no chance with

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.570 
gets an easy one time or no chance with
the<00:02:13.959> bullet<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.040> um<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:16.450> just<00:02:16.570> kind<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:16.990> a
