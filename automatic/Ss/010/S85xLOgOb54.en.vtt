00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
called a bit there or impress because

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.149 
called a bit there or impress because
the<00:01:46.909> door<00:01:47.149> catch<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.630> here<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.710> since<00:01:48.890> at<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.090 
twisted a little bit just pull it around
a<00:01:55.070> bit<00:01:55.219> there<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:55.969> go<00:01:56.289> now<00:01:57.289> see<00:01:57.500> it's<00:01:57.740> out<00:01:57.890> there

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
a bit there we go now see it's out there

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.260 
a bit there we go now see it's out there
you<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.460> put<00:01:58.610> one<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.759> your<00:01:58.850> little<00:01:58.969> sticky
