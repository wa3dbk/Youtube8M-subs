00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
to install the trigger into a flash that

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.799 
to install the trigger into a flash that
you<00:00:13.080> will<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.230> using<00:00:14.089> using<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.179> standard<00:00:15.570> flash

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.480 

fasten<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> adapter<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:23.009> flash<00:01:23.310> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
fasten the adapter and your flash is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:35.090 
fasten the adapter and your flash is
ready<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:30.049> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.409> other<00:01:31.740> end<00:01:33.920> plug<00:01:34.920> in

the other end of the cable into the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.090 
the other end of the cable into the
trigger

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:59.760 

and<00:01:46.320> we're<00:01:47.320> all<00:01:47.530> set<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.580> simple<00:01:58.770> turn

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
and we're all set it's that simple turn

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.110 
and we're all set it's that simple turn
on<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.070> flash<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.700> trigger<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:06.060> now<00:02:07.060> we

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
on the flash and the trigger and now we

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.680 
on the flash and the trigger and now we
can<00:02:07.479> set<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.110> trigger<00:02:09.270> into<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.360> settings

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
can set the trigger into the settings

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.680 
can set the trigger into the settings
that<00:02:10.869> we<00:02:10.959> want<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:14.550> we<00:02:15.550> discussed<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
that we want like we discussed in the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.460 
that we want like we discussed in the
second<00:02:17.080> part<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:18.160> tutorial<00:02:21.360> first<00:02:22.470> I'll

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
second part of the tutorial first I'll

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.710 
second part of the tutorial first I'll
demonstrate<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:26.050> single<00:02:26.440> shot<00:02:27.330> feature<00:02:28.330> of

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
demonstrate the single shot feature of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:40.410 
demonstrate the single shot feature of
the<00:02:29.080> trigger<00:02:36.600> snap<00:02:37.600> your<00:02:37.810> fingers<00:02:38.110> as<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:39.420> sound

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
the trigger snap your fingers as a sound

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.020 
the trigger snap your fingers as a sound
source<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.770> will<00:02:41.890> activate<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.750> flash

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
source and it will activate the flash

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.340 
source and it will activate the flash
here<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.330> multiple<00:02:46.750> shot<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:48.780> which<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
here is the multiple shot in which the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.180 
here is the multiple shot in which the
trigger<00:02:51.070> will<00:02:51.489> activate<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.090> flash<00:02:52.950> how<00:02:53.950> many

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
trigger will activate the flash how many

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.330 
trigger will activate the flash how many
ever<00:02:54.400> times<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.900> receives<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:57.239> sound<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:59.340> now

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
ever times it receives a sound and now

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.960 
ever times it receives a sound and now
we'll<00:03:00.549> try<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.090> strobe<00:03:01.600> Oh<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:03.370> which<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
we'll try the strobe Oh in which the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.610 
we'll try the strobe Oh in which the
trigger<00:03:07.209> will<00:03:08.140> activate<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:10.360> flash<00:03:10.630> how<00:03:11.380> many

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
trigger will activate the flash how many

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.600 
trigger will activate the flash how many
other<00:03:11.860> times<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.610> was<00:03:12.760> set<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.540> settings

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
other times it was set in the settings

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.670 
other times it was set in the settings
during<00:03:15.610> one<00:03:15.910> session<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.820> session<00:03:19.239> starts

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
during one session the session starts

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.009 
during one session the session starts
when<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.709> trigger<00:03:21.090> receives<00:03:22.620> sound<00:03:25.019> we'll

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
when the trigger receives sound we'll

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.820 
when the trigger receives sound we'll
try<00:03:26.260> setting<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.799> different<00:03:27.790> settings<00:03:28.120> in<00:03:28.540> the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
try setting it different settings in the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.300 
try setting it different settings in the
delays<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.630> strobe<00:03:31.870> oh<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.260> how<00:03:33.250> many

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
delays of the strobe oh and how many

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.960 
delays of the strobe oh and how many
times<00:03:33.760> one<00:03:34.720> strobo<00:03:35.200> session<00:03:36.299> will<00:03:38.730> activate<00:03:39.730> a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
times one strobo session will activate a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.780 
times one strobo session will activate a
flash<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.860> can<00:03:42.010> see<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.190> difference

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
part of the tutorial we'll try it this

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:08.599 
part of the tutorial we'll try it this
again<00:04:02.159> different<00:04:03.030> settings<00:04:07.280> as<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.430> may<00:04:08.579> have

again different settings as you may have

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.759 
again different settings as you may have
noticed<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.420> trigger<00:04:09.689> will<00:04:09.930> be<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.170> standby

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
noticed the trigger will be on standby

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.490 
noticed the trigger will be on standby
mode<00:04:11.069> after<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.489> is<00:04:11.609> set<00:04:12.139> indicating<00:04:13.139> that<00:04:13.379> it
