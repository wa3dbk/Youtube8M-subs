00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.790
 doctor soto 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.620
 If Jesus is the eternal son 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.130
 who is your mother that ends because according to Galatians 4 4 the posh has been 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.129
 for once a woman born under the law 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.050
 let's write today 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.099
 that the lic 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.630
 he said to talk 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.710
 of a woman who is talking 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.359
 but manida de jesÃºs 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.249
 not the sonship of him 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.560
 as the son of the eternal father 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.409
 and it's not that the father but did not have a relationship with the woman 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.760
 why ponce sanutri rally in vic in the trinity would there be a woman who 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.110
 Mother of jesus 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 this cache of the eternal supposes that grandson of the father 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.360
 but he different what is talking about the son according to the flesh 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.500
 when doctor soto 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.440
 optimized for the word 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.280
 that said he has been externally fathered by the father previously 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.650
 used term 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.200
 eternally begotten by the begotten father means 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.590
 that had a beginning said eternal reiterating 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.480
 it's not in the bible it's not a term 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.480
 Theological is not a biblical term either 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.980
 the expression is to say the concept actually we have to deal here the 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.940
 doctor soto said 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.820
 So we are in agreement on many things and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.240
 and we honestly disagree on many things because there is a lot of difference 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.170
 between thinking what the eternal posy of God which is a terminology that does not 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.040
 exists 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.750
 can be presented now 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.990
 if we speak of haiti said eternal of God 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.690
 we should think 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.420
 what in fact the father is eternally in big leagues said 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.110
 in this moment the father this one to be and they will have Doric also because 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.730
 we are in eternity 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.080
 we have to talk about time when jesus was created 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.860
 hoefken aside as day the trinity 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.080
 similar a shot the after this entente of eternity 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.740
 and we can not confuse times and eternity now because we are both 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.899
 different things 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.029
 the detainee is out of the times times were created 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.859
 now in space and time 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:24.069
 because of the human race we have to see why the origin of their 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.489
 commanded 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.760
 but the cues of exceeding has always been because God has been of Peron 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.919
 as usual 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.049
 it is a sign that the father 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.649
 There are those who recorded said 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:39.759
 and they have emanated from the Holy Spirit as it can be etc or eternal 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.809
 coexisting code to injuries the stick
