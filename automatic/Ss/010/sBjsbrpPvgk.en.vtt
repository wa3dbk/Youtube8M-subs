great
so<00:00:35.230> as<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:36.130> mentioned<00:00:36.520> this<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.820> part<00:00:37.090> of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
so as I mentioned this is part of

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.910 
so as I mentioned this is part of
psychos<00:00:37.510> premier<00:00:37.900> collection<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.620> it<00:00:38.740> does

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
psychos premier collection and it does

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.799 
psychos premier collection and it does
feature<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.310> kinetic<00:00:39.879> movement<00:00:40.120> which<00:00:40.570> means

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
feature a kinetic movement which means

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.080 
feature a kinetic movement which means
it's<00:00:41.379> basically<00:00:41.770> powered<00:00:42.280> by<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.520> movement

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
it's basically powered by the movement

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.209 
it's basically powered by the movement
of<00:00:43.210> your<00:00:43.329> wrist<00:00:43.629> back<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.289> forth<00:00:44.739> back<00:00:45.190> and

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
of your wrist back and forth back and

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.389 
of your wrist back and forth back and
forth<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:47.170> unique<00:00:47.469> feature<00:00:47.530> about<00:00:48.219> this

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
forth one unique feature about this

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.130 
forth one unique feature about this
watch<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.910> that<00:00:49.030> it<00:00:49.120> actually<00:00:49.270> senses

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
watch is that it actually senses

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.500 
watch is that it actually senses
inactivity<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:51.160> will<00:00:51.399> put<00:00:51.640> itself<00:00:51.910> to<00:00:52.180> sleep

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
inactivity and will put itself to sleep

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.380 
inactivity and will put itself to sleep
after<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.079> 24-hour<00:00:53.920> period<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.550> inactivity<00:00:54.789> and

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
after a 24-hour period of inactivity and

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.540 
after a 24-hour period of inactivity and
that's<00:00:56.170> especially<00:00:56.410> useful<00:00:56.920> for<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.370> watch

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
that's especially useful for a watch

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.040 
that's especially useful for a watch
like<00:00:57.789> this<00:00:57.850> considering<00:00:58.629> that<00:00:58.780> it's<00:00:58.960> a

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
like this considering that it's a

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.049 
like this considering that it's a
dressier<00:00:59.920> watch<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.460> most<00:01:00.609> people<00:01:00.850> probably

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
dressier watch and most people probably

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.750 
dressier watch and most people probably
wouldn't<00:01:01.629> wear<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:01.870> on<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.109> daily<00:01:02.440> basis<00:01:03.039> so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
wouldn't wear it on a daily basis so

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.520 
wouldn't wear it on a daily basis so
even<00:01:04.150> if<00:01:04.239> it<00:01:04.360> sits<00:01:04.570> in<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.809> drawer<00:01:05.050> for<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.320> few

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
even if it sits in the drawer for a few

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.160 
even if it sits in the drawer for a few
days<00:01:05.740> months<00:01:06.340> or<00:01:06.490> even<00:01:06.520> years<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.990> will

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
days months or even years it will

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.340 
days months or even years it will
essentially<00:01:08.590> shut<00:01:09.040> down<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.690> minute<00:01:11.200> our

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
essentially shut down it's a minute our

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.039 
essentially shut down it's a minute our
second<00:01:11.920> hand<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.400> go<00:01:13.210> into<00:01:13.360> essentially<00:01:13.900> a

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
second hand and go into essentially a

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.460 
second hand and go into essentially a
sleep<00:01:14.530> mode<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.360> date<00:01:16.570> will<00:01:16.869> continue<00:01:17.350> to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
sleep mode and the date will continue to

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.230 
sleep mode and the date will continue to
advance<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.159> date<00:01:18.340> up<00:01:18.549> here<00:01:18.700> will<00:01:18.850> continue

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
advance the date up here will continue

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240 
advance the date up here will continue
to<00:01:19.360> advance<00:01:19.689> even<00:01:19.900> while<00:01:20.290> it's<00:01:20.500> in<00:01:20.650> sleep<00:01:20.950> mode

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
to advance even while it's in sleep mode

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.880 
to advance even while it's in sleep mode
and<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.570> wake<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:22.900> up<00:01:23.020> all<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.380> need<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.590> do<00:01:23.710> is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
and to wake it up all you need to do is

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.530 
and to wake it up all you need to do is
just<00:01:24.130> give<00:01:24.280> it<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.460> little<00:01:24.579> shake<00:01:24.850> or<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.329> the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
just give it a little shake or just the

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.210 
just give it a little shake or just the
movement<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.259> your<00:01:26.380> wrist<00:01:26.650> will<00:01:26.890> essentially

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
movement of your wrist will essentially

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.399 
movement of your wrist will essentially
wake<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.700> up<00:01:27.790> it<00:01:28.030> will<00:01:28.659> then<00:01:28.900> proceed<00:01:29.200> to

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
wake it up it will then proceed to

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.920 
wake it up it will then proceed to
advance<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.220> correct<00:01:30.640> time<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.360> as<00:01:31.810> I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
advance to the correct time and as I

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.539 
advance to the correct time and as I
mentioned<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.380> will<00:01:32.530> actually<00:01:32.920> hold<00:01:33.250> that

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
mentioned it will actually hold that

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.670 
mentioned it will actually hold that
correct<00:01:33.909> time<00:01:34.090> for<00:01:34.420> up<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.720> about<00:01:34.900> four<00:01:35.290> years

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
correct time for up to about four years

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.450 
correct time for up to about four years
of<00:01:36.149> inactivity<00:01:37.149> so<00:01:37.540> that's<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.829> a<00:01:38.950> great

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
of inactivity so that's that's a great

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.469 
of inactivity so that's that's a great
energy<00:01:39.850> saver<00:01:40.149> there<00:01:40.450> for<00:01:40.899> that<00:01:41.049> watch<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
energy saver there for that watch the

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.929 
energy saver there for that watch the
case<00:01:43.720> itself<00:01:44.049> is<00:01:44.229> stainless<00:01:44.530> steel<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:45.159> it's

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
case itself is stainless steel and it's

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.410 
case itself is stainless steel and it's
very<00:01:46.180> attractive<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.470> diameter<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.399> about<00:01:48.520> 43

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
very attractive the diameter is about 43

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.630 
very attractive the diameter is about 43
millimeters<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.040> see<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.490> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
millimeters and you can see that the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.399 
millimeters and you can see that the
thickness<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:52.329> about<00:01:52.530> 12<00:01:53.530> millimeters<00:01:54.250> there

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
thickness is about 12 millimeters there

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.289 
thickness is about 12 millimeters there
so<00:01:56.409> it's<00:01:56.619> appropriately<00:01:57.250> sized<00:01:57.610> for<00:01:57.969> a<00:01:58.060> dress

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
so it's appropriately sized for a dress

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.539 
so it's appropriately sized for a dress
watch<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.869> comfortably<00:01:59.380> fits<00:01:59.770> under<00:02:00.520> the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
watch it comfortably fits under the

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.020 
watch it comfortably fits under the
sleeve<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.119> dress<00:02:01.360> shirt<00:02:01.630> on<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.520> top<00:02:03.729> here

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
sleeve of a dress shirt on the top here

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.359 
sleeve of a dress shirt on the top here
the<00:02:04.060> glass<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.899> scratch<00:02:05.530> resistant

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
the glass is a scratch resistant

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.109 
the glass is a scratch resistant
sapphire<00:02:06.909> crystal<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.670> face<00:02:09.880> here<00:02:10.090> I

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
sapphire crystal and on the face here I

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.700 
sapphire crystal and on the face here I
think<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.390> dial<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.840> very<00:02:11.140> elegant-looking

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
think the dial is very elegant-looking

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.830 
think the dial is very elegant-looking
with<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.430> Roman<00:02:12.790> numerals<00:02:13.210> as<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.900> can<00:02:14.050> see

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
with the Roman numerals as you can see

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
with the Roman numerals as you can see
you've<00:02:16.840> also<00:02:17.050> got<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.770> month<00:02:18.130> indicator<00:02:18.760> on

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
you've also got a month indicator on

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.700 
you've also got a month indicator on
this<00:02:19.330> sub<00:02:19.600> dial<00:02:19.960> down<00:02:20.410> at<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
this sub dial down at the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.610 
this sub dial down at the
bottom<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.190> if<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.150> look<00:02:22.420> carefully<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:23.140> may

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
bottom and if you look carefully you may

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.430 
bottom and if you look carefully you may
not<00:02:23.800> be<00:02:23.920> able<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.130> see<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:25.240> on<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> inner<00:02:25.660> on

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
not be able to see but on the inner on

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.470 
not be able to see but on the inner on
the<00:02:26.500> inner<00:02:26.710> circumference<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.700> sub<00:02:28.180> dial

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
the inner circumference of that sub dial

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.570 
the inner circumference of that sub dial
there's<00:02:28.960> actually<00:02:29.440> an<00:02:29.530> indicator<00:02:30.010> for<00:02:30.160> leap

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
there's actually an indicator for leap

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.030 
there's actually an indicator for leap
years<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.180> that's<00:02:31.330> always<00:02:31.990> very<00:02:32.500> handy

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
years so that's always very handy

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.620 
years so that's always very handy
especially<00:02:33.130> for<00:02:33.730> watch<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.300> may<00:02:34.450> not

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
especially for watch that you may not

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.660 
especially for watch that you may not
wear<00:02:34.810> for<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> while<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.340> won't<00:02:36.490> need<00:02:36.610> to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
wear for for a while you won't need to

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.380 
wear for for a while you won't need to
reset<00:02:37.090> it

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
reset it

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.810 
reset it
the<00:02:38.380> smaller<00:02:38.680> sub<00:02:39.010> dial<00:02:39.310> at<00:02:39.550> four<00:02:39.790> o'clock

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
the smaller sub dial at four o'clock

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the smaller sub dial at four o'clock
over<00:02:40.450> here<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.960> actually<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.270> 24-hour<00:02:43.270> display

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
over here is actually a 24-hour display

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.750 
over here is actually a 24-hour display
for<00:02:44.290> people<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.860> see<00:02:45.130> 24-hour

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
for people that like to see 24-hour

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.820 
for people that like to see 24-hour
display<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:48.870> in<00:02:49.870> my<00:02:50.140> opinion<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> biggest

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
display so in my opinion the biggest

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.920 
display so in my opinion the biggest
shortcoming<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.850> watch<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.390> its<00:02:52.570> lack<00:02:52.900> of

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
shortcoming of this watch is its lack of

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.680 
shortcoming of this watch is its lack of
luminescence<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.160> really<00:02:54.760> has<00:02:54.970> no<00:02:55.240> low<00:02:55.480> light

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
luminescence I really has no low light

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.500 
luminescence I really has no low light
performance<00:02:56.190> none<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.400> hands<00:02:57.820> or<00:02:57.940> our<00:02:58.210> and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
performance none of the hands or our and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.010 
performance none of the hands or our and
markers<00:02:59.100> have<00:03:00.100> any<00:03:00.280> luminescence<00:03:01.020> properties

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
markers have any luminescence properties

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.800 
markers have any luminescence properties
so<00:03:02.290> that's<00:03:02.830> one<00:03:03.070> drawback<00:03:03.550> but<00:03:03.910> as<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.420> dressed

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
so that's one drawback but as a dressed

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.180 
so that's one drawback but as a dressed
watch<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.350> can<00:03:05.470> see<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:05.830> it's<00:03:06.130> very

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
watch you can see it's it's very

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.570 
watch you can see it's it's very
attractive<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.870> band<00:03:08.170> actually<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:09.190> really

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
attractive the band actually is really

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.450 
attractive the band actually is really
nice<00:03:09.790> leather<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:11.140> brown<00:03:11.560> leather<00:03:11.830> band<00:03:12.130> and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
nice leather a brown leather band and

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.540 
nice leather a brown leather band and
it's<00:03:12.580> got<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:12.880> nice<00:03:13.150> croco<00:03:14.080> pattern<00:03:14.430> which<00:03:15.430> I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
it's got this nice croco pattern which I

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.210 
it's got this nice croco pattern which I
like<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> lot<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:17.260> then<00:03:17.380> another<00:03:17.650> unique

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
like a lot and then another unique

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.960 
like a lot and then another unique
feature<00:03:18.550> is<00:03:18.940> actually<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.690> clasp<00:03:20.050> so<00:03:20.550> as<00:03:21.550> you

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
feature is actually the clasp so as you

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.900 
feature is actually the clasp so as you
can<00:03:22.090> see<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.510> three-fold<00:03:23.580> metal<00:03:24.580> clasp

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
can see it's a three-fold metal clasp

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.530 
can see it's a three-fold metal clasp
with<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.530> know<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> locking<00:03:27.160> release<00:03:27.490> pin<00:03:28.120> here

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
with you know a locking release pin here

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.950 
with you know a locking release pin here
and<00:03:29.610> what's<00:03:30.610> nice<00:03:30.820> is<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.390> leather<00:03:31.630> part

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
and what's nice is that the leather part

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.810 
and what's nice is that the leather part
of<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.230> band<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.680> actually<00:03:32.830> adjustable<00:03:33.610> so

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
of the band is actually adjustable so

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.520 
of the band is actually adjustable so
you<00:03:33.850> can<00:03:33.970> essentially<00:03:34.420> size<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.080> watch<00:03:35.260> for

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
you can essentially size the watch for

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.040 
you can essentially size the watch for
yourself<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.220> then<00:03:37.030> once<00:03:37.630> it's<00:03:37.840> sized

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
yourself and then once it's sized

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.900 
yourself and then once it's sized
appropriately<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:39.070> have<00:03:39.220> easy<00:03:39.430> on/off

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
appropriately you have easy on/off

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.700 
appropriately you have easy on/off
access<00:03:40.480> with<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.260> metal<00:03:41.530> clasp<00:03:41.800> here<00:03:42.130> so<00:03:43.710> this

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
access with the metal clasp here so this

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.950
