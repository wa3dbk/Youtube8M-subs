 Hi, I'm Erika RamÃ­rez and in this video 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.400
 I want to recommend four exercises 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:12.170
 to increase the glutes and give them shape 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.750
 if you've been looking for a way to 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.119
 increase the size of your butt is 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.919
 likely that you tried to find 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.699
 some exercises that do the 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.999
 gluteus muscles older than training the 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.130
 Buttocks properly is not that hard 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.169
 gluteal muscles and are great 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.440
 you use constantly and when you're 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.780
 walking or running now the thing is 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.540
 to walk and run your glutes 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.020
 little stronger and firmer but it's not going 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.360
 to add a lot of volume to run costs 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.820
 up running down the stairs will give you 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.190
 better results but if you want 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.380
 really remarkable margas needs 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.400
 exercises with more resistance and that 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.050
 specifically work the buttocks 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.320
 what are the exercises that the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.590
 muscles of your glutes bigger the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.659
 options are many and varied if you have 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.270
 the possibility of enrolling in a 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.400
 gym you can try a series of 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.570
 Exercises such as squats or weight 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.550
 dead 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.610
 Telesur is also good for 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.909
 buttocks most gyms 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.440
 they also have machines that train 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.050
 specifically the buttocks 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.360
 and many gyms also have classes 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.870
 specials for the abdominals and 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.910
 buttocks are usually very effective 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 and it's also stimulating when it 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.850
 work together with other people 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.880
 If you can not go to the gym, it's not a 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.210
 problem there are a lot of exercises that 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.130
 they require little equipment these 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.060

 but they keep the feet more separated 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.830
 as a kind of go make sure that 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.140

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.210
