00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
- scary - smooth em back here again I

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.900 
- scary - smooth em back here again I
may<00:00:04.170> get<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.350> lot<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.560> emails<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.790> know

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
may get a lot of emails and you know

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.760 
may get a lot of emails and you know
different<00:00:06.330> comments<00:00:06.810> about<00:00:06.900> techniques<00:00:07.620> of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
different comments about techniques of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.890 
different comments about techniques of
my<00:00:07.890> planning<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.429> voicings<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.599> number

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
my planning and voicings and the number

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.140 
my planning and voicings and the number
system<00:00:10.289> in<00:00:10.440> theory<00:00:10.829> so<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.579> is<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.789> base<00:00:11.969> of

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
system in theory so this is the base of

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.879 
system in theory so this is the base of
this<00:00:12.240> video<00:00:12.539> is<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.780> kind<00:00:12.959> of<00:00:12.990> come<00:00:13.169> compile

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
this video is to kind of come compile

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.289 
this video is to kind of come compile
all<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.159> stuff<00:00:14.339> together<00:00:14.489> so<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.030> can<00:00:15.150> see

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
all the stuff together so you can see

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.090 
all the stuff together so you can see
what<00:00:15.419> I'm<00:00:15.509> doing<00:00:15.539> I<00:00:16.080> changed<00:00:16.529> my<00:00:16.619> voicings

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
what I'm doing I changed my voicings

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.860 
what I'm doing I changed my voicings
I'll<00:00:17.280> go<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:17.610> the<00:00:17.700> number<00:00:17.940> theory<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.480> all

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:18.870 
I'll go with the number theory and all

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.660 
I'll go with the number theory and all
that<00:00:19.020> good<00:00:19.140> stuff<00:00:19.200> right<00:00:19.350> here<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.830> we're

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that good stuff right here so we're

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.140 
that good stuff right here so we're
gonna<00:00:20.790> be<00:00:20.910> certain<00:00:21.180> out<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.360> the<00:00:21.420> key<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.720> G<00:00:23.150> I'm

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
gonna be certain out of the key of G I'm

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.090 
gonna be certain out of the key of G I'm
gonna<00:00:24.360> show<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.870> notes<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> scale

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
gonna show you the notes in the scale

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.770 
gonna show you the notes in the scale
and<00:00:26.280> then<00:00:26.640> how<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.850> play<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.120> chords<00:00:27.600> and<00:00:27.690> the

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
and then how I play the chords and the

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.990 
and then how I play the chords and the
scale<00:00:28.020> and<00:00:28.170> how<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.350> make<00:00:28.740> those<00:00:28.920> chords<00:00:29.280> so<00:00:29.940> you

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
scale and how I make those chords so you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.579 
scale and how I make those chords so you
start<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.600> we'll<00:00:36.899> count<00:00:37.109> the<00:00:37.199> numbers<00:00:37.589> 1<00:00:38.070> 2<00:00:38.699> 3

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.139 

8<00:00:43.589> but<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> don't<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.550> that's<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.999> back

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
8 but you don't really that's going back

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
8 but you don't really that's going back
to<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.600> 1<00:00:45.749> again<00:00:46.729> you<00:00:47.729> have<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:47.999> flat<00:00:48.210> 7<00:00:49.370> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
to the 1 again you have your flat 7 and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.009 
to the 1 again you have your flat 7 and
so<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:50.609> I<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.729> is<00:00:51.059> when<00:00:51.359> I'm<00:00:51.479> playing<00:00:51.510> these

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
so what I do is when I'm playing these

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.770 
so what I do is when I'm playing these
chords<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> scale<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.579> changed<00:00:54.269> my<00:00:54.359> voicing

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
chords in the scale I changed my voicing

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.979 
chords in the scale I changed my voicing
so<00:00:54.960> we'll<00:00:55.109> start<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.499> with<00:00:55.530> G<00:00:56.719> which<00:00:57.719> will<00:00:57.870> be

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so we'll start out with G which will be

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.090 
so we'll start out with G which will be
your<00:00:58.109> 1<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.679> gonna<00:00:58.799> be<00:00:58.920> your<00:00:59.100> root<00:00:59.280> a

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
your 1 so it's gonna be your root a

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.090 
your 1 so it's gonna be your root a
minor<00:01:02.100> B<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:03.530> B<00:01:04.530> minor<00:01:04.770> B<00:01:04.950> 2<00:01:05.070> 3<00:01:06.140> C<00:01:07.140> major<00:01:07.800> will

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
minor B or to B minor B 2 3 C major will

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.260 
minor B or to B minor B 2 3 C major will
be<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.460> for

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
be here for

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.560 
be here for
the<00:01:10.600> major<00:01:10.840> be<00:01:11.049> here<00:01:11.200> 5<00:01:11.440> e<00:01:13.020> minor<00:01:14.020> B<00:01:14.320> or<00:01:14.470> 6<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
the major be here 5 e minor B or 6 and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.050 
the major be here 5 e minor B or 6 and
then<00:01:17.530> have<00:01:17.830> shock<00:01:18.070> would<00:01:18.190> be<00:01:18.280> your<00:01:18.430> 7<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:18.940> your

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
then have shock would be your 7 and your

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.190 
then have shock would be your 7 and your
flat<00:01:19.330> 7<00:01:19.540> will<00:01:19.750> be<00:01:19.780> your<00:01:19.960> ever

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.020 

and<00:01:23.200> while<00:01:23.530> I'm<00:01:23.650> playing<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.640> what<00:01:24.790> I'll<00:01:24.880> do<00:01:25.000> is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
and while I'm playing so what I'll do is

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.190 
and while I'm playing so what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:25.300> start<00:01:25.330> out<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.780> I'll<00:01:25.870> change<00:01:26.050> my

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
I'll start out and I'll change my

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.450 
I'll start out and I'll change my
voicing<00:01:26.710> so<00:01:26.890> we'll<00:01:27.160> start<00:01:27.310> with<00:01:27.520> G<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:29.460> I'll

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
voicing so we'll start with G and I'll

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:42.290 
voicing so we'll start with G and I'll
find<00:01:30.730> various<00:01:31.090> ways<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.390> play

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.340 

not<00:01:43.300> gone<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.659> next<00:01:43.870> or<00:01:43.990> do<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.200> same

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
not gone to the next or do the same

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:56.300 
not gone to the next or do the same
thing<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:44.800> minor<00:01:50.490> B<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.700> same<00:01:51.850> thing<00:01:55.140> see

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
thing a minor B the same thing see

through<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.190> number<00:02:55.460> system<00:02:55.930> one<00:02:56.930> will

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
through the number system one will

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.780 
through the number system one will
always<00:02:57.350> be<00:02:57.560> your<00:02:57.770> route<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.250> no<00:03:01.370> matter<00:03:01.520> what

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
always be your route so no matter what

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.400 
always be your route so no matter what
what<00:03:02.300> key<00:03:02.480> you're<00:03:02.660> in<00:03:02.720> or<00:03:02.930> whatever<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.260> know
