00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
do on your cutting board so you don't

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.119

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
hit your finger like this okay so i'm

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.830 
hit your finger like this okay so i'm
just<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.550> race<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.270> against<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.660> body

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
just going to race this against my body

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.130 
just going to race this against my body
and<00:00:58.820> then<00:00:59.820> i'm<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and then i'm going to just do all the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.030 
and then i'm going to just do all the
way<00:01:01.230> down<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.920> these

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:22.770 

oopsy<00:01:10.360> gotta<00:01:11.360> pee<00:01:11.630> with<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:11.990> one<00:01:19.210> all<00:01:20.210> right

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.359 

should<00:01:23.780> be<00:01:23.810> able<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.409> slide<00:01:24.619> these<00:01:24.860> all<00:01:25.040> on<00:01:25.340> a

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
should be able to slide these all on a

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:33.610 
should be able to slide these all on a
little<00:01:25.759> faster

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.680 

so<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.280> find<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.940> bigger<00:01:35.210> peas<00:01:35.480> are

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
so I find that the bigger peas are

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.690 
so I find that the bigger peas are
easier<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.140> get<00:01:36.380> on<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:36.980> because<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.550> have

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
easier to get on here because you have

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
easier to get on here because you have
more<00:01:37.880> surface<00:01:38.090> area<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.600> work

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.030 

so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.440 

once<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.820> have<00:01:51.850> them<00:01:52.150> all<00:01:52.330> on<00:01:52.510> here<00:01:54.450> you're

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
once you have them all on here you're

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.700 
once you have them all on here you're
just<00:01:55.630> going<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.870> add<00:01:56.110> some<00:01:56.740> olive<00:01:57.010> oil<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
just going to add some olive oil and a

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.640 
just going to add some olive oil and a
little<00:02:02.890> bit<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.310> kosher<00:02:03.550> salt<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.500> is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
little bit of kosher salt so this is

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.140 
little bit of kosher salt so this is
great<00:02:05.800> because<00:02:06.010> it's<00:02:06.370> really<00:02:06.490> easy<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:06.880> just

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
great because it's really easy to just

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.820 
great because it's really easy to just
flip<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.720> you're<00:02:07.960> going<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.140> take<00:02:08.560> hold<00:02:08.770> of

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
flip and you're going to take hold of

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.990 
flip and you're going to take hold of
all<00:02:08.979> your<00:02:09.130> peers<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.340> I'm<00:02:09.460> just<00:02:09.580> going<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.790> set

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
all your peers and I'm just going to set

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.780 
all your peers and I'm just going to set
them<00:02:10.210> over<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:10.990> my<00:02:11.200> grill<00:02:12.390> which<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.570> on<00:02:13.690> medium

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
them over on my grill which is on medium

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.580 
them over on my grill which is on medium
and<00:02:15.790> they're<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:16.840> convinced<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.380> that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and they're just convinced it like that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.760 
and they're just convinced it like that
until<00:02:18.190> they<00:02:18.340> get<00:02:18.810> beautiful<00:02:19.810> with<00:02:20.530> grill

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
until they get beautiful with grill

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.800 
until they get beautiful with grill
marks<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.250> these<00:02:21.460> have<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.420> I've<00:02:22.510> had<00:02:22.690> on

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
marks like these have that I've had on

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.250 
marks like these have that I've had on
here<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:24.070> takes<00:02:24.280> about<00:02:24.870> about<00:02:25.870> seven

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
here and that takes about about seven

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.920 
here and that takes about about seven
minutes<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.740> each<00:02:26.890> side<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:28.030> about<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> medium

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
minutes on each side on about a medium

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.440 
minutes on each side on about a medium
on<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.709> grill<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.910> I'm<00:02:30.970> just<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.300> take
