00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
put it on your ear it's ensured that it

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.609 
put it on your ear it's ensured that it
won't<00:01:27.509> move<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.900> won't<00:01:28.020> slip<00:01:28.170> off<00:01:28.290> your<00:01:28.350> ear

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
won't move and won't slip off your ear

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.800 
won't move and won't slip off your ear
and<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.860> feel<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.820> together<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> hold<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and I feel like all together the hold is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
and I feel like all together the hold is
pretty<00:01:31.079> secure<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.920> these<00:01:32.250> earrings<00:01:32.670> are<00:01:32.850> made

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
pretty secure so these earrings are made

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.940 
pretty secure so these earrings are made
of<00:01:33.299> silver<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.350> sensitive<00:01:34.740> ears

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
of silver so if you have sensitive ears

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.580 
of silver so if you have sensitive ears
you<00:01:35.220> should<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.549> okay<00:01:35.880> unless<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.990> need<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
you should be okay unless you need a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.109 
you should be okay unless you need a
white<00:01:37.860> gold<00:01:38.130> version<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:38.700> you'd<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
white gold version then you'd have to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.660 
white gold version then you'd have to
buy<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> fine<00:01:40.200> jewelry<00:01:40.710> line<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.100> Chanel<00:01:41.369> but

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
buy the fine jewelry line of Chanel but

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.819 
buy the fine jewelry line of Chanel but
if<00:01:42.090> your<00:01:42.329> ears<00:01:42.479> aren't<00:01:42.659> overly<00:01:43.200> sensitive<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
if your ears aren't overly sensitive I

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
if your ears aren't overly sensitive I
think<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.189> should<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.640> fine<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.659> course

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
think these should be fine so of course

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
think these should be fine so of course
depending<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.439> what<00:01:46.619> size<00:01:46.799> earlobe<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.460> have

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
depending on what size earlobe you have

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
depending on what size earlobe you have
this<00:01:48.060> earring<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.630> look<00:01:48.750> differently<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this earring will look differently but I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.980 
this earring will look differently but I
thought<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.399> taste<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> my<00:01:51.420> style<00:01:51.810> this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
thought for my taste and my style this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.649 
thought for my taste and my style this
was<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> better<00:01:52.530> size<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.070> pick<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.540> is

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
was a better size to pick so this is

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
was a better size to pick so this is
what<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> earrings<00:01:55.229> look<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:56.189> really

what the earrings look like it's really
sparkly<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> especially<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.869> dark

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
sparkly and especially if you have dark

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
sparkly and especially if you have dark
hair<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.469> myself<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.979> feel<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.670> really

mini as you can see they are quite a bit
smaller<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.410> don't<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.250> extend<00:02:44.670> past<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
smaller and don't really extend past the

earlobe as much so if you want a more

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.280 
earlobe as much so if you want a more
subdued<00:02:48.030> look<00:02:48.390> maybe<00:02:48.630> go<00:02:48.810> with<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> smaller

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
subdued look maybe go with a smaller

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.920 
subdued look maybe go with a smaller
size<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.519> anyways<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.299> can<00:02:51.450> tell<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
quality of course isn't there and it

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.900 
quality of course isn't there and it
just<00:02:55.110> doesn't<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.950> same<00:02:56.130> shine<00:02:56.549> that

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
just doesn't have the same shine that

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.640 
just doesn't have the same shine that
the<00:02:57.360> real<00:02:57.540> ones<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.110> know<00:02:58.170> it's<00:02:58.379> hard<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the real ones have I know it's hard to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.170 
the real ones have I know it's hard to
tell<00:02:58.860> with<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.160> quality<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.549> camera<00:02:59.940> because

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
tell with this quality of camera because

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.410 
tell with this quality of camera because
I'm<00:03:00.299> just<00:03:00.480> using<00:03:00.629> my<00:03:01.260> macbook<00:03:01.860> pro<00:03:01.890> webcam<00:03:02.730> but

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
I'm just using my macbook pro webcam but

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.819 
I'm just using my macbook pro webcam but
in<00:03:03.629> real<00:03:03.840> life<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.319> really<00:03:04.560> tell<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
in real life you can really tell the

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.680 
in real life you can really tell the
difference<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.430> these<00:03:05.879> definitely<00:03:06.420> don't

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
difference and these definitely don't

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.390 
difference and these definitely don't
have<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.140> same<00:03:07.410> shine<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:07.980> course<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
have that same shine and of course the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.970 
have that same shine and of course the
quality<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:08.819> isn't<00:03:09.299> up<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.450> par<00:03:09.599> as<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.530> used

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
quality just isn't up to par as I used

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.470 
quality just isn't up to par as I used
to<00:03:11.099> wear<00:03:11.220> these<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.430> lot<00:03:11.610> back<00:03:11.879> in<00:03:12.060> college<00:03:12.299> a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
to wear these a lot back in college a

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.720 
to wear these a lot back in college a
few<00:03:12.599> years<00:03:12.840> ago<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.220> stones<00:03:14.489> have

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
few years ago and the stones have

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.339 
few years ago and the stones have
already<00:03:14.970> started<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.329> come<00:03:15.569> out<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.049> it's<00:03:16.230> not

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
already started to come out so it's not

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.039 
already started to come out so it's not
really<00:03:16.650> salvageable<00:03:17.160> at<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.639> point<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.239> of

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
really salvageable at this point and of

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.349 
really salvageable at this point and of
course<00:03:19.290> these<00:03:19.920> don't<00:03:20.190> have<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> warranty<00:03:21.000> but

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
course these don't have a warranty but

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.509 
course these don't have a warranty but
the<00:03:21.569> real<00:03:21.720> Chanel<00:03:22.079> earrings<00:03:22.410> actually<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:23.100> so

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
the real Chanel earrings actually do so

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.190 
the real Chanel earrings actually do so
maybe<00:03:23.760> you've<00:03:23.940> seen<00:03:24.180> my<00:03:24.329> other<00:03:24.359> Chanel<00:03:24.840> review

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
maybe you've seen my other Chanel review

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.870

but<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.739> review<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.160> didn't<00:03:26.549> really<00:03:26.730> voice

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
but in that review I didn't really voice

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.819 
but in that review I didn't really voice
my<00:03:27.090> opinion<00:03:27.480> because<00:03:27.660> there<00:03:28.349> was<00:03:28.470> no<00:03:28.650> voice

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
my opinion because there was no voice

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.440 
my opinion because there was no voice
over<00:03:29.099> and<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.609> was<00:03:29.670> basically<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.209> a

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
over and it was basically just a

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.180 
over and it was basically just a
