00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.870
 Majority and folders 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.740
 someone pulls me aside 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.970

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.880
 Heinsberg district 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.400

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 after multiple right-click was that inflation 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 in Aachen, there is a point set at the end 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.150

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.510
 what you are looking for 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.510
 then not after 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.470
 much better all gold just completely down 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.210
 Haiti gave Zubin Mehta in Word for 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.840
 Nothing is the end far more important 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.010

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.230
 Qatar I lose my strength 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.450
 then the company took care of it 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.500
 that's how we fulfill it 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500
 airy easy to do 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.380
 then the first one meets Mini as will 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.729
 I climbed the whole 1 7 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.629
 let's just go over there 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.279
 in the stage design edition 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.609
 with every purchase there the case 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.849
 After Regan Smith I will ever go up again 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.849
 Klika and then I was already there 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 then the whole thing could show fast again 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.999
 I follow so that it can see better 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.169
 Percent never so, the solar project remained prime suspect 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.449

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.729

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.759
 3 animal more than 6 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:10.569
 For example, if you're a racing team in the evening, percent could be 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.149
 from the only one block 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.949
 Nadal succeeded in making it click away from now 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.139
 if it helps keep it pressed 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.879
 and done in mixed 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.879

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.779
 the Château Pope 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.499
 just take it easy 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.269
