 a plate and a glass 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.550
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.220
 Frost 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.950

 how are we going to do it? 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.440
 with the help of a lemon 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.440
 we count in the mouth of the glass 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.630
 and we serve a little salt with chili in 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.310
 the plate 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.310
 later we turn the glass 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.399
 or frosty our glass 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.399
 then we add the ice 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.390
 we squeeze a lemon 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.530
 we add the parked game 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.530
 just a few droplets 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.140

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.350

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.400
 a little trickle 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.990
 the blood is 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.390
 since we have poured the ingredients 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.390
 we shake a little 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.070
 and finally we add the beer 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.890
