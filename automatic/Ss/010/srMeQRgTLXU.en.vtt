00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.570
 to be I tested the bar 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.990
 kiko so I'm doing this video 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.390
 today but by cons I have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.800
 planned to go to kiko in a few 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.720
 weeks late or a few days just not 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 again and I know I'm going to buy some 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.170
 blow when I skin this trail will not be 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 necessarily a day but to catch me 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.000
 I will make you a hall that co so 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 so here are the two videos you 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.960
 will have a little overview of all my 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.170
 products of this brand is armed 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.579
 first day where France is everything from 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.899
 without further ado I will 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.559
 start by introducing yourself to two 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.899
 products time so first of all a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.239
 fund isr beats you know the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.430
 packagings that cock I think this one 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.690
 high school number 102 so that's a good 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.390
 player he suffers like that he has a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 mirror not I dazzle you with so 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.900
 it's very handy and the browser 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.210
 looks like this so that's 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.000
 absolutely brothers preferred everything 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 we just did not stay much 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170
 no more but this one is really 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.040
 perfect I do not think he has any 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.610
 your orange 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.790
 it is dull it really makes a super the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.159
 done on the skin and that's summer I'm 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.799
 do not be too much since many may 11 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.270
 in winter I use it a lot for 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.979
 count on ring to warm up 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.320
 his complexion that represents seems super 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.909
 quick 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 but I do not remember the prices 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.680
 of head but I 'll just put you 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.060
 below here and at its in info bar 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.560
 besides I will put you the links of 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.790
 all the products that bach plays like 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.340
 usually by the way but I forget 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.350
 often to say it so here I confess 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.600
 6 and then it's a very small one 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.869
 times a smaller packaging is the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.729
 number 100 and it's a bluff then 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.000
 the same is always a small a small 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.060
 mirror is extremely practical and the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.549
 blush is like this so it's 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.860
 a bluff that is not necessarily at all 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.940
 the world I think 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.450
 but actually looks like a tax at 1 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.220
 bronze 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.010
 I had asked a saleswoman 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.019
 it had told me that with a little 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.400
 maths it's very beautiful and indeed I 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.810
 a lot it warms once again from 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.860
 more my time and I like to put it 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.079
 in winter or summer 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.180
 so here I know the two alone 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.430
 products for the time that I have that in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.319
 do I have no kiko in my city end 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.390
 I have one in a city next door so I 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.329
 can easily go by car but 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.650
 here we must have time 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.730
 something that I do not necessarily have 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.340
 that's why I have not got it yet 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.840
 a lot of products that but from 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.610
 I've seen and for sure I crack a 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:56.069
 then we'll go to the eyes 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:00.060
 with long famous lighting stick 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.940
 so that's what I'm focusing on 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.079
 have already talked about his name a video where 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.700
 I gave you advice for 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.280
 start makeup since it's 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.930
 extremely easy to use 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.180
 it looks like that it turns and 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.739
 not even need to prune it or what 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.530
 whatever it turns he only have to and 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.630
 it's a shade to pro eyeshadow was going 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:27.720
 lose and it's an eye shadow a 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.389
 creamy stick not too curious no 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.730
 you have to work it all 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.280
 following right now after that dry but 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.230
 that's never how I take a 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.989
 passing and are afraid dimmed the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.489
 work is done at the same not 5 minutes 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:46.799
 so I have a Aaron like that is the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:49.200
 04 and then I have the 07 that is 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.250
 a lot more very iridescent white that makes 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.350
 very very very 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.260
 so here it is really shots of 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.280
 heart of chico and beats besides how 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.500
 when I go back I go in 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.940
 may not resume from this 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.830
 collection I saw that they had released 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.450
 a new collection but in any case 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.550
 I resume since that since it is very 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.300
 practical and ultimately I use this more 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.810
 kind of darkness an eyelid problem 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.060
 rather than my mesfar manila powder 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.829
 kid 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.340
 So here we stay in the 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.870
 eyes with tam my big combe oscillates from 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.000
 at kiko so this is the first one I have 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.440
 bought and since then I have not changed 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.370
 since he still survives well enough and 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.220
 Well now I use it every day 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.100
 in fact I bought it a year ago 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.780
 a month ago a year before I play 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.160
 use epalinges said to me like I 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.980
 I'm going to test it and it's really 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.210
 a difference have for bottom I thought 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.810
 not that it would make such a difference 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.430
 in fact is there without mascara we just put 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.860
 that we have already left at rest so with 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.410
 a mascara that really makes it a 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.810
 great effect so it's cheap it's 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.790
 practice it does not hurt even if we 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.370
 looks like it happened has forced him out 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.040
 so yeah that I you 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:08.090
 highly recommend the great thing 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.919
 did not happen in language and then 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.220
 I have four lip products at 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.010
 present to you then those there was a 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.020
 boulevard hoc collection 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.180
 so I do not know if it's still 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.220
 available I'm sorry it's 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.110
 the elliptical like that so aiden a 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.669
 jumbo cd in fact jumbo lipstick 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.560
 who turns and does not need to 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.320
 pencil sharpener so I took four 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.169
 yes here I had not to decide then 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.330
 first of all i have the 0 1 that comes up 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.430
 like this is the new of the most clear 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.479
 of the collection so this one by 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.949
 against must be careful since the 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.289
 tendency to mark fine lines 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.479
 especially that it's all red to 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:51.979
 matte lips in fact so they have more 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:54.380
 tendency to dry m after I have the 02 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.940
 always a nude but a little darker 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.850
 this time that looks like this 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:09.010
 which is superb also that kind of 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:12.289
 old rose after I have the 05 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.530
 it's a good jaurÃ¨s and that's a red 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.610
 pretty flashy 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.000
 so they are all this morning as I 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.990
 wanted said present like this and in 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.660
 last g20 if this one is a boo 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.210
 fuchsia like that for sure I'm 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.639
 the more I think they come 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.729
 like that and knowing that the matte finish 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.909
 low but 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.379
 it's over favorite lips I 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.759
 am totally a fan of packaging 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:43.409
 it's ultra practical it finally turns 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:46.589
 nothing to say about this product there I you 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:48.360
 recommend them we already arrive at the end 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:49.499
 of my products who when when what when 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.639
 I say I'm not the masses 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:56.490
 and besides that it does not have one it's the 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.020
 varnish so it's a varnish that co so 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.479
 I took 3 May in touch when I 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.339
 counted I had 10 and I can you 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.319
 to talk about it more than that because I 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:06.149
 do a complete review on mick fanning 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.039
 who co I do not know if the video will be 

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:10.050
 given before or after this one so you 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.740
 put a link if we are not already 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.139
 online 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.490
 so here's the nail polish that like you 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.509
 will see in this video I tell you that 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.370
 it's really the best report 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:19.349
 quality price for me they hold very 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.939
 very well the colors that's his 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:22.589
 beautiful I think they have nothing left 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:25.649
 to prove at the air level towards nice 

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:27.839
 so that's it for this short video if 

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:31.469
 you have other brand ideas that 

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:32.909

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:35.430
