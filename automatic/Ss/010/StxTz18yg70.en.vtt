00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.660
 but we have seen the motherboard but how 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.220
 we feed our computer 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.670
 in this second video we will go to 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 analyze and the main heart of the 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.550
 computers have chosen every 5 as 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.460
 is one of the most stable processors in the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.960
 intel and gaming time is 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:48.309
 enough man is a lg model at 11 55 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:50.590
 eli 533 50p the weightlifter means that not 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.660
 has the integrated video card and therefore 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.620
 you need a card to see land 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.859
 to re-elaborate the data, in other words, not 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.170
 we took a 35 70 for example k e 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.030
 he had taken a model first because he didn't 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.640
 plans to overclock 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.450
 in fact we will not find turrets 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:19.420
 dissipating we go to open it without 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:21.189
 wreak havoc all over 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.670
 here is note that he receives it without it 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.470
 get rid of nothing if not possible 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.970
 then make this sink have 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:38.250
 unfortunately we have the mythical 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.840
 label the face label very beautiful 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 just to do this I would buy 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.189
 interesting and the labels to give 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.350
 the lighting effect 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.840
 ok this year too which is the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.070
 classic sink has reigned that 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.229
 however on the design 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.229
 there is the pre-installed thermal paste 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.680
 it just cools down but that's enough 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.850
 but if it is enough then there is sta 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.300
 box that will devastate nothing or snow 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.540
 see that in fact it is snowing but well 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.240
 rottluff because we see if the process 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.240
 his appearance perhaps better to open it my god 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:32.640
 to tell you some obvious things or 64 bit e 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.100
 quad core and precisely 1 gigahertz and it is not 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.900
 overclockable so if you want to do it 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.030
 for clocking I recommend you take the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.709
 35 70k and who wants to say that he doesn't have the gpu 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.930
 integrated so you have if you want to do 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.850
 many data processing and how and for 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.450
 more with a video card with a more today 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.450
 very good
