00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
danger close so basically your chopper

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.950 
danger close so basically your chopper
gunner<00:01:42.950> becomes<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.520> 12<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.060> hit<00:01:44.210> kill<00:01:44.540> instead

where<00:01:59.980> you<00:02:00.130> will<00:02:00.280> be<00:02:00.430> hidden<00:02:00.610> from<00:02:00.760> their

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
where you will be hidden from their

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.750 
where you will be hidden from their
radar<00:02:01.420> or<00:02:01.630> from<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.170> air<00:02:02.320> support<00:02:02.830> I<00:02:03.070> like<00:02:03.640> to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
radar or from the air support I like to

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.430 
radar or from the air support I like to
make<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.060> silence<00:02:04.510> because<00:02:05.020> normally<00:02:05.410> you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
make it silence because normally you

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.999 
make it silence because normally you
want<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.830> hide<00:02:05.979> while<00:02:06.310> you're<00:02:06.490> cold<00:02:06.729> blooded

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
want to hide while you're cold blooded

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.910 
want to hide while you're cold blooded
if<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.160> find<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:10.200> your<00:02:11.200> assault<00:02:11.470> rifle<00:02:11.860> is

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
if you find that your assault rifle is

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.010 
if you find that your assault rifle is
too<00:02:12.130> inaccurate<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.910> can't<00:02:13.150> snipe<00:02:13.450> enough<00:02:13.780> I

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
too inaccurate and can't snipe enough I

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.930 
too inaccurate and can't snipe enough I
like<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.410> use<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.890> scar<00:02:15.160> alternate<00:02:15.640> which<00:02:15.790> is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
like to use the scar alternate which is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.750 
like to use the scar alternate which is
pretty<00:02:16.120> much<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.420> stopping<00:02:17.080> power<00:02:17.260> class

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
pretty much a stopping power class

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.280 
pretty much a stopping power class
except<00:02:18.760> since<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> scar<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.959> lot<00:02:20.110> more

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
except since the scar is a lot more

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.830 
except since the scar is a lot more
accurate<00:02:20.800> than<00:02:20.920> matar<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.550> use<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.030> in<00:02:22.270> sniping

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
accurate than matar I use it in sniping

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.010 
accurate than matar I use it in sniping
situations<00:02:23.550> not<00:02:24.550> sniping<00:02:25.120> but<00:02:25.390> long-range

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
situations not sniping but long-range

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.770 
situations not sniping but long-range
situations<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.220> at<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.270> beginning<00:02:28.600> of<00:02:28.690> a

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
situations and at the beginning of a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.570 
situations and at the beginning of a
match<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.930> use<00:02:32.080> my<00:02:32.110> cook<00:02:32.650> scope<00:02:33.010> fail<00:02:33.280> class

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
match I can use my cook scope fail class

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.330 
match I can use my cook scope fail class
because<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.780> man<00:02:34.959> army<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.470> can't<00:02:35.739> quick

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
because one man army you can't quick

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.250 
because one man army you can't quick
scope<00:02:36.580> with<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.940> now<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.870> prefer

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
scope with that now I just prefer

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
scope with that now I just prefer
thermal<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:38.950> my<00:02:39.070> breath<00:02:39.310> decal<00:02:39.989> but<00:02:40.989> um<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.590> use

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
thermal on my breath decal but um I use

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.360 
thermal on my breath decal but um I use
this<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.670> maps<00:02:42.880> like<00:02:43.150> high-rise<00:02:44.010> where<00:02:45.010> you

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
this in maps like high-rise where you

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.220 
this in maps like high-rise where you
can<00:02:45.550> get<00:02:45.670> those<00:02:45.850> easy<00:02:46.180> sniping<00:02:46.750> kills<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
can get those easy sniping kills in the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.800 
can get those easy sniping kills in the
beginning<00:02:47.820> or<00:02:48.820> just<00:02:49.330> if<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.600> feel<00:02:49.780> like

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
beginning or just if you feel like

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.010 
beginning or just if you feel like
sniping<00:02:50.500> for<00:02:50.770> couple<00:02:51.280> kills<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:52.540> not<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.810> bad

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
sniping for couple kills it's not a bad

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.009 
sniping for couple kills it's not a bad
idea<00:02:53.050> but<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:53.739> class<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.040> very<00:02:54.310> vulnerable

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
idea but this class is very vulnerable

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.780 
idea but this class is very vulnerable
because<00:02:56.019> it<00:02:56.290> has<00:02:56.410> no<00:02:56.650> secondary<00:02:57.190> weapon<00:02:57.610> so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
because it has no secondary weapon so

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.120 
because it has no secondary weapon so
honestly<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.200> had<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.500> remove<00:02:59.799> one<00:03:00.040> of

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
honestly if you had to remove one of

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.729 
honestly if you had to remove one of
these<00:03:00.250> classes<00:03:00.760> because<00:03:01.180> as<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.600> can<00:03:01.630> see<00:03:01.780> I'm

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
these classes because as you can see I'm

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.100 
these classes because as you can see I'm
second<00:03:03.280> prestige<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.390> have<00:03:04.720> six

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
second prestige so you I have six

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.520 
second prestige so you I have six
classes<00:03:05.230> right<00:03:05.739> here<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:07.180> this<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.410> only

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
classes right here so this if you only

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.039 
classes right here so this if you only
have<00:03:08.739> five<00:03:08.950> classes<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.790> class<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.630> not<00:03:10.750> very

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
have five classes this class is not very

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.590 
have five classes this class is not very
necessary<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.610> just<00:03:12.760> nice<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.000> have<00:03:13.299> and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
necessary but it's just nice to have and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.900 
necessary but it's just nice to have and
of<00:03:14.290> course<00:03:14.320> if<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.860> have<00:03:15.010> even<00:03:15.040> more<00:03:15.340> classes

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
of course if you have even more classes

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.110 
of course if you have even more classes
than<00:03:15.940> me<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.480> can<00:03:16.660> add<00:03:16.810> on<00:03:17.549> scar<00:03:18.549> alternates

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
than me you can add on scar alternates

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.120 
than me you can add on scar alternates
for<00:03:19.480> cold<00:03:19.720> blooded<00:03:20.019> or<00:03:20.260> whatever<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.890> want

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
for cold blooded or whatever you want

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.440 
for cold blooded or whatever you want
really<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.870> hopefully<00:03:23.080> I'll<00:03:24.030> make<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.150> easier

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
really so hopefully I'll make it easier

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.330 
really so hopefully I'll make it easier
for<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.810> get<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.049> nuke<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:27.010> course<00:03:27.040> for

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
for you to get a nuke and of course for

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.630 
for you to get a nuke and of course for
your<00:03:27.640> killstreaks<00:03:28.209> you<00:03:29.080> want<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.739> harrier

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
your killstreaks you want a harrier

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.870 
your killstreaks you want a harrier
chopper<00:03:30.910> gunner<00:03:31.420> nuke<00:03:31.950> but<00:03:32.950> some<00:03:33.310> maps<00:03:33.579> you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
chopper gunner nuke but some maps you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.390 
chopper gunner nuke but some maps you
would<00:03:34.090> want<00:03:34.810> an<00:03:35.049> attack<00:03:35.380> helicopter<00:03:35.560> on<00:03:36.250> a

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
would want an attack helicopter on a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.009 
would want an attack helicopter on a
c-130<00:03:39.030> arrest<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.239> probably<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.840> most

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
c-130 arrest is probably the most

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.680 
c-130 arrest is probably the most
exception<00:03:41.680> at<00:03:41.799> map<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.730> attack<00:03:43.000> helicopter

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690

exception at map the attack helicopter
on<00:03:43.810> rust<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.380> much<00:03:44.620> better<00:03:44.920> than<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.310> Harrier

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
on rust is much better than the Harrier

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.910 
on rust is much better than the Harrier
because<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.690> Harrier<00:03:47.049> when<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.560> put<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.799> on

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
because the Harrier when you put it on

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.370 
because the Harrier when you put it on
top<00:03:48.100> of<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.340> map<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.760> can't<00:03:49.060> see<00:03:49.269> anybody<00:03:49.510> so

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
top of the map it can't see anybody so

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.259 
top of the map it can't see anybody so
it<00:03:50.500> won't<00:03:50.709> get<00:03:50.860> many<00:03:51.040> kills<00:03:51.370> while<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.000> attack

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
it won't get many kills while the attack

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.900 
it won't get many kills while the attack
helicopter<00:03:52.900> will<00:03:53.079> circle<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.530> map<00:03:53.910> shooting

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
helicopter will circle the map shooting

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.660 
helicopter will circle the map shooting
everyone<00:03:55.269> since<00:03:55.510> small<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.799> ac-130<00:03:57.459> is

everyone since small and the ac-130 is

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.340 
everyone since small and the ac-130 is
better<00:03:57.910> than<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.269> chopper<00:03:58.510> gunner

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
better than the chopper gunner
