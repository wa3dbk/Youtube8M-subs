 we have to go rescue him but for 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:58.839

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.090
 find these vehicles we are going to 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.090
 find in an easy way but 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.670
 there may be a bit of trouble 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.230
 because the ones on the poster are not they are not 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.100
 improvement you no longer have the risk of searching and 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.810
 lose time truth but I will 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.270
 I want to show I know that you can not find 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.880
 some when we are in zone of 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.580
 We Chara is well known so we will 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.920

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.570
 week the police are now calm 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.220
 but sometimes also it alarmed 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.090
 and the caste 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.200

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.200
 from here outside 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.150
 then you can 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.020
 give it to house the egg 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.830

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.830
 my love 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.180
 It's also not easy, it's not so 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.180
 complicated 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.620
 I'm here now I'm going to clean up a bit the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.650
 zone from there to the bottom so that 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.940
 bother me those guys have ak-47 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.310
 they have very good weapons 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.950
 but they are terrible at the time of flying 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.040
 they have good good aim that stays 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.040
 there 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.730
 seeing more enemies but now I have to 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.730
 a little clean the area because 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.400
 the type of the oriental old man 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.640
 find in one of those garages I'm going to 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.380
 throwing some grenades because they will be 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.380
 guys studying the area 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.819
 as close 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.750
 I also want to hide there 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.750
 I do not want to be disturbed 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.150
 good just in case not so that I do not 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.959

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.959
 good the most 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.120
 one more and just in case I do not want that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.810
 after this 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.810
 and the reign 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.960
 you are not a child to castes 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.340
 already 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.340

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.880
 / visited / / p abuelito / / 9 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.350
 perfect 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.550
 now we have to leave it like this already 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.500

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.100
 pink 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.830
 the pomegranate are very useful 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.440
 if at the time of throwing them into the garages 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.350
 because you do not know who is inside the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.000
 garage obviously to see Colombians 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.000
 guarding the elder truth 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.160
 obviously then we better clean up a 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.940
 shortly before these guys and this 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.940
 way it becomes easier 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:04.779

 Colombian poster vehicle before 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.520
