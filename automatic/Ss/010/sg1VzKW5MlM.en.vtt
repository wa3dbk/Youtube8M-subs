Clippers I'm being very careful around

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.830 
Clippers I'm being very careful around
the<00:02:15.220> sort<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.490> bony<00:02:15.700> parts<00:02:16.150> around<00:02:16.420> her<00:02:16.660> eyes

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
just going quietly and carefully and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.920 
just going quietly and carefully and
always<00:02:21.610> making<00:02:21.820> sure<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.570> Clippers

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
always making sure that the Clippers

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.740 
always making sure that the Clippers
definitely<00:02:23.590> aren't<00:02:23.890> hot<00:02:24.340> if<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:24.910> try<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.360> tip

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
definitely aren't hot if you try and tip

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.449 
definitely aren't hot if you try and tip
a<00:02:25.780> horse's<00:02:26.260> head<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.740> Clippers<00:02:27.100> are<00:02:27.280> hot

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
a horse's head and the Clippers are hot

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.210 
a horse's head and the Clippers are hot
it<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.820> really<00:02:28.240> put<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.480> horse<00:02:28.810> off<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.860> would

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
it can really put a horse off I would

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.040 
it can really put a horse off I would
then<00:02:30.370> get<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.700> smaller<00:02:31.000> Clippers<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.840> clip

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
then get the smaller Clippers to clip

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.260 
then get the smaller Clippers to clip
round<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.560> fiddly<00:02:33.520> little<00:02:33.550> bits<00:02:33.970> around

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
round the fiddly little bits around

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.750 
round the fiddly little bits around
their<00:02:34.750> edges<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.350> their<00:02:35.500> ears<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.580> clip

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
their edges of their ears and to clip

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.490 
their edges of their ears and to clip
out<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.090> inside<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.810> ears<00:02:38.020> if<00:02:38.290> that's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
out the inside of the ears if that's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.650 
out the inside of the ears if that's
what<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.040> do<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:40.150> also<00:02:40.300> use

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
what you like to do and then also use

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.930 
what you like to do and then also use
the<00:02:40.810> smaller<00:02:41.080> Clippers<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.830> get<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> finer<00:02:42.400> cuts

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the smaller Clippers to get a finer cuts

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:58.199 
the smaller Clippers to get a finer cuts
above<00:02:43.270> their<00:02:43.570> whiskers<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.580> here<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:45.970> go

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.809 

they're<00:02:59.209> very<00:02:59.420> quiet<00:02:59.810> it's<00:03:00.769> even<00:03:01.159> easier<00:03:01.580> to

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
they're very quiet it's even easier to

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.580 
they're very quiet it's even easier to
clip<00:03:02.030> them<00:03:02.299> if<00:03:02.480> their<00:03:02.690> head<00:03:02.810> color<00:03:03.080> isn't<00:03:03.409> on

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
clip them if their head color isn't on

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.259 
clip them if their head color isn't on
but<00:03:03.890> you've<00:03:04.010> got<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.370> really<00:03:04.670> know<00:03:04.819> them<00:03:05.060> and

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
but you've got to really know them and

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.800 
but you've got to really know them and
trust<00:03:05.599> them<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.959> be<00:03:06.080> able<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.379> do<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:10.810> let's

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
trust them to be able to do that let's

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.350 
trust them to be able to do that let's
just<00:03:11.930> move<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.290> onto<00:03:12.739> her<00:03:12.890> neck<00:03:13.099> here<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.330> I

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
just move it onto her neck here so I

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.009 
just move it onto her neck here so I
still<00:03:14.750> have<00:03:14.989> her<00:03:15.910> under<00:03:16.910> control<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.629> mean<00:03:17.900> I

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
still have her under control I mean I

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.869 
still have her under control I mean I
trust<00:03:18.440> her<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.829> know<00:03:18.950> she's<00:03:19.220> going<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.579> stand

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
trust her and know she's going to stand

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.089 
trust her and know she's going to stand
quietly<00:03:20.299> it's<00:03:20.840> much<00:03:21.019> easier<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.590> do<00:03:21.860> their

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099
