while I go the rink for games I see

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.780 
while I go the rink for games I see
people<00:00:09.300> on<00:00:09.450> these<00:00:09.660> things

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
people on these things

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.310 
people on these things
I<00:00:10.820> really<00:00:11.240> just<00:00:11.360> wanted<00:00:11.630> to<00:00:11.690> get<00:00:11.780> out<00:00:11.930> on<00:00:12.110> one

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
I really just wanted to get out on one

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.770 
I really just wanted to get out on one
and<00:00:12.500> rip<00:00:12.680> around<00:00:12.920> cities<00:00:13.670> how'd<00:00:14.420> you<00:00:14.510> decide

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
and rip around cities how'd you decide

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.740 
and rip around cities how'd you decide
to<00:00:14.870> bring<00:00:14.960> these<00:00:15.080> guys<00:00:15.260> with<00:00:15.410> it<00:00:15.640> I<00:00:16.660> think<00:00:17.660> they

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
to bring these guys with it I think they

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.620 
to bring these guys with it I think they
just<00:00:17.779> want<00:00:18.080> to<00:00:18.140> come<00:00:18.350> but

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
just want to come but

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
we kind of made into a little tour thing

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.010 
we kind of made into a little tour thing
here<00:00:22.090> Liz<00:00:22.420> this<00:00:22.690> so<00:00:23.280> I<00:00:24.280> think<00:00:25.000> they<00:00:25.300> were<00:00:25.360> opted

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
here Liz this so I think they were opted

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.029 
here Liz this so I think they were opted
in<00:00:26.170> and<00:00:26.350> then

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.739 

it<00:00:30.039> seems<00:00:30.310> like<00:00:30.460> one<00:00:31.060> one<00:00:31.329> member<00:00:31.570> of<00:00:31.599> this

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:31.749 
it seems like one one member of this

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:32.880 
it seems like one one member of this
party<00:00:32.079> keeps<00:00:32.259> kind<00:00:32.349> of<00:00:32.500> getting<00:00:32.680> in<00:00:32.770> trouble

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
party keeps kind of getting in trouble

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.119 
party keeps kind of getting in trouble
with<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.219> authorities<00:00:33.250> do<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.030> yeah<00:00:38.129> it's

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
with the authorities do it yeah it's

00:00:39.129 --> 00:01:18.800 
with the authorities do it yeah it's
reckless

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.700 

seems<00:01:19.810> like<00:01:19.899> you're<00:01:20.020> going<00:01:20.140> faster<00:01:20.500> than<00:01:20.619> the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
seems like you're going faster than the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.380 
seems like you're going faster than the
other<00:01:20.830> people<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:27.820> at<00:01:28.000> all
