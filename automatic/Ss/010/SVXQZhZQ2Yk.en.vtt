 Iker Casillas 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.349
 with the support of the international agency for development 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.509
 presentation 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.509
 improve our rural housing 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:24.520
 Dear Friends 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.440
 We know that they have decided to make an effort to improve their living conditions 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.090
 that we have prepared this video this will teach us to improve gave their 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.850
 households 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 I hope you put it into practice 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 let's see what Mr. joaquin tells us 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.920
 before the vegetables sown broadcast 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 has not subscribed to my land 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.290
 perÃ¡n my products were very small 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.250
 now I have enough 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.000
 who produce good vegetables 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 I feel very happy today 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.740
 because here in Quito 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.700
 the joaquin lord entered 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 who wants to tell us something 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.630
 homegardens 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 The size of the garden will depend on the land available to each family to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.010
 said end 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.030
 for this video we will take the measurements of eight meters by five and a half meters 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.110
 as an example 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.420
 to install a family garden we need more recent tools 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.720
 more apathetic 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.590
 the straight 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.590
 the legacy 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460
 how do we install a family garden 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
 first the land must be expensive 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.760
 you have to consider 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.760
 how are you going to distribute the garden space 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.099
 in the following way 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.989
 Acosta more than seven meters with 40 centimeters long 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.299
 with one meter wide 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.010
 2k more than six meters 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.559
 ten centimeters long 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.859
 by one meter wide 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.049
 a seedling two meters long and 30 centimeters long 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.339
 by one wide 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:31.910
 Do not forget that we must also prepare roads 30 centimeters wide 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.910
 that will allow us to work 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.419
 Next, proceed to prepare the soil 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.879
 break the big clods 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.359
 cynthia the soil of stones because they impede the growth of the roots 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.639
 moistens the soil and the next day on February 13 with a peak 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.089
 prepare space for the masses 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.579
 also the roads and beds for crops 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.269
 Apply this wednesday of the beds 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.559
 but first make sure that the manure has been fenced at least during 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:06.910
 three months 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.239
 otherwise the plants will be burned 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.119
 remember that the bonanza 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.119
 propose to the soil the foods that the plants consume 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.819
 you can now select the crops 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.270
 in this case we will choose the sowing of cane 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.270
 Swiss chard and lettuce 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:49.069
 In the case of the heifer gallas the heca the type of sowing is direct as a 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.069
 Next, we explain 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.539
 you must first open the grooves considering the following distances 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:02.019
 for chard the distance between rows is 10 centimeters 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.389
 for the veteran 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.389
 the distance between rows is 30 centimeters 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.740
 but it would sow the seeds in the following way 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.809
 dig an amount of 2 centimeters deep 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:27.800
 with what that one 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.509
 one or two seeds 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.860
 tacuatÃ­ press gently 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.889
 then 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.889
 of the bcra 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.479
 in the case of lettuce 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.849
 mastic is recommended 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.849
 for the difficult and germination of this product in the area 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:54.010
 is 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.180
 We are going to make it in the conditioned space for it 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.219
 we throw little manure a post 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.219
 and we mix it with the earth 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.889
 moisten moscone cuba 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.889
 and we leave it until the next day 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:16.219
 the next day it is done in rows of six centimeters between 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.219
 they 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.710
 and then planting the seeds in the following way 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.099
 after 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.500
 apply four liters of water in the morning 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.230
 and two in the night between diego type rain 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.230
 so that the seed does not jump 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.789
 the transplant 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.259
 when the plants have 10 to 15 centimeters they are taken out with their country 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:54.139
 complete 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.139
 and they are raised in beds prepared for that purpose 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.569
 It should be done in the afternoon and with the soil one month 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:04.139
 do not forget 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.060
 that you should water ask that by signing the weeds that appear 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.090
 and you already have your web
