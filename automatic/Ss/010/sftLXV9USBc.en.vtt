00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.450 

last<00:00:01.230> time<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.620> explored<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.040> laws<00:00:02.280> of

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
last time we explored the laws of

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.329 
last time we explored the laws of
exponents<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:03.179> we<00:00:03.840> figured<00:00:04.650> out<00:00:04.799> how<00:00:05.130> they

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
exponents and we figured out how they

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.130 
exponents and we figured out how they
worked<00:00:05.640> as<00:00:05.850> long<00:00:06.210> as<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.480> were<00:00:06.600> talking<00:00:06.839> about

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
worked as long as we were talking about

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.470 
worked as long as we were talking about
positive<00:00:08.040> integer<00:00:08.429> powers<00:00:08.790> multiplying

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
positive integer powers multiplying

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360 
positive integer powers multiplying
numbers<00:00:09.630> by<00:00:09.929> themselves<00:00:10.080> over<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.190> over

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
numbers by themselves over and over

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.980 
numbers by themselves over and over
again<00:00:11.599> so<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.750> saw<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.740> if<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> B

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
again so we saw that if that a to the B

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.939 
again so we saw that if that a to the B
times<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> C<00:00:16.890> was<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.730> B<00:00:17.880> plus<00:00:18.119> C

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
times a to the C was a to the B plus C

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.130 
times a to the C was a to the B plus C
that<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> B<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.850> C<00:00:20.939> power<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
that a to the B to the C power was a to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.460 
that a to the B to the C power was a to
the<00:00:22.320> BC<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.240> that<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> B<00:00:24.750> divided<00:00:25.350> by<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the BC and that a to the B divided by a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.580 
the BC and that a to the B divided by a
to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> C<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.789> B<00:00:26.939> minus<00:00:27.269> C<00:00:27.590> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
to the C was a to the B minus C and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.490 
to the C was a to the B minus C and
those<00:00:29.220> laws<00:00:29.490> worked<00:00:30.029> wonderfully<00:00:30.840> as<00:00:31.019> long<00:00:31.349> as

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
those laws worked wonderfully as long as

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.530 
those laws worked wonderfully as long as
we<00:00:31.619> were<00:00:31.769> talking<00:00:32.130> about<00:00:32.250> integer<00:00:32.730> powers<00:00:33.090> B

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
we were talking about integer powers B

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
we were talking about integer powers B
and<00:00:33.690> C<00:00:33.870> had<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.320> integers<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.550> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and C had to be integers and for that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.170 
and C had to be integers and for that
matter

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
matter

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.680 
matter
B<00:00:36.809> minus<00:00:37.320> C<00:00:37.500> has<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.190> positive<00:00:39.120> integer

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
B minus C has to be a positive integer

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.400 
B minus C has to be a positive integer
and<00:00:40.280> we<00:00:41.280> wanted<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> BA<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.750> positive

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
and we wanted a to be a BA a positive

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.660 
and we wanted a to be a BA a positive
number<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.010> multiply<00:00:44.250> over<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
number that you can multiply over and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.959 
number that you can multiply over and
over<00:00:44.850> again<00:00:45.410> okay<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:47.129> time<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.850> gonna

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
over again okay this time we're gonna

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.260 
over again okay this time we're gonna
start<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> talk<00:00:48.660> about<00:00:48.690> what<00:00:49.399> 0<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.760> negative

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
start to talk about what 0 and negative

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.110 
start to talk about what 0 and negative
powers<00:00:51.840> mean<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.559> we<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:53.129> gonna<00:00:53.219> say<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
powers mean so we are gonna say what is

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.529 
powers mean so we are gonna say what is
3<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> 0<00:00:54.629> mean<00:00:55.879> what<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.000> 5<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
3 to the 0 mean what is 5 to the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.799 
3 to the 0 mean what is 5 to the
negative<00:00:57.570> 3<00:00:58.109> mean<00:00:59.149> what<00:01:00.149> about<00:01:00.239> fractional

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
negative 3 mean what about fractional

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.840 
negative 3 mean what about fractional
powers<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.289> give<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> 5<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> 5<00:01:02.550> halves

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
powers if I give you 5 to the 5 halves

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000 
powers if I give you 5 to the 5 halves
or<00:01:03.149> 3<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> 5<00:01:03.809> halves<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.229> X<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> 5

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
or 3 to the 5 halves or X to the 5

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.830 
or 3 to the 5 halves or X to the 5
halves<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:06.150> does<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.270> mean

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
halves what does that mean

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.230 
halves what does that mean
and<00:01:08.000> finally<00:01:09.140> what<00:01:10.140> does<00:01:10.549> not<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> fractional

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and finally what does not a fractional

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.090 
and finally what does not a fractional
power<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> irrational<00:01:13.290> power<00:01:13.770> what

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
power but in the irrational power what

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.310 
power but in the irrational power what
does<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> mean<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> let's<00:01:15.869> take<00:01:16.080> these<00:01:16.200> one

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
does that mean so let's take these one

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.690 
does that mean so let's take these one
at<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> time<00:01:17.509> we<00:01:18.509> start<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> 0th

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
at a time we start off with the 0th

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.090 
at a time we start off with the 0th
power<00:01:21.530> now<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.670> zero<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.830> 1

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
power now a to the zero is a to the 1

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.330 
power now a to the zero is a to the 1
minus<00:01:26.549> 1<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.090> 0<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.390> 1<00:01:27.570> minus<00:01:27.840> 1<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
minus 1 because 0 is 1 minus 1 and the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.390 
minus 1 because 0 is 1 minus 1 and the
law<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.880> exponents<00:01:30.420> says<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.100> 1

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
law of exponents says that a to the 1

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.090 
law of exponents says that a to the 1
divided<00:01:33.299> by<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.990> 1<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> 1

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
divided by a to the 1 is a to the 1

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.710 
divided by a to the 1 is a to the 1
minus<00:01:35.400> 1<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.909> divided<00:01:39.630> by

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
minus 1 and so this is just a divided by

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.980 
minus 1 and so this is just a divided by
a<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:41.400> course<00:01:41.670> that's<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:45.110> unless<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:47.159> 0

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
a and of course that's one unless a is 0

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
a and of course that's one unless a is 0
so<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.229> we've<00:01:49.380> gotten<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> law<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
so what we've gotten is the law that a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.840 
so what we've gotten is the law that a
to<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.299> 0<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.840> equal<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.350> 1<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:54.899> 0<00:01:55.850> 0

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to the 0 is equal to 1 if a is not 0 0

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.270 
to the 0 is equal to 1 if a is not 0 0
to<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> 0<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:58.680> defined<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:01.710> can't<00:02:02.040> take

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
to the 0 is not defined you can't take

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.240 
to the 0 is not defined you can't take
the<00:02:02.460> 0th<00:02:02.759> power<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.350> 0<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:04.979> just

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the 0th power of 0 because that's just

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429 
the 0th power of 0 because that's just
saying<00:02:05.490> 0<00:02:05.880> divided<00:02:06.390> by<00:02:06.420> 0<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:07.020> doesn't<00:02:07.320> make

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
saying 0 divided by 0 that doesn't make

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.590 
saying 0 divided by 0 that doesn't make
sense

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.890 

put<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> box<00:02:12.810> around<00:02:12.960> it<00:02:13.230> move<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:14.690> now<00:02:15.690> let's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
put a box around it move on now let's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.320 
put a box around it move on now let's
talk<00:02:16.020> about<00:02:16.080> negative<00:02:16.620> powers<00:02:17.180> suppose<00:02:18.180> we

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
talk about negative powers suppose we

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.870 
talk about negative powers suppose we
want<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.720> negative<00:02:19.080> nth<00:02:19.560> power<00:02:20.310> or<00:02:20.520> something

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
want the negative nth power or something

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.680 
want the negative nth power or something
like<00:02:21.140> five<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.410> minus<00:02:22.800> third<00:02:23.450> well<00:02:24.450> this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
like five to the minus third well this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.760 
like five to the minus third well this
is<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.770> zero<00:02:26.190> minus<00:02:26.760> n<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.380> our<00:02:28.380> law<00:02:28.620> of

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
is a to the zero minus n and our law of

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.680 
is a to the zero minus n and our law of
exponents<00:02:29.430> said<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.000> had<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.600> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
exponents said that that had to be a to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.050 
exponents said that that had to be a to
the<00:02:31.020> zero<00:02:31.970> divided<00:02:32.970> by<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.600> n<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:35.060> we

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the zero divided by a to the n and we

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.010 
the zero divided by a to the n and we
just<00:02:36.270> said<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.080> zero<00:02:37.350> was<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:39.020> so

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
just said that a to the zero was one so

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.390 
just said that a to the zero was one so
whenever<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.590> an<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.880> negative<00:02:41.880> power

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
whenever you see an a negative power

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.830 
whenever you see an a negative power
it's<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.550> same<00:02:44.820> thing<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.090> dividing<00:02:45.480> by<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
it's the same thing as dividing by a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.470 
it's the same thing as dividing by a
positive<00:02:46.110> power<00:02:46.700> when<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.730> say<00:02:47.970> 2<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
positive power when I say 2 to the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.510 
positive power when I say 2 to the
negative<00:02:48.660> 3<00:02:50.120> that's<00:02:51.120> 1<00:02:51.770> over<00:02:52.770> 2<00:02:52.950> times<00:02:53.160> 2<00:02:53.340> times

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
negative 3 that's 1 over 2 times 2 times

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.960 
negative 3 that's 1 over 2 times 2 times
2<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.200> will<00:02:55.200> describe<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.580> saying<00:02:56.820> there

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
2 I will describe this as saying there

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.270 
2 I will describe this as saying there
are<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> negative<00:02:57.390> 3<00:02:57.870> powers<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.410> 2<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.070> here

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
are a negative 3 powers of 2 in here

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.850 
are a negative 3 powers of 2 in here
what<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.060> really<00:03:00.270> means<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.380> have<00:03:01.530> 2

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
what it really means is that you have 2

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.850 
what it really means is that you have 2
divided<00:03:02.280> by<00:03:02.310> 3<00:03:02.900> divided<00:03:03.900> by<00:03:03.930> 2<00:03:04.170> 3<00:03:04.590> times

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
divided by 3 divided by 2 3 times

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.490 
divided by 3 divided by 2 3 times
instead<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.790> multiplying<00:03:06.420> by<00:03:06.600> 2/3<00:03:07.170> times

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
instead of multiplying by 2/3 times

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.940 
instead of multiplying by 2/3 times
negative<00:03:08.600> exponents<00:03:09.600> means<00:03:10.140> divided<00:03:10.650> that

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
negative exponents means divided that

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.310 
negative exponents means divided that
many<00:03:11.130> times<00:03:11.430> positive<00:03:12.239> exponents<00:03:13.110> means

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
many times positive exponents means

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.440 
many times positive exponents means
multiply<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.220> many<00:03:14.400> times<00:03:17.120> then<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.299> have

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
multiply that many times then we have

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.300 
multiply that many times then we have
fractional<00:03:18.959> powers<00:03:19.320> now<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.799> understand

fractional powers now to understand
fractional<00:03:20.880> powers<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.390> use<00:03:21.510> another<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.989> our

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
fractional powers we use another of our

fractional powers we use another of our
laws<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.470> exponents<00:03:23.090> if<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.209> want<00:03:24.450> to

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
laws of exponents if you want to

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.020

understand<00:03:24.989> X<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.530> 5<00:03:25.739> halves<00:03:26.040> let's<00:03:26.880> see

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
understand X to the 5 halves let's see

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.620 
understand X to the 5 halves let's see
what<00:03:27.180> X<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.570> 5<00:03:27.720> halves<00:03:28.019> squared<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:29.630> so

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
what X to the 5 halves squared is so

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.900 
what X to the 5 halves squared is so
this<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.049> X<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.680> 5<00:03:31.920> halves<00:03:32.420> times<00:03:33.420> 2<00:03:34.910> that's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
this is X to the 5 halves times 2 that's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.460 
this is X to the 5 halves times 2 that's
X<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.630> fifth<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:39.209> must<00:03:39.540> have<00:03:39.840> X<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
X to the fifth so you must have X to the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.550 
X to the fifth so you must have X to the
5<00:03:40.739> halves<00:03:41.360> must<00:03:42.360> be<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.470> square<00:03:43.650> root<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:45.380> x<00:03:46.380> to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
5 halves must be the square root of x to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.920 
5 halves must be the square root of x to
the<00:03:46.650> fifth<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:48.350> this<00:03:49.350> only<00:03:49.620> makes<00:03:50.010> sense<00:03:50.340> if<00:03:50.930> X

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
the fifth and this only makes sense if X

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.069 
the fifth and this only makes sense if X
is<00:03:52.230> at<00:03:52.380> least<00:03:52.590> zero<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.340> X<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.850> negative<00:03:54.090> x<00:03:54.660> to

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
is at least zero if X is negative x to

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.810 
is at least zero if X is negative x to
the<00:03:55.170> fifth<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.590> negative<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.250> can't<00:03:56.489> take<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
the fifth is negative you can't take the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.539 
the fifth is negative you can't take the
square<00:03:56.970> root<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.360> negative<00:03:57.480> number<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.549> in

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
square root of a negative number so in

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.509 
square root of a negative number so in
general<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:00.480> we<00:04:00.630> do<00:04:00.810> fractional<00:04:01.530> powers<00:04:01.890> we

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
general when we do fractional powers we

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.000 
general when we do fractional powers we
only<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:03.000> fractional<00:04:03.660> powers<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.200> positive

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
only do fractional powers of positive

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.770 
only do fractional powers of positive
number<00:04:05.280> numbers<00:04:05.579> we<00:04:05.760> don't<00:04:05.970> do<00:04:06.239> fractional

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
number numbers we don't do fractional

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.789 
number numbers we don't do fractional

generally<00:04:11.400> if<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.730> say<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.630> P<00:04:12.840> over<00:04:13.200> Q<00:04:13.790> if

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
generally if I say a to the P over Q if

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.449 
generally if I say a to the P over Q if
you<00:04:14.940> take<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.690> Q<00:04:15.930> power<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:17.099> got<00:04:17.310> to

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
you take that to the Q power you got to

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.349 
you take that to the Q power you got to
get<00:04:17.580> a<00:04:17.729> to<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.060> P

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
get a to the P

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.300 
get a to the P
so<00:04:20.139> that<00:04:20.289> means<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.859> to<00:04:21.009> the<00:04:21.400> P<00:04:21.579> over<00:04:21.849> Q

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
so that means that a to the P over Q

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.110 
so that means that a to the P over Q
must<00:04:24.310> be<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.780> Q<00:04:26.080> root<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.300> P<00:04:30.120> it's

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
must be the Q root of a to the P it's

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:39.959 
must be the Q root of a to the P it's

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
also the Q through of a to the P because

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
is a to the P over Q so there are two

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.029 
is a to the P over Q so there are two
ways<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.719> think<00:04:58.930> about<00:04:59.139> fractional<00:04:59.680> powers

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
ways to think about fractional powers

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.980 
ways to think about fractional powers
you<00:05:00.699> can<00:05:00.879> either<00:05:01.120> think<00:05:01.270> of<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.509> as<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.750> Q

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
you can either think of it as the Q

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.100 
you can either think of it as the Q
through<00:05:02.289> of<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.949> P<00:05:03.159> or<00:05:03.940> as<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.870> peace

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
tower of the Q through today that's

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.240 
tower of the Q through today that's
fractional<00:05:10.150> powers<00:05:12.779> the<00:05:13.779> last<00:05:14.020> thing<00:05:14.379> is<00:05:14.770> what

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
fractional powers the last thing is what

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.360 
fractional powers the last thing is what
if<00:05:15.370> we<00:05:15.669> take<00:05:15.849> a<00:05:15.909> power<00:05:16.210> that's<00:05:16.479> not<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.779> fraction

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
if we take a power that's not a fraction

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.999 
if we take a power that's not a fraction
so<00:05:18.370> what<00:05:18.580> if<00:05:18.669> we<00:05:18.759> want<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.060> understand<00:05:19.740> X<00:05:20.740> to

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
so what if we want to understand X to

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.420 
so what if we want to understand X to
the<00:05:21.099> pi<00:05:22.500> well<00:05:23.500> we<00:05:23.620> have<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.889> do<00:05:24.039> this<00:05:24.190> with

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
the pi well we have to do this with

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.610 
the pi well we have to do this with
approximations<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.539> these<00:05:25.870> these<00:05:26.289> kinds<00:05:26.590> of

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
approximations and these these kinds of

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.180 
approximations and these these kinds of
approximations<00:05:27.219> are<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.819> core<00:05:28.419> of<00:05:28.539> calculus

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
approximations are the core of calculus

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.159 
approximations are the core of calculus
so<00:05:30.190> we<00:05:30.279> know<00:05:30.430> that<00:05:30.639> pi<00:05:30.940> is<00:05:31.000> close<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.569> three<00:05:31.840> so

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
so we know that pi is close to three so

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.959 
so we know that pi is close to three so
you<00:05:32.259> figure<00:05:32.560> that<00:05:32.680> X<00:05:33.069> to<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.460> power<00:05:33.639> should<00:05:33.909> be

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
you figure that X to the power should be

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.589 
you figure that X to the power should be
close<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.479> X<00:05:34.629> cubed<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.940> we<00:05:37.060> know<00:05:37.210> that<00:05:37.360> pi<00:05:37.569> is

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
close to X cubed and we know that pi is

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.129 
close to X cubed and we know that pi is
even<00:05:38.020> closer<00:05:38.259> to<00:05:38.500> 3.1<00:05:39.240> so<00:05:40.240> X<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:40.599> the<00:05:40.719> pi<00:05:40.870> should

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
even closer to 3.1 so X to the pi should

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.369 
even closer to 3.1 so X to the pi should
be<00:05:41.289> closer<00:05:41.620> to<00:05:42.009> X<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.490> 3.1<00:05:43.180> now<00:05:43.990> what<00:05:44.139> is<00:05:44.229> X

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:44.379 
be closer to X to the 3.1 now what is X

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:49.350 
be closer to X to the 3.1 now what is X
to<00:05:44.469> the<00:05:44.560> 3.1<00:05:45.159> mean<00:05:45.479> well<00:05:46.479> 3.1<00:05:47.169> is<00:05:47.379> 31<00:05:47.919> tenths<00:05:48.400> so

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
to the 3.1 mean well 3.1 is 31 tenths so

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.260 
to the 3.1 mean well 3.1 is 31 tenths so
that's<00:05:49.569> the<00:05:50.229> tenth<00:05:50.500> root<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:51.009> x<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.520> 31<00:05:51.940> X

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.089 

to<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.360> three<00:05:55.539> point<00:05:55.750> one<00:05:55.930> four<00:05:55.960> is<00:05:56.529> the

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
to the three point one four is the

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.399 
to the three point one four is the
hundredth<00:05:57.610> root<00:05:57.849> of<00:05:58.000> x<00:05:58.479> to<00:05:58.659> the<00:05:58.719> 314<00:06:00.960> X<00:06:01.960> to<00:06:02.289> the

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
hundredth root of x to the 314 X to the

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.649 
hundredth root of x to the 314 X to the
three<00:06:02.589> point<00:06:02.800> one<00:06:02.979> four<00:06:03.009> one<00:06:03.490> is<00:06:03.729> a<00:06:03.969> thousandth

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
three point one four one is a thousandth

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:10.499 
three point one four one is a thousandth
root<00:06:04.839> of<00:06:04.990> x<00:06:05.229> to<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:06.000> 3141<00:06:07.560> and<00:06:08.560> so<00:06:09.120> if<00:06:10.120> you<00:06:10.270> want

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
root of x to the 3141 and so if you want

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.209 
root of x to the 3141 and so if you want
to<00:06:10.569> know<00:06:10.690> what<00:06:10.839> X<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.199> the<00:06:11.289> Pi<00:06:11.469> is<00:06:11.529> you<00:06:11.919> come<00:06:12.099> up

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:12.219 
to know what X to the Pi is you come up

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:13.860 
to know what X to the Pi is you come up
with<00:06:12.250> fractions<00:06:13.000> that<00:06:13.150> get<00:06:13.330> closer<00:06:13.659> and

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
with fractions that get closer and

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.469 
with fractions that get closer and
closer<00:06:14.050> and<00:06:14.259> closer<00:06:14.500> to<00:06:14.740> PI<00:06:14.889> and<00:06:15.250> take<00:06:15.940> X<00:06:16.210> to

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
closer and closer to PI and take X to

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.939 
closer and closer to PI and take X to
those<00:06:16.629> powers<00:06:17.370> so<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:20.229> get<00:06:20.379> the<00:06:20.529> exact

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
those powers so and to get the exact

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.159 
those powers so and to get the exact
value<00:06:21.069> you<00:06:21.909> have<00:06:22.089> to<00:06:22.270> use<00:06:22.389> a<00:06:22.419> limit<00:06:22.839> now<00:06:23.139> the

price precise definition of a limit
we're<00:06:25.509> gonna<00:06:25.659> get<00:06:25.810> later<00:06:26.399> that's<00:06:27.399> one<00:06:28.149> of<00:06:28.240> the

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
we're gonna get later that's one of the

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.209 
we're gonna get later that's one of the
key<00:06:28.509> ideas<00:06:28.959> of<00:06:29.139> calculus<00:06:29.560> is<00:06:29.709> the<00:06:29.740> first<00:06:30.039> of

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219 
key ideas of calculus is the first of

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:31.999 
key ideas of calculus is the first of
the<00:06:30.279> six<00:06:30.430> pillars<00:06:30.639> of<00:06:30.880> calculus

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
the six pillars of calculus

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.659 
the six pillars of calculus
but<00:06:32.879> for<00:06:33.089> now<00:06:33.589> we're<00:06:34.589> gonna<00:06:34.710> hand<00:06:35.279> wave<00:06:35.520> it

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
but for now we're gonna hand wave it

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.179 
but for now we're gonna hand wave it
we're<00:06:36.240> just<00:06:36.270> gonna<00:06:36.509> say<00:06:36.839> if<00:06:37.289> you<00:06:37.830> want<00:06:38.099> to

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:38.189 
we're just gonna say if you want to

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:45.109 
we're just gonna say if you want to
understand<00:06:38.729> the<00:06:38.879> function<00:06:39.360> a<00:06:40.339> to<00:06:41.339> the<00:06:41.669> X<00:06:44.119> then

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:45.119 
understand the function a to the X then

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:50.779 
understand the function a to the X then
that<00:06:45.330> makes<00:06:45.599> sense<00:06:47.839> when<00:06:48.839> X<00:06:49.110> is<00:06:49.589> a<00:06:50.309> rational

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
that makes sense when X is a rational

00:06:50.789 --> 00:07:01.040 
that makes sense when X is a rational
number<00:06:52.520> and<00:06:54.529> then<00:06:56.180> fill<00:06:57.180> in<00:06:57.360> the<00:06:57.389> holes<00:06:59.779> when<00:07:00.779> X

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
number and then fill in the holes when X
