00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
order the parts and then we'll put it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
order the parts and then we'll put it
through<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> repair<00:00:35.340> process<00:00:35.690> what<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.810> have

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
through the repair process what we have

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.620 
through the repair process what we have
is<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> camera<00:00:37.650> system<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.310> take

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
is a camera system that will take

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.420 
is a camera system that will take
pictures<00:00:39.630> of<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> damage<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.650> we<00:00:41.250> can

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
pictures of the damage and we can

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.980 
pictures of the damage and we can
actually<00:00:41.790> upload<00:00:42.030> these<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> insurance

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
actually upload these to the insurance

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.110 
actually upload these to the insurance
company<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.740> the<00:00:44.250> insurance<00:00:44.340> company<00:00:44.940> sees

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
company and the insurance company sees

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
company and the insurance company sees
the<00:00:45.300> whole<00:00:45.450> complete<00:00:45.810> picture<00:00:46.110> along<00:00:46.620> with

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the whole complete picture along with

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.220 
the whole complete picture along with
the<00:00:47.100> estimate<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.020> done

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the estimate and this is all done

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.900 
the estimate and this is all done
through<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.470> computer<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.250> makes<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> easier

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
through a computer it makes it easier

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.820 
through a computer it makes it easier
for<00:00:51.300> us<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> take<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> picture<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.560> we<00:00:52.680> don't

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
for us to take the picture so we don't

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.530 
for us to take the picture so we don't
have<00:00:52.950> to<00:00:53.130> come<00:00:53.310> back<00:00:53.490> and<00:00:53.760> download<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.390> can

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
bring the car back to the same shape and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.510 
bring the car back to the same shape and

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
the same body construction that was

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.100 
the same body construction that was
there<00:01:30.820> before<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.450> accident

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
there before the accident

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.100 
there before the accident
accuracy<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.850> definitely<00:01:33.850> important<00:01:34.420> because

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
accuracy is definitely important because

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.290 
accuracy is definitely important because
of<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.530> fact<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.980> everything<00:01:36.550> has<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:37.030> fit

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
of the fact that everything has to fit

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.630 
of the fact that everything has to fit
if<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.480> don't<00:01:37.840> have<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.230> car<00:01:38.500> straight<00:01:38.890> you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
if you don't have the car straight you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.490 
if you don't have the car straight you
don't<00:01:39.910> have<00:01:40.120> everything<00:01:40.420> back<00:01:40.780> in<00:01:41.050> perfect

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
don't have everything back in perfect

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.860 
don't have everything back in perfect
shape<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:42.400> will<00:01:42.640> not<00:01:42.820> get<00:01:43.060> any<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.510> parts

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
shape you will not get any of the parts

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.470 
shape you will not get any of the parts
to<00:01:43.930> fit<00:01:44.260> properly<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:45.580> therefore<00:01:46.030> we<00:01:46.180> want<00:01:46.390> to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
to fit properly so therefore we want to

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.090 
to fit properly so therefore we want to
make<00:01:46.660> sure<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.050> car<00:01:47.260> is<00:01:47.500> right<00:01:47.680> back<00:01:47.890> to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
make sure the car is right back to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.160 
make sure the car is right back to
pre-accident<00:01:48.340> condition<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.510> that

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
pre-accident condition and that

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.890 
pre-accident condition and that
everything<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:50.920> going<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.280> fit<00:01:51.580> 100%<00:01:52.570> our

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
everything is going to fit 100% our

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.380 
everything is going to fit 100% our
process<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.800> probably<00:01:54.220> one<00:01:54.370> of<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.580> best<00:01:54.790> in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
process is probably one of the best in

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.580 
process is probably one of the best in
