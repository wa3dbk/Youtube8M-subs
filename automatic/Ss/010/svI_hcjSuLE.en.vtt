00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 personal hello okay can do to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.879
 you step by step how to draw 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.560
 a model top blouse 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.469
 will also fit for that top crop 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.860
 God I never had to modeling the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.860
 grandmother 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 then we will begin the retraction of the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.119
 our base of a blouse 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.539
 so this is so if you are going to do this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.939
 little light is with fabric 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 Elastane Knit You Will Have To Bring The 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.710
 a basis with the measures of a new 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.590
 table of measures that is already in the mesh is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.520
 you put google the table of 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.350
 Measures for amalia is to buy fabrics 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 with elastano you will find several 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.399
 results do not have to high there 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.010
 elasticity for medium in city city 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.170
 and the standard table that is for flat fabric 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 It's the one I'm using here. 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 For tissue with average elasticity, I 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.210
 I looked for lugo and gave it to my 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.550
 measure was not hit with any size of the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.680
 My table staff hit with had 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.170
 so I put it on top of the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.180
 table even if you did not have your 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.909
 measures does not match the table of measurements 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.000
 for knitwear you can be 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.240
 decreasing two centimeters is in the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.840
 standard template even I come back retracting 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.840
 she's the front and the back 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 Firstly 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.850
 the front of us will be 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.380
 pretending here our bust line with 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.220
 the sharing of the booty that will be 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.760
 climbing 3 centimeters in the middle of our 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.760
 from the front 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.700
 We're going to find the right 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.040
 middle of our bust line here is 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.420
 my 18-centimeter golf then 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.510
 nor will it be 9 and from the middle I will 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:31.860
 being 6 to 8 centimeters is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:35.550
 I'm going to climb here six inches and I 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.709
 I'll be calling you here at the end. 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.920
 from my house table compel these three 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.920
 points 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.890
 in the front it stays that way and then you go 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.650
 decide the size you want 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.510
 of your blouse in case of that 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.310
 top crop exchange is not for you guys 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.550
 I'll leave the video in the box. 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.880
 abuse information is the top 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.280
 crop of Tanks I put size 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.820
 it ends here on my waist 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.080
 ok but will get a person 's criterion 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.840
 she wants to make a dress a 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.630
 monkey that the match will be and 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.880
 if you decide the length is behind a 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.010
 straight and cut it then adds 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.200
 the seam allowance or even for a 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.000
 shirt only decided to comply if you 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.920
 you want most right and let r trace 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.290
 this basis already on paper with a little bit 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.330
 the bigger you are, you can increase the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.670
 so much that you want in case to do 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.200
 a bat a shirt a little bit 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.770
 slightly longer length 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.040
 It's on the back of the same process. 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.500
 so in the end one of my house I go 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.870
 Score a point I'll find somewhere in between 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.989
 of my bust line that will give 9 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.120
 because it also gave 18 centimeters 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.580
 But here I am going to increase by four 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.930
 centimeters out there does not have to be so much 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.930
 How much ahead there? 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.189
 and here you will be able to see also the 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.570
 where you want to end right which is the means 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.660
 of my back 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.609
 I'll mark one centimeter here below 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.970
 of the bust line 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.020
 if you want more defeated only in 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.660
 decreasing here from the line of the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:42.699
 wine okay and now I will be calling the 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:45.010
 points and the length as there in front 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.449
 You'll decide if I'm going to cut here. 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.090
 I'll also do it like I'm a top 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.650
 crop is in front and on the back I go 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.650
 cut it on the line of my waist 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:07.569
 if you went to the New Year's in your 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.699
 its on your blouse that I do not even 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.619
 step we did not even top crop it was 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.050
 with revell then I'll check up 

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:16.499
 reveals this back because it already has 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.939
 lots of notation not to get polluted 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.800
 you can take our rival in the 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:21.879
 another role later but only for us 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.789
 Mark 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:27.369
 I want to reserve how many centimeters 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.360
 So here 's my side and here's my 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.429
 my side 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.149
 This is my back and you think my 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:36.759
 front're so when I want from 

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:42.039
 from my side zinha to reveals 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:46.059
 I'll mark here that I want the seven 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:59.439
 cm and email marketing here in this 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:06:02.589
 my other side too and then I go 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:07.449
 square in the middle of my piece occhetta 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:09.789
 retina and I'm going to draw a line 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:12.059
 on this other side the same good thing 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:18.969
 the squad here in the middle is held 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:22.479
 and I'm going to draw a line then this line 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:24.699
 that I created will be mine reveals this 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.269
 part was all up to mine. 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.919
 line 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:29.319
 if you want you may be taking in 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.139
 other paper to have all the molds 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:35.409
 gardens and square 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.719
 When it's with elastane, I'll let it go. 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.569
 the three-inch wide 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:45.039
 and the fulfillment of it the 30 centimeters 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:47.499
 both the games 32 pm okay but can 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.119
 be measuring is also outside off 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:51.189
 how much does it go because sometimes the person 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:53.709
 A little higher it has a little more 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:55.869
 bust're doing must be the mouse 

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:58.779
 a little more aid for fabric 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:01.589
 plan you can leave them 48 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:03.849
 inches by three inches wide 

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:06.279
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:08.649
 have liked to sign up on the channel who 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:11.189
 Did you like the video kisses and even the 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:11.189
 next
