00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello children the report are the trees 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.049
 of the campus we are going to explain your 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.650
 name their leaves that are 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.140
 characteristics 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.279
 this is a mulberry that belongs to the 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.890
 temperate zone of asia has two types of 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.890
 leaves the whole and the achieved 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.920
 he has in him 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.329
 in the form of saw 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.710
 it's a love 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.710
 from the heart 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.220
 This is the horse chestnut 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.540
 some have many to 70 meters 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.540
 height 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.880
 we see him because he was living in autumn 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.780
 these leaves dry and in spring in the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.619
 Chestnut 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.619
 the house 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.490
 we are before one of the trees of my 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.490
 folios 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.350
 we can see that it is still in a pyramidal form 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.170
 precisely for the habitat where of 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.290
 where are the snow and are the only 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.070
 that have the articulated blades and are 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.070
 like little needles 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.130
 I will explain 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.110
 your trunk is 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.110
 shaved 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.580
 and its leaves 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.180
 They are green and their branches are shaped like 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.180
 thorns 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.490
 but 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.020
 what we have here is an art is a 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.880
 deciduous tree that belongs to the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.650
 family of the bleeding and it is 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.800
 characteristic of the countries of europe 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.810
 Africa can reach 25 meters and 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.810
 adult shadows when there are temperatures 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.130
 and its fruits are praise and criticism 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.710
 Well now I will explain the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.060
 photosynthesis that is a process through 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.500
 which becomes matter 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.570
 inorganic in organic matter and that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.000
 it feeds the plants for it 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.380
 you need that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.450
 absinthe water earth and sunlight 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.400
 the roots take from the earth salts 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.560
 minerals and water that rises to the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 leaves by means of tubes that give the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.300
 stems that are steps children and in the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.640
 leaves together with the co2 a canvas of 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.920
 carbon that in the sunlight will 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.870
 transformed into elaborate sap goes from 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.380
 be the case already elaborated that the food 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.380
 of the plants
