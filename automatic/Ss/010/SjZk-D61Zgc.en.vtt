power play and they scored on a cross in
spot<00:02:38.549> where<00:02:38.819> our<00:02:38.850> d<00:02:39.150> didn't<00:02:39.480> pick<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.870> but

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
spot where our d didn't pick it up but

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.100 
spot where our d didn't pick it up but
not<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.430> situation<00:02:41.700> i'm<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:42.420> basically<00:02:42.870> i

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
not in a situation i'm so basically i

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.100

think crutchie Ginley vucic are

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.020 
think crutchie Ginley vucic are
considered<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.069> dominant<00:02:47.340> line<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.940> the

considered to be a dominant line in the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.420 
considered to be a dominant line in the
leak<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.450> those<00:02:49.290> guys<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.950> gone<00:02:50.130> toe-to-toe

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
thought was awful we did we let him come

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.880 
thought was awful we did we let him come
through<00:03:09.750> us<00:03:09.900> instead<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.320> just<00:03:10.530> making<00:03:10.680> them

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890

through us instead of just making them
put<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.370> wall<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.880> being

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
put it on the wall and and being

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.910

aggressive<00:03:12.510> being<00:03:13.079> our<00:03:13.170> toes<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.530> i<00:03:13.769> thought

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
aggressive being our toes and i thought

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.740 
aggressive being our toes and i thought
we<00:03:14.040> got<00:03:14.160> cautious<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.180> saying<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.600> we<00:03:15.720> can't

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
about it yesterday after the first

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.840 
about it yesterday after the first
period<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.709> thought<00:03:35.130> we<00:03:35.280> had<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.489> game<00:03:35.670> right

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
period I thought we had the game right

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.520 
period I thought we had the game right
back<00:03:36.090> where<00:03:36.269> we<00:03:36.329> wanted<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:36.870> had<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.109> gameplay

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
back where we wanted we had the gameplay

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.650 
back where we wanted we had the gameplay
and<00:03:37.680> fast<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.160> was<00:03:38.250> 21<00:03:38.670> we<00:03:38.850> made<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> mistake<00:03:39.120> on

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
and fast it was 21 we made a mistake on

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.509 
and fast it was 21 we made a mistake on
a<00:03:39.690> rush<00:03:39.930> entry<00:03:40.350> on<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.590> cross<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:40.829> spot<00:03:41.280> that's

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
a rush entry on a cross and spot that's

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.370 
a rush entry on a cross and spot that's
a<00:03:41.640> simple<00:03:41.970> sort<00:03:42.239> out<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.510> up<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:42.900> our<00:03:42.989> net<00:03:43.170> I

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
a simple sort out and up in our net I

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.559 
a simple sort out and up in our net I
thought<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.890> game<00:03:44.010> was<00:03:44.160> over<00:03:44.220> at<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.700> point

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.610 

but<00:03:48.569> we<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.780> got<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.019> play<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.319> way<00:03:49.410> we<00:03:49.440> have

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
but we just got to play the way we have

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.500 
but we just got to play the way we have
I<00:03:49.769> think<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.850> know<00:03:50.940> I've<00:03:51.060> been<00:03:51.180> here<00:03:51.299> nine

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
I think you know I've been here nine

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.759 
I think you know I've been here nine
years<00:03:51.980> we've<00:03:52.980> done<00:03:53.160> this<00:03:53.310> nine<00:03:53.579> times<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.769> you

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
years we've done this nine times and you

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.319 
years we've done this nine times and you
go<00:03:55.950> through<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.310> each<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.819> every<00:03:57.030> year<00:03:57.150> the

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
go through it each and every year the

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.629 
go through it each and every year the
same<00:03:57.540> thing<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:58.350> get<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.650> series<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.280> one

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
same thing you get in a series and one

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.370 
same thing you get in a series and one
team<00:03:59.850> just<00:04:00.209> another<00:04:00.540> team<00:04:00.750> adjust<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.170> just

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
team just another team adjust you just

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.979 
team just another team adjust you just
keep<00:04:01.530> going<00:04:01.859> I<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.970> think<00:04:03.150> for<00:04:03.239> our<00:04:03.480> team<00:04:03.720> to

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
keep going I just think for our team to

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.740 
keep going I just think for our team to
be<00:04:04.260> effective<00:04:04.769> we<00:04:04.950> have<00:04:05.099> to<00:04:05.280> do<00:04:05.510> exactly<00:04:06.510> what

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
be effective we have to do exactly what

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.800 
be effective we have to do exactly what
we<00:04:06.930> do<00:04:07.170> if<00:04:07.379> we<00:04:07.409> want

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
we do if we want

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.020 
we do if we want
have<00:04:08.319> a<00:04:08.349> scrum<00:04:08.770> after<00:04:09.160> every<00:04:09.400> whistle<00:04:09.640> and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
have a scrum after every whistle and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.430 
have a scrum after every whistle and
getting<00:04:10.270> a<00:04:10.360> cross-check<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.020> match<00:04:11.140> after

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
getting a cross-check and match after

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.250 
getting a cross-check and match after
every<00:04:11.830> whistle<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.400> yeah<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.660> guy's<00:04:13.840> assume

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
every whistle and yeah that guy's assume

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.510 
every whistle and yeah that guy's assume
they're<00:04:14.440> not<00:04:14.560> letting<00:04:14.770> you<00:04:14.890> run<00:04:15.040> people<00:04:15.310> on

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520

they're not letting you run people on
icings<00:04:15.910> anymore<00:04:16.329> I<00:04:16.359> figured<00:04:16.720> they<00:04:16.900> probably

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
icings anymore I figured they probably

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.569 
icings anymore I figured they probably
got<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:17.440> figured<00:04:17.650> out<00:04:17.859> after<00:04:18.160> yesterday

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
got that figured out after yesterday

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.170 
got that figured out after yesterday
like<00:04:19.060> little<00:04:19.329> things<00:04:19.359> like<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.720> I<00:04:20.139> assume

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
like little things like that I assume

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.080 
like little things like that I assume
those<00:04:22.180> things<00:04:22.450> will<00:04:22.600> be<00:04:22.690> cleaned<00:04:22.960> up
