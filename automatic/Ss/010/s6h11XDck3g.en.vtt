00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
and then this is the second page and I

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.810 
and then this is the second page and I
think<00:00:58.120> she<00:00:58.690> put<00:00:58.960> these<00:00:59.230> together<00:00:59.609> bought<00:01:00.609> some

think she put these together bought some

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.509 
think she put these together bought some
pieces<00:01:01.059> at<00:01:01.329> Michaels<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.749> put<00:01:01.960> them<00:01:02.079> together

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.140 
pieces at Michaels and put them together
another<00:01:03.519> wax<00:01:04.030> stamp<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.920> love<00:01:06.159> these<00:01:06.310> papers

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.290 

and<00:01:10.150> then<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.450> here<00:01:10.810> she<00:01:11.140> put<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> pocket<00:01:12.300> where

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
and then in here she put a pocket where

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.320 
and then in here she put a pocket where
she<00:01:13.480> put<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.870> tag<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.070> those<00:01:18.610> tags<00:01:18.940> were<00:01:19.150> run

she put to tag and those tags were run

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.470 
she put to tag and those tags were run
through<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.630> cuttlebug<00:01:20.940> there's<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.150> swirl

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
through the cuttlebug there's the swirl

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.350 
through the cuttlebug there's the swirl
and<00:01:22.660> then<00:01:22.960> this<00:01:23.080> is<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:24.210> handwriting<00:01:25.210> one

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
page it look like well their keys but

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.470 
page it look like well their keys but
they<00:02:37.190> look<00:02:37.340> like<00:02:37.490> they've<00:02:37.670> been<00:02:37.700> liquid<00:02:38.210> glass

did<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.980> don't<00:02:43.250> know<00:02:43.370> they<00:02:43.760> might<00:02:43.790> have
