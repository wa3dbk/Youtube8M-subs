00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
when they're green before they turn if

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.850 
when they're green before they turn if

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
even I read in the book here that even

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.700 
even I read in the book here that even
just<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.210> ripened<00:01:54.600> regular<00:01:55.140> elderberries

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
just the ripened regular elderberries

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.550 
just the ripened regular elderberries
they<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.159> make<00:01:56.399> some<00:01:56.640> people<00:01:56.909> feel<00:01:57.240> nauseous

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
they can make some people feel nauseous

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.170 
they can make some people feel nauseous
so<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:58.950> everyone<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.729> course<00:02:00.000> if

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
so it's not for everyone of course if

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.380 
so it's not for everyone of course if
you<00:02:00.299> use<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.960> bake<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.520> eat<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.180> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you use this to bake or you eat it in a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.709 
you use this to bake or you eat it in a
cooked<00:02:03.659> form<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.729> little<00:02:06.090> different<00:02:06.270> ok

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
cooked form it's a little different ok

nauseous if you do get that kind of
reaction<00:02:10.259> from<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.640> eating<00:02:11.970> them<00:02:12.180> raw

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
reaction from it but eating them raw

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.860 
reaction from it but eating them raw
that<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> side<00:02:13.470> effects

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
that that is a side effects

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.199 
that that is a side effects
some<00:02:13.959> people<00:02:14.230> feel<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.129> only<00:02:15.670> had<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.849> couple<00:02:15.909> of

some people feel I only had a couple of

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.720 
some people feel I only had a couple of
them<00:02:16.360> just<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.569> taste<00:02:17.010> they're<00:02:18.010> not<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.489> very

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
them just a taste they're not a very

them just a taste they're not a very
sweet<00:02:18.970> berry<00:02:19.299> but<00:02:19.480> they<00:02:19.569> certainly<00:02:19.750> do<00:02:19.989> have

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
sweet berry but they certainly do have

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.080 
sweet berry but they certainly do have
their<00:02:20.260> own<00:02:20.290> flavor<00:02:20.799> which<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.700> actually<00:02:21.849> quite

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
their own flavor which is actually quite

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.880 
their own flavor which is actually quite
nice<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.659> imagine<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.260> know<00:02:23.500> making<00:02:23.739> a

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
nice I can imagine you know making a

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.289 
nice I can imagine you know making a
jelly<00:02:24.099> or<00:02:24.280> jam<00:02:24.519> in<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.730> these<00:02:24.849> or<00:02:25.120> maybe

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
jelly or jam in of these or maybe

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.089 
jelly or jam in of these or maybe
cooking<00:02:25.569> these<00:02:25.750> making<00:02:26.170> breads<00:02:26.470> or<00:02:26.680> muffins

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
cooking these making breads or muffins

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.680 
cooking these making breads or muffins
with<00:02:27.280> them<00:02:27.489> would<00:02:28.030> actually<00:02:28.390> tastes<00:02:28.599> pretty

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
with them would actually tastes pretty

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.869 
with them would actually tastes pretty
good<00:02:28.870> however<00:02:29.769> what<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:30.099> didn't<00:02:30.340> notice<00:02:30.459> here

and and all that good stuff I would

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.930 
and and all that good stuff I would
actually<00:02:56.230> say<00:02:56.470> for<00:02:56.980> its<00:02:57.129> size<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.459> quantity

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
actually say for its size and quantity

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.030 
actually say for its size and quantity
and<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.269> fact<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.260> fact<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.769> is<00:02:59.799> very

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
and the fact the fact that it is very

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.940 
and the fact the fact that it is very
seated<00:03:00.489> like<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:02.019> can<00:03:02.409> make<00:03:02.709> some

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
seated like that and it can make some

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.940 
seated like that and it can make some
people<00:03:03.099> nauseous<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:04.060> its<00:03:04.269> raw<00:03:04.480> form<00:03:04.950> this

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
people nauseous in its raw form this

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.759 
people nauseous in its raw form this
would<00:03:06.129> probably<00:03:06.340> be<00:03:06.670> better<00:03:07.260> as<00:03:08.260> may<00:03:08.620> be<00:03:08.650> a

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
would probably be better as may be a

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.399 
would probably be better as may be a
survival<00:03:09.159> type<00:03:09.760> berry<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.299> look<00:03:10.420> for<00:03:10.659> saw

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
survival type berry to look for saw

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:12.690 
survival type berry to look for saw
something<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.829> would<00:03:11.980> specifically<00:03:12.430> go

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
something that I would specifically go

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.940 
something that I would specifically go
and<00:03:12.879> snack<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.299> when<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.510> find<00:03:13.840> although<00:03:14.620> if<00:03:14.799> I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
and snack on when I find although if I

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.220 
and snack on when I find although if I
had<00:03:15.190> time<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.459> really<00:03:15.909> collect<00:03:16.329> it<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.720> you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
had time to really collect it and you

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.479 
had time to really collect it and you
know<00:03:17.290> separate<00:03:17.709> all<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.859> berries<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:18.310> can

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
know separate all the berries you can

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.770 
know separate all the berries you can
cook<00:03:18.910> with<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.359> tastes<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.599> lot<00:03:19.720> better

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
cook with it and it tastes a lot better

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.740 
cook with it and it tastes a lot better
in<00:03:20.590> my<00:03:20.769> opinion<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:22.120> again<00:03:22.419> it's<00:03:22.630> not

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
in my opinion but this again it's not

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.059 
in my opinion but this again it's not
something<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.049> would<00:03:23.139> just<00:03:23.290> snack<00:03:23.500> on<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.980> know
