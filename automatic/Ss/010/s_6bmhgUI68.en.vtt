00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:02.999
 The Time ... of the Post ... with ... Smosh. 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:05.662
 IAN IS BORED - EPISODE 78 

00:00:05.662 --> 00:00:08.097
 HORRIBLE POKÃ‰MON IN OUR MAIL ?! 

00:00:08.097 --> 00:00:10.269
 Hi guys, welcome to another episode of ... 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.162
 The Mail Time with Smosh. 

00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:14.711
 It seems we will be busy today. 

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:16.042
 Look at that huge box over there. 

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:19.611
 They could not think of a damn letter! I have to call Anthony to pick it up! 

00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:21.166
 I can not wait to find out what's inside. 

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.488
 -I hope it's not someone packed. -Or a corpse. 

00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:26.077
 That would be an interesting video. 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.545
 What the hell is the monkey's anti-back dust ?! 

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:31.383
 You put it in your butt. 

00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:33.646
 There's your ass and that's where the dust goes. 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.845
 What the hell?! They put us eyeliner. 

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:38.469
 He looks pretty with eyeliner. 

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.190
 I'm Anthony, and I'm ... a fool! 

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:50.510
 I have a letter from Singapore and believe that the United States is the United States. 

00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:53.106
 Cool. 

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.758
 I think we should go here for the Time to Eat with Smosh. 

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.097
 Something in this package is very fragile, fragile, fragile! 

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:07.880
 This person says "The pole barber asks for your forgiveness for sleeping with your wife ... 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.922
 ... so he brought you a lively prostitute. " 

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:13.571
 Thank you barber pole ... But I'm still hating you! 

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:15.389
 I'm a boy, not a girl! 

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:18.295
 Hell, the barber pole has more drawings than us. 

00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:25.736
 -Yes. -You are a zebra. 

00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:28.813
 Hey Ian. Waths up? 

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.719
 That is cute? 

00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:35.209
 We have the best thing that we have received by mail. 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.127
 We have received a lot from you, but we have an open letter! 

00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:43.156
 What is great Anthony cuts his little fingers. 

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:44.209
 So this will help. 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:45.863
 Always in fashion. 

00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:47.739
 The best drawing of Charlie. 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:49.530
 Powers of unicorn. 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.930
 It's me with Boxman in a What the Firetruck shirt. 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.001
 There are a lot of video game characters forming the word Smosh. 

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.542
 It's very cool. 

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:02.169
 Irish pasture. 

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:05.130
 Irish pasture so you must be very drunk. 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:06.867
 Someone drew us this comic. 

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:09.280
 Anthony, do you want to make a video? 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:10.513
 I do not want. 

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:11.947
 What? 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.900
 I have to shit. 

00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:17.746
 I thought you had found out my secret. 

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:19.288
 Be your secret! 

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:23.157
 -L ... do you know? -Yes! 

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:30.770
 Do not worry, Ian. I will not tell anyone about you ... 

00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:33.688
 Pedophilia! 

00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:37.794
 If ... you become me ... 

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:42.654
 Treatment! 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.582
 Recording Lunch Time with Smosh the next day ... 

00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:49.504
 It is stuck! 

00:02:49.738 --> 00:02:51.403
 It's what she said. 

00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:54.522
 Why do not you just suck it? 

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:56.844
 I'm not your girlfriend, Ian. 

00:02:58.508 --> 00:03:00.741
 I am your boyfriend! 

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:02.892
 Let me ***. 

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:04.317
 The end. 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.825
 That was very esperuznante, but beautifully drawn. 

00:03:09.613 --> 00:03:12.839
 This is a girl giving her heart to Anthony. 

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:14.514
 This hat fits me perfectly. 

00:03:14.514 --> 00:03:17.351
 The very nice cut of Ian's plate. 

00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:18.835
 Calcilcillos de guinea pigs. 

00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:20.084
 Charlie is going to love him. 

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:22.443
 Ian holding a pickle. 

00:03:22.443 --> 00:03:23.653
 As he does every night. 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.649
 Disgusting. 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.179
 Canada bracelet. 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:31.443
 These are definitely going to be used in some future Smosh video. 

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:34.889
 Care Ian. You are putting yourself in the statements. 

00:03:38.013 --> 00:03:41.568
 Cool. You and me like rainbow caterpillars. 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.346
 Here I am at my wedding holding a Mudkip. 

00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:46.593
 That's how I look like a Bratz doll. 

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.716
 Look at this. 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.990
 It is so great and esperuznante at the same time. 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.357
 We have a candy bar from Norway. 

00:03:56.626 --> 00:03:57.703
 It's liquid now. 

00:03:57.703 --> 00:03:59.093
 They make a good hat. 

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:05.440
 It's summer. Do not avoid chocolate bars until it is September or October. 

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:09.230
 I have the Star Wars characters, now I can recreate the first scene of the movie. 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.037
 Would you like us if we kiss? 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.789
 We have a can of tuna. It can not be good. 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.879
 It's in a can, it's fine. 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.143
 Hell, old man. 

00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:22.426
 It is Boxman with all possible expressions. 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:26.813
 I am a witch. 

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:29.316
 Do not brush my teeth 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.971
 Picajachu 

00:04:39.744 --> 00:04:41.576
 You are a car full of fun. 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.610
 An elongated pacifier. What I always wanted. 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.958
 Someone finally did it. They sent us porn. 

00:04:50.316 --> 00:04:55.120
 Apparently a mother sent us these. He says he sent them from his personal collection. 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.196
 -Thanks Mom. -Wait, is it your mother who sent them? 

00:04:58.196 --> 00:04:59.537
 No, ONE mom did it. 

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:02.390
 We have an iPod Touch. Here you have Ian ... 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.544
 What do you do? 

00:05:04.848 --> 00:05:06.969
 I have this nice necklace. 

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:11.596
 What's in the huge box? 

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:15.074
 What's in it? Almost nothing. 

00:05:16.248 --> 00:05:18.134
 Oh yeah. Pious 

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:19.705
 Personally, I love them. 

00:05:19.705 --> 00:05:23.949
 -You imagine if a madman puts on it to send it. -Yes. 

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:29.206
 -And then it goes like this. -What are you doing?! 

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:32.686
 -A) Yes? Would you go like this? -I can not breathe! 

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:33.901
 No, you're fine. 

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:38.433
 Awake. 

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:42.214
 Well, I think Anthony is dead. 

00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:43.850
 You have to bury this bastard. 

00:05:44.131 --> 00:05:48.486
 Leave us more suggestions for Ian is Boring or if you prefer send us more mail. 

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:51.366
 -And I'll see you later. -Goodbye. 

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:52.224
 Go dead! 

00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:57.298
 They just filled in the cavities and applied novocaine to this side of my face. 

00:05:57.281 --> 00:06:00.432
 And it has paralyzed one side of my nose. Look
