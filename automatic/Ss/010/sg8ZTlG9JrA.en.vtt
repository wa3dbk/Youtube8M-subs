this game and like trimmed it down a lot

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.850 
this game and like trimmed it down a lot

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
because it was a pretty long game

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.350

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.389 
hell but I still really liked it and
this<00:02:02.850> game<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.390> getting<00:02:04.369> way<00:02:05.369> more

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

boring<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.390> lot<00:02:06.810> quicker<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.099> it's

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
boring a lot quicker and I think it's

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.710 
boring a lot quicker and I think it's
just<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.459> modern<00:02:08.940> warfare<00:02:09.149> two<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
just because modern warfare two you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750 
just because modern warfare two you
could<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:10.020> anything<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:10.950> successful

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.150 
game I was ice like set a standard for a
kg<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.730> wanted<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> have<00:02:51.210> but<00:02:51.720> then<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.230> just

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
kg that I wanted to have but then I just

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.760 
kg that I wanted to have but then I just
kind<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.400> started<00:02:54.020> screwing<00:02:55.020> around<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.650> I

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
kind of started screwing around and I

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.350 
kind of started screwing around and I
realized<00:02:56.130> how<00:02:56.250> much<00:02:56.310> fun<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:56.910> now<00:02:57.330> I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
realized how much fun it is and now I

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.860 
realized how much fun it is and now I
just<00:02:58.220> didn't<00:02:59.220> care<00:02:59.400> about<00:02:59.550> my<00:02:59.730> KD<00:02:59.940> anymore<00:03:00.450> now

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
just didn't care about my KD anymore now

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.140 
just didn't care about my KD anymore now
it's<00:03:01.050> not<00:03:01.320> very<00:03:01.500> good<00:03:01.650> because<00:03:02.520> I<00:03:02.730> don't<00:03:02.880> try

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
it's not very good because I don't try

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.680 
it's not very good because I don't try
at<00:03:03.360> all<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.620> mean<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.190> have<00:03:05.340> more<00:03:06.240> fun<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.660> I
