00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.140
 used to big gameplay on my channel 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.879
 so that's if you follow me on twitter 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.590
 normally you should know what 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.559
 I speak so today I you 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.120
 proposes my attempt to 700 kg chalenge 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.550
 that was launched a little over a year ago 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.650
 months by the American community is 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.580
 today so I'm going to finish 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.409
 on 1722 kim for two deaths so 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.760
 challenge accomplished challenge does I 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.129
 am the first french to have 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.050
 accomplished this challenge i'm so here you go 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.120
 I'm pretty happy with myself but I 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.100
 am still far enough from yom this 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.489
 crackers who for the moment holds the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.950
 record 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.120
 so he did 746 so that's it I'm 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.100
 'm even when one of 24 that 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.830
 difference from him it's not 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.540
 negligible is not bad and then that's it 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.510
 so I explained to you a little bit 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.990
 challenge rules as well as my class then 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.479
 the challenge is simply a challenge based 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.270
 on fun with specific rules 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.470
 so for that the map is not interesting 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.550
 you can choose the map that you 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.500
 want but personally I you 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.570
 advise the map mme nepton so a 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.240
 little map of preference so to 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.370
 to do to create a trap spawn 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.860
 here is to have the most kiel 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.470
 possible then then the rules well 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.990
 precise are then must be in mode 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.950
 general scrum 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.860
 so that's how I wanted to ilham a 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.980
 little does not matter there you have to put 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.780
 a time limit of 10 minutes you 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.390
 do not put any limits on this body 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.310
 so you put it in dignity guy you 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.590
 add eleven boots 11 boots what 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.960
 you put in rookie you do not put 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.159
 the radar so here are two in the map 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.690
 you will not see the boots when when 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.930
 tyrosse here you will see them until 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.409
 shots so without radar in all is more 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.810
 banal and then 17.2 class so that's it 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.459
 to issue 17 points on your class 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.780
 all you know call of duty black ops 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.550
 walking with points on 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.710
 classes 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.690
 must put 17 so in multiplayer 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.730
 we can only use disney 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.650
 up there wanting to put seven more 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.470
 then something very important 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.070
 who can maybe we who will 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.450
 succeed who will help us succeed the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.590
 challenge is simply putting life 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.140
 at 30% 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.640
 so here is life at 30% next 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.110
 there is also a set up of this strict body 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.420
 very specific you can see who is the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.670
 warthog the dog as well as groups 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.290
 hunting end the canine unit forgiveness 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.430
 now I want to tell you my class 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.260
 and I tell you a little step in which 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.960
 is this challenge then me 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.150
 I use it amÃ©lie w 57 which for me 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.970
 is the most suitable tear compared 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.520
 to the tears the most suitable compared 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.550
 to the challenge that is proposed to us so 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.670
 indeed we must put him charger 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.350

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.940
 long well cross as you want 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.780
 I think I had almost canon 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.190
 on this part there no no no I think 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.060
 that I'm going to cross me actually excuse me 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.350
 I think I think I have put cross and 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.360
 so that's all for my 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.500
 assets chti's light weight determination 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.910
 looters then dexterity and conditions 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.660
 extreme in terms of 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.130
 lethal accessories I use the ckd so 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.350
 only one c4 for my 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.150
 non- lethal accessories I use from 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.010

 will never happen to me during this part 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.019
 so I will not use it even if the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.080
