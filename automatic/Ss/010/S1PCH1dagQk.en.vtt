00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.789

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.969

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.540
 a cycle 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.530
 It does not have to be a perfect circle. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.280
 to be simply a business 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.900
 Then you make the lady's ear. 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.689

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.920
 The secret is in this part of the bi train 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:41.280

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.270
