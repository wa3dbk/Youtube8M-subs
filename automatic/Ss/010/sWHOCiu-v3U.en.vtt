 It is made in a dilution of 110 and 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.880
 we are going to 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.170
 to see the tablecloth in what conditions are 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.710
 well, you see the grease stains 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.660
 two pieces of tablecloth the one below and the one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.559
 up see you see how everything is 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.610
 all the tablecloth full of spots we are going to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.660
 to 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.140
 to spread where there are spots let's go 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.130
 to pulverize the one we're seeing that 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.980
 is elda's and we're going to pulverize 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.380
 especially the areas as we go to 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.880
 first the top part of me so that 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.300
 I do not have any spots I'm going to 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.740
 spray over the entire surface well 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.500
 like this is also that it is 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.980
 pulverizing 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980
 yes 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.850
 we are going to open this side here and we are going to 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.850
 pulverize it too 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.010
 can be washed beloved can not be left 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.680
 soak or machine washable I 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.530
 Now after I have the product 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.210
 I'm going to put it in the washing machine but the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.770
 process of the washing machine we are not going to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.690
 can see why it's so long 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.479
 the washing for being that half an hour not 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.910
 I can have the video working, I do not know 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.070
 You will edit it but I want you 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.630
 see how it works now come to these 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.920
 good bleachers this is not fat because 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.990
 this is the sprayer that was left 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.990
 previously but I am now going to 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.460
 spread the product also the same by 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.500
 the areas the surface of the tablecloth 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.500
 so that all the stains come out 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.569
 already pulverized I'm going to put it in 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.030
 the washing-machine 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.260
 with water 30 to 40 degrees because it's 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.959
 color and a normal wash not a cycle 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.450

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.840

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.770
 and wash it by hand or put it in later 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.630
 the washing-machine 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.660

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.330

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.160
 see when the washing machine has left 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.290
 being wet they will not be able to check if
