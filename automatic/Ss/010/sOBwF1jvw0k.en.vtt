00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
yeah it changed it a little that's what

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.379 
yeah it changed it a little that's what
I<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.609> that's<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.150> sign<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.639> aging<00:03:08.639> aging

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
I like that's the sign of aging aging

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.059 
I like that's the sign of aging aging
and<00:03:09.810> sign<00:03:10.139> of<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.430> past<00:03:11.670> passage<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.540> time

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
and sign of the past passage of the time

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:41.660 
and sign of the past passage of the time
so<00:03:14.069> nothing<00:03:14.780> stay<00:03:15.780> permanent

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.040 

so<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:42.850> work<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.330> show<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.840> last

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050

with light into into the exhibition this

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.010 
with light into into the exhibition this
is<00:03:48.790> my<00:03:49.000> new<00:03:49.720> direction<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.710> new<00:03:51.640> way<00:03:51.940> of

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
is my new direction and a new way of

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.950 
is my new direction and a new way of
presentation<00:03:53.490> everything<00:03:54.490> was<00:03:54.670> done<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.780> my

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
presentation everything was done in my

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.890 
presentation everything was done in my
diary<00:03:56.610> without<00:03:57.610> a<00:03:57.640> camera<00:03:57.970> without<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
diary without a camera without the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.960 
diary without a camera without the
camera<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.740> you<00:03:59.800> go<00:04:00.040> back<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.520> origin<00:04:00.910> of

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
camera so you go back to the origin of

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.540 
camera so you go back to the origin of
photography<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.780> look<00:04:02.380> very<00:04:02.710> much<00:04:02.890> like<00:04:02.950> the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
photography that look very much like the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.370 
photography that look very much like the
early<00:04:03.760> photograph<00:04:04.390> about<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.720> origin<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
early photograph about the origin of the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.380 
early photograph about the origin of the
world<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.980> tiny<00:04:06.190> bit<00:04:06.490> of<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.880> the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
world just a tiny bit of the the

also<00:04:15.970> it's<00:04:16.570> related<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:18.090> probably<00:04:19.090> some<00:04:19.420> kind

something<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.700> know<00:04:27.820> moving<00:04:28.720> against

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
something is you know moving against

something is you know moving against
each<00:04:29.860> other<00:04:30.100> that's<00:04:30.490> caused<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.120> tension<00:04:31.630> the

electricity its charge is some kind of
energy

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.970 

so<00:04:47.520> one<00:04:48.520> night<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:49.180> had<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.750> vision<00:04:49.840> of<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.620> movie

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
so one night I had a vision of the movie

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.350 
so one night I had a vision of the movie
theater<00:04:51.310> series

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
theater series

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.960 
theater series
suppose<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.260> expose<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.920> entire<00:04:54.250> movie<00:04:54.670> story

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
suppose I expose the entire movie story

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.810 
suppose I expose the entire movie story
then<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.230> screen<00:04:56.620> should<00:04:56.890> be<00:04:56.920> overexposed

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
then the screen should be overexposed

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.930 
then the screen should be overexposed
and<00:04:58.510> then<00:04:59.230> becomes<00:04:59.620> quite<00:05:00.040> a<00:05:00.070> bright<00:05:00.490> white

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
and then becomes quite a bright white

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.930 
and then becomes quite a bright white
screen<00:05:01.600> shining<00:05:02.380> out<00:05:02.620> from<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.130> screen<00:05:03.460> and

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.850 

the<00:05:06.940> rest<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.450> part<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:08.110> interior<00:05:08.560> of<00:05:08.650> the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
the rest of the part the interior of the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.540 
the rest of the part the interior of the
theater<00:05:08.890> should<00:05:09.730> be<00:05:10.620> shown<00:05:11.620> in<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.760> very<00:05:13.060> dark

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
theater should be shown in a very dark

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.290 
theater should be shown in a very dark
circumstances<00:05:15.900> so<00:05:17.040> next<00:05:18.040> step<00:05:18.250> is<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.700> make<00:05:19.150> it

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
circumstances so next step is to make it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:07:03.930 
circumstances so next step is to make it
happen<00:05:19.540> and<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:21.250> I<00:05:21.490> just<00:05:22.150> made<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.390> happen

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.000
