don't<00:03:09.250> believe<00:03:09.550> in<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:12.150> limit<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:13.330> shoes

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
don't believe in like a limit in shoes

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.250 
don't believe in like a limit in shoes
because<00:03:14.680> shoes<00:03:15.150> are<00:03:16.150> going<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.450> last<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:16.930> for

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
a while so yeah I'd rather spend it on

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.949
