00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello, I want to present to your 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.580
 attention to such an interesting thing 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.120
 which can be called her cauldron or 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.190
 pan firm bernard but history 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.199
 the origin of what color so actually 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.990
 speaking principle gave her wife said 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
 but since you are sometimes ready for family points 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.650
 here you will be so special 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.189
 thing in which you can cook 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.689
 convenient pilaf that's what interests me 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.480
 The principle is interesting first of all as well 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.030
 usually principle I say cook ordinary 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.489
 pan pan so normal 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.129
 good is a stainless steel pot with 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.110
 thick fat bottom in principle this 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.320
 enough 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.059
 that's generally enough before 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.160
 we continue means it turns out unlike 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.800
 pots just the point is that this 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.219
 such a wonderful pot she is big 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.079
 heavy and in her 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.739
 when you cook in principle and it turns out 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.199
 you can better heat up the heat 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.180
 almost here and then she 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.670
 accordingly it is better to keep warm there 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 but it turns out so here actually 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.400
 interesting but bought it there for shares 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.619
 it costs to me it seems there let's say the area 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.439
 1000 rubles well, so we have more than a thousand 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.450
 somewhere there will not be a thousand plus 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.570
 speak there exactly and that cost 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.909
 Okay, I will unpack I show our company myself 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.400
 On itself burner well in firms like she 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.160
 you yourself German here 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:42.140
 in general, is there such a small 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.140
 the inscription where it says that after all 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.730
 made it in china 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:08.220
 what do we have here suppliers bernard 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.220
 group russia moscow avenue vernadskogo 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.300
 manufacturer 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.280
 word word 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.530
 groups shorter is obtained with control china 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.240
 Well actually I want to say 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.580
 what is actually in general then this 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.800
 enough such a normal quality 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.720
 dishes 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.239
 so you can treat her 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:42.230
 kindly 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:48.750
 all open show open 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:56.010
 open here so it looks inside 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:03:04.880
 we take out we remove 1 glass bag 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.880
 cap I can say 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.150
 cover this very unpretentious usual 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.000
 glass 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.760
 proboscis is normal so well yes 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.680
 for example, with respect to the rim 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.310
 of course maybe there wanted more 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.920
 such a powerful thick rim 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.650
 lid with a rivet it is not screwed in 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.170
 Generally it is good or bad to say 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:39.330
 Well, everything is fine there is such a brand 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:49.859
 the inscription and the cauldron itself there is a Kazakh pot 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:56.400
 the pan turns out such here 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:58.760
 they have the ear of the brain actually say 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.760
 iron 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.720
 inside teflon coating is not here 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.200
 such an understanding let's say there is a thick bottom 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.310
 it is simply here is such thick in 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.370
 in general, everything is now taken from and weighed 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.390
 I will say how much the piece weighs probably all 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.410
 so it is thoroughly kilogram probably 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.410
 several two exceptions 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.210
 Here we take the scales 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.210
 turn on 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.020
 set 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:55.550
 two one hundred eighty eight point 2088 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:01.639
 if you add a cover from the circle more 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:06.470
 respectively 2 802 892 total three 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:09.260
 kilo is obtained along with the cap here 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:14.919
 so that's an interesting thing that has 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:18.590
 You can say about her that she is important. 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.990
 be there any garbage use for 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.470
 this there what teflon bamboo 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.260
 and the rest of the spatula here I have under 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.850
 two such shoulder blades 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.280
 which now seems to be in trend and 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.100
 fashionable can you recommend from 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.889
 it turns out such a pen from org glass 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.620
 and here what silicone tip well 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.590
 here it is some kind of ordinary 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.270
 this production company samura 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.550
 Japan I like this more 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.490
 because she is so more elastic more 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.970
 tough basically perfectly normal 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.490
 there to judge this is she so somehow 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.850
 more so soft very this 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.979
 i'm not very comfortable at least 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.710
 the wife says that she is comfortable for example 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:07.070
 tell us what kind of oil there is or 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.750
 smear the rest of the pan when 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.150
 bake it well, damn it, he knows 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.280
 pancakes there or something else but I tell you 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.830
 there you will in principle be asked 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.750
 aim to pick up all such accessory then 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.460
 Take the best that could have ie 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.620
 still good different at least 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.770
 particular samuro 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.510
 she's so tight hard on principle 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.430
 that's not glue not blamed 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.880
 that is, here is such a thing 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:36.800
 bothers you well actually here 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.539
 what can i say once probably i 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.160
 try you can understand cook 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:44.630
 anything and maybe even take it off 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.550
 video about cooking there is a cult 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.250
 ordinary pilaf I have one video I 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.360
 I would not say that he would like so much 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.400
 liked or disliked well 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.070
 at least probably 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.990
 maybe someone will be interested 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:01.190
 cook what kind of chicken is bad in 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:08.080
 This Kazan checks and show well, in principle 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:17.259
 it is not important you here is the result 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:17.259
 of this action so all 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:28.400
 buy all sorts of life miracles and 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:28.400
 be happy and happy all bye
