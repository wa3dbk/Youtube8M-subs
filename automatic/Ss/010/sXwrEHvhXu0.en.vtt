that different from halo 3 it's kind of

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.640 
that different from halo 3 it's kind of
interesting<00:01:32.540> it's<00:01:32.870> not<00:01:32.990> really<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.320> lot

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
interesting it's not really a lot

different<00:01:38.530> ODSTs<00:01:39.530> are<00:01:39.710> surprisingly

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
different ODSTs are surprisingly

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.830 
different ODSTs are surprisingly
stronger<00:01:40.729> than<00:01:40.850> Spartans<00:01:41.360> which<00:01:41.540> should<00:01:41.720> not

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
stronger than Spartans which should not

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.469 
stronger than Spartans which should not
be<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.140> case<00:01:42.320> right<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.940> way<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.119> reason<00:01:44.450> I

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
be the case right the way the reason I

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.660 
be the case right the way the reason I
guess<00:01:44.660> bloody<00:01:44.900> decided<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.590> mark<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.550> little

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
guess bloody decided to mark it a little

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.460 
guess bloody decided to mark it a little
bit<00:01:46.850> for<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.000> stance<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.960> game<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.290> actually

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
bit for the stance the game is actually

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.820 
bit for the stance the game is actually
easier<00:01:49.160> than<00:01:49.990> Hitler<00:01:50.990> three<00:01:51.229> was<00:01:51.410> but<00:01:51.680> there's

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
