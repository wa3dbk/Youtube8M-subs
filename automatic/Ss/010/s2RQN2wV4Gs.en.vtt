00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
ever playing together as a team so I

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.050 
ever playing together as a team so I
thought<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.229> did<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.409> good<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> I'm<00:01:17.820> not

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
thought we did really good and I'm not

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.690 
thought we did really good and I'm not
sure<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.540> end<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.720> winning<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.049> whole

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
sure if we end up winning this whole

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.770 
sure if we end up winning this whole
demolition<00:01:20.700> game<00:01:20.820> cuz<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
demolition game cuz this is just the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
demolition game cuz this is just the
first<00:01:21.810> round<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.560> thought<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.890> pretty

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
first round but I thought was a pretty

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.100 
first round but I thought was a pretty
good<00:01:23.430> gameplay<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.720> hold<00:01:24.990> them

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
good gameplay because we do hold them

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380 
good gameplay because we do hold them
off<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.560> around<00:01:26.070> four<00:01:26.430> minutes<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:27.360> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
off like around four minutes which is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.600 
off like around four minutes which is
pretty<00:01:27.780> hard<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.259> um<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.549> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
pretty hard but um I don't know if you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.950 
pretty hard but um I don't know if you
know<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> way<00:01:30.150> demolition<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.689> played

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
they wanted to do and a lot of people

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.429 
they wanted to do and a lot of people
actually<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.579> attack<00:01:54.030> him<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.360> two<00:01:54.659> which

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
I never really understood completely but

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.410 
I never really understood completely but
apparently<00:01:58.439> people<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.430> attack<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> lot

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
apparently people can attack a lot

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.999 
apparently people can attack a lot
better<00:02:00.540> than<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.930> defend<00:02:01.290> I've<00:02:01.590> always

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.499 
better than can defend I've always
wanted<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> defend<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> might<00:02:03.479> just

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
wanted to defend but that might just

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
wanted to defend but that might just
show<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:03.990> big<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> new<00:02:04.380> by<00:02:04.560> him<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.829> don't

a<00:02:21.599> little<00:02:22.170> bit<00:02:22.410> iffy<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.069> gay<00:02:23.310> males<00:02:23.519> because<00:02:23.730> I

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
a little bit iffy in gay males because I

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.580 
a little bit iffy in gay males because I
don't<00:02:24.330> know<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.599> know<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.500> you

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
don't know if you know this but if you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.220 
don't know if you know this but if you
get<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.769> draw<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.310> any<00:02:26.519> game<00:02:26.760> mode<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.239> emails

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
get a draw in any game mode in emails

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.170 
get a draw in any game mode in emails
you<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.920> replay<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.550> whole<00:02:29.580> map<00:02:30.060> from

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
you have to replay the whole map from

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.780 
you have to replay the whole map from
this<00:02:30.360> very<00:02:30.660> start<00:02:31.080> where<00:02:31.950> sometimes<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.640> get

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
this very start where sometimes can get

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.030 
this very start where sometimes can get
a<00:02:32.819> little<00:02:33.120> bit<00:02:33.360> aggravating<00:02:34.230> especially<00:02:34.980> if

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
a little bit aggravating especially if

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.229 
a little bit aggravating especially if
you're<00:02:35.130> running<00:02:35.220> short<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.670> time<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:35.940> you're

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
you're running short on time so you're

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.630 
you're running short on time so you're
trying<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.480> get<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.630> lot<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.840> games<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.349> up<00:02:37.640> but

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
trying to get a lot of games in up but

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.220 
trying to get a lot of games in up but
we'll<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:38.880> have<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.060> see<00:02:39.090> how<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.690> ends<00:02:40.170> up

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
we'll just have to see how that ends up

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.500 
we'll just have to see how that ends up
turning<00:02:40.440> out<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.950> think<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:41.910> pretty<00:02:42.209> neat

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
turning out I think it's pretty neat

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.809 
turning out I think it's pretty neat
actually<00:02:43.080> because<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.799> lot<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.069> people<00:02:44.250> played

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
actually because a lot of people played

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.449 
actually because a lot of people played
so<00:02:45.209> gay<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.810> game<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> demolition<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:47.280> I've

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.750 
ever xiv in this one gameplay footage I
think<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.410> saw<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.590> still<00:02:49.980> skills<00:02:50.340> channel

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
think I saw one still skills channel

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.789 
think I saw one still skills channel
basically<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.930> other<00:02:52.079> team<00:02:52.319> was<00:02:52.440> pretty<00:02:52.680> good

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
basically the other team was pretty good

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.830 
basically the other team was pretty good

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
demolition and all they did was on the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 
demolition and all they did was on the
defense<00:02:55.170> around<00:02:55.380> or<00:02:55.650> maybe<00:02:55.829> in<00:02:56.040> my<00:02:56.190> him<00:02:56.280> in<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
office around I really know but it was

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.110
