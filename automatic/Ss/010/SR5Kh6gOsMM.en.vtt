protagonist is and one of the reasons

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.660 
protagonist is and one of the reasons
why<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> halo<00:02:31.269> reach<00:02:31.300> wasn't<00:02:31.989> popular<00:02:32.230> at<00:02:32.739> least

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
why a halo reach wasn't popular at least

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.479 
why a halo reach wasn't popular at least
from<00:02:34.060> what<00:02:34.840> i<00:02:35.080> have<00:02:35.319> read<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.250> didn't

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.740 
get to play as master chief san mateo 3
ODST<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.790> didn't<00:02:40.000> get<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.209> play<00:02:40.330> as<00:02:40.420> master

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
ODST you didn't get to play as master

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.949 
ODST you didn't get to play as master
chief<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:42.519> lot<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:42.940> people<00:02:43.180> hated<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> hero

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
chief and a lot of people hated the hero

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.350 
chief and a lot of people hated the hero
t<00:02:44.230> campaign<00:02:44.769> why<00:02:45.250> because<00:02:46.120> there<00:02:46.269> were

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
t campaign why because there were

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.699 
t campaign why because there were
segments<00:02:46.840> where<00:02:46.989> he<00:02:47.049> played<00:02:47.319> as<00:02:47.470> arbiter<00:02:48.040> so

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
segments where he played as arbiter so

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.520 
segments where he played as arbiter so
it<00:02:50.709> would<00:02:51.190> definitely<00:02:51.580> be<00:02:51.810> free<00:02:52.810> for<00:02:53.019> 3<00:02:53.200> has<00:02:53.380> to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
it would definitely be free for 3 has to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.289 
it would definitely be free for 3 has to
think<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.069> maybe<00:02:54.760> maybe<00:02:55.060> they'll

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
think of this maybe maybe they'll

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.050 
think of this maybe maybe they'll
introduce<00:02:55.569> us<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.530> badass<00:02:57.310> new<00:02:57.519> Spartan<00:02:57.970> in

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
halo trilogy that would be sort of I

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.130

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
open to that but it would seem as if a

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.509 
open to that but it would seem as if a
