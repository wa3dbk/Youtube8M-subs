Leopard on a backup USB thumb drive and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.400 
Leopard on a backup USB thumb drive and
I<00:00:41.190> personally<00:00:41.670> hate<00:00:42.020> CDs<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.320> them

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

scratched you can lose them they break
now<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> reason<00:00:45.750> Apple<00:00:45.989> does<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.260> obviously

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
now the reason Apple does is obviously

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290 
now the reason Apple does is obviously
because<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> new<00:00:47.250> MacBook<00:00:47.610> Airs<00:00:47.789> don't<00:00:48.120> have

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because the new MacBook Airs don't have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.510 
because the new MacBook Airs don't have
a<00:00:48.329> CD<00:00:48.629> drive<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.110> optical<00:00:49.530> drive<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
a CD drive or optical drive but it's a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.770 
a CD drive or optical drive but it's a
good<00:00:50.670> sign<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> things<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.270> come<00:00:51.390> from<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
good sign of things to come from the

offs for me for the MacBook Air was the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.370 
offs for me for the MacBook Air was the
fact<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.180> didn't<00:02:18.450> include<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.870> backlit

netbook if you kind of want to compare

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.819 
netbook if you kind of want to compare
it<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.570> way<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.320> gotta<00:03:28.500> remember<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
it that way and you gotta remember the

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.740 
it that way and you gotta remember the
main<00:03:29.010> cost<00:03:29.280> why<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.120> expensive<00:03:30.450> is

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
main cost why this is so expensive is

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.870 
main cost why this is so expensive is
because<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.170> uses<00:03:31.440> solid-state<00:03:32.100> flash<00:03:32.430> memory

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
because it uses solid-state flash memory

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.819 
because it uses solid-state flash memory

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
people were kind of comparing the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.850 
people were kind of comparing the
MacBook<00:03:36.390> Air<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> MacBook<00:03:37.320> Pro<00:03:37.590> and
