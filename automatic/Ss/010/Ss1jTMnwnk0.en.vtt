00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.299
 thirty years ago I bought my first one 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.179
 boat was the mambo of the same era 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:21.380
 so long and now look at what 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.849
 builds the yard this is 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.340
 the flagship of the sessa and cover range 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.560
 queen of her fleet shows all 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.550
 the beauty and luxury that the yard is 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.550
 able to achieve 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 before test 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.820
 la and to discover its dynamic qualities 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.820
 we see its aesthetic qualities and 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820
 housing 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.900
 is a coupe of the line 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.500
 chat to which dedicates ample space to the areas 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.500
 of blanket 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.790
 the bow 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.730
 there are the valiant chaise longue on 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 sundeck and a very large sun hood 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.070
 perfect chic to give some privacy 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.379
 the cockpit contemplates the sofa the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.330
 table and buildings along the sides 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.240
 despite all these elements of 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.400
 furniture remains a lot of free space 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.040
 secret is the subject of the sundeck on 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.980
 stern that perfects the use of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.530
 surfaces 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.130
 the complete submersible aft bridge 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.810
 the functionality of the external areas 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.610
 great christian the designer of all 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.350
 Construction site models introduced with 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.240
 this is a new theme 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.300
 architectural interpenetration 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.730
 almost hull aesthetic and deck 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.140
 wanted to emphasize the merger of the 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.300
 two bodies see the dialogue between the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.640
 two windows that of the saloon that 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.950
 it goes down until it meets the step forward 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.230
 is that of the side that rises up to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.780
 limit granted by the structure 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.420
 similarly towards the stern the fiddle yes 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.070
 it elevates not only to receive the sockets 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.170
 engine room air but 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.860
 especially to accompany the profile 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.200
 of the pulga everywhere there is continuity between 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.490
 outside and inside from the living room 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.530
 overlooking the horizon and in the wake the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.780
 roof is mostly crystal and one 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.660
 large portion opens to the sun and 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.720
 in the air when entering the hall one notices 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.330
 the all-Italian ability to renew 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.520
 the style preserving elegance too 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.930
 when facing exercises of 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.930
 strong modernity 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.430
 the layout of the main deck can 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.270
 vary but this solution is a lot 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.730
 Interesting 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.450
 a kitchen with the appearance of a bar cabinet 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.570
 place between outside and inside to serve them 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.000
 both wider and more equipped the 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.120
 kitchen located on the lower deck which 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.410
 despite the position it is flooded 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.020
 of light coming from the windshield 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.600
 a domestic steel back top 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.770
 professionals remember the passion 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.170
 Italian for the culinary art fabrics 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.770
 steel essences leathers are amalgamated between 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.620
 them with polite style without exceeding 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.030
 ephemeral and extravagant before 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.950
 express your judgment 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.400
 wait a moment we enter 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.470
 in the master cabin is located at 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.940
 hull center at the most stable point a 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.430
 a height of two meters 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.700
 the furnishings include the beauty area 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.650
 large wardrobes but see how it is 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.510
 overlooking the sea 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.150
 the bathroom is even composed of three 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.010
 separate areas there is the double ravello and the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.500
 shower with chromotherapy or for the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.570
 guests are available two cabins one 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.270
 located forward is equipped with a bathroom 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.080
 reserved the other arranged for a long time 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.000
 side 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.560
 equipped with two single bunks with 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.170
 direct access to the bathroom another day 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.260
 version includes four cabins and three 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.260
 bath 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.610
 the c68 was born with a propulsion in 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.220
 axis line certainly the most 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.500
 reliable and durable afterwards 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.250
 however the version with was developed 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.230
 the winning ips propulsion for 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.230
 maneuverability and efficiency 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.280
 this is the model we are experiencing 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.690
 next version with two volvo engines 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.690
 penta by 900 horses 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.900
 if you don't like piloting the boat if 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.900
 you want a commander to do it at 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.550
 your place the shaft line is great 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.470
 solution 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.570
 but it is a pity not to pilot after all 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.720
 personally a hull has so great and 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.570
 so fascinating is why the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.840
 propulsion bbs comes to your aid 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.389
 with its handling with the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.740
 joystick runs smoothly 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.510
 even moored alone perhaps with 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.040
 the help of some family member who 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.250
 check the perimeter of the boat 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.860
 and comparisons in terms of efficiency 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.200
 there is no comparison with 900 horses 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.030
 get an extraordinary result 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.280
 comparable perhaps to a propulsion with 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.280
 1,200 horses in line from 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.150
 at the start the nyon hull raises his 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.490
 there is no pull up and I don't have 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.030
 used the blog the minimum speed of 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:27.590
 dynamic sustenance and is close by 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:29.270
 1,540 rpm 90 liters hour the push 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.220
 of four counter-rotating propellers is 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.070
 certainly much more effective and less 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.820
 regress greater speed even at 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.820
 low gaits 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.770
 here is an excellent cruising speed 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:48.710
 we are at 25 knots fuel consumption 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:52.009
 and the 237 liters per hour at 1900 rpm 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:56.160
 we see the noise and so much deviates the 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:58.390
 noise at 25 9 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.860
 the security command 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.740
 of the boat also depends on the 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.930
 visual field made available by a 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.980
 large windshield but also from 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.980
 these are the side windows 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.400
 here is an excellent cruising speed 27 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.120
 nodes at 2,000 rpm consumption have gone up but 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:23.669
 of just 250 liters per hour in total 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.669
 means 9.7 liters better 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.540
 cruising speed data is i 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.150
 more interesting but I don't see why not 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.040
 I should push it to the fullest even if 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.240
 conditions are not ideal ones and 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.240
 then down the gas 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.790
 salt the 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.920
 the engine speed also rises 36 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:06.140
 nodes the maximum have also risen 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.140
 consumption 333 liters per hour 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.330
 and if to this 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.290
 the city ​​suddenly we had a 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.850
 stumbling block 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.850
 just give the whole bar 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.120
 the reaction is quite ready then the 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:27.919
 security is confirmed even if yes 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.919
 must suddenly change course 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.770
 the test of c 68 has shown that 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.580
 this is the worthy flagship of the 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.580
 party fleet
