this<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.190> an<00:00:02.310> unboxing<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.330> Choji<00:00:04.020> one

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
this is an unboxing of the a Choji one

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.610 
this is an unboxing of the a Choji one

grabber<00:00:08.210> texture<00:00:09.210> surfaces<00:00:09.750> I'm<00:00:10.650> gonna<00:00:10.830> show

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
grabber texture surfaces I'm gonna show

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.419 
grabber texture surfaces I'm gonna show
how<00:00:11.160> easy<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.730> fast<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> install<00:00:13.429> here

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
how easy and fast it is to install here

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.500 
how easy and fast it is to install here
it<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.849> box<00:00:16.220> this<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:17.609> arrives<00:00:18.210> in

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
it is in the box this is what arrives in

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.220 
it is in the box this is what arrives in
the<00:00:18.570> mail<00:00:21.980> instructions<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.369> will<00:00:24.230> want

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the mail instructions that you will want

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.910 
the mail instructions that you will want
to<00:00:25.289> read

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:45.720 

and<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.760> unit<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.690> power<00:00:35.930> cord

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.190 

so<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.330> first<00:00:46.570> thing<00:00:46.780> is<00:00:47.020> to<00:00:48.540> never<00:00:49.540> let<00:00:49.990> the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
so the first thing is to never let the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.590 
so the first thing is to never let the
two<00:00:50.650> magnets<00:00:51.100> touch<00:00:51.280> each<00:00:51.460> other<00:00:51.670> because

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
two magnets touch each other because

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.010 
two magnets touch each other because
you'll<00:00:52.870> never<00:00:53.110> get<00:00:53.290> them<00:00:53.380> apart<00:00:53.710> if<00:00:54.250> they<00:00:54.340> do

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you'll never get them apart if they do

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.360 
you'll never get them apart if they do
without<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.290> cardboard<00:00:56.770> touch<00:00:57.010> each<00:00:57.160> other

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
without the cardboard touch each other

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.930 
without the cardboard touch each other
don't<00:00:57.670> pull<00:00:58.000> them<00:00:58.180> apart<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:58.780> want<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.350> twist

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
don't pull them apart you want to twist

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.520 
don't pull them apart you want to twist
you<00:01:00.940> want<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.180> twist<00:01:01.360> them<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:02.110> get<00:01:02.230> them<00:01:02.410> apart

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
you want to twist them to get them apart

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.510 
you want to twist them to get them apart
or<00:01:03.220> get<00:01:03.580> some<00:01:03.790> thin<00:01:04.180> cardboard<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.680> slide<00:01:06.370> it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
or get some thin cardboard and slide it

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.880 
or get some thin cardboard and slide it
between<00:01:06.610> them<00:01:07.030> but<00:01:07.690> best<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.140> probably<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.740> try

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
between them but best is probably to try

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.190 
between them but best is probably to try
to<00:01:09.010> twist<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:09.490> just<00:01:09.840> don't<00:01:10.840> let<00:01:10.990> them<00:01:11.140> touch

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
to twist it just don't let them touch

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
to twist it just don't let them touch
and<00:01:11.860> you'll<00:01:12.640> be<00:01:12.790> fine<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.200> here's<00:01:14.350> your<00:01:14.560> two

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and you'll be fine so here's your two

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.999 
and you'll be fine so here's your two
three<00:01:15.970> watt<00:01:16.120> LEDs<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:20.380> green<00:01:20.710> grabber

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
three watt LEDs and your green grabber

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.810 
three watt LEDs and your green grabber
growth<00:01:21.970> surface<00:01:22.740> extremely<00:01:23.740> rough<00:01:23.979> with<00:01:24.640> your

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
growth surface extremely rough with your

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.999 
growth surface extremely rough with your
air<00:01:24.970> bubbles<00:01:25.180> sliced<00:01:25.720> air<00:01:25.990> line<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
air bubbles sliced air line on the

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.020 
air bubbles sliced air line on the
bottom<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:28.240> all<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.780> do<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.280> take<00:01:30.280> off<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
bottom so all you do is take off the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.130 
bottom so all you do is take off the
tape

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.290 

there<00:01:37.740> you're<00:01:38.150> very<00:01:39.150> strong<00:01:39.479> bar<00:01:39.930> magnets

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
there you're very strong bar magnets

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.679 
there you're very strong bar magnets
very<00:01:42.300> strong

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:55.179 

and<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.289> get<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.829> air<00:01:49.039> pump

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.139 

and<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.149> gonna<00:01:56.329> go<00:01:57.009> like<00:01:58.009> that

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and it's just gonna go like that

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.730 
and it's just gonna go like that
okay<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:00.780> we're<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:00.990> gonna<00:02:01.170> set<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.590> in

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
okay so we're just gonna set that in

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.300 
okay so we're just gonna set that in
there

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.089 

go<00:02:04.760> ahead<00:02:04.910> and<00:02:05.000> turn<00:02:05.120> the<00:02:05.270> air<00:02:05.420> on

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.440 

yeah<00:02:13.670> not<00:02:14.090> bad<00:02:14.569> without<00:02:14.810> even<00:02:15.109> adjusting<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.520 

doesn't<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.470> be<00:02:20.590> perfect<00:02:21.010> that's<00:02:21.879> fine

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
doesn't have to be perfect that's fine

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.900 
doesn't have to be perfect that's fine
that's<00:02:23.530> fine<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:26.290> would<00:02:26.530> be<00:02:26.650> too<00:02:26.860> much<00:02:27.069> on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
that's fine this would be too much on

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.360 
that's fine this would be too much on
this<00:02:28.180> side<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.379> can<00:02:29.530> still<00:02:29.680> see<00:02:29.950> bubbles

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
this side but you can still see bubbles

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.280 
this side but you can still see bubbles
hitting<00:02:30.819> this<00:02:31.000> side<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.480> they<00:02:31.599> always<00:02:31.840> help

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
hitting this side so they always help

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.040 
hitting this side so they always help
they<00:02:32.769> always<00:02:33.099> hit<00:02:33.280> all<00:02:33.519> areas<00:02:33.940> because<00:02:34.870> it's

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
they always hit all areas because it's

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.309 
they always hit all areas because it's
an<00:02:35.170> enclosed<00:02:35.500> space<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.870> probably<00:02:38.140> best

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
an enclosed space this is probably best

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.259 
an enclosed space this is probably best
right<00:02:38.560> here<00:02:38.739> though<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.730> want<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:39.970> try<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.150> get

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
right here though you want to try to get

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.160 
right here though you want to try to get
bubbles<00:02:40.660> going<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:41.019> both<00:02:41.200> sides<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:43.209> this

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
bubbles going on both sides so this

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.830 
bubbles going on both sides so this
would<00:02:44.410> be<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.739> down<00:02:44.980> version<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.630> would

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
would be the down version and this would

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.990 
would be the down version and this would
be<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.230> up<00:02:47.680> version<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.459> would<00:02:48.610> eliminate

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
be the up version that would eliminate

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.759 
be the up version that would eliminate
the<00:02:49.239> bubbles<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:52.319> this<00:02:53.319> will<00:02:53.500> give<00:02:53.620> you

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
the bubbles for you this will give you

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.460 
the bubbles for you this will give you
more<00:02:53.799> water<00:02:54.160> flow<00:02:54.430> through<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:56.260> will

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
more water flow through it this will

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.319 
more water flow through it this will
give<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.799> less<00:02:57.730> water<00:02:58.299> flow<00:02:58.599> through<00:02:58.959> it<00:03:00.329> so

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
give you less water flow through it so

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.770 
give you less water flow through it so
let's<00:03:01.870> just<00:03:02.049> drop<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.940> let's<00:03:04.329> plug<00:03:04.540> in

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
let's just drop that and let's plug in

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.660 
let's just drop that and let's plug in
the<00:03:04.989> power<00:03:05.349> supply<00:03:07.049> which<00:03:08.049> works<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.670> 120

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
the power supply which works on 120

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.720 
the power supply which works on 120
volts<00:03:10.000> or<00:03:10.150> 220<00:03:11.190> volts<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:12.610> to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
volts or 220 volts you just have to

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.610 
volts or 220 volts you just have to
change<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.269> plug<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.840> get<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.049> proper<00:03:14.380> plug

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
change the plug to get the proper plug

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:28.880 
change the plug to get the proper plug
but<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.549> power<00:03:15.730> supply<00:03:16.000> works<00:03:16.269> just<00:03:16.540> fine

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.240 

I'm<00:03:29.370> gonna<00:03:29.550> temporarily<00:03:30.319> put<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.500> cord<00:03:32.100> up

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
I'm gonna temporarily put the cord up

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.530 
I'm gonna temporarily put the cord up
there<00:03:32.490> but<00:03:32.670> you'll<00:03:32.790> want<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.060> put<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.330> in<00:03:33.420> a

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
there but you'll want to put it in a

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.930 
there but you'll want to put it in a
spot<00:03:33.900> where<00:03:34.140> it's<00:03:34.260> not<00:03:34.319> gonna<00:03:34.470> get<00:03:34.680> wet<00:03:34.940> so

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
spot where it's not gonna get wet so

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.430 
spot where it's not gonna get wet so
anyway<00:03:36.209> that's<00:03:36.450> about<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:37.020> all<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.260> have<00:03:37.290> to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
anyway that's about it all you have to

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.280 
anyway that's about it all you have to
do<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.709> connect<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:41.840> we'll<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:43.020> put<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.260> right

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
do is connect it we'll just put it right

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.240 
do is connect it we'll just put it right
there

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.730 

and<00:03:49.640> is<00:03:49.970> done

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
and is done

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.550 
and is done
okay<00:03:52.610> so<00:03:53.270> as<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.510> reminder

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.710 

that's<00:03:59.160> with<00:03:59.459> no<00:03:59.640> bubbles<00:04:00.030> as<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.300> can<00:04:00.540> see

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
that's with no bubbles as you can see

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.180 
that's with no bubbles as you can see
all<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.990> bubbles<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.470> are<00:04:01.530> being<00:04:01.740> removed

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.900 

and<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:07.770> bubbles<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.430> can

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
and that is with bubbles and you can

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.740 
and that is with bubbles and you can
peek<00:04:09.150> inside<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.750> see<00:04:10.550> how<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.610> flow<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:11.970> of

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
peek inside to see how the flow is of

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.480 
peek inside to see how the flow is of
course<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.709> going<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:13.890> have<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.160> red<00:04:14.310> light

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
course it's going to have the red light

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.640 
course it's going to have the red light
if<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.390> red<00:04:15.569> light<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.930> off<00:04:16.079> then<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.530> can

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
if the red light is off then you can

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.250 
if the red light is off then you can
just<00:04:16.799> use<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> flashlight<00:04:17.389> if<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:18.600> get<00:04:18.780> darker

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
just use a flashlight if you get darker

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.610 
just use a flashlight if you get darker
growth<00:04:20.389> you<00:04:21.389> can<00:04:21.419> raise<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.780> up<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:25.470> will

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
growth you can raise it up and that will

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.590 
growth you can raise it up and that will
keep<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.980> water<00:04:26.190> inside<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:27.000> filter<00:04:27.360> more

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
keep the water inside the filter more

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.440 
keep the water inside the filter more
more<00:04:28.230> times<00:04:28.470> around<00:04:28.889> which<00:04:29.730> will<00:04:29.940> pull<00:04:30.150> more

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
more times around which will pull more

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.440 
more times around which will pull more
nutrients<00:04:31.080> out<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.560> water<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.460> allow<00:04:33.390> the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
nutrients out of the water and allow the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.750 
nutrients out of the water and allow the
algae<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.900> grow<00:04:34.050> greener<00:04:34.500> but<00:04:35.460> if<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.640> get

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
algae to grow greener but if you get

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.180 
algae to grow greener but if you get
very<00:04:35.970> light<00:04:36.240> growth<00:04:36.560> it's<00:04:37.560> better<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.010> have<00:04:38.160> it

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
very light growth it's better to have it

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.800 
very light growth it's better to have it
further<00:04:38.760> down<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:41.210> then<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.330> course<00:04:42.540> when<00:04:42.720> you

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
further down and then of course when you

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.690 
further down and then of course when you
want<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.020> clean<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.380> when<00:04:44.340> it's<00:04:44.490> time<00:04:44.640> for

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
want to clean it when it's time for

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.810 
want to clean it when it's time for
cleaning<00:04:45.060> seven<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.720> 21<00:04:46.230> days<00:04:46.410> just<00:04:47.280> turn<00:04:47.669> off

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
cleaning seven to 21 days just turn off

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:58.020 
cleaning seven to 21 days just turn off
the<00:04:47.940> light<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.270> pop<00:04:48.419> it<00:04:48.600> off

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.719 

lift<00:04:58.690> it<00:04:58.810> up

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.640 

take<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.569> the<00:05:02.689> sink<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.110> brush<00:05:03.259> off<00:05:03.499> the

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
take it to the sink and brush off the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.980 
take it to the sink and brush off the
algae<00:05:05.979> especially<00:05:06.979> along<00:05:07.249> the<00:05:07.990> sliced

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
algae especially along the sliced

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.260 
algae especially along the sliced
airline<00:05:09.589> and<00:05:10.189> I<00:05:10.279> like<00:05:10.460> to<00:05:10.610> leave<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:10.939> air<00:05:11.059> hose

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
airline and I like to leave the air hose

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.939 
airline and I like to leave the air hose
connected<00:05:11.779> as<00:05:12.050> a<00:05:12.319> matter<00:05:12.499> of<00:05:12.559> fact<00:05:12.740> you<00:05:12.889> can

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
connected as a matter of fact you can

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.619 
connected as a matter of fact you can
STIs<00:05:13.279> you<00:05:13.789> can<00:05:13.939> see<00:05:14.029> some<00:05:14.180> bubbles<00:05:14.449> in<00:05:14.509> it

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629 
STIs you can see some bubbles in it

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.260 
STIs you can see some bubbles in it
right<00:05:14.779> now<00:05:14.960> but<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:15.770> helps<00:05:16.039> you<00:05:16.219> get<00:05:16.879> the<00:05:17.089> any

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
right now but that helps you get the any

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.999 
right now but that helps you get the any
algae<00:05:17.689> growth<00:05:17.870> out<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.379> tube<00:05:18.620> because<00:05:18.889> it

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
algae growth out of the tube because it

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.429 
algae growth out of the tube because it
will<00:05:19.159> grow<00:05:19.509> quite<00:05:20.509> a<00:05:20.539> bit<00:05:20.749> along<00:05:21.050> in<00:05:21.169> here<00:05:21.319> and

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:21.439 
will grow quite a bit along in here and

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.659 
will grow quite a bit along in here and
you<00:05:21.499> can<00:05:21.650> lift<00:05:21.800> up<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.009> tubing<00:05:23.949> to<00:05:24.949> maybe

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
you can lift up the tubing to maybe

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.399 
you can lift up the tubing to maybe
while<00:05:25.909> you're<00:05:26.059> blowing<00:05:26.180> in<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.509> hose<00:05:26.689> or

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
while you're blowing in the hose or

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.769 
while you're blowing in the hose or
while<00:05:27.620> you<00:05:27.800> have<00:05:28.009> the<00:05:28.339> air<00:05:28.879> pump<00:05:29.120> still<00:05:29.389> on

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
while you have the air pump still on

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.959 
while you have the air pump still on
starting<00:05:30.589> with<00:05:30.710> see<00:05:31.099> the<00:05:31.189> air<00:05:31.339> goes<00:05:31.580> this<00:05:31.759> way

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
starting with see the air goes this way

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.869 
starting with see the air goes this way
the<00:05:32.150> air<00:05:32.240> goes<00:05:32.449> here<00:05:32.749> and<00:05:32.870> around<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:34.460> if<00:05:34.729> you

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 
the air goes here and around so if you

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:38.230 
the air goes here and around so if you
keep<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.599> air<00:05:35.809> pump<00:05:36.169> on<00:05:36.439> and<00:05:36.849> then<00:05:37.849> just<00:05:38.029> move

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
keep the air pump on and then just move

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.230 
keep the air pump on and then just move
these<00:05:38.449> segments<00:05:38.990> this<00:05:39.169> way<00:05:39.399> any<00:05:40.399> algae<00:05:41.089> that's

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
these segments this way any algae that's

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.209 
these segments this way any algae that's
inside<00:05:41.629> the<00:05:41.779> tube<00:05:42.020> will<00:05:42.529> go<00:05:42.649> this<00:05:42.889> way<00:05:43.039> and

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
inside the tube will go this way and

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.700 
inside the tube will go this way and
eventually<00:05:43.639> pop<00:05:43.879> out<00:05:44.089> then<00:05:45.050> just<00:05:45.319> tuck<00:05:45.559> them

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
eventually pop out then just tuck them
