00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
icing all right so we've got a little

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.589 
icing all right so we've got a little
bit<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.740> vanilla<00:00:26.369> buttercream<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.449> made

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
bit of vanilla buttercream that we made

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.259 
bit of vanilla buttercream that we made
earlier<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.109> we're<00:00:28.920> gonna<00:00:29.039> turn<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.699> pink

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
earlier and we're gonna turn this pink

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.250 
earlier and we're gonna turn this pink
by<00:00:30.900> adding<00:00:31.669> some<00:00:32.669> food<00:00:32.969> coloring<00:00:33.360> red<00:00:34.020> food

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
by adding some food coloring red food

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.400 
by adding some food coloring red food
coloring<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.890> best<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.410> again

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
coloring and it's best to do that again

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.869 
coloring and it's best to do that again
in<00:00:37.440> small<00:00:37.890> increments<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.399> we're<00:00:38.489> gonna<00:00:38.579> add

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
in small increments so we're gonna add

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940 
in small increments so we're gonna add
about<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.510> half<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.840> teaspoon<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> time<00:00:40.680> until

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
about a half a teaspoon at a time until

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
about a half a teaspoon at a time until
we<00:00:41.160> get<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> desired<00:00:41.670> shade<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.210> pink<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> we

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
we get the desired shade of pink that we

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.420 
we get the desired shade of pink that we
want<00:00:48.170> but<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.289> we're<00:00:49.559> gonna<00:00:49.649> mix<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.219> by

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
want but then we're gonna mix this by

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
want but then we're gonna mix this by
hand<00:00:51.410> which<00:00:52.410> should<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:53.100> than<00:00:53.340> enough

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
hand which should be more than enough

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.650 
hand which should be more than enough
what<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.149> best<00:00:57.360> when<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
what we have here and it's best when you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.970 
what we have here and it's best when you
have<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> whole<00:00:57.989> full<00:00:58.289> batch<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.770> do

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have a whole full batch you can do

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.010 
have a whole full batch you can do
multiple<00:00:59.399> colors<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.750> separate<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> down

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
multiple colors and separate it down

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.399 
multiple colors and separate it down
into<00:01:01.260> smaller<00:01:01.940> batches<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.260> can

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
into smaller batches and then you can

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
into smaller batches and then you can
have<00:01:04.619> several<00:01:04.920> different<00:01:05.540> colors<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.689> work

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
have several different colors to work

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.490 
have several different colors to work
with<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.720> create<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> palette

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
with there we go and create a palette

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.980 
with there we go and create a palette
so<00:01:12.500> here's<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.430> one<00:01:13.610> issue<00:01:13.790> we<00:01:14.390> have<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.660> good

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
so here's the one issue we have a good

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.290 
so here's the one issue we have a good
shade<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.410> pink<00:01:15.620> but<00:01:15.740> if<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.070> can<00:01:16.220> see<00:01:16.580> the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
shade of pink but if you can see the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.840 
shade of pink but if you can see the
frostings<00:01:17.780> become<00:01:18.080> grainy<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:19.460> little<00:01:19.670> too

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
frostings become grainy and a little too

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.410 
frostings become grainy and a little too
wet<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.960> fix<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:21.410> we<00:01:21.620> just<00:01:22.610> fold<00:01:23.120> in<00:01:23.330> a

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
wet so to fix that we just fold in a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.120 
wet so to fix that we just fold in a
little<00:01:23.450> more<00:01:23.930> powdered<00:01:24.320> sugar<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.830> dry<00:01:25.070> it

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
little more powdered sugar to dry it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.770 
little more powdered sugar to dry it
back<00:01:25.400> out<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.210> give<00:01:26.360> us<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.570> better

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
back out and to give us a better

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.480 
back out and to give us a better
spreading<00:01:27.290> consistency<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.890> more<00:01:28.130> consistent

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490

puree<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.590> in<00:02:21.680> your<00:02:21.800> blender<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.060> use

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
puree it in your blender and you can use

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.110 
puree it in your blender and you can use
fats<00:02:23.510> which<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.470> what<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:26.030> achieve

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
fats which is what this is to achieve

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.790 
fats which is what this is to achieve
another<00:02:26.660> pink<00:02:27.019> color<00:02:27.459> as<00:02:28.459> an<00:02:28.670> alternative<00:02:29.800> so

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
another pink color as an alternative so

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.770 
another pink color as an alternative so
darker<00:02:31.250> shades<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.850> color<00:02:32.239> in<00:02:32.480> your<00:02:32.510> frosting

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
darker shades of color in your frosting

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.320 
darker shades of color in your frosting
are<00:02:33.170> hard<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.650> achieve<00:02:34.010> but<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.820> best<00:02:35.090> way<00:02:35.300> to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
are hard to achieve but the best way to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.570 
are hard to achieve but the best way to
get<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.840> really<00:02:36.200> dark<00:02:36.560> dark<00:02:36.830> color<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.250> start

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
get a really dark dark color to start

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.820 
get a really dark dark color to start
out<00:02:37.790> with<00:02:38.000> what<00:02:38.660> we<00:02:38.750> have<00:02:38.930> here<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.440> we<00:02:39.620> made

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
out with what we have here that we made

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.070 
out with what we have here that we made
our<00:02:39.980> layers<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.459> vanilla<00:02:40.760> buttercream<00:02:41.090> and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
our layers of vanilla buttercream and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.990 
our layers of vanilla buttercream and
we're<00:02:42.230> gonna<00:02:42.320> add<00:02:43.300> cocoa<00:02:44.300> powder<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.610> I

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
we're gonna add cocoa powder to it so I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.740 
we're gonna add cocoa powder to it so I
had<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.390> bounce<00:02:48.790> 1/2<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.880> cup<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.239> can<00:02:50.360> judge<00:02:50.570> for

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
had a bounce 1/2 a cup you can judge for

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.740 
had a bounce 1/2 a cup you can judge for
yourself<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.320> get<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.470> nice<00:02:51.830> dark<00:02:52.480> shade<00:02:53.480> and

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
yourself to get a nice dark shade and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.310 
yourself to get a nice dark shade and
you'll<00:02:53.840> just<00:02:53.959> mix<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:57.080> can<00:02:57.200> always

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
you'll just mix that in you can always

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.940 
you'll just mix that in you can always
just<00:02:57.620> add<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.860> little<00:02:58.280> more<00:02:58.690> frosting<00:02:59.950> into

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
just add a little more frosting into

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.680 
just add a little more frosting into
your<00:03:01.310> base

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.540 

so<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> good<00:03:04.500> tip<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.250> always<00:03:07.130> add<00:03:08.130> two

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
so a good tip is you can always add two

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.970 
so a good tip is you can always add two
it's<00:03:09.000> very<00:03:09.120> difficult<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.900> take<00:03:10.020> away<00:03:10.290> from<00:03:10.590> so

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
it's very difficult to take away from so

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.460 
it's very difficult to take away from so
we<00:03:11.610> were<00:03:12.090> little<00:03:12.330> aggressive<00:03:12.780> with<00:03:12.960> our<00:03:13.080> cocoa

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
we were little aggressive with our cocoa

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.470 
we were little aggressive with our cocoa
at<00:03:13.650> first<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.610> will<00:03:14.790> make<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> larger<00:03:15.300> batch

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
at first this will make a larger batch

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.720 
at first this will make a larger batch
so<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.470> mixing<00:03:16.800> you're<00:03:17.070> gonna<00:03:17.190> create<00:03:17.670> a

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
so this is mixing you're gonna create a

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.240 
so this is mixing you're gonna create a
darker<00:03:18.180> shade<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.570> gives<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.870> nice<00:03:19.250> really

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
darker shade this gives you nice really

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.790 
darker shade this gives you nice really
dark<00:03:20.580> shades<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.270> backgrounds<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.840> reds<00:03:22.350> or

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
dark shades and backgrounds to reds or

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.240 
dark shades and backgrounds to reds or
blues<00:03:23.130> or<00:03:23.490> any<00:03:23.670> color<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.980> we're<00:03:26.190> gonna

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
blues or any color and this we're gonna

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.100 
blues or any color and this we're gonna
do<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.550> black<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.270> what<00:03:27.420> we've<00:03:27.570> done<00:03:27.750> we've

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
do a black so what we've done we've

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.110 
do a black so what we've done we've
taken<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.590> white<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.550> you've<00:03:29.730> made<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.030> a

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
taken that white and you've made it a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.340 
taken that white and you've made it a
nice<00:03:30.330> base<00:03:30.660> Brown<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.290> we're<00:03:34.290> gonna

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
nice base Brown and to that we're gonna

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.430 
nice base Brown and to that we're gonna
start<00:03:34.770> adding<00:03:34.950> our<00:03:35.190> color<00:03:35.430> now<00:03:36.440> there's

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
start adding our color now there's

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.420 
start adding our color now there's
different<00:03:37.770> kind<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:37.980> colors<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.400> there

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
different kind of colors out there

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.520 
different kind of colors out there
there's<00:03:39.030> liquid<00:03:39.270> color<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.870> there's<00:03:40.350> also

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
there's liquid color and there's also

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.860 
there's liquid color and there's also
paste<00:03:40.980> when<00:03:41.760> I'm<00:03:41.880> trying<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.300> get<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> really

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
paste when I'm trying to get a really

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.400 
paste when I'm trying to get a really
nice<00:03:43.110> dark<00:03:43.680> black<00:03:44.370> color<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.970> find<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.720> paste

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
nice dark black color I find the paste

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.200 
nice dark black color I find the paste
colors<00:03:46.830> work<00:03:47.040> better<00:03:47.280> they<00:03:47.730> give<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.030> more

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
colors work better they give you a more

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.890 
colors work better they give you a more
intense<00:03:48.630> shade<00:03:49.430> there<00:03:50.430> also<00:03:50.690> don't<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.750> to

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
intense shade there also don't have to

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.980 
intense shade there also don't have to
use<00:03:52.020> quite<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.440> much<00:03:52.590> as<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:54.390> do<00:03:54.510> with<00:03:54.600> liquid

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
use quite so much as you do with liquid

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.140 
use quite so much as you do with liquid
and<00:03:55.140> which<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.160> think<00:03:56.370> imparts<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.820> little<00:03:57.060> bit

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
and which I think imparts a little bit

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.460 
and which I think imparts a little bit
of<00:03:57.210> a<00:03:57.270> taste<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.660> if<00:03:57.750> you're<00:03:57.870> going<00:03:58.050> for<00:03:58.230> light

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
of a taste so if you're going for light

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.400 
of a taste so if you're going for light
shades<00:03:59.150> by<00:04:00.150> all<00:04:00.270> means<00:04:00.510> use<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.960> liquid<00:04:01.230> food

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
shades by all means use the liquid food

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.340 
shades by all means use the liquid food
coloring<00:04:01.640> but<00:04:02.640> for<00:04:02.850> darker<00:04:03.300> shades<00:04:04.170> we're

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
coloring but for darker shades we're

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.690 
coloring but for darker shades we're
gonna<00:04:04.440> have<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.830> add<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> lot<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.490> get<00:04:05.580> an

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
gonna have to add a lot to get an

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.410 
gonna have to add a lot to get an
intense<00:04:05.970> color

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
intense color

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.040 
intense color
I<00:04:06.570> find<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.380> pace<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.950> be<00:04:08.070> better

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.009 

so<00:04:12.050> as<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.319> can<00:04:12.409> see<00:04:12.590> it's<00:04:12.709> already<00:04:14.019> starting

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
so as you can see it's already starting

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:21.629 
so as you can see it's already starting
to<00:04:15.049> come<00:04:15.260> together

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.280 

I'm<00:04:22.639> gonna<00:04:22.820> get<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:22.970> good<00:04:23.150> arm<00:04:23.330> out<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:26.290> and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
I'm gonna get a good arm out of this and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.650 
I'm gonna get a good arm out of this and
don't<00:04:27.500> worry<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:28.030> your<00:04:29.030> frosting<00:04:29.180> comes<00:04:29.510> out<00:04:29.600> a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
don't worry it your frosting comes out a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.970 
don't worry it your frosting comes out a
little<00:04:29.780> too<00:04:29.990> thick<00:04:30.169> you<00:04:30.260> can<00:04:30.380> always<00:04:30.500> just<00:04:30.770> add
