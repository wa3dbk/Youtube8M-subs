impression on these images the sky is
not<00:00:48.440> blue

according to dr. Pollock the sky is in

according to dr. Pollock the sky is in
fact<00:01:15.500> pink

she's<00:01:18.960> an<00:01:19.080> okay<00:01:19.380> color<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:24.710> sky<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.770> red

she's an okay color it the sky is red

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.109 
she's an okay color it the sky is red
but<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.299> red<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.380> surface<00:01:28.740> and

the question of what makes and and and
by<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.580> way<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.990> reason<00:01:34.289> it<00:01:34.409> looks<00:01:34.530> blue

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
by the way the the reason it looks blue

by the way the the reason it looks blue
here<00:01:35.039> is<00:01:35.220> must<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.450> due<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.340> someone

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
here is must then be due to someone

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.940 
here is must then be due to someone
making<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.819> slightly<00:01:39.509> wrong<00:01:40.080> relative

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
making a slightly wrong relative

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130 
making a slightly wrong relative
weighting<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.429> the<00:01:41.520> three<00:01:42.479> colors<00:01:42.780> which<00:01:42.990> go

weighting of the three colors which go

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.719 
weighting of the three colors which go
into<00:01:43.259> making<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.770> picture<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.640> was

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
into making up this picture and it was

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.219 
into making up this picture and it was
done<00:01:45.000> before<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:47.509> appropriate<00:01:48.509> color

calibration chart data had been
incorporated<00:01:51.299> into<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> hope<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.039> will

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
incorporated into this so I hope we will

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.809 
incorporated into this so I hope we will
see<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.520> next<00:01:53.610> day<00:01:53.819> or<00:01:53.850> two<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.560> corrected

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
see in the next day or two it corrected

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.950
