00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.419 

so<00:00:00.750> last<00:00:00.960> time<00:00:01.050> we<00:00:01.380> were<00:00:01.469> working<00:00:01.589> on<00:00:01.949> farmer

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so last time we were working on farmer

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.809 
so last time we were working on farmer
John's<00:00:02.669> circuit<00:00:03.270> we<00:00:03.959> had<00:00:04.170> X<00:00:04.470> naught<00:00:04.799> Y<00:00:04.980> &amp;<00:00:05.370> Z<00:00:05.430> or

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
John's circuit we had X naught Y &amp; Z or

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.830 
John's circuit we had X naught Y &amp; Z or
X<00:00:06.240> Y<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:07.049> not<00:00:07.200> Z<00:00:07.470> or<00:00:07.740> x<00:00:08.250> y&amp;z<00:00:08.910> now<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.420> did<00:00:09.630> make<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
X Y and not Z or x y&amp;z now I did make a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.020 
X Y and not Z or x y&amp;z now I did make a
mistake<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.440> previous<00:00:10.800> video<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.910> I

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
mistake in the previous video so and I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.910 
mistake in the previous video so and I
fixed<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.170> didn't<00:00:13.440> know<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.559> I

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
fixed it so if you didn't know that I

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.840 
fixed it so if you didn't know that I
fixed<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.910> now<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.109> need<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.320> do<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.850> make

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
fixed it now what we need to do is make

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.480 
fixed it now what we need to do is make
the<00:00:18.359> circuit<00:00:19.170> diagram<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the circuit diagram for this and it's a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730 
the circuit diagram for this and it's a
little<00:00:20.699> bit<00:00:20.910> complex<00:00:21.359> or<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.930> later<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.619> in

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
little bit complex or so later on in

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.900 
little bit complex or so later on in
this<00:00:22.859> video<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:23.189> gonna<00:00:23.250> learn<00:00:23.670> how<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
this video we're gonna learn how to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.679 
this video we're gonna learn how to
simplify<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.560> XY<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.519> Z<00:00:26.939> all

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
simplify it so we have XY and Z all

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.509 
simplify it so we have XY and Z all
right<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.230> we're<00:00:28.380> gonna<00:00:28.470> take<00:00:28.769> our<00:00:28.980> first<00:00:29.189> X

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
right so we're gonna take our first X

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.400 
right so we're gonna take our first X
naught<00:00:29.939> Y<00:00:30.119> Z<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> put<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.109> inverter

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
naught Y Z and you see I put an inverter

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.010 
naught Y Z and you see I put an inverter
there<00:00:31.850> I'm<00:00:32.850> gonna<00:00:33.000> link<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.780> these

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
there I'm gonna link put all these

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
there I'm gonna link put all these
circuits<00:00:34.469> near<00:00:34.770> these<00:00:35.280> outputs<00:00:35.940> near<00:00:36.090> each

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
circuits near these outputs near each

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.520 
circuits near these outputs near each
other<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.480> we're<00:00:36.660> gonna<00:00:36.750> make<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.050> end<00:00:37.290> gate

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
other and we're gonna make an end gate

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.590 
other and we're gonna make an end gate
for<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> these<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.309> that's<00:00:38.489> X<00:00:38.760> naught<00:00:39.329> y

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
for all of these so that's X naught y

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.700 
for all of these so that's X naught y
and<00:00:39.930> z<00:00:40.410> that's<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.710> next

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and z that's all we have right now next

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.060 
and z that's all we have right now next
up<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.789> need<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.239> X<00:00:45.600> Y<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.500> Z<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.950> we're

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
up we need to do X Y and not Z so we're

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.010 
up we need to do X Y and not Z so we're
gonna<00:00:47.160> take<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> X<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> y<00:00:48.329> outputs<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
gonna take the X and the y outputs and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
gonna take the X and the y outputs and
we're<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.800> inputs<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.280> we're<00:00:50.370> gonna

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we're going for inputs and we're gonna

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.979 
we're going for inputs and we're gonna
put<00:00:50.670> them<00:00:50.789> together<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.270> we're<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
put them together and we're going to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.709 
put them together and we're going to
invert<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.620> Z<00:00:52.800> input<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.489> put<00:00:54.149> them<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.480> into

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
invert the Z input and put them all into

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.189 
invert the Z input and put them all into
an<00:00:54.930> end<00:00:55.140> gates<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.690> first<00:00:57.870> two

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
an end gates so we have the first two

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.529 
an end gates so we have the first two
done<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.680> need<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.100> XY<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.699> z<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.270> we

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
done now we need to do XY and z so we

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
done now we need to do XY and z so we
don't<00:01:00.750> need<00:01:00.899> any<00:01:01.140> inverters<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.949> one

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
don't need any inverters for this one

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.509 
don't need any inverters for this one
and<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.449> pulling<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.530> XYZ<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.309> place

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and I'm just pulling the XYZ in place

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.380 
and I'm just pulling the XYZ in place
near<00:01:05.820> each<00:01:05.939> other<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.619> now<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.189> make<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
near each other and now I do is make the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.260 
near each other and now I do is make the
or<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> gates<00:01:10.580> next<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.700> need<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> connect

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
or and gates next we need to connect

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.920 
or and gates next we need to connect
them<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:13.110> gates<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.299> one<00:01:15.299> final<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.720> gate

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
them with or gates and one final or gate

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020 
them with or gates and one final or gate
and<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.229> we're<00:01:16.380> done<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.759> this<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and now we're done and this is the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
and now we're done and this is the
simplified<00:01:18.509> circuit<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.619> lot<00:01:20.040> simpler

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
simplified circuit it's a lot simpler

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.219 
simplified circuit it's a lot simpler
than<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> other<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.600> we're<00:01:22.110> gonna

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
than the other one so now we're gonna

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440 
than the other one so now we're gonna
learn<00:01:22.470> how<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.280> some<00:01:23.610> boolean<00:01:24.030> theorems

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
learn how to do is some boolean theorems

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.620 
learn how to do is some boolean theorems
they're<00:01:25.080> magical<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.670> these<00:01:27.090> aren't<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they're magical so these aren't all the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.670 
they're magical so these aren't all the
boolean<00:01:27.900> theorems<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.229> these<00:01:28.470> are<00:01:28.590> some

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
boolean theorems but these are some

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.010 
boolean theorems but these are some
pretty<00:01:28.799> important<00:01:29.280> ones<00:01:29.460> first<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.390> X

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pretty important ones first we have X

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.920 
pretty important ones first we have X
and<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.590> X<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.310> equals<00:01:32.579> 0<00:01:32.820> next<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.900> have

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and not X and I equals 0 next up we have

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.980 
and not X and I equals 0 next up we have
X<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:34.680> 1<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.520> equal<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.180> 1<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.869> we

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
X or 1 and that is equal to 1 then we

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.580 
X or 1 and that is equal to 1 then we
have<00:01:37.020> X<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.490> X<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.030> equals<00:01:39.329> 1<00:01:39.570> next<00:01:40.320> we

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
have X or not X and I equals 1 next we

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.899 
have X or not X and I equals 1 next we
have<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.130> simple<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.360> distribution<00:01:43.350> problem

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
have a simple just distribution problem

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.429 
have a simple just distribution problem
just<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.210> math<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.630> cool<00:01:46.020> X<00:01:46.259> out

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
just like in math we can cool X out

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
just like in math we can cool X out
which<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> common<00:01:47.220> term<00:01:47.399> between<00:01:47.640> these<00:01:48.000> two

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
which is a common term between these two

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.399 
which is a common term between these two
and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.409> change<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.009> Y<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.790> Z<00:01:51.409> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
and then we can change it to Y or Z so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.620 
and then we can change it to Y or Z so
in<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.619> equation<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.399> x<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.820> y<00:01:53.939> or<00:01:54.180> X

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
in this equation we have x and y or X

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.510 
in this equation we have x and y or X
and<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.899> Y<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.710> we're<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.979> pull<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.369> an

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and not Y and we're going to pull out an

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.300 
and not Y and we're going to pull out an
X<00:01:56.790> first<00:01:57.149> because<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.930> boolean

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
X first because in boolean

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.649 
X first because in boolean
simplification<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> work<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
simplification we want to work with

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.200 
simplification we want to work with
smaller<00:02:01.110> pieces<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.340> original<00:02:02.759> equation

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
smaller pieces of the original equation

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.670 
smaller pieces of the original equation
so<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:03.899> we're<00:02:04.229> left<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.649> Y<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.759> Y<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
so now we're left with Y or not Y so in

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.460 
so now we're left with Y or not Y so in
a<00:02:07.979> previous<00:02:08.190> theorem<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:09.030> learned<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.750> Y<00:02:10.140> or

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
a previous theorem we learned that Y or

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.180 
a previous theorem we learned that Y or
not<00:02:10.800> Y<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.370> equal<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.940> 1<00:02:12.150> because

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
not Y is equal to 1 because

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.090 
not Y is equal to 1 because
when<00:02:13.310> we<00:02:13.430> when<00:02:14.090> Y<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.360> equal<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> 1<00:02:15.350> it'll

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
when we when Y is equal to a 1 it'll

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.180 
when we when Y is equal to a 1 it'll
output<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.580> 1<00:02:16.640> because<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.990> first<00:02:18.440> Y<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.920> 1

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
output a 1 because the first Y is a 1

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.120 
output a 1 because the first Y is a 1
and<00:02:19.400> when<00:02:20.180> y<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.450> equal<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> 0<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.770> Y<00:02:21.920> that's

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
and when y is equal to a 0 the Y that's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.580 
and when y is equal to a 0 the Y that's
inverted<00:02:22.760> will<00:02:22.910> make<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.270> 1<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.020> this

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
inverted will make it a 1 so this

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.730 
inverted will make it a 1 so this
equation<00:02:25.400> supplies<00:02:25.940> down<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.180> X<00:02:26.480> next<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.440> have

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
equation supplies down to X next we have

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.770 
equation supplies down to X next we have
consensus<00:02:28.460> theorems<00:02:28.910> these<00:02:29.390> are<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.600> very

of<00:02:31.730> these<00:02:31.970> down<00:02:32.030> you're<00:02:32.600> gonna<00:02:32.720> use<00:02:32.930> them<00:02:33.080> a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
of these down you're gonna use them a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.400 
of these down you're gonna use them a
lot<00:02:33.410> when<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.740> simplify<00:02:34.100> stuff<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.960> now<00:02:36.110> we're

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
lot when you simplify stuff so now we're

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.740 
lot when you simplify stuff so now we're
on<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.800> big<00:02:37.070> equation<00:02:37.760> farmer<00:02:38.540> John's

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
gonna pull X out of this because we want

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.120 
gonna pull X out of this because we want
to<00:02:43.880> work<00:02:44.030> with<00:02:44.270> smaller<00:02:44.630> pieces<00:02:45.350> when<00:02:45.980> we

I'm<00:02:49.010> sad<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.340> say<00:02:49.490> that<00:02:49.520> there's<00:02:49.820> gonna<00:02:49.970> be<00:02:50.180> a

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
I'm sad to say that there's gonna be a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.790 
I'm sad to say that there's gonna be a
lot<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.540> trial<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.140> error<00:02:51.350> when<00:02:51.650> you're

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
lot of trial and error when you're

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.740 
lot of trial and error when you're
trying<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.160> solve<00:02:52.640> an<00:02:52.820> equation<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:53.390> your<00:02:53.420> own

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
trying to solve an equation on your own

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.860 
trying to solve an equation on your own
some<00:02:54.590> ways<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.310> might<00:02:55.610> not<00:02:55.790> work<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.360> yeah<00:02:56.780> you

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
some ways it might not work and yeah you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.510 
some ways it might not work and yeah you
just<00:02:57.080> have<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.440> keep<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.740> trying<00:02:57.980> different

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
just have to keep on trying different

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.790 
just have to keep on trying different
approaches<00:02:59.270> at<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.260> now<00:03:00.380> what<00:03:00.530> we're<00:03:00.650> left

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
approaches at it so now what we're left

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.900 
approaches at it so now what we're left
with<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.280> X<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.940> not<00:03:02.570> Y<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:03.080> Z<00:03:03.290> or<00:03:03.530> Y<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.490> not<00:03:04.610> Z

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
with is X and not Y and Z or Y and not Z

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.480 
with is X and not Y and Z or Y and not Z
or<00:03:05.180> Y<00:03:05.720> &amp;<00:03:05.870> Z<00:03:05.960> so<00:03:06.890> now<00:03:06.920> we're<00:03:07.130> going<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.280> continue

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
or Y &amp; Z so now we're going to continue

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.000 
or Y &amp; Z so now we're going to continue
by<00:03:07.880> bringing<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.300> X<00:03:08.510> down<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.710> see<00:03:09.860> we

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
by bringing the X down and you see we

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.460 
by bringing the X down and you see we
have<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.220> common<00:03:10.610> term<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:11.120> Y<00:03:11.420> among<00:03:11.750> those<00:03:11.990> so

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
have a common term of Y among those so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.260 
have a common term of Y among those so
we're<00:03:12.590> going<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.740> pull<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.130> Y<00:03:13.280> out<00:03:13.310> but<00:03:14.060> first

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
we're going to pull the Y out but first

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.530 
we're going to pull the Y out but first
we're<00:03:14.390> going<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.540> write<00:03:14.840> our<00:03:15.080> not<00:03:15.680> y&amp;z<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:16.790> we

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
we're going to write our not y&amp;z and we

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.600 
we're going to write our not y&amp;z and we
can't<00:03:17.810> pull<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.410> Y<00:03:18.560> out<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> not<00:03:19.220> y<00:03:19.370> out

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
can't pull the Y out and the not y out

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.090 
can't pull the Y out and the not y out
with<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.180> because<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:20.780> not<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.140> same<00:03:21.170> as<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.709> Y

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
with it because it's not the same as a Y

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.300 
with it because it's not the same as a Y
so<00:03:23.060> we<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.239> Y<00:03:23.420> on<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.780> outside<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:25.280> the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
so we have Y on the outside and on the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.850 
so we have Y on the outside and on the
inside<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:26.239> those<00:03:26.390> parentheses<00:03:26.660> we<00:03:27.290> have<00:03:27.320> two

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
inside of those parentheses we have two

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.300 
inside of those parentheses we have two
Z's<00:03:28.160> we<00:03:28.820> have<00:03:28.940> an<00:03:29.090> odd<00:03:29.330> Z<00:03:29.660> or<00:03:30.530> Z<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:32.890> that<00:03:33.890> will

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
Z's we have an odd Z or Z and that will

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.120 
Z's we have an odd Z or Z and that will
by<00:03:34.970> one<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.300> theorems<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:36.290> simplify<00:03:36.650> down

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
by one of the theorems can simplify down

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.449 
by one of the theorems can simplify down
to<00:03:37.760> one<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:38.959> when<00:03:39.110> we<00:03:39.230> distribute<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.980> Y<00:03:40.190> with

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
to one so when we distribute the Y with

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.340 
to one so when we distribute the Y with
the<00:03:40.550> one<00:03:40.730> we're<00:03:41.150> just<00:03:41.180> gonna<00:03:41.510> be<00:03:41.630> left<00:03:41.810> with<00:03:41.959> X

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
the one we're just gonna be left with X

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.290 
the one we're just gonna be left with X
and<00:03:42.940> not<00:03:43.940> Y<00:03:44.260> Z<00:03:45.260> or<00:03:45.860> Y<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:47.000> looks<00:03:47.180> really

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
and not Y Z or Y and that looks really

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.130 
and not Y Z or Y and that looks really
familiar

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
familiar

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.460 
familiar
can't<00:03:48.769> quite<00:03:48.890> place<00:03:49.130> my<00:03:49.340> finger<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.970> Oh

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
can't quite place my finger on it Oh

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.780 
can't quite place my finger on it Oh
guess<00:03:51.470> what<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.800> one<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.100> our<00:03:52.190> consensus

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
guess what is one of our consensus

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.670 
guess what is one of our consensus
theorems<00:03:53.269> oh<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.780> told<00:03:54.050> you<00:03:54.200> those<00:03:54.350> would<00:03:54.500> come

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
theorems oh I told you those would come

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.880 
theorems oh I told you those would come
in<00:03:54.769> handy<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.450> that's<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:56.690> we<00:03:56.959> can<00:03:57.170> distribute

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
in handy and that's it we can distribute

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.640 
in handy and that's it we can distribute
the<00:03:58.010> X<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.519> we're<00:03:58.610> left<00:03:58.760> with<00:03:59.000> x<00:03:59.269> and<00:03:59.570> y<00:03:59.780> or<00:04:00.290> x

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
the X and we're left with x and y or x

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.530 
the X and we're left with x and y or x
and<00:04:00.980> z<00:04:02.980> yeah<00:04:03.980> look<00:04:04.400> farmer<00:04:04.790> John's<00:04:04.970> happy<00:04:05.360> and

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
and z yeah look farmer John's happy and

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.000 
and z yeah look farmer John's happy and
his<00:04:05.690> sons<00:04:05.900> crying<00:04:06.200> we've<00:04:06.410> done<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.620> great<00:04:06.980> job

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
his sons crying we've done a great job

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.400 
his sons crying we've done a great job
all<00:04:07.640> right<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.330> there<00:04:08.450> we<00:04:08.570> go<00:04:08.690> we<00:04:09.019> can<00:04:09.050> write

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
all right and there we go we can write

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.150 
all right and there we go we can write
it<00:04:09.530> as<00:04:09.680> x<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.370> y<00:04:10.670> or<00:04:11.030> x<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.720> z<00:04:11.930> or<00:04:12.590> we<00:04:13.010> could

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
it as x and y or x and z or we could

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.220 
it as x and y or x and z or we could
write<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.430> in<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:13.970> easier<00:04:14.360> way<00:04:14.570> which<00:04:14.810> is<00:04:14.959> x

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
write it in the easier way which is x

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.500 
write it in the easier way which is x
and<00:04:15.470> y<00:04:16.010> or<00:04:16.040> z<00:04:16.489> which<00:04:16.669> was<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.970> equation<00:04:17.390> that

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
and y or z which was the equation that

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.770 
and y or z which was the equation that
we<00:04:17.600> learned<00:04:17.780> last<00:04:17.959> video<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:19.600> we're<00:04:20.600> done

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
we learned last video and we're done

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.500 
we learned last video and we're done
with<00:04:20.930> this<00:04:21.200> video<00:04:21.580> stay<00:04:22.580> tuned<00:04:22.880> for<00:04:22.910> more

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
with this video stay tuned for more

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.659 
with this video stay tuned for more
things<00:04:23.840> like<00:04:24.169> boolean<00:04:24.560> logic<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:25.130> maybe<00:04:25.460> some

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
things like boolean logic and maybe some

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.260 
things like boolean logic and maybe some
calculus

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
calculus

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.300
