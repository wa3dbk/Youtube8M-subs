00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello girls and guys welcome one day 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.990
 more to the channel in this video I bring you the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.500
 last purchases that I have made for a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.150
 Cosmetics website page no os 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.570
 I will say it since she is not happy 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.570
 with them 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.110
 just tell you that it is a page that I had 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.439
 that it took me three days to get there 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.210
 maximum and it has taken me like 13 to arrive 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.240
 and I never knew anything about them 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.970
 although I wrote repeatedly to the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.980
 customer care is avoided or damn 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.239
 case talking badly and I got in contact 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 with the transportation company he had not 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.900
 the factory order was left ten days 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.180
 after 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.970
 finally and then the order appeared with 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.200
 another shipping number therefore a 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.180
 disgusting but good reviews 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.790
 aside I will not say the name of the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.120
 company but you will all intuit the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.640
 I did it because I went to the store 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.100
 physical and I did not find what I wanted 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.600
 I wanted the dry shampoos I only had in 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.170
 the ship des the ship that had 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.160
 tested the price are five euros almost and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.720
 good but I wanted to try those of 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.700
 batista because he had heard very good 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 criticisms of them then I bought 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.350
 this is 10 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 to try a little bit the whole range there 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.260
 to give it a little with the one that most 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.320
 like 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.280
 this is the tropical traffic 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.280
 the tropical 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.090
 what does that smell 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.090
 a tropical because it smells like 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.840
 Coconut and mango smell super good tonight 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.740
 my pillow hurt because I tried it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 yesterday to tell you about this work which 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.039
 do not know how they work is not more than 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.090
 shake the shampoo open the root apply it 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.799
 massage a little with your hands and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.210
 then removed to remove with a brush 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.759
 what is the white powder that is 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.759
 It is a minute what takes 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 Well, I picked up this hell, I think 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.170
 that does not put anything 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.460
 Rapid absorption revitalizes the hair and 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.350
 Eliminates any fat 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:20.610
 he does not put anything special for being him 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.610
 our prosecutor took I stayed a lot 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.950
 yes I think it is 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.390
 xx the volume is so dry that it puts 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.549
 the same thing exactly so either 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.069
 I think it's good how you paste the sticker 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.599
 in Spanish they do not explain much 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.799
 specifically for what is each but 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.180
 well these includes that it is for the 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.060
 volume and I took the anfield florman 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.860
 blas 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.950
 how good is exactly the same for 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.209
 behind that is the different fragrance 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.209
 and there is little more 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.140
 I needed other things and I took advantage 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.420
 the order so that the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.840
 Free shipping and I picked up the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.930
 good cream already with this the cream of 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.170
 milk of the mark far mona that is this 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.610
 agreement itself this led her cream 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.709
 using a lot of time and I 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.049
 I love how my skin looks good 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.459
 three euros this cream but I love 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.159
 how is the skin really I tell you that 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.860
 I love to use I have a super skin 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.209
 cool at night and since it is 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.370
 using I see that I have the skin 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.500
 pretty good then I will use 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.799
 again I was finishing meters 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.799
 backwards 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.609
 the next thing that I have caught have been 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.500
 these rescue blisters a minute that 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.689
 it was also ending I was left 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.579
 half blister or that I use half 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.840
 because if you did not give me the hair but it's 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.480
 that this is a wonder for the hair 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.400
 really that every 15 days 20 you make a 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.349
 treatment with this is a wonder me 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.790
 they love and it's the cheapest place 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.349
 they come out because in the English court they usually 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.980
 around five euros and in this store 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.980
 three peak 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.100
 Let's see 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.520
 how to use it open a week after 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.010
 have had the hair when you start 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.420
 anatole or brittle tighten the yellow 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.910
 Apply on hair strands 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.870
 starting at the tips making sure 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.870
 that every strand is covered well 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.910
 Apply on freshly washed hair and 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.910
 clarify in a minute 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.440
 a lot more than I say is nothing because this 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.930
 it's the ransom a minute they're rescue 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.780
 a minute or in a minute is and 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.979
 it's true that it looks great 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.319
 the last thing I took to fill in the 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.830
 order was already a fragrance of these from 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.830
 pink 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.340
 be rose flower that pink smells what 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.880
 I tell you but hey, he does not smell anything 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.130
 wrong 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.490
 to see what it smells really good here another 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:59.310
 once we're going to apply it does not have a smell 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.530
 spectacular 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.230
 but let's choose it is lame 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.350
 for the pajamas for when you leave the 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.200
 shower and I what I say is a euro 99 100 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.510
 milliliters then well then that 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.430
 we can ask the smell is nice then 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.860
 it is already and it is also to buy a 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.390
 fragrance without smelling it a bit 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.610
 complicated 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.110
 and the gift that came to me that they are to put 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.190
 some little gift and I appreciate it very much 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.900
 although good is this enamel of up to 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.050
 the craquelards that I think is no longer 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.080
 they carry a lot more than me 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.030
 nail polish I'm a bit reluctant to 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.390
 make up my nails so your vagabond 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.580
 for that but the truth with a lot 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.560
 start the order were 20 with 40 and 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.090
 something or was almost just 20 euros 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.490
 because I did not want to spend more 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.620
 I needed more I did not want to spend more and 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.940
 Nothing the service is super bad I'll tell you 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.380
 I say it's the first thing that happens to me like that 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.770
 that I will not take into account for 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.240
 next orders but then little more than 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.710
 tell you that I hope you liked the 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.440
 video that is like that 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.390
 supporting me to keep uploading videos 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.310
 this month half proposed and I'm 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.470
 going up a lot I hope you like it 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.370
 that do not saturate I do not know how to do it or 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.140
 I hope you like it above all and nothing 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.950
 Well what I always say to you that I hope 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.420
 that you liked the video that 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.550
 they estimate and it's up that we see ourselves in 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.550
 the next one a huge big kiss goodbye
