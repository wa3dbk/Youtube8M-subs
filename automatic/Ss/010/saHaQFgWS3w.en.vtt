00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.380

 200 grams of pasta 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.570
 sausage to taste 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.810
 and a splash of cooking oil 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.960
 and a half tablespoon of chicken broth in 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.490
 a pot we are going to put our oil 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.260
 let's apply our sausages and 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.870
 we're going to put them there we're going to let 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.690
 cook a little 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.940
 and then add the onion too 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.890
 we let it cook until it 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.650
 start to see yellow 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.690
 then add the tomato 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.330
 previously diced and we're going to 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.090
 let it cook a little bit we add 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.930
 two cups of water by the way and our 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.080
 chicken broth powder mix super 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.080
 all right 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.350
 and we add the pasta to be without 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.690
 cook well as it comes from the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 little bag and we try to make everything 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.509
 down the water bastien 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.159
 when it is already boiling we lower it a 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.710
 little bit to the fire that should be on fire 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.980
 half by the way and little by little we're going 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.340
 adding the spinach 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.700
 we mix a little bit add another 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 little spinach we mix again 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.750
 and so on you can put it all 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.750
 the spinach they want 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.450
 then we add the cheese style 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.030
 monterrey what you want is to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.980
 taste but for me always among more than 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.569
 that has something better 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.959
 so I put a whole bar 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.950
 and at the end add a minced jim bait 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.000
 in little pieces 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.980
 and ready and stay 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.950
 It seems very elaborate but in reality it is 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.410
 the easiest and richest thing the cheese will 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:44.090
 gives a touch we want milestone very very very 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.090
 good and ready to enjoy good food 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.540
