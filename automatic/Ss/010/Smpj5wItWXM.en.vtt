00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.270
 There is also a cause for exclusive use of the input . This can be mixed with pc as well. 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.990

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:35.210

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.460
 Four 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.380
 This is quite a penny hmm 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:07.590
 It is such a service that is usually a judge of that normal headphone 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.640
 A little bit ok It's ok Yeah that 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:15.690

 Other than Benly So cat 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.799

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:37.890
 It is a nove to adjust the balance, right now 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.630
 Say you because it is fully opened to master the place I'll have become such Fu 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:47.070
 8 speaker sound Mr. Koch Makusen get to reverse Yeah you heard and Well headphones 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.760
 It is it Yeah side is not heard only the sound is or rather ask them to challenge their own level 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.529
 It seems to be heard in half in the middle 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:58.639
 That's right yeah 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:05:00.910

 Thank you 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:19.380
 It is the overwintering of this right sound and the left sound to say that 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:24.900
 The amount of sound is the part that adjusts the balance, but this is 8 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:28.380
 How much is it 8 I wonder if it will be adjusted at that level 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.070
 Management and control, for example 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:36.490

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.870
 When I return to balance 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.290
 x It seems to be a specification- 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:09.040
 I wonder if it is used or not 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:12.220
 It is people that top product is not used well by pedal Well 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.830
 Tobu then gradually more and more slowly, such gradually like to before 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.950

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.790
 Because it is a privately-owned Susumu temple Bite 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:30.480
 8 touch sensor is attached 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:32.370

 Yes, it 's rich in microphones when it's over 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.760
 That's enough, the volume of the microphone and the microphone support it 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.370
 I see 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.760
 Has become a feeling that 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.150
 Already 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:37.569
 What if the function It is packed is so comparatively 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:41.789
