cake I used a saucer and cut out a round
circle<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.340> another<00:00:21.320> circle<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.769> off

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920

trim<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.720> off<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> height<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.530> want<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
trim it off to the height you want the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
trim it off to the height you want the
shell<00:01:47.100> perimeter<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:48.420> using<00:01:48.750> some<00:01:48.899> green

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
it and okay a circle shape then a piece

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.090 
it and okay a circle shape then a piece
of<00:01:53.970> paper<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.689> guide<00:01:54.930> which<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.649> fold<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
of paper that's a guide which I fold in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.480 
of paper that's a guide which I fold in
half<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:56.670> 2/3<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:58.560> cut<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> top<00:01:59.310> off

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
half then 2/3 and then cut the top off

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.510 
half then 2/3 and then cut the top off
and<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.939> gives<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:01.229> hexagon<00:02:02.189> shape

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and this gives you this hexagon shape

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.389 
and this gives you this hexagon shape
and<00:02:02.869> then<00:02:03.869> you're<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.590> cut<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> shell

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
and then you're going to cut the shell

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.330 
and then you're going to cut the shell
from<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.450> hexagon<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.649> use<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> points

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
from that hexagon just use the points

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.740 
from that hexagon just use the points
and<00:02:08.459> cut<00:02:08.700> out<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> edge<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> circle

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and cut out to the edge of the circle

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360 
and cut out to the edge of the circle
and<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.050> all<00:02:10.140> your<00:02:10.289> pieces<00:02:10.440> then<00:02:11.250> you're

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and you have all your pieces then you're

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.979 
and you have all your pieces then you're
going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> line<00:02:11.760> them<00:02:11.970> off<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.300> some<00:02:12.569> green

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
going to line them off with some green

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.790 
going to line them off with some green
food<00:02:13.319> dye

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
food dye

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.790 
food dye
and<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.820> get<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> thin<00:02:15.840> brush<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.350> go<00:02:16.650> around

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and then get a thin brush and go around

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.190 
and then get a thin brush and go around
in<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.190> middle<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.700> put<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.910> spiral<00:02:18.660> following

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
in the middle and put a spiral following

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.590 
in the middle and put a spiral following
the<00:02:19.350> edges<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.220> shell<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.330> just

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
the edges of the shell and this just

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.940 
the edges of the shell and this just
gives<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.960> little<00:02:22.170> bit<00:02:22.320> more<00:02:22.500> depth<00:02:22.770> in

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
gives it a little bit more depth in

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400 
gives it a little bit more depth in
detail<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.690> how<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.930> decorate

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
detail it's up to you how you decorate

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.870 
detail it's up to you how you decorate
the<00:02:25.500> shell<00:02:25.710> because<00:02:26.010> each<00:02:26.220> turtle<00:02:26.520> shell<00:02:26.760> is

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the shell because each turtle shell is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.000 
the shell because each turtle shell is
different<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.420> individual<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.260> get<00:02:28.800> creative

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
different in individual so get creative

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.750 
different in individual so get creative
with<00:02:29.280> yours

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
I based mine off the old ninja turtle

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.100

where you cut the yellow fondant down

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.790 
where you cut the yellow fondant down
this<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.190> lines<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.580> off<00:02:38.670> nicely

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
this just lines it off nicely

your shell pieces remember not to put it
down<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.040> bottom<00:02:47.220> you're<00:02:47.520> going<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.670> lift<00:02:47.850> it

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
down the bottom you're going to lift it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.110 
down the bottom you're going to lift it
off<00:02:48.180> about<00:02:48.570> in<00:02:48.810> half<00:02:49.080> an<00:02:49.290> inch<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.830> then<00:02:50.370> match

off about in half an inch and then match

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.120 
off about in half an inch and then match
it<00:02:51.150> up<00:02:51.390> with<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.840> did<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.230> top<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.830> bottom

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it up with I did the top and the bottom

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.040 
it up with I did the top and the bottom
then<00:02:53.430> put<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.790> middle<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.330> then<00:02:54.930> the

then put in the middle and then the
pieces<00:02:55.230> around<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.680> edge<00:02:55.860> just<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.490> knew<00:02:56.820> I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
pieces around the edge just so I knew I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.270 
pieces around the edge just so I knew I
didn't<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.140> worry<00:02:58.350> about<00:02:58.470> spacing<00:02:58.860> too

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
didn't have to worry about spacing too

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.700 
didn't have to worry about spacing too
much<00:02:59.520> it's<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.780> symmetrical<00:03:01.290> way<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.500> go

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
much it's just a symmetrical way to go

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.010 
much it's just a symmetrical way to go
about<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:02.100> now<00:03:03.060> putting<00:03:03.270> some<00:03:03.480> lines<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
shell and then it's time to roll out

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.880 
shell and then it's time to roll out
some<00:03:10.830> thick<00:03:11.190> little<00:03:12.320> cylinders<00:03:13.320> which<00:03:13.710> will

some thick little cylinders which will

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.680 
some thick little cylinders which will
become<00:03:14.040> his<00:03:14.490> feet<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.150> push<00:03:15.360> them<00:03:15.510> in

become his feet when you push them in

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.210 
become his feet when you push them in
and<00:03:15.900> use<00:03:16.020> your<00:03:16.050> fingers<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.470> manipulate<00:03:17.070> them
