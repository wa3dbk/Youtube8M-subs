00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.910
 in a match like that one is always the most important is to score at this 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.910
 price there you do it on sedan on this free kick 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.109
 I would have because too much Christian christian rouaud why 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.539
 it was a plot the census enumerator 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.099
 this contract with anyone 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.770
 criticized from 1 to 0 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.620
 he was a supporter of the real 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.740
 two months after the moon is noticed that I had 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.070
 still very serious 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.070
 the second half 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.990
 baptist hecker roger thiago silva presents more 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.240
 it makes a gesture to heaven after another 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 haberdasher 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.500
 the first goal of this news 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.600
 we are still in the top 10 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.080
 13 to 6 someone who thinks that it depends on statistics opta for ben 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.239
 arfa anyway 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.239
 it's 14 dead 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.080
 and what is already a championship you have the feeling of racing 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 classic success 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.420
 do not say that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.200
 ap in the goal 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.170
 I'm happy with that 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.550
 it does however also to know what they do and I am a player like 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.549
 what can make the difference 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.410
 conscious in the thatch bridge clinic 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.050
 but I do 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 all for could help the team 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.850
 you attend the typical wish is good for us for master word 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 win the championship because if you win this point 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 the statistical map he said 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.450
 but if you can not the championship it's long 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 and it was them who had attended picnics 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.079
 it is very beautiful with 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.609
 with the senior championships 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.609
 so what is he going to do 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.169
 I also believe that next week decade 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.289
 decidedly etc but 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.380
 it's called part 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.719
 the sides 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.299
 it happens to me likewise difficult match-to-body we too a zone 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.909
 difficult match 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.029
 sunrise period in who 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.909
 clip seriously 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.429
 we should not consult each other anyway 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.569
 Where is the problem 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.599
 answer everyone says comparable data to the key against saint maurit 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.689
 time 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.879
 complicated he abstained little 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.899
 on the side of lyon 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.129
 it is important 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.429
 devote a second 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.169
 on the match 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.020
 it is good too 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.209
 impossible today at the same time 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.209
 I think it's a difference if 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.429
 messi barca this contest
