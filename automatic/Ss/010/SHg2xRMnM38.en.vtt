conditioning system and then it also has
the<00:00:22.529> pressure<00:00:22.980> gauge<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.760> read<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the pressure gauge so you can read the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.400 
the pressure gauge so you can read the
pressure<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> air<00:00:24.779> conditioning<00:00:25.260> system

pressure in the air conditioning system

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
pressure in the air conditioning system
so<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> don't<00:00:25.830> overfill<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:26.730> underfill<00:00:27.180> it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
so you don't overfill it or underfill it

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.849 
so you don't overfill it or underfill it
this<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> easiest<00:00:28.470> jobs<00:00:28.619> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this is one of the easiest jobs you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.500 
this is one of the easiest jobs you
could<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.369> car<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.910> get<00:00:30.240> really

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
could do on your car and get really

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.450 
could do on your car and get really
rewarding<00:00:31.019> results<00:00:31.439> especially<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.309> this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
rewarding results especially in this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.780 
rewarding results especially in this
summer<00:00:32.700> heat<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> 2000<00:00:34.620> BMW<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.520> but

recharge lasts over a year which means

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
recharge lasts over a year which means
that<00:01:14.939> there's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.840> small<00:01:16.200> leak

that there's a really really small leak

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.770 
that there's a really really small leak
which<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.340> usually<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> bad<00:01:18.030> seal<00:01:18.330> somewhere

which is usually a bad seal somewhere

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
which is usually a bad seal somewhere
it's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.770> worth<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> spend<00:01:20.670> thousands<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it's not worth it to spend thousands of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.609 
it's not worth it to spend thousands of
dollars<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.689> find<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> leak<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.470> then

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
dollars to find the leak and then

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.070 
dollars to find the leak and then
replace<00:01:22.950> AC<00:01:23.220> components<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.509> instead<00:01:24.869> we're

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
replace AC components so instead we're

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
replace AC components so instead we're
going<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.380> using<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.979> refrigerant<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> has

a sealer in it now the reason why I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.429 
a sealer in it now the reason why I

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
chose this AC system kit is because the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
chose this AC system kit is because the

sealer in this kit isn't the typical
sealer<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.320> not<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> goo<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.280> thick

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
sealer it's not a goo it's not thick

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.210 
sealer it's not a goo it's not thick
this<00:01:36.210> sealer<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.380> conditioner<00:01:38.070> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
this sealer is more of a conditioner it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.730 
this sealer is more of a conditioner it
conditions<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> rubber<00:01:39.329> gaskets<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.619> those

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
conditions the rubber gaskets so those

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.429 
conditions the rubber gaskets so those
rubber<00:01:40.979> gaskets<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.700> o-rings<00:01:42.450> swell<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
rubber gaskets and o-rings swell and

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.010 
rubber gaskets and o-rings swell and
clog<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> most<00:01:44.399> common<00:01:44.759> leaks<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.899> that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
clog the most common leaks so now that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.330 
clog the most common leaks so now that
you<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> basics<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.829> refrigerant

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you know the basics on the refrigerant

to recharge your AC system so the first
thing<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.659> want<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
thing that you want to do is we want to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.760 
thing that you want to do is we want to
connect<00:01:53.430> our<00:01:53.549> AC<00:01:54.119> kit<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.290> low<00:01:55.560> pressure

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
connect our AC kit to the low pressure

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.370 
connect our AC kit to the low pressure
service<00:01:56.369> port<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.180> adapter<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.290> we

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
service port with this adapter so we

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810 
service port with this adapter so we
have<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.590> find<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> low<00:01:59.070> pressure<00:01:59.310> service

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
have to find the low pressure service

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.580 
have to find the low pressure service
port<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> low<00:02:00.689> pressure<00:02:00.869> service<00:02:01.350> port

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
port now the low pressure service port

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.899 
port now the low pressure service port
is<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> air

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
is going to be on one of the air

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.730 
is going to be on one of the air
conditioning<00:02:03.420> lines<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.409> these<00:02:04.530> two

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
conditioning lines you can see these two

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.260 
conditioning lines you can see these two
air<00:02:04.860> conditioning<00:02:05.310> lines<00:02:05.460> coming<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.030> right

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
air conditioning lines coming in right

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.910 
air conditioning lines coming in right
here<00:02:06.630> well<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.439> want<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.770> follow

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
here well now you just want to follow

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.070 
here well now you just want to follow
the<00:02:08.129> lines<00:02:08.340> actually<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:09.539> here<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.959> can

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the lines actually right here you can

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
the lines actually right here you can
see<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.009> service<00:02:11.310> ports<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.910> this

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
see is one of the service ports in this

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.430 
see is one of the service ports in this
case<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> high

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
case this is the high

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
case this is the high
pressure<00:02:13.620> service<00:02:14.040> port<00:02:14.310> which<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.880> can't<00:02:15.150> use

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
pressure service port which we can't use

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.540 
pressure service port which we can't use
sometimes<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.500> high<00:02:16.620> pressure<00:02:16.860> service<00:02:17.280> port

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
sometimes the high pressure service port

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.000 
sometimes the high pressure service port
has<00:02:17.940> an<00:02:18.150> H<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> cap<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.650> case<00:02:19.860> we

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
has an H on the cap in this case we

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.710 
has an H on the cap in this case we
don't<00:02:20.100> have<00:02:20.220> any<00:02:20.340> lettering<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.030> cat<00:02:21.270> but

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
don't have any lettering on the cat but

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.360 
don't have any lettering on the cat but
don't<00:02:22.170> worry<00:02:22.350> if<00:02:22.650> you're<00:02:22.770> not<00:02:22.890> sure<00:02:23.070> which<00:02:23.220> is

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
don't worry if you're not sure which is

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.590 
don't worry if you're not sure which is
a<00:02:23.400> high<00:02:23.550> pressure<00:02:23.850> which<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.180> low<00:02:24.390> pressure

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
a high pressure which is low pressure

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.740 
a high pressure which is low pressure
your<00:02:25.350> adapter<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.250> only<00:02:26.820> fits<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.540> low

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
your adapter here only fits on the low

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.600 
your adapter here only fits on the low
pressure<00:02:28.050> port<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.920> see<00:02:29.100> here<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.430> won't

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
pressure port you can see here it won't

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.010 
pressure port you can see here it won't
fit<00:02:29.820> on<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> high<00:02:30.120> pressure<00:02:30.360> port<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.990> you

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
fit on the high pressure port so you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.870 
fit on the high pressure port so you
can't<00:02:31.290> mess<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:32.340> we'll<00:02:32.430> put<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.580> cap

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
can't mess that up so we'll put that cap

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.700 
can't mess that up so we'll put that cap
back<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.630> now<00:02:34.200> we're<00:02:34.350> going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> follow

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
back on and now we're going to follow

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.900 
back on and now we're going to follow
our<00:02:35.130> AC<00:02:35.400> lines<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.370> see<00:02:38.400> them<00:02:38.700> right

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
our AC lines you can see them right

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.120 
our AC lines you can see them right
there<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.420> goes<00:02:39.600> into<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.170> cabin<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.860> then

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
there it goes into the cabin and then

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.040 
there it goes into the cabin and then
actually<00:02:41.520> right<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:41.790> here<00:02:42.270> here's<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
actually right up here here's the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.110 
actually right up here here's the
low-pressure<00:02:43.650> service<00:02:44.130> port<00:02:44.370> again

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
low-pressure service port again

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.760 
low-pressure service port again
sometimes<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:45.870> an<00:02:45.990> L<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.560> cap

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
sometimes you have an L on the cap

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.440 
sometimes you have an L on the cap
indicating<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.730> low-pressure<00:02:48.090> port

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
indicating that's the low-pressure port

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.810 
indicating that's the low-pressure port
in<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.840> case<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.200> don't<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.490> take<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
in this case we don't but you take the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.910 
in this case we don't but you take the
cap<00:02:50.970> off<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.990> grab<00:02:52.230> your<00:02:52.380> adapter<00:02:52.800> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
cap off and just grab your adapter and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.440 
cap off and just grab your adapter and
all<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.130> have<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.000> pull<00:02:54.240> back<00:02:54.390> on

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
all you have to do is you pull back on

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.260 
all you have to do is you pull back on
this<00:02:54.810> like<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.580> then<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.760> push<00:02:57.030> down

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
this like that and then you push down

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.990 
this like that and then you push down
and<00:02:58.010> then<00:02:59.010> that's<00:02:59.190> connected<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.850> can

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
and then that's connected and you can

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.460 
and then that's connected and you can
see<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.270> fits<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.080> fits<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.440> our

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
see it fits so it fits on our

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.560 
see it fits so it fits on our
low-pressure<00:03:01.920> port<00:03:02.310> no<00:03:02.520> problem<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.210> I'm

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
low-pressure port no problem and I'm

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.520

because<00:03:06.240> we<00:03:06.480> don't<00:03:06.630> need<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.900> attached<00:03:07.230> right

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
because we don't need it attached right

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.290 
because we don't need it attached right
now<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:08.310> was<00:03:08.460> just<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.760> show<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.150> our

check it out so on this vehicle what you
want<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.760> do<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.120> want<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.360> find<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> AC

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
want to do is you want to find the AC

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.360 
want to do is you want to find the AC
compressor<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.650> after<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.010> find<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.220> air

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
compressor and after you find the air

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.040 
compressor and after you find the air
conditioning<00:03:29.820> compressor<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.840> want<00:03:30.989> to

conditioning compressor you want to

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.080 
conditioning compressor you want to
follow<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> AC<00:03:31.590> lines<00:03:32.070> actually<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.760> want<00:03:33.030> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
follow the AC lines actually I want to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.340 
follow the AC lines actually I want to
look<00:03:33.150> right<00:03:33.330> here<00:03:33.510> here's<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.840> high-pressure

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
look right here here's the high-pressure

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.140 
look right here here's the high-pressure
AC<00:03:34.709> line<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.489> can<00:03:35.610> see<00:03:35.760> here's<00:03:36.030> that

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
AC line and you can see here's that

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.180 
AC line and you can see here's that
service<00:03:36.540> port<00:03:36.810> which<00:03:37.020> is<00:03:37.050> capped<00:03:37.440> then<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
service port which is capped then it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.250 
service port which is capped then it
goes<00:03:38.340> into<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.760> condenser<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.450> then<00:03:40.140> it

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
goes into the condenser and then it

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.470 
goes into the condenser and then it
comes<00:03:40.470> back<00:03:40.560> around<00:03:40.920> here<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.300> see

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
comes back around here and you can see

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.870 
comes back around here and you can see
here's<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.900> nice<00:03:43.050> thick<00:03:43.380> AC<00:03:43.650> line<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.700> is

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
here's that nice thick AC line this is

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.640 
here's that nice thick AC line this is
going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.360> accumulator<00:03:45.959> which<00:03:46.290> removes

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
going to the accumulator which removes

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.110 
going to the accumulator which removes
the<00:03:46.739> moisture<00:03:46.890> from<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.370> refrigerant<00:03:48.000> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
the moisture from the refrigerant and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.759 
the moisture from the refrigerant and
here's<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.870> other<00:03:48.900> cap<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.650> our

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
here's the other cap so this is our

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.350 
here's the other cap so this is our
low-pressure<00:03:50.160> cap<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:50.700> we<00:03:50.730> could<00:03:50.970> fill<00:03:51.180> my

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
low-pressure cap so we could fill my

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.570 
low-pressure cap so we could fill my
truck<00:03:51.630> from<00:03:51.780> right<00:03:52.019> here<00:03:52.230> alright<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.370> now<00:03:53.519> we

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
truck from right here alright so now we

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.340 
truck from right here alright so now we
know<00:03:53.730> how<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:53.910> find<00:03:54.180> our<00:03:54.420> low-pressure<00:03:54.930> port

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
know how to find our low-pressure port

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.740 
know how to find our low-pressure port
the<00:03:55.650> next<00:03:56.040> step<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:57.150> have<00:03:57.300> to<00:03:57.420> figure<00:03:57.720> out

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
the next step is we have to figure out

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.020 
the next step is we have to figure out
what<00:03:58.290> temperature<00:03:58.830> it<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.100> outside<00:03:59.550> in<00:03:59.760> this

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
what temperature it is outside in this

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.570 
what temperature it is outside in this
case<00:04:00.269> we<00:04:00.540> have<00:04:00.690> about<00:04:00.989> ninety<00:04:01.470> degrees

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
case we have about ninety degrees

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.220 
case we have about ninety degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.820> what<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.390> do<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:03.780> adjust

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
Fahrenheit and what you do is you adjust

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.530 
Fahrenheit and what you do is you adjust
this<00:04:04.590> gauge<00:04:04.890> right<00:04:05.220> here<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.150> can<00:04:06.300> see

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
this gauge right here and you can see

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.750 
this gauge right here and you can see
inside<00:04:06.810> here<00:04:07.410> there's<00:04:07.709> all<00:04:07.920> temperatures<00:04:08.310> at

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
inside here there's all temperatures at

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.400 
inside here there's all temperatures at
the<00:04:09.030> bottom<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.810> want<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.080> point<00:04:10.290> that

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
the bottom and you want to point that

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.460 
the bottom and you want to point that
arrow<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.040> middle<00:04:11.310> right<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.630> about<00:04:13.110> 90

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
arrow in the middle right to about 90

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.050 
arrow in the middle right to about 90
degrees<00:04:13.590> which<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.040> right<00:04:14.370> about<00:04:14.550> there<00:04:14.790> so

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
degrees which is right about there so

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.900 
degrees which is right about there so
it's<00:04:15.180> going<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.360> be<00:04:15.420> between<00:04:15.690> 45<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.650> 55<00:04:17.160> psi

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
it's going to be between 45 and 55 psi

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.120 
it's going to be between 45 and 55 psi
in<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.330> green<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.780> that's<00:04:19.739> where<00:04:20.010> we're

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
in that green and that's where we're

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.320 
in that green and that's where we're
going<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.340> want<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.580> build<00:04:20.790> up<00:04:20.940> our<00:04:21.090> pressure

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
going to want to build up our pressure

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.950 
going to want to build up our pressure
too<00:04:21.919> now<00:04:22.919> we<00:04:22.979> can<00:04:23.190> go<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.700> car

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
too now we can go in the car

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.249 
too now we can go in the car
and<00:04:25.770> then<00:04:26.280> turn<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.610> car<00:04:26.820> on<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:30.810> have<00:04:31.020> my

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
and then turn the car on and I have my

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.200 
and then turn the car on and I have my
temperature<00:04:31.949> gauge<00:04:32.070> right<00:04:32.550> here<00:04:32.850> I'm<00:04:33.030> going

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
temperature gauge right here I'm going

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.870 
temperature gauge right here I'm going
to<00:04:33.300> put<00:04:33.570> in<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.930> vent<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:35.310> we<00:04:35.430> know<00:04:35.610> what

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
to put in the vent so we know what

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.219 
to put in the vent so we know what
temperature<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.360> air<00:04:36.630> coming<00:04:36.930> out<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.139> the

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
temperature the air coming out of the

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.710 
temperature the air coming out of the
vent<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.639> now<00:04:38.639> I'm<00:04:38.729> going<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:38.910> come<00:04:39.150> down<00:04:39.360> here

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
vent is now I'm going to come down here

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.120 
vent is now I'm going to come down here
and<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:40.139> want<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.500> make<00:04:40.620> sure<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:40.949> have<00:04:41.039> the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
and I want to make sure that I have the

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.159 
and I want to make sure that I have the
air<00:04:41.280> conditioner<00:04:41.759> on<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.600> can<00:04:42.720> see<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:43.020> is

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
air conditioner on you can see this is

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.749 
air conditioner on you can see this is
climate<00:04:43.590> control<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:44.400> have<00:04:44.669> the

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
climate control so I have the

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.310 
climate control so I have the
temperature<00:04:45.120> all<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.539> way<00:04:45.630> down<00:04:45.810> as<00:04:45.960> cold<00:04:46.199> as

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
temperature all the way down as cold as

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.170 
temperature all the way down as cold as
it<00:04:46.410> could<00:04:46.590> go<00:04:46.740> if<00:04:46.979> you<00:04:47.400> have<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.610> knobs<00:04:47.820> just

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
it could go if you have the knobs just

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.029 
it could go if you have the knobs just
switch<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.600> knobs<00:04:48.810> as<00:04:49.050> cold<00:04:49.289> as<00:04:49.440> it'll<00:04:49.680> go<00:04:49.710> and

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
switch the knobs as cold as it'll go and

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.800 
switch the knobs as cold as it'll go and
then<00:04:50.759> you<00:04:50.850> want<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.030> make<00:04:51.120> sure<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.419> hit<00:04:51.630> this

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
then you want to make sure you hit this

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.590 
then you want to make sure you hit this
button<00:04:51.870> right<00:04:52.199> here<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:54.030> turns<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.419> AC

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
button right here and that turns the AC

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.510 
button right here and that turns the AC
on<00:04:55.520> then<00:04:56.520> we<00:04:56.610> can<00:04:56.639> watch<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:59.190> actually

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
on then we can watch this so actually

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.430 
on then we can watch this so actually
let<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.849> car<00:05:00.060> run<00:05:00.270> for<00:05:00.539> a<00:05:00.570> little<00:05:00.810> while<00:05:00.960> and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
let the car run for a little while and

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.320 
let the car run for a little while and
you<00:05:01.560> can<00:05:01.680> see<00:05:01.949> got<00:05:02.220> down<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.490> seventy<00:05:03.030> seven

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
you can see got down to seventy seven

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.620 
you can see got down to seventy seven
and<00:05:03.539> a<00:05:03.570> half<00:05:03.599> degrees<00:05:04.460> with<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.490> AC<00:05:05.789> on<00:05:06.060> and

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
and a half degrees with the AC on and

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.900 
and a half degrees with the AC on and
that's<00:05:07.259> just<00:05:07.349> not<00:05:07.620> cold<00:05:07.919> enough<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:08.550> let's<00:05:08.729> go

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
that's just not cold enough so let's go

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.520 
that's just not cold enough so let's go
charge<00:05:09.270> it<00:05:09.449> up<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.810> I'm<00:05:10.139> going<00:05:10.259> to<00:05:10.289> show<00:05:10.470> you

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
charge it up and I'm going to show you

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.020 
charge it up and I'm going to show you
how<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.740> check<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.070> make<00:05:11.190> sure<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.550> compressor

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
how to check to make sure the compressor

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.629 
how to check to make sure the compressor
is<00:05:12.090> running<00:05:12.770> so<00:05:13.770> right<00:05:14.070> down<00:05:14.220> here<00:05:14.490> is<00:05:14.610> the

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
is running so right down here is the

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.189 
is running so right down here is the
compressor<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.479> we<00:05:15.690> just<00:05:15.870> want<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.020> make<00:05:16.139> sure

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
compressor and we just want to make sure

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.230 
compressor and we just want to make sure
it's<00:05:16.440> on<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:16.949> could<00:05:17.250> actually<00:05:17.370> see<00:05:17.729> it<00:05:17.759> spinning

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
it's on I could actually see it spinning

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.430 
it's on I could actually see it spinning
you<00:05:18.330> can<00:05:18.449> see<00:05:18.599> the<00:05:18.720> front<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.199> pulley

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
you can see the front of that pulley

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.659 
you can see the front of that pulley
spinning<00:05:19.919> that<00:05:20.190> means<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.430> compressor

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
spinning that means the compressor

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.909 
spinning that means the compressor
clutch<00:05:21.000> is<00:05:21.300> on<00:05:21.630> I'm<00:05:22.139> going<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.349> go<00:05:22.500> in<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.740> car

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
clutch is on I'm going to go in the car

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.350 
clutch is on I'm going to go in the car
real<00:05:23.099> quick<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.580> I'm<00:05:23.699> going<00:05:23.820> to<00:05:23.849> shut<00:05:24.120> it<00:05:24.150> off

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
real quick and I'm going to shut it off

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.290 
real quick and I'm going to shut it off
and<00:05:24.389> you'll<00:05:24.840> see<00:05:25.020> how<00:05:25.169> it<00:05:25.289> stops<00:05:26.090> so<00:05:27.090> right

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
and you'll see how it stops so right

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.960 
and you'll see how it stops so right
there<00:05:27.479> you<00:05:27.599> can<00:05:27.720> see<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:27.930> stops<00:05:28.199> and<00:05:28.530> it's<00:05:28.710> off

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
there you can see it stops and it's off

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.089 
there you can see it stops and it's off
I'm<00:05:29.970> going<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.240> turn<00:05:30.360> it<00:05:30.479> on<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:31.830> can<00:05:31.949> see

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
I'm going to turn it on and you can see

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.000 
I'm going to turn it on and you can see
right<00:05:32.220> there<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.760> clicked<00:05:33.240> back<00:05:33.389> on<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.860> in

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
right there it clicked back on so in

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.439 
right there it clicked back on so in
this<00:05:35.099> case<00:05:35.340> our<00:05:35.580> compressor<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.120> running

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
this case our compressor is running

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.089 
this case our compressor is running
which<00:05:36.900> is<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:37.110> good<00:05:37.409> thing<00:05:37.440> means<00:05:37.949> our

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
which is a good thing means our

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.500 
which is a good thing means our
compressor<00:05:38.520> is<00:05:38.610> working<00:05:38.940> if<00:05:39.060> yours<00:05:39.300> isn't

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
compressor is working if yours isn't

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.000 
compressor is working if yours isn't
running<00:05:39.780> that's<00:05:40.020> not<00:05:40.169> necessarily<00:05:40.590> bad<00:05:40.710> it

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
running that's not necessarily bad it

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.080 
running that's not necessarily bad it
could<00:05:41.130> mean<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.490> pressure<00:05:41.729> is<00:05:41.909> really

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
could mean that the pressure is really

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.879 
could mean that the pressure is really
low<00:05:42.389> and<00:05:42.659> you<00:05:42.930> need<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.169> boost<00:05:43.320> it<00:05:43.560> with<00:05:43.770> the

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
low and you need to boost it with the

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.379 
low and you need to boost it with the
refrigerant<00:05:44.400> so<00:05:44.639> don't<00:05:44.849> worry<00:05:44.940> about<00:05:45.210> that

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
refrigerant so don't worry about that

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.020 
refrigerant so don't worry about that
yet<00:05:45.659> let's<00:05:46.199> move<00:05:46.409> to<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.680> next<00:05:46.710> step<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:48.000> next

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
yet let's move to the next step the next

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.719 
yet let's move to the next step the next
step<00:05:48.510> is<00:05:48.750> get<00:05:49.080> your<00:05:49.169> safety<00:05:49.620> goggles<00:05:49.800> on<00:05:50.099> and

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
step is get your safety goggles on and

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.000 
step is get your safety goggles on and
get<00:05:51.270> your<00:05:51.389> gloves<00:05:51.539> on<00:05:51.900> so<00:05:52.590> that<00:05:52.740> the

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
get your gloves on so that the

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.649 
get your gloves on so that the
refrigerant<00:05:53.460> doesn't<00:05:53.820> hit<00:05:53.970> your<00:05:54.090> hands<00:05:54.449> and

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
refrigerant doesn't hit your hands and

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.240 
refrigerant doesn't hit your hands and
cause<00:05:54.840> frostbite<00:05:55.080> and<00:05:55.500> also<00:05:55.800> doesn't<00:05:55.979> get<00:05:56.190> in

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
cause frostbite and also doesn't get in

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.399 
cause frostbite and also doesn't get in
your<00:05:56.340> eyes<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:56.729> blonde<00:05:56.909> you<00:05:57.090> now<00:05:58.020> we<00:05:58.080> want<00:05:58.349> to

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.230 
your eyes and blonde you now we want to
unscrew<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:58.889> top<00:05:59.099> of<00:05:59.310> our<00:05:59.460> bottle<00:05:59.789> to<00:05:59.940> remove

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
unscrew the top of our bottle to remove

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
refrigerant with its additives so we get

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.730 
refrigerant with its additives so we get
it<00:06:11.580> evenly<00:06:11.880> distributed<00:06:12.599> now<00:06:13.380> attach<00:06:13.710> the

out why it could be as simple as

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.220 
out why it could be as simple as
something<00:07:08.850> like<00:07:09.060> the<00:07:09.240> AC<00:07:09.420> compressor<00:07:09.870> fuse

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
something like the AC compressor fuse

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.590 
something like the AC compressor fuse
just<00:07:10.530> needs<00:07:10.710> to<00:07:10.800> be<00:07:10.890> replaced

psi<00:07:16.110> and<00:07:16.410> now<00:07:17.250> we<00:07:17.310> could<00:07:17.580> remove<00:07:17.880> the<00:07:18.060> coupler

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.390
