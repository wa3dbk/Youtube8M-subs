00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.519
 the bull is the part of the body located 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.369
 between the neck and the abdomen 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.279
 the thoracic cavity and its wall have 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.279
 Cone shape is narrower 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.130
 superiorly it was increasing 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.500
 bottom reaches its maximum size 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.210
 in the union with the abdominal part of 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.730
 trunk this is divided into three phases one 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.890
 central mediastinum occupied by the 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.920
 heart and structures that transport 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.739
 airs blood and food 2 and 3 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 right and left lung cavities 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.570
 which houses football and the rib cage 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.839
 with its horizontal bars formed by 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.879
 ribs and rib cartilages also 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.670
 sustained by the sternum and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.860
 thorax vertebrae the chest wall is 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.259
 formed by the rib cage and the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.659
 muscles that extend between 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.270
 ribs 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.439
 the thorax has the function of protecting 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.030
 the vital organs of the thorax and abdomen 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.609
 provide insertion of members 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.770
 superiors provide insertion to 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.659
 muscles that maintain the position of 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.289
 the superior members in relation to 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.349
 external interest the external is a bone 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.780
 flat and vertically that 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.820
 forms the previous central part of the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.610
 thoracic cage 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.880
 this is divided into manubrio body of the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.270
 sternum and apophysis and I am where the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.020
 manubrio presents 2 cut-outs clavicular 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.909
 and a jugular 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.829
 the body presents the cuts 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:56.469
 costales which will be found 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.110
 articulated joints but 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:02.159
 vials which allow the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.369
 inspiration and expiration 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.060
 the body of the sternum is articulated with 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.580
 the handlebar and with up office and if you are 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.030
 presenting a joint 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.190
 primary cartilaginous justified 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.190
 and if it was external 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:27.349
 the ribs the thorax is composed 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.170
 for 24 ribs 12 pairs in which 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.080
 the first to the seventh are true 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.709
 since they are articulated directly to 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.900
 Externar by means of cartilages the 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:45.940
 ribs 8 9 10 are faults since they are 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.310
 articulate cartilage with dro external 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.819
 of his previous rib 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.879
 finally the ribs 11 and 2 d are 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.120
 floating ribs since it does not 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.569
 articulate when external 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.260
 the ribs are classified as typical and 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.470
 atypical are typical of the third to the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.250
 nine since they possess a head and a 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.610
 neck a tuber a body an angle 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.909
 and a groove are atypical ribs 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.970
 one that is the shortest and widest 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:25.720
 curves presents a single one on my veneer 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.840
 articular have two sub grooves such 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.870
 sub keys that is where the vein rests 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.660
 subclavian artery and the subclavian artery the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.530
 second rib is longer frac 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.109
 thin and less curved ribs 10 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.349
 11 and 12 like the first have 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.450
 just an articular face on his head and 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.170
 articulates with his vertebra 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.959
 corresponding being also 11 and 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.370
 the 12 those that do not present collars 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.370
 no tubers 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.650
 vertebrae 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.959
 the thoracic vertebrae are composed 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.250
 by spinous processes and apophysis 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.920
 transverse 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.220
 where the transverse presents an appointment 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.560
 for the tuber of the rib 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.950
 they contain 4 in my face even though the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.970
 vertebra t 1 had this 11 of 12 instead 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.640
 of my veneers are masochists 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.420
 they are articulated by means of discs 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.760
 intervertebrals also present some 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.639
 upper joint faces which 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.210
 they articulate to the previous vertebra 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:40.560
 scapular waist scapular waist 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.289
 It is composed of scapula clavicle and 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.050
 a chrome which is articulated to the 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.770
 clavicle through a joint 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.770
 called clavicular acromium 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.000
 finally the thorax presents two 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.130
 upper thoracic orifices which 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.620
 connects the thorax with the limbs 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.480
 upper and lower hole 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.790
 thoracic which contains the diaphragm 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.230
 that supports the organs and lyceums 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.230
 presented in the openings
