00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.460

 who the secrets 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.159

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.190
 more 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.650
 with a whole heart to the deed 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.370
 Dell stands firm with all this is the philosophy of the title shows 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.050

 Tomorrow ends the era Finke kept alive 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.240
 pointless slaughter caravans in the land of the rising sun 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.630
 if you see it on board and only "in a democracy can make food 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.240
 to get 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.170
 sid / dpa 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.379
 but in the end it is rank and name made 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.500
 The two major Christian worldview text consists of one percent Intel 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.880
 give picture 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.620
 they make the rails 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.620
 6 percent employed 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.640
 especially at this time that's 4 1 percent 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.700
 current 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.380
 much more important 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.530
 two to three percent can not go on like this 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.640
 so the cab got up 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.890
 People do not anymore 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.820
 that can take a long time it is what happened 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.830
 I hope he has happened a lot 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.190
 so doing something unexpected is very nice 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.920

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.590

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.510
 For many years she has been in her seats since March 2010 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.749

 According to the complaint, not everyone has hundreds of interest 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:43.239
 what you have to do what you want to do what you want it is that 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:43.810
 circle 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.889

 This Thomas is not Hero the wrong way either 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.319
 but there are also additional ones 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.479

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:16.219
 practically 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.519
 clearly next to 53 tones 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.519
 there is also practically there 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.989
 first collusion meet pavilion I have no idea 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.999

 There are people who want them now 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.299

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.499

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.329
 for the meaning of life Country 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.939
 as so often 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.559
 in the meantime become 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:59.199
 Aha on this question is guided de I wish
