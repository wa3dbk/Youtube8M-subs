00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
actually a new stuff implemented in this

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.270 
actually a new stuff implemented in this
might<00:02:03.720> be<00:02:03.960> cooked<00:02:04.560> beef<00:02:06.050> there's<00:02:07.050> chicken<00:02:07.980> raw

chicken<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.020> implemented<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
chicken I think they implemented the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.800 
chicken I think they implemented the
chest<00:02:11.100> before<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.610> didn't<00:02:11.820> have<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.330> think

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
chest before I didn't have it I think

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.020 
chest before I didn't have it I think
I'm<00:02:13.050> not<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.350> sure<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.460> correct<00:02:14.700> me<00:02:14.910> if

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.600 
I'm not so sure you can correct me if
you<00:02:15.150> want<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.630> there's<00:02:16.500> holes<00:02:16.830> probably

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
you want and there's holes probably

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.520 
you want and there's holes probably
every<00:02:17.880> sort<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.150> holes<00:02:18.360> that's<00:02:18.990> pretty<00:02:19.350> weird

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
every sort of holes that's pretty weird

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.190 
every sort of holes that's pretty weird
before<00:02:19.770> when<00:02:20.220> there<00:02:20.370> wasn't<00:02:20.550> hose<00:02:20.850> because<00:02:21.750> it

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
before when there wasn't hose because it

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500 
before when there wasn't hose because it
was<00:02:22.320> actually<00:02:22.710> already<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.220> from<00:02:23.580> unruly<00:02:24.330> or

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
was actually already in from unruly or

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.480 
was actually already in from unruly or
early<00:02:25.110> version<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:26.310> there's

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
early version so as you can see there's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.210 
early version so as you can see there's
glowing<00:02:27.120> obsidian<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.560> reactor<00:02:28.950> goes

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
glowing obsidian and then reactor goes

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.290 
glowing obsidian and then reactor goes
down<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.640> glowstone<00:02:29.940> dust<00:02:30.080> under<00:02:31.080> HOH<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
down and glowstone dust under HOH and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.910 
down and glowstone dust under HOH and
something<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.330> shot<00:02:33.570> me<00:02:33.600> invisible<00:02:34.260> bedrock

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
something that shot me invisible bedrock

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.230 
something that shot me invisible bedrock
I'm<00:02:35.190> going<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.430> test<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.700> out<00:02:35.760> one<00:02:36.060> day<00:02:36.210> I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
I'm going to test that out one day I

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.510 
I'm going to test that out one day I
don't<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.600> when<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.890> want<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.040> see<00:02:38.280> what

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
don't know when I just want to see what

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.700 
don't know when I just want to see what
actually<00:02:38.850> looks<00:02:39.030> like<00:02:39.210> maybe<00:02:40.170> I'll<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.530> do

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
actually looks like maybe I'll just do

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.920 
actually looks like maybe I'll just do
it<00:02:40.830> right<00:02:41.130> after<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.550> video<00:02:41.880> as<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.720> see

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.140 
it right after this video as you can see
there's<00:02:43.230> melons<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.400> stuff<00:02:44.640> for<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> men<00:02:45.000> in
