00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
maintaining the straightness is to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.470 
maintaining the straightness is to
ensure<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.990> not<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.030> lot<00:02:33.120> of

moisture<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.380> your<00:02:34.470> hair<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:36.120> whenever<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.630> did

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780

moisture in your hair so whenever I did
apply<00:02:38.240> moisturizer<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.750> was<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.080> quicker

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
apply moisturizer it was just quicker

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.120 
apply moisturizer it was just quicker
cream<00:02:40.830> based<00:02:41.160> moisturizer<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.440> applied

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
cream based moisturizer and if I applied

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
cream based moisturizer and if I applied

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
water

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.930 
water
I<00:02:46.070> applied<00:02:48.440> lick<00:02:49.440> out<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.890> my<00:02:50.040> my<00:02:50.490> spray<00:02:50.910> bottle

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.280 
I applied lick out of my my spray bottle
that<00:02:51.630> gives<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.760> fine<00:02:53.760> mist<00:02:54.600> so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290

first part of this video you can see how

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.879 
first part of this video you can see how
it<00:05:21.580> looks<00:05:21.849> and<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.900> length<00:05:23.199> of<00:05:23.409> it<00:05:23.560> when<00:05:23.740> it's

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
it looks and the length of it when it's

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.939 
it looks and the length of it when it's
straightened<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:25.349> now<00:05:27.690> you<00:05:28.690> can<00:05:28.840> see<00:05:29.139> what<00:05:29.860> it

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
straightened and now you can see what it

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.680 
straightened and now you can see what it
looks<00:05:30.159> like<00:05:30.250> when<00:05:30.699> it's<00:05:30.849> just<00:05:31.060> freshly<00:05:31.330> washed

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
looks like when it's just freshly washed

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.379 
looks like when it's just freshly washed
and<00:05:32.349> detangled<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.389> thought<00:05:34.810> it<00:05:34.900> was<00:05:35.020> very

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
and detangled so I thought it was very

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.779

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
can see this okay so this is what the

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.029 
can see this okay so this is what the
hair<00:05:49.000> looks<00:05:49.300> like<00:05:51.810> as<00:05:52.810> you<00:05:52.990> can<00:05:53.139> see<00:05:53.469> the

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
hair looks like as you can see the

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.399 
hair looks like as you can see the
longer<00:05:54.759> my<00:05:54.909> hair<00:05:55.120> gets<00:05:55.449> the<00:05:55.900> more<00:05:58.110> it's<00:05:59.110> very

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
longer my hair gets the more it's very

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.980 
longer my hair gets the more it's very
dips<00:05:59.979> hair<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.909> my<00:06:01.870> curl<00:06:02.759> just<00:06:03.759> becomes<00:06:04.240> once

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
dips hair and my curl just becomes once

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.790 
dips hair and my curl just becomes once
I<00:06:05.110> comb<00:06:05.349> my<00:06:05.380> curls<00:06:05.949> out<00:06:06.159> my<00:06:06.849> curls<00:06:07.150> are<00:06:07.389> more<00:06:08.289> of

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.499 

spirals<00:06:11.800> like<00:06:12.610> loose<00:06:13.449> spirals<00:06:14.259> and<00:06:15.509> deep

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
spirals like loose spirals and deep

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.010 
spirals like loose spirals and deep
waves<00:06:16.900> in<00:06:17.169> the<00:06:17.289> front<00:06:17.699> but<00:06:18.699> once<00:06:19.000> I<00:06:19.270> detangle

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
waves in the front but once I detangle

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.219 
waves in the front but once I detangle
my<00:06:20.139> hair<00:06:20.520> it's<00:06:21.520> pretty<00:06:21.930> just<00:06:25.080> there's<00:06:26.080> not

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
my hair it's pretty just there's not

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.100 
my hair it's pretty just there's not
really<00:06:26.440> a<00:06:26.560> curl<00:06:26.949> to<00:06:27.250> it<00:06:27.719> it's<00:06:28.719> just<00:06:28.780> more<00:06:29.080> like

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
really a curl to it it's just more like

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.100 
really a curl to it it's just more like
a<00:06:29.259> wave<00:06:29.530> and<00:06:29.919> it's<00:06:30.820> just<00:06:31.030> big<00:06:31.590> so<00:06:32.610> this<00:06:33.610> is<00:06:33.789> the

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
a wave and it's just big so this is the

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.140 
a wave and it's just big so this is the
sides<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.620> then<00:06:36.130> I'll<00:06:36.250> turn<00:06:36.490> around<00:06:36.699> so<00:06:37.060> you

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
sides and then I'll turn around so you

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.170 
sides and then I'll turn around so you
can<00:06:37.300> see<00:06:37.330> an<00:06:38.050> additional<00:06:38.500> texture<00:06:39.279> in<00:06:39.490> the

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
can see an additional texture in the

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.140 
can see an additional texture in the
back<00:06:40.449> so

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
back so

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.550 
back so
if<00:06:41.210> you<00:06:41.300> go<00:06:41.450> back<00:06:41.630> and<00:06:41.780> look<00:06:41.900> at<00:06:42.080> my<00:06:42.110> previous

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
if you go back and look at my previous

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.270 
if you go back and look at my previous
my<00:06:43.190> my<00:06:43.610> beginning<00:06:44.120> videos<00:06:44.480> when<00:06:44.840> I<00:06:44.870> first<00:06:45.280> cut

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280

four<00:06:48.920> different<00:06:49.070> texture<00:06:49.670> distinct<00:06:50.270> textures

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
four different texture distinct textures

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
curls are very distinct the side is

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.110 
curls are very distinct the side is
looser<00:07:05.780> and<00:07:06.020> obviously<00:07:06.800> my<00:07:07.220> entire<00:07:07.580> crown
