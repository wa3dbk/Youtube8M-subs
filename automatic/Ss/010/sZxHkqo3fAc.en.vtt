00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hey charles naouri and welcome guys 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.320
 the one plus was worth it is the video one 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.070
 I make a small analysis between the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.130
 two there 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.550
 about the game that has gone through this channel 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.240
 time is the fight against changes or 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.500
 developed by the project is 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.369
 distributed by sega 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.189
 the game is on the platforms ps3 xbox 360 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.579
 and now on pc 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.750
 the version that I played is from pc and 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.710
 she cost 84/99 is currently also 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.829
 and this franchise playoff is that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 combat takes place in the real world 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.940
 united states vs. russia yes I 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.309
 I can really know just summed up the game 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.920
 there the story is basically you are a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.020
 American pilot and you have to make the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 that's all that is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.149
 unlike the previous games that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.810
 and they had all the know still more and 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.790
 such and left the coolest game and is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.040
 because it is the mold fight doc is supported that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.950
 really came to give a renewed 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.990
 his side the flying arcade and understood by 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 who instead of you stayed at the circuses 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.450
 disciples behind your enemy here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.450
 you go in a more personal fight 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.000
 intense with legal maneuvers India songs 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.439
 had quick time events and such that at 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.400
 times can be a little annoying more 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.549
 really gives a fuck aggregator in the game 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.710
 The Dog Face Mold Fighter Has Its Great 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.869
 problems is mainly a problem 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.689
 multiplayer that really needs a 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.610
 balancing for the next game case 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.250
 they want to use the mogi tailor 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.829
 understood this one seven combat because 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.869
 Do you know when you make an account? 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.500
 maneuver is very difficult if you do not 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.200
 hit with a missile and such is one thing 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.200
 which is not very cool also has some 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.899
 borges that are mandatory and another in 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.550
 doc left today to be able to kill him 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.970
 It is vital that the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.790
 development has been somewhat 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.760
 excited about the module 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.569
 but who is - please folks at 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.060
 next 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.980
 the diversity of the missions is a stop 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.920
 cool you control helicopters 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.500
 bombers and logic cacÃ©m and missions 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.189
 so it's never the same 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.959
 thing 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:34.569
 although une is an airplane game and 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.720
 You play a lot with other things without 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.840
 be know fighters but very well it gives 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.239
 a cool variety in the game and adds 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.819
 enough controls for pc are 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.599
 Awesome, our face is not impossible. 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.849
 I 'm not saying this for the love of 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.129
 God the first time you play and 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.599
 not playing with a control was 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.169
 play on the keyboard 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.489
 You're going to be sick, Malu, it's going to be bad 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.739
 same 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.959
 It is certain that during the course of the game you will 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.840
 catching the first 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:15.909
 really makes it difficult and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.729
 is a bad cop right part that is not there 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.459
 these things understood but pass between the 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:23.859
 missions giving a very nice aggregator 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.220
 Logical between the missions, I am. 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.010
 saying ok leave on the cop menu and play the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.129
 cop is for four people so you 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.470
 You can play with your friends in me. 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.019
 I advise you to play on the difficulty of 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.389
 elite because it really is easy has 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.019
 your friends to help is one thing 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.280
 cool 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:48.220
 The story is generically ridiculous. 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.379
 sure that he had heard him famous 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.879
 war stuff and such a war book 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.280
 but generic organ mano understood the Russian 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.729
 and New Middle East American 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.560
 new understands boot there he being the cei 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:05.229
 lapagesse video by dilma 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.459
 the pomegranate was one of the kind of new thing 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:12.489
 taking out a makarov who is the villain among 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.829
 Quotes from the plot of the game she is 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.889
 highly predictable and is not very 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.750
 exciting, right? 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.300
 game multiplayer or parade that 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.300
 comes to add enough aircraft 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.370
 can be used a system also says 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.830
 than those that can improve the 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.860
 performance of its various aircraft 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.900
 ways to play and is much better than the 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.780
 multiplayer this fight 6 that your son 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.849
 balance planning does not 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:46.840
 do not know how to do it that is not 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:49.180
 perfect but it's good it's not that combat 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.150
 I think they were excited 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.270
 nation can forget a little in the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.120
 importance that history has for the 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.270
 franchise the focus for example this combat 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.479
 4 and such a thing like that 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.389
 which was actually followed by the next 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.849
 and if with a bat he left a little more 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.800
 surroundings did you care and you? 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.250
 this time they cared so much about the 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.639
 that they forgot everything so 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.419
 many people may not like it and I do not 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.030
 liked it 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.610
 in history but the action was legal 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.919
 because they played quite broadly 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.599
 the summing track of the game is epic face 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.460
 multiplayer cop missions meet 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.250
 especially in campaign missions 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.090
 soundtrack of the game I joined this in 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:43.120
 certain times and also know putz leaves 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.330
 the most cruel business was feel the 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.370
 my since the explosion action at the time that 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.919
 You 're in the mold debate plays with that. 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.990
 music is really one thing 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.099
 that adds quite a game happened to 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.919
 emotion and such 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:04.360
 So it sucks, but it was worth it. 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:07.300
 The answer is yes the pc version and 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.039
 wii consoles already know depending on the price 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.900
 I think it's not worth much anymore 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.259
 especially if you are a fan of 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.379
 franchise because despite bringing a 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.750
 innovative gameplay and such they 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:23.110
 They forgot to do this fight. 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.210
 I know if I fight from the 4 that knows the 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.190
 story a little more engaging 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.379
 you know the consequences really. 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.310
 of your important team actions in the 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:35.930
 story 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.610
 the narrative estonia and everything a not 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.060
 no, no 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.760
 but in the case of football action of 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.300
 very good innovation 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.520
 wait there for the black friday or something 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.190
 promotion for you to pick up the game I 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.530
 I tell you a lot if you are a fan of 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.270
 Franchise if you're not waiting too 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.220
 because otherwise you will be disappointed 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.100
 photo mainly because of the 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.500
 controls and such but if you want to give 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.660
 one more look there single player one 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.810
 single player video one sim one video 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.110
 multiplayer and a video of the cope and how 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.000
 always have a good afternoon, good evening 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.570
 illogical a good day 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.540
 I was not forget I liked it and add 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.430
 this video to favorites too if you guys 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.740
 want to follow more closely if they 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.110
 inscribe here from the side 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.350
