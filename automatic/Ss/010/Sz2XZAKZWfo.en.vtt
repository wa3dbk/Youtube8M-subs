00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.030 
sloshing around in there but you get it
in<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:57.439> spacers<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.799> this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
in there and you get spacers in this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.209 
in there and you get spacers in this
case<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.579> PVC<00:02:00.000> tubes<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:00.990> not<00:02:01.439> cook<00:02:01.950> with

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
case it's PVC tubes I do not cook with

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.249 
case it's PVC tubes I do not cook with
those<00:02:02.430> again<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.360> demonstration<00:02:04.140> any

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
those again this is demonstration any

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.530 
those again this is demonstration any
ideas<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:04.920> an<00:02:05.070> air<00:02:05.250> gap<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> bottom

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
ideas you want an air gap on the bottom

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.900 
ideas you want an air gap on the bottom
of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.290> pot<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.220> heat<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.489> get

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
of the pot so the heat can get

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.589 
of the pot so the heat can get
underneath<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.459> put<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> spacers

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
underneath it you can put the spacers

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.460 
underneath it you can put the spacers
under<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
under the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.940 
under the
under<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> bag<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.990> little<00:02:16.500> better<00:02:16.710> if

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
under the bag it's a little better if

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.550 
under the bag it's a little better if
you<00:02:17.070> can<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.700> inside<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.660> bag<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.290> just

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
you can do that inside the bag it's just

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.820 
you can do that inside the bag it's just
a<00:02:19.680> lot<00:02:19.860> harder<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.460> pull<00:02:20.670> off<00:02:21.590> one<00:02:22.590> by<00:02:22.800> one

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
a lot harder to pull off one by one

a lot harder to pull off one by one
pieces<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.700> wood<00:02:23.910> work<00:02:24.390> real<00:02:24.690> well<00:02:24.870> I've<00:02:25.170> used

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
pieces of wood work real well I've used

pieces of wood work real well I've used
rocks<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.460> then<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.290> tent<00:02:28.590> see<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.920> but

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
rocks and then you can tent see it but

front of the pot either one you can use
the<00:02:41.520> bag<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.570> kind<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.870> work<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.440> through

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
the bag and just kind of work it through

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.560 
the bag and just kind of work it through
that<00:02:43.860> hole<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.400> keeps<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.790> bag<00:02:44.970> sealed
