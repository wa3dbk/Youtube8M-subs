horizontal metal cage here they are you
can<00:00:35.570> barely<00:00:35.750> see<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.110> cage<00:00:36.260> anymore<00:00:36.680> which<00:00:36.830> is

can barely see the cage anymore which is

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.729 
can barely see the cage anymore which is
the<00:00:37.100> idea<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:38.780> tomatoes<00:00:39.199> grow<00:00:39.379> up<00:00:39.470> through

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
the idea the tomatoes grow up through

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.500 
the idea the tomatoes grow up through
and<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.580> tomatoes<00:00:40.910> will<00:00:41.059> all<00:00:41.180> be<00:00:41.330> on<00:00:41.480> the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
and the tomatoes will all be on the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.150 
and the tomatoes will all be on the
outside<00:00:41.600> of<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.290> cage<00:00:42.470> where<00:00:42.739> we<00:00:42.830> can<00:00:42.949> harvest

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
outside of the cage where we can harvest

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.800 
outside of the cage where we can harvest
them<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:43.550> they'll<00:00:43.670> be<00:00:43.790> up<00:00:43.940> off<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.360> ground<00:00:44.480> so

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
them but they'll be up off the ground so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.270 
them but they'll be up off the ground so
we're<00:00:45.170> a<00:00:45.200> three<00:00:45.590> of<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.739> lot<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.040> problems

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280

we're a three of a lot of the problems
with<00:00:46.670> rod<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.180> rodents<00:00:47.630> and<00:00:47.750> stuff<00:00:48.050> like<00:00:48.200> that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
with rod and rodents and stuff like that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.410 
with rod and rodents and stuff like that
it's<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.100> really<00:00:49.250> great<00:00:49.430> thing<00:00:49.670> for<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.149> the

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's a really great thing for that the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.290 
it's a really great thing for that the
taller<00:00:50.660> heirloom<00:00:51.110> tomatoes<00:00:51.760> we've<00:00:52.760> got<00:00:52.940> here

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
taller heirloom tomatoes we've got here

taller heirloom tomatoes we've got here
one<00:00:54.079> tomato<00:00:54.350> /<00:00:54.680> TP<00:00:54.980> TP<00:00:55.250> s<00:00:55.430> is<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.700> way<00:00:55.790> I<00:00:55.820> used

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
one tomato / TP TP s is the way I used

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.760 
one tomato / TP TP s is the way I used
to<00:00:56.180> do<00:00:56.329> it<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.510> Vermont<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.079> I<00:00:57.320> used<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.590> put

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
to do it in Vermont and I used to put

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.549 
to do it in Vermont and I used to put
one<00:00:58.640> plant<00:00:59.120> on<00:00:59.360> each<00:00:59.660> leg<00:00:59.930> because<00:01:00.200> the<00:01:00.290> plants

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
one plant on each leg because the plants

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.380 
one plant on each leg because the plants
never<00:01:00.770> got<00:01:00.950> that<00:01:01.100> big<00:01:01.160> now<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.030> only<00:01:02.210> one

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
never got that big now the only one

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.630 
never got that big now the only one
we're<00:01:02.540> doing<00:01:02.750> that<00:01:02.899> way<00:01:03.050> now<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:04.369> early

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
we're doing that way now is the early

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.370 
we're doing that way now is the early
girls<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:05.300> we<00:01:05.420> want<00:01:05.630> for<00:01:05.810> our<00:01:05.899> very<00:01:06.080> first

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
girls that we want for our very first

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.719 
girls that we want for our very first
tomatoes<00:01:06.800> and<00:01:07.009> that's<00:01:07.250> because<00:01:07.430> we're

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
tomatoes and that's because we're

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.120 
tomatoes and that's because we're
pruning<00:01:08.119> them<00:01:08.240> off<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.200> single<00:01:09.590> stem<00:01:09.800> to

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
pruning them off to a single stem to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.249 
pruning them off to a single stem to
make<00:01:10.280> them<00:01:10.430> bare<00:01:10.610> sooner<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.210> we're<00:01:11.869> doing

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
make them bare sooner and we're doing

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.840 
make them bare sooner and we're doing
pretty<00:01:12.410> well<00:01:12.500> we've<00:01:12.830> got<00:01:13.009> a<00:01:13.039> lot<00:01:13.310> of<00:01:13.340> good<00:01:13.610> big

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
pretty well we've got a lot of good big

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.399 
pretty well we've got a lot of good big
clusters<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.300> tomatoes<00:01:14.780> on<00:01:14.930> there<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:15.170> are

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
clusters of tomatoes on there that are

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.289 
clusters of tomatoes on there that are
there<00:01:15.860> almost<00:01:16.190> full<00:01:16.580> size<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.060> they're<00:01:17.150> ready

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
there almost full size and they're ready

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.850 
there almost full size and they're ready
to<00:01:17.360> start<00:01:17.630> ripening<00:01:18.049> probably<00:01:18.440> another<00:01:18.619> three

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
to start ripening probably another three

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.280 
to start ripening probably another three
weeks<00:01:18.890> we'll<00:01:19.250> have<00:01:19.369> ripe<00:01:19.520> tomatoes<00:01:20.140> but<00:01:21.140> I'm

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
weeks we'll have ripe tomatoes but I'm

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.500 
weeks we'll have ripe tomatoes but I'm
experimenting<00:01:22.630> I'm<00:01:23.630> experimenting<00:01:24.080> now<00:01:24.530> with

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
experimenting I'm experimenting now with

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.120 
experimenting I'm experimenting now with
different<00:01:26.510> ways<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.900> trellising<00:01:27.799> tomatoes

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
different ways of trellising tomatoes

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.230 
different ways of trellising tomatoes
that<00:01:28.159> are<00:01:28.310> more<00:01:28.460> appropriate<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:29.150> the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
that are more appropriate to the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.260 
that are more appropriate to the
mid-atlantic<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:30.130> one<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.340> these<00:01:31.520> cages<00:01:31.820> that

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
mid-atlantic and one is these cages that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.820 
mid-atlantic and one is these cages that
I<00:01:32.930> got<00:01:33.320> at<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.520> building<00:01:35.299> supply<00:01:35.540> store<00:01:35.869> their

I got at the building supply store their

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.060 
I got at the building supply store their
concrete<00:01:37.159> reinforcing<00:01:37.729> wire<00:01:38.030> they<00:01:38.960> cost<00:01:39.260> six

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
concrete reinforcing wire they cost six

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.370 
concrete reinforcing wire they cost six
dollars<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.520> fifty<00:01:40.700> cents<00:01:40.909> apiece<00:01:41.380> they're

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
dollars and fifty cents apiece they're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.200 
dollars and fifty cents apiece they're

flat I fold them around like this put

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.700 
flat I fold them around like this put
them<00:01:44.299> together<00:01:44.420> with<00:01:44.720> cable<00:01:45.049> ties<00:01:45.229> that<00:01:45.439> I<00:01:45.560> got

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.510 
bamboo to stabilize the row an
occasional<00:01:50.450> piece<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:51.140> rebar<00:01:51.380> at<00:01:51.770> two<00:01:52.220> dollars

occasional piece of rebar at two dollars

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.810 
occasional piece of rebar at two dollars
each<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.950> know<00:01:55.040> we're<00:01:55.280> putting<00:01:55.520> them<00:01:55.640> on

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
each and you know we're putting them on

three<00:01:56.119> foot<00:01:56.299> centers<00:01:56.630> six<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.710> bed<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.479> I'm

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
three foot centers six to a bed and I'm

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.569 
three foot centers six to a bed and I'm
convinced<00:02:00.290> how<00:02:00.680> only<00:02:00.829> would<00:02:01.070> they<00:02:01.159> fill<00:02:01.430> these

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
convinced how only would they fill these

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.069 
convinced how only would they fill these
gauges<00:02:01.820> they're<00:02:02.450> probably<00:02:02.600> going<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.960> come

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
gauges they're probably going to come

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.040 
gauges they're probably going to come
way<00:02:03.290> out<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.590> top<00:02:03.799> of<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.040> cages<00:02:04.400> which

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
way out the top of the cages which

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.330 
way out the top of the cages which
it's<00:02:06.050> just<00:02:06.230> the<00:02:06.320> biggest<00:02:06.470> piece<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:06.980> could<00:02:07.160> get

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
it's just the biggest piece I could get

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.600 
it's just the biggest piece I could get
without<00:02:07.460> getting<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.910> roll<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.390> roll<00:02:09.400> $150<00:02:10.400> I

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
without getting a roll and roll $150 I

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.520 
without getting a roll and roll $150 I
didn't<00:02:10.820> really<00:02:10.940> want<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.150> go<00:02:11.210> there<00:02:11.540> now<00:02:12.320> one

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
didn't really want to go there now one

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.780 
didn't really want to go there now one
of<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> tricks<00:02:13.100> with<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> tomatoes<00:02:13.700> of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
of the tricks with the tomatoes of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.550 
of the tricks with the tomatoes of
course<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.090> planting<00:02:14.810> we've<00:02:14.930> got<00:02:15.080> another<00:02:15.290> bed

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
course is planting we've got another bed

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.740 
course is planting we've got another bed
down<00:02:15.800> here<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.340> think<00:02:17.240> one<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> biggest

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
down here I think one of the biggest

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.350 
down here I think one of the biggest
mistakes<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.350> people<00:02:18.470> may<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:20.240> know

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
mistakes that people may you know

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.060 
mistakes that people may you know
growing<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.720> vegetable<00:02:20.870> garden<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.890> think

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
growing a vegetable garden is to think

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.680 
growing a vegetable garden is to think
they<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.280> plant<00:02:22.550> once<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.000> that's<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.330> we

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
they just plant once and that's it we

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.420 
they just plant once and that's it we
are<00:02:23.780> always<00:02:24.020> planting<00:02:24.680> new<00:02:24.830> stuff<00:02:25.100> all<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430

time and even tomatoes these tomatoes we

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.330 
time and even tomatoes these tomatoes we
just<00:02:29.660> put<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:29.930> we<00:02:30.080> came<00:02:30.560> up<00:02:30.590> with<00:02:30.830> an<00:02:30.920> open<00:02:31.190> bed

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
Gloria and I talked about what do we

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.720 
Gloria and I talked about what do we
want<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.350> grow<00:02:33.560> more<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.130> we<00:02:34.190> decided<00:02:34.430> more

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
want to grow more of and we decided more

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.630 
want to grow more of and we decided more
tomatoes<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:36.020> happen<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.350> have<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.920> couple

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
tomatoes and I happen to have a couple

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.400 
tomatoes and I happen to have a couple
each<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.240> three<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:38.810> my<00:02:38.960> old<00:02:39.140> favorite

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
each of three of my old favorite

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.980 
each of three of my old favorite
heirlooms<00:02:39.920> which<00:02:40.220> are<00:02:40.490> black<00:02:41.030> Cuban<00:02:41.570> black

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
heirlooms which are black Cuban black

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.620 
heirlooms which are black Cuban black
Ethiopian<00:02:42.710> and<00:02:42.830> big<00:02:43.160> rainbow<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.450> put

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
Ethiopian and big rainbow and so we put

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.020 
Ethiopian and big rainbow and so we put
them<00:02:44.720> out<00:02:44.840> even<00:02:45.830> though<00:02:45.920> drost<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.550> long<00:02:46.760> gone

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
them out even though drost is long gone

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.440 
them out even though drost is long gone
we<00:02:47.450> still<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:48.350> these<00:02:48.890> milk<00:02:49.490> jugs<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.150> the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
we still have these milk jugs and the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.360 
we still have these milk jugs and the
reason<00:02:50.750> now<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:50.930> because<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:51.800> have<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> squirrel

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
reason now is because we have a squirrel

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.280 
reason now is because we have a squirrel
that<00:02:52.640> came<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.360> started<00:02:53.570> nipping<00:02:53.960> off<00:02:54.050> our

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
that came and started nipping off our

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.260 
that came and started nipping off our
seedlings<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.310> we<00:02:55.490> just<00:02:55.640> put<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.970> over<00:02:56.150> here

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
seedlings so we just put this over here

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.610 
seedlings so we just put this over here
until<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.810> gets<00:02:56.990> big<00:02:57.170> enough<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.530> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
until it gets big enough that the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.930 
until it gets big enough that the
squirrel<00:02:57.830> isn't<00:02:57.920> interested<00:02:58.550> in<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.760> anymore

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
squirrel isn't interested in it anymore

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.870 
squirrel isn't interested in it anymore
and<00:02:59.240> as<00:03:00.170> soon<00:03:00.320> as<00:03:00.470> these<00:03:00.560> get<00:03:00.800> up<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.130> you

early<00:03:29.750> girl<00:03:29.900> doesn't<00:03:30.200> get<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.380> whole<00:03:30.440> lot

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
early girl doesn't get a whole lot

bigger<00:03:30.860> than<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.310> maybe<00:03:31.820> another<00:03:32.090> twenty

bigger than this maybe another twenty

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.420 
bigger than this maybe another twenty
percent<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.019> i<00:03:33.680> would<00:03:33.860> say<00:03:34.010> that<00:03:34.040> these<00:03:34.250> are

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
percent and i would say that these are

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.509 
percent and i would say that these are
about<00:03:34.519> three<00:03:34.910> weeks<00:03:35.060> away<00:03:35.269> from<00:03:35.390> ready<00:03:36.519> so
