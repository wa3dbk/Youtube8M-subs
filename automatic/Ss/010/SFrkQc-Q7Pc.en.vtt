00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
we're leaking pancake batter get the get

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.370 
we're leaking pancake batter get the get
the<00:02:11.430> batter<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:12.630> right<00:02:12.810> let's<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the batter all right let's get that in

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.530 
the batter all right let's get that in
there<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.260> little<00:02:16.470> thin<00:02:16.709> well<00:02:17.540> it's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
there it's a little thin well it's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.699 
there it's a little thin well it's
probably<00:02:18.810> going<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.989> be<00:02:19.049> like<00:02:19.260> more<00:02:19.440> like<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
probably going to be like more like a

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.740 
probably going to be like more like a
crepe<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.220> consistency<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.660> know

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
crepe like consistency but you know

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.000 
crepe like consistency but you know
we're<00:02:21.900> experimenting<00:02:22.290> we're<00:02:22.680> gonna<00:02:22.769> see

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
we're experimenting we're gonna see

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.030 
we're experimenting we're gonna see
where<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.250> ends<00:02:23.489> up<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.970> don't<00:02:24.599> know<00:02:24.780> um<00:02:25.170> so

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
where this ends up I don't know um so

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.100 
where this ends up I don't know um so
let's<00:02:26.190> put<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.489> down<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.569> let's<00:02:27.840> let<00:02:27.959> that

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
let's put that down and let's let that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.259 
let's put that down and let's let that
spin<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.519> take<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> minute<00:02:29.940> here<00:02:30.060> to

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
spin just going to take a minute here to

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.300 
spin just going to take a minute here to
let<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.510> pancake<00:02:30.989> cook<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.950> about<00:02:32.160> what

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
let that pancake cook think about what

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.520 
let that pancake cook think about what
