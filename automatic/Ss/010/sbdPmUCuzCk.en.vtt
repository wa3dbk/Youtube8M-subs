00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
render and see if we can bring it to

render and see if we can bring it to
life<00:01:37.820> Shenzhen<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.060> only<00:01:39.240> cared<00:01:39.630> about

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
render as possible which was just fine

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.389 
render as possible which was just fine
for<00:01:48.299> me<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.140> didn't<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
for me because I didn't really like the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
for me because I didn't really like the
back<00:01:50.579> half<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> render<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.840> didn't<00:01:52.110> seem

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
back half of the render just didn't seem

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.710 
back half of the render just didn't seem
very<00:01:52.470> balanced<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.280> front<00:01:53.520> half<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.600> it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
very balanced the front half so it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
very balanced the front half so it
allowed<00:01:54.960> me<00:01:55.140> some<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.590> creative<00:01:55.950> outlet<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
allowed me some of my creative outlet to

trout up here it was one of the things
that<00:02:12.030> vexed<00:02:12.390> me<00:02:12.510> about<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> design<00:02:13.170> was<00:02:13.440> how

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that vexed me about the design was how

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.640 
that vexed me about the design was how
to<00:02:13.650> get<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.190> shroud<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.940> there<00:02:15.780> without<00:02:15.990> ugly

kind<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.390> hit<00:02:21.540> me<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.840> easy<00:02:21.990> answer<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
kind of hit me the easy answer that the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.510 
kind of hit me the easy answer that the
artists<00:02:23.730> actually<00:02:24.030> provided<00:02:24.569> in<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.050> render

was<00:02:26.520> something<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.060> I've<00:02:27.450> used<00:02:27.840> several

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
was something that I I've used several

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.800 
was something that I I've used several

times in my own designs and loved was a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.840 
times in my own designs and loved was a

the groove and snaps in so it holds
