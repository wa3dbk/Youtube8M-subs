00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.800 
have them I guess because they you have
that<00:02:02.600> safety<00:02:03.009> so<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.100> well<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:04.850> got<00:02:05.090> if<00:02:05.360> I<00:02:05.450> can

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
that safety so I well I got if I can

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.770 
that safety so I well I got if I can
 up<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.320> can<00:02:06.530> drive<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.740> bit<00:02:06.979> bitchy<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.880> but

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
 up I can drive a bit bitchy it but

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.740 
 up I can drive a bit bitchy it but
when<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:08.929> have<00:02:09.200> none<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:10.000> wrote<00:02:11.000> one<00:02:11.180> left<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:11.660> if

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
when I have none I wrote one left so if

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.470 
when I have none I wrote one left so if
I<00:02:11.810> lose<00:02:12.020> this<00:02:12.050> one<00:02:12.319> you<00:02:12.470> see<00:02:13.060> when<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.090> have<00:02:14.239> none

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
I lose this one you see when I have none

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.410 
I lose this one you see when I have none
I<00:02:14.750> seem<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.440> focus<00:02:15.920> better<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.849> not<00:02:17.269> up
