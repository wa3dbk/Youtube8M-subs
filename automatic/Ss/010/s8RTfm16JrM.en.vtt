00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.600
 hello I am sergi arola although today I 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.660
 important is not the important day 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.930
 it's my two friends I'm going to 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.529
 present and the little screams disc of 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.150
 hysteria 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.770
 first of all we want to know if the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.259
 an international chef's dogs have 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.230
 the scoop of any of your recipes 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.240
 That led to the letter all think 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.350
 for example with with homers someone with 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.360
 very careful because it has many 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.239
 skin problems has many problems 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.700
 of hair then they have their I think and it's 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.340
 what they eat and today they are delighted with 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.899
 it is small and with a bit of the same rhyme 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.969
 the only thing that makes it look like ever 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.760
 unusual here at home when we do 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.160
 broth is q of it then what is left and all 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.230
 the meat let's say it has already been cooked 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.239
 avoid so we give it to you and it's a bit 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.300
 As your extra I do not have to admit that 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.929
 I put on enough milk when you see 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.020
 people who give their pets food of 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.370
 I love them and they are part of the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.260
 family 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.330
 but obviously there are certain 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.960
 things verging on obscenity and never 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.960
 I would fall on them 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.620
 is a harlista of own 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.420
 rita came because I had a my dog 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.729
 it was one was called Hindi and it was a jack 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.630
 russell I really like homework 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.490
 by character I'm pretty pretty 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.270
 when Hindi died scream came in to cover 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.270
 to the hole 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.200

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.110
 delighted with her also to purpose 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.940

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.490

 has seen you in a fantastic year there 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.860
 Sometimes I think a chair is happy 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.060
 that my children when I return from travel there 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.580
 Sometimes I get the feeling that it comes out 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.289
 record rita that my children srl if he did not have 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.240
 have to go around and around to find him 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.340
 a name to his terrier because he did not say it 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.840
 my children really I wanted to call him 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.489
 crisis because more will start with everything 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.980
 the joke this and I said good then 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.769
 we have a bitch called crisis and 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.680
 so we'll have a bitch crisis but not 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.970
 but in the end it did not prosper 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.920
 fortunately for her and yet 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.750
 Well, my daughters wanted to call her 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.459
 rita rita beta and it was already a challenge to 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.440
 retarda rita hayworth 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:38.040
 with these worlds , the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.040
 winter 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.330
 all right 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.099
 nor sarpei is 13 years old that in a sarpei 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.110
 it's like a hundred-odd gentleman who already 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.710
 He is a very old man and yet he 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.140
 keep as yes 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.410
 as if it were the first day we put him 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.200
 eat to eat basically by homer 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.730
 simpson tea very well very well really that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.590
 eating had a slightly special character 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.930
 and crazy sections and everything and from the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.870
 moment that we spent it the uncle already had 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.670
 less disease problems and less 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.140
 problems of character and with rita it 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.390
 They are great and I think the day 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.430
 what to eat then go away immediately 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.440
 we will have to look for a substitute because 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.680
 I can not imagine rita living or living 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.680
 alone 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.450
 a chef of the international stature of 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.950
 exerted arola does not stop traveling if there 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.800
 something missing when away 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.270
 of home are rides with rita and young 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.700
 I do not know if I would know how to get home in 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.990
 meet a dog when I 'm in 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.840
 trip for example if I'm going for a walk 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.090
 in paris or with sao paulo de santiago I'm going 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.740
 to take a walk I see a dog and I stay 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.560
 looking at it as well as saying with a 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.210
 little envy a little nostalgia 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.190
 I would never abandon them fundamentally 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.750
 because they are part of the family and one does not 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.180
 he abandons he does not abandon the people to the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.340
 family and achieve more in case it was not enough 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.380
 call rita and you know that rita is what 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.030
 given then you know that it is 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.010
 sergi arola would never abandon his 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.330
 dogs if you want to enjoy again 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.880

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.229

 and 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.419
 to
