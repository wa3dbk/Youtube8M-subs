 two france buses since eighteen 130 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:12.779
 hello everyone and welcome to the dvd of technical presentation of the 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.699
 mandolin we congratulate you on the purchase of this professional utensil 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.369
 and thank you for your trust chapter 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.449
 presentation of the mandolin and its various components 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.509
 here is the mandolin and its various components 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.050
 lalanne lice 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.329
 the blade answered yesterday the pen a julienne 9 of 10 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.310
 carriage 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.310
 and her evening husband 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 for direct use on worktop pillars both feet 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.240
 until they are blocked by the security fruits or vegetables 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.230
 can be received directly on the plan 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.580
 working or on a plate the back foot and when reversible 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.520
 it allows you by flipping it 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.940
 use on a container 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.590
 for our presentation 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.600
 we will put it back in its position 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.409
 initial initialization here is how to adjust the torque thickness using 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.840
 of the support plate 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.460
 after unlocking forensic who have located on the sides of the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.170
 mandolin you can adjust the height of the tray and therefore the thickness of 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.600
 costs the gripping area of ​​the hob or will facilitate this 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 manipulation in order to make this adjustment with useful precision 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.170
 it is the graduated ruler then shaved inside the amount then 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.159
 blocked the plate by tightening the dj 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.630
 expertise to define parallel pairs in order to achieve 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 washers or slices you have two horizontal blades 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.690
 we remind you that it's man are heavily used and so to 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.850
 the test out of the reach of children to handle with caution once 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.570
 the choice of couple life performed insert the blade like this since 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.549
 drag it to the peak of security if you want to perform 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.900
 a vertical section you have a julienne comb of 10 millimeters 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.860
 of gap between the blades this one still does not read in combination with the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.409
 blade here 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.280
 this attention they are also strongly he said he was 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.359
 important to take the pen and by the planned area like this 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.719
 insert the channel taking into account the notches located only at its two 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.739
 triangular ends and markers on the blade and the mandolin 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.459
 then lock them the site comece with the blocking bar 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.610
 here is the cart 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.750
 it slips on these two rails and thus guarantee driving for a 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.379
 regular and secure cut is in this receptacle 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.659
 that you will have food this pusher is polycarbonate 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.989
 In particular, it has 3088 food preservation units. 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.799
 and a spring guaranteeing a complete cut of the audi fruit 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.409
 vegetables after setting the mandolin according to the desired cut that 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.170
 steel produces it in the cart 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.080
 when you drive the night nail on the food to cut needles that 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.020
 penetrates prevent them from rolling in the spring of aftershocks a pressure 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.439
 constant 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.769
 you can then make your shots rain down with a simple motion 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.389
 back and forth the central rod of the pusher tells you the level of 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.479
 products remaining in the cart one can press these little games if the 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.379
 vegetable consistency petromont m 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.609
 chapter 2 the different cuts we will present different 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.140
 torque techniques achievable using the mandolin 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.659
 you'll see it appears to be highlighted at the bottom of your screen the 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.749
 differences between the ram the optional modules use when the 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:34.939
 demonstration 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.539
 to andelys of different thicknesses 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.539
 the militia 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.919
 julienne cut in boat nose 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.919
 jimmy remy of 10 millimeters 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.189
 embossed couple here are some tips to easily achieve 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.539
 perfect potato tea set this technique requires the use 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.039
 of death to judge at first adjust the cutting height at 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.709
 minimum it is rusted the plate in a second time after placing 

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:31.860
 the product in the trolley carried out a first movement 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.620
 pushing it downwards after pulling it backwards 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.159
 made a rotation of about quarter-turn like these and push 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.750
 the new puck towards the blade repeat this operation taking care 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.979
 to invite both these positions until the vegetables are 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.259
 fully cut 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.259
 Here's the result 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.360
 chapter 3 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360
 the options 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.659
 in option there are also three additional Julian themes with 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.110
 a spacing of 2 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.860
 4 and 7 millimeters 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.909
 for even more cutting choices 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.909
 here are some examples 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.680
 for fruits and vegetables do they have carrots 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.460
 zucchini 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.229
 where the big potatoes for free I'm ashamed 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.839
 we offer this water pusher 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.360
 it works on the same basis as the initial push 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.419
 chapter 4 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.559
 making a plate and teaching sliced ​​vegetables 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.529
 based on different techniques 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:35.419
 which were presented to you 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.490
 this presentation and made by a professional chef exclusively
