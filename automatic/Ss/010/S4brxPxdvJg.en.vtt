00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:11.030
 so hello today we are learning 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.009
 draw photoshop art from the type of such 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.010
 that is, that real will be about how to draw 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.010
 glowing red eyes 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:25.980
 blew artah take a photo any there 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.210
 then we find the eyes on her need them 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.210
 cut to another layer 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.880
 after it turned out not crooked 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.850
 get upset there it will be possible all this 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.460
 fix show how we take these first 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.260
 layers that are left to be joined 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.040
 and into the background and translate then here 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.809
 push blending options 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:09.790
 external glow do normal 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:13.259
 Black and here on the situation already look into 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.000
 first you need one hundred percent opacity 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:20.860
 a little bit here it is necessary to subtract 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.110
 slightly as little as vodka is possible 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.810
 if inaccurately done a little 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.020
 let's say you can add them a boat in one 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 pixel 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.439
 there inside the outside as you like 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.990
 should also like a little 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.430
 to soften all these ladders 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.380
 better it looked and then it means 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.000
 we take this here layer but not on it 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.030
 on top of the bottom we create a new make 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.310
 pupils get 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.630
 we select under the pupil there is size 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.909
 homeless and clear one hundred percent 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.030
 the size is well 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:09.869
 corks get there we take them 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.940
 first things like that when there 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.080
 why she is working out the devil 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.569
 glow 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.730
 because to look like 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.310
 really more truly eyes 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.170
 these are why you made this your 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:33.080
 Now we put the external glow on 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.080
 red so here 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.920
 about such settings there each 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.939
 in its own way, you can still internal 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.569
 glow but i don't usually do it 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:50.670
 fine so uart get eyes 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.700
 really interesting to take make 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.269
 just one layer on top here to draw 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.739
 his paint what that garbage then 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.470
 change here on screen here they will be like 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.720
 as if ok to shine later 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.840
 If you can hardly see the glow, we take this 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.970
 layer let's make it less brightness 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.849
 Polish contrast 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.980
 like the lower the brightness the better 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.209
 visible lighting 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.500
 the darker the photo too 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.470
 accordingly in obvious glow also 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.250
 who here is like everybody there 2 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.290
 tons for example 2 tons of photos 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.290
 to make we take make level 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.180
 so he makes then take correction both 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.220
 shines there all his 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.220
 it will complete these levels 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:07.950
 on the tank itself I like this 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.560
 not good too bad 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.010
 that's actually all the real how to do 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.010
 such roses 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.500
 then they get a course 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.500
 such ram read
