we<00:00:00.359> told<00:00:00.599> that<00:00:00.840> during<00:00:01.140> each<00:00:01.380> cycle<00:00:01.709> the

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
we told that during each cycle the

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.030 
we told that during each cycle the
engine<00:00:02.520> exposed<00:00:02.970> 10<00:00:03.360> kilo<00:00:03.720> Joule<00:00:04.040> exhaust

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
engine exposed 10 kilo Joule exhaust

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.120 
engine exposed 10 kilo Joule exhaust
energy<00:00:05.700> so<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.240> know<00:00:06.509> that<00:00:06.540> Q<00:00:08.330> see<00:00:10.070> how<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
energy so we know that Q see how the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:21.220 
energy so we know that Q see how the
engine<00:00:11.639> works<00:00:13.670> it<00:00:14.670> takes<00:00:16.460> it<00:00:17.460> takes<00:00:18.080> energy<00:00:19.430> qh

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
engine works it takes it takes energy qh

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.089 
engine works it takes it takes energy qh
from<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.410> hot<00:00:22.650> reservoir<00:00:24.289> it<00:00:25.289> does<00:00:25.560> work<00:00:26.599> w<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
from a hot reservoir it does work w and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.080 
from a hot reservoir it does work w and
it's<00:00:29.099> exposed<00:00:29.609> energy<00:00:30.570> QC<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> cold

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it's exposed energy QC to a cold

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.280 
it's exposed energy QC to a cold
reservoir<00:00:35.210> we<00:00:36.210> told<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.960> energy

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
reservoir we told that the energy

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.069 
reservoir we told that the energy
expelled<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> engine<00:00:38.790> exposed<00:00:39.510> 10

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
expelled that the engine exposed 10

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.459 
expelled that the engine exposed 10
kilojoules<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.219> QC<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> 10<00:00:42.780> killed<00:00:43.020> Jews<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
kilojoules so QC is 10 killed Jews that

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.400 
kilojoules so QC is 10 killed Jews that
is<00:00:43.590> 10<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> four<00:00:44.629> joules<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.899> kilo<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is 10 to the four joules a kilo is a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.510 
is 10 to the four joules a kilo is a
thousand<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.370> ten<00:00:47.579> thousand<00:00:48.000> Jews<00:00:49.520> we

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
thousand so that's ten thousand Jews we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.569 
thousand so that's ten thousand Jews we
want<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> find<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.390> energy<00:00:51.539> taken<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.579> during

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
want to find the energy taken in during

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
want to find the energy taken in during
each<00:00:53.850> cycle<00:00:55.039> remember<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:57.649> efficiency

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
each cycle remember that the efficiency

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.190 
each cycle remember that the efficiency
e<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.760> 1<00:01:00.680> minus<00:01:02.270> QC<00:01:03.799> /<00:01:04.799> qh<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> want<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> find

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
e is 1 minus QC / qh so I want to find

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.890 
e is 1 minus QC / qh so I want to find
the<00:01:07.350> energy<00:01:07.560> taken<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.150> qh<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the energy taken in that is qh so the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.350 
the energy taken in that is qh so the
question<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.350> yell<00:01:13.710> fine<00:01:14.630> 2h<00:01:16.939> knowing<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
question is yell fine 2h knowing the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
question is yell fine 2h knowing the
efficiency<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> link<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.189> so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
efficiency and the link you see so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
efficiency and the link you see so
that's<00:01:20.759> simple<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.200> means<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.820> QC<00:01:24.229> /<00:01:25.229> q

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that's simple so this means that QC / q

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:35.840 
that's simple so this means that QC / q
h<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:27.080> 1<00:01:28.080> minus<00:01:28.290> e<00:01:29.450> which<00:01:30.450> means<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.259> H<00:01:34.850> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
h is 1 minus e which means a to H is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.270 
h is 1 minus e which means a to H is
equal<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.329> Q<00:01:36.570> C<00:01:36.900> over<00:01:37.890> 1<00:01:38.100> minus<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.250> qh<00:01:42.799> q<00:01:43.799> c<00:01:44.040> is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
equal to Q C over 1 minus a so qh q c is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.410 
equal to Q C over 1 minus a so qh q c is
given<00:01:45.409> 10<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.619> 4<00:01:48.500> over<00:01:49.500> 1<00:01:49.530> minus<00:01:49.890> e<00:01:50.420> is

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
given 10 to the 4 over 1 minus e is

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.969 
given 10 to the 4 over 1 minus e is
twenty<00:01:52.079> percent<00:01:52.290> which<00:01:52.619> means<00:01:52.979> 0.2<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> this

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
twenty percent which means 0.2 so this

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.280 
twenty percent which means 0.2 so this
is<00:01:56.009> 10<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> 4<00:01:56.939> Jews<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.320> 0.8<00:02:00.049> which<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
is 10 to the 4 Jews of a 0.8 which is

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.249 
is 10 to the 4 Jews of a 0.8 which is
1.25<00:02:02.540> times<00:02:03.540> 10<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> 4<00:02:04.500> juice<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
1.25 times 10 to the 4 juice so this is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.030 
1.25 times 10 to the 4 juice so this is
the<00:02:08.509> energy<00:02:09.509> taken<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.050> during<00:02:10.890> each<00:02:11.099> cycle

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
the energy taken in during each cycle

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.539 
the energy taken in during each cycle
now<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.060> want<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> duration<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.170> cycle

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.970 

now<00:02:19.549> we're<00:02:20.060> given<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:21.230> power<00:02:21.439> we<00:02:21.739> haven't

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
now we're given the the power we haven't

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.369 
now we're given the the power we haven't
used<00:02:22.189> that<00:02:22.280> yet<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.329> power<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.750> think<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.170> was

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.089 

we<00:02:44.420> told<00:02:44.689> you<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.139> the<00:02:45.349> power<00:02:45.560> output<00:02:45.799> is<00:02:46.340> 10

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
we told you that the power output is 10

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:56.409 
we told you that the power output is 10
kilowatt<00:02:49.099> ok<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:53.239> this<00:02:53.359> is<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.810> work<00:02:54.169> /<00:02:55.419> the

so<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.599> 0.25<00:03:45.819> times<00:03:46.819> 10<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.389> 4<00:03:47.799> juice

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
so this is 0.25 times 10 to the 4 juice

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.129 
so this is 0.25 times 10 to the 4 juice
this<00:03:49.579> is<00:03:49.729> the<00:03:49.879> work<00:03:50.090> done<00:03:50.389> during<00:03:51.109> each<00:03:51.530> cycle

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
this is the work done during each cycle

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.819 
this is the work done during each cycle
so<00:03:54.139> if<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:55.549> time<00:03:55.819> for<00:03:56.329> each<00:03:57.079> cycle<00:03:57.889> is<00:03:58.069> delta<00:03:58.639> T

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
so if the time for each cycle is delta T

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:08.009 
so if the time for each cycle is delta T
then<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:01.069> power<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.189> work<00:04:05.919> during<00:04:06.919> or

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
then the power is just a work during or

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.650 
then the power is just a work during or
in<00:04:09.019> one<00:04:09.290> cycle<00:04:10.389> work<00:04:11.389> done

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:22.960 

in<00:04:15.950> one<00:04:16.950> cycle<00:04:19.610> /<00:04:20.610> the<00:04:21.510> duration<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.380> cycle

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
in one cycle / the duration of the cycle

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.520 
in one cycle / the duration of the cycle
then<00:04:23.970> that's<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.330> time<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.780> takes<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.170> do<00:04:25.380> this

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
then that's the time it takes to do this

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.090 
then that's the time it takes to do this
work<00:04:26.780> times<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.020> duration<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:31.680> cycle

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
work times the duration of the cycle

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.890 
work times the duration of the cycle
that's<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.520> power<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:38.090> 0.25<00:04:39.090> times<00:04:39.570> 10

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
that's a power so this is 0.25 times 10

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.100 
that's a power so this is 0.25 times 10
to<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.080> four<00:04:40.520> joules<00:04:41.930> divided<00:04:42.930> by<00:04:43.050> the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
to the four joules divided by the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.030 
to the four joules divided by the
duration<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.920> cycle<00:04:44.370> delta<00:04:44.850> T<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.830> delta<00:04:46.830> T

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
duration of the cycle delta T so delta T

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.950 
duration of the cycle delta T so delta T
is<00:04:48.410> 0.25<00:04:49.410> times<00:04:49.830> ten<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.370> fall<00:04:50.700> over<00:04:51.060> the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
is 0.25 times ten to the fall over the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.470 
is 0.25 times ten to the fall over the
power<00:04:53.000> which<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:54.270> 10<00:04:55.250> kilowatts<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.910> that's<00:04:57.150> 10

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
power which is 10 kilowatts so that's 10

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.760 
power which is 10 kilowatts so that's 10
to<00:04:58.380> power<00:04:58.590> for<00:04:59.210> 10,000<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:01.170> it's<00:05:01.790> 0.25<00:05:02.790> seconds

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
to power for 10,000 so it's 0.25 seconds

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.390 
to power for 10,000 so it's 0.25 seconds
that's<00:05:05.150> duration<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.420> the<00:05:06.660> side<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:06.960> is

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
that's duration of the side that is

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.440 
that's duration of the side that is
every<00:05:08.400> cycle<00:05:08.790> last<00:05:09.030> one<00:05:09.780> quarter<00:05:10.260> of<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.470> second

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
every cycle last one quarter of a second

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.060 
every cycle last one quarter of a second
during<00:05:12.450> each<00:05:12.750> cycle<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.830> work<00:05:14.040> done<00:05:14.370> is<00:05:16.070> 0.25

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
during each cycle the work done is 0.25

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.340 
during each cycle the work done is 0.25
times<00:05:17.430> 10<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.910> four<00:05:18.180> joules<00:05:18.540> so<00:05:19.200> what<00:05:19.320> is

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
times 10 to the four joules so what is

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.380 
times 10 to the four joules so what is
the<00:05:19.560> power<00:05:19.800> output<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:22.110> work<00:05:22.320> /<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:24.150> time

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
the power output the work / the time

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.360 
the power output the work / the time
which<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:24.870> indeed<00:05:25.320> than<00:05:25.590> 10<00:05:26.360> kilowatts
