00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 Welcome to him 

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.950
 football fans here back to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.390
 Team presentation from my teams, yes, how 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.799
 Some of you wanted to see that 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.469
 i already have my russia for him 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.170
 shown in the other video now my 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.509
 portuguese team there we catch too 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.720
 then go directly into the gate then for rui 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.460
 Patrício is a very solid goalkeeper 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.990
 that's what I'm for 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.930
 actually only such a small budget 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.060
 had and yes I have it several times 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.439
 I said the players I bought all 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 as the game just came out so 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 Do not be surprised about the prices or 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.050
 that I am here only sun so one 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 doll the team has but that they 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.380
 nevertheless players with whom one stops too 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.760
 So winning games can rui patrício 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.550
 definitely a very good goalkeeper 1 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:48.300
 90 tall 85 real 82 repulsion 82 reflexes 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.539
 79 positioning 45 tempo is not now 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.010
 he still holds the burner 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.309
 actually everything on his box 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.770
 So at least there is a lot on the back right 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.120
 we have silvio 170 so big 4 stars 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.979
 two weak feet make the barbecue 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.610
 Unfortunately, only needs 870 tempo 73 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 defense 72 header are very 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.250
 solid values ​​for a right 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.150
 Defender could do with the values 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.900
 actually play in midfield as well 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.159
 above all things as 76er evaluation is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 Definitely recommended 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.530
 internal defenses paulo vinicius 186 3 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.710
 star weak foot two points of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.509
 Occupational now not exhilarating 65 paces 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.930
 is also rather average but 80 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.520
 defense and 84 header 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.009
 He already has a lot out there, yes 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.450
 with him in the central defense maicon 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.630
 micron baroque 191 3 stars weaker 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.979
 foot two stars s kix special movement 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.950
 62 defense 62 pace also as I said 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.570
 not the fastest but is okay 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 as long as you are reasonable behind and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.729
 does not run straight ahead 80 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.619
 Defense 83 header with 1 91 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.290
 Do not you have any back there? 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.379
 problems with the header at least in the back 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.130
 on the left we have alexander alexandrow 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.250
 logo silva 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.870
 82 speed 79 defense 860 75 88 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.520
 dribbling there are also the values 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.910
 actually fit into midfield 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.010
 for the left midfielder he is 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.300
 now, however, left-back two 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.180
 stars weak foot unfortunately only three 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.570
 stars special moves is on everyone 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.700
 case okay on this position yes 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.990
 in central defensive midfield 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.140
 we fernando 183 2 star skill moves 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.450
 two stars weak foot 69 pace too 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.880
 again not the fastest but that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.470
 is indeed in fifa 14 is not 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.800
 Speed ​​not only looks case 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.420
 but here also just superiority 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.920
 ball possession fit and other 83 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.270
 defense 73 header 71 treble 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.550
 is definitely a rock solid 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:10.190
 defensive midfielder on the right 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.130
 right middlefield eduardo salvio edwin 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.380
 salvio also called by me 1 1 70 is 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.490
 a small four-digit moves three 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.220
 star weak foot 88 tempo 84 374 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.840
 bullet-fit 470 is definitely 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.370
 wing flitzer and that can also a lot 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.450
 give to ball yes have left there 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.670
 varela eve motionless carlos varela 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.640
 179 is big the little man four stars 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.340
 weak foot 4 star skill moves 84 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.000
 tempo 280 dribbling 75 lap 170 fit 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.610
 Definitely values ​​with which you 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.610
 can provide a good deal of excitement 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.550
 in front of the rhine with the special 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.690
 movements and he is also very agile and 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.010
 look at the price so I have that 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.880
 bought for 350 calls 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.750
 that is really nothing then central 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.730
 offensively with quintero four points of the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.459
 unfortunately only two stars weaker 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.600
 foot but that's all so wild 169 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.669
 It's just big, but it's real 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.560
 I find very good values for one 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.450
 central offensive midfield man the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.490
 you just have to distribute the balls 75 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.680
 tempo fully sufficient for him 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.100
 70 74 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.210
 almost 84 dribbling and the defensive and 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.330
 defend your head once 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:35.050
 outside shape is definitely his 600th 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.940
 limit yes and in the storm we have on 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.979
 the left side jackson martinez 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.780
 you should know in any case 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.090
 a grenade from the fc porto four stalls 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.660
 weak foot 4 star skill moves 82 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:53.830
 tempo 75 shot 86 header 78 dribbling 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:57.759
 the guy is really a grenade yes and 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:02.440
 storm partner on his side da marcel 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:04.660
 lopez 84 pace 79 header 80 dribbling 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.229
 72 also shot four booths ski needs a lot 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:12.389
 stronger foot 18 goals in 20 play three 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:17.620
 give templates so you can live with 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:20.620
 188 very big so in front really 185 18 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.380
 makes itself neat criminals yes 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.849
 i have my belgium on replacement bank 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.970
 team what I then in the next video 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.080
 and then I would say that 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.270
 It was definitely from this time 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.860
 makes good looking with wife and 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.940
 girls and in fact nice and warm 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.940
 that the things do not decrease
