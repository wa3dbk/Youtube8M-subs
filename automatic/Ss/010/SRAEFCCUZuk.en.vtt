00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
a tactic here why can't you just track

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.260 
a tactic here why can't you just track

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it and it's trapped but just loaded this

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
it and it's trapped but just loaded this
nights<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.699> first<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.149> take<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> nut<00:01:03.080> yeah

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.620 
nights here first so take the nut yeah
yeah<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.369> mind<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.180> he<00:01:06.360> does<00:01:06.510> he

yeah I want that in mind but he does he
if<00:01:06.930> he<00:01:07.020> does<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.200> he<00:01:07.439> loses<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.770> whole<00:01:07.950> piece

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.830 

C<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> then<00:01:12.090> then<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.330> would<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> move

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
C and then then I would have to move

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.480 
C and then then I would have to move
anyway<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.210> um<00:01:15.600> yeah<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.979> would<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.159> been<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
anyway so um yeah that would have been a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.470 
anyway so um yeah that would have been a
chance<00:01:17.759> also

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.160 

take<00:01:22.750> stakes

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.080 

yeah<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:28.189> now<00:01:28.400> you<00:01:28.610> could<00:01:28.880> have<00:01:28.970> just

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
yeah so that now you could have just

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.170 
yeah so that now you could have just
taken<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.600> night<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.200> then<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:30.680> should<00:01:30.860> hear

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
taken that night and then we should hear

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.210 
taken that night and then we should hear
that<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.990> get<00:01:34.360> when<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.450> see<00:01:35.600> somebody

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
that so you get when you see somebody

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.859 
that so you get when you see somebody
one<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.310> their<00:01:37.430> pieces<00:01:37.640> has<00:01:37.909> very<00:01:38.180> reduced

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
one of their pieces has very reduced

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.800 
one of their pieces has very reduced
mobility<00:01:39.580> like<00:01:40.580> that<00:01:40.759> rule<00:01:40.939> do<00:01:41.149> you<00:01:41.270> think<00:01:41.450> how

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
mobility like that rule do you think how

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.050 
mobility like that rule do you think how
do<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:41.930> scenario<00:01:42.409> how<00:01:42.979> do<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:47.200> trap<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.280> will

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
do I scenario how do I trap it so will

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.969 
do I scenario how do I trap it so will
be<00:01:50.270> eight<00:01:50.450> okay<00:01:53.110> that's<00:01:54.110> not<00:01:54.409> too<00:01:54.470> bad<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
be eight okay that's not too bad the

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.630 
be eight okay that's not too bad the
putting<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> roof<00:01:55.789> on<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.000> open<00:01:56.240> line<00:01:57.640> ok

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
putting the roof on the open line ok

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.130 
putting the roof on the open line ok
text<00:01:59.360> takes<00:01:59.810> now<00:02:00.130> see<00:02:01.569> ok<00:02:02.569> so<00:02:02.630> now<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:02.929> can

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
text takes now see ok so now you can

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.109 
text takes now see ok so now you can
still<00:02:03.440> do<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.590> idea<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.280> trapping<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.759> let's

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
still do that idea of trapping it let's

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.749 
still do that idea of trapping it let's
see<00:02:05.299> if<00:02:05.390> that's<00:02:05.539> what<00:02:05.659> you<00:02:05.750> do<00:02:06.460> now<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.490> ain't

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
see if that's what you do now you ain't

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.650 
see if that's what you do now you ain't
Queen<00:02:08.060> here<00:02:09.700> there<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.729> wouldn't<00:02:11.150> do<00:02:11.630> that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
Queen here there I wouldn't do that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.300 
Queen here there I wouldn't do that
especially<00:02:11.989> he<00:02:12.769> is<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.519> will<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.000> porn<00:02:14.330> up

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
especially he is I will see you porn up

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.949 
especially he is I will see you porn up
I'm<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.730> should<00:02:17.120> really<00:02:17.360> be<00:02:17.600> wanting<00:02:17.720> to

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
I'm so you should really be wanting to

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.320 
I'm so you should really be wanting to
attack<00:02:18.290> his<00:02:18.500> King<00:02:18.799> in<00:02:19.549> this<00:02:19.670> position<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.269> you

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
attack his King in this position and you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.620 
attack his King in this position and you
shouldn't<00:02:20.540> be<00:02:20.750> allowing<00:02:21.350> him<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.620> swap<00:02:21.860> Queens

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
shouldn't be allowing him to swap Queens

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.370 
shouldn't be allowing him to swap Queens
because<00:02:23.630> if<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.840> swap<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.080> Queen's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
because if you swap the Queen's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.520 
because if you swap the Queen's
basically<00:02:24.830> he's<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.370> game<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.700> corner

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
basically he's in it in game of corner

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.080 
basically he's in it in game of corner
so<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.830> would<00:02:28.040> be<00:02:28.160> trying<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.519> get<00:02:28.670> an<00:02:28.790> attack<00:02:29.060> on

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
so I would be trying to get an attack on

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.610 
so I would be trying to get an attack on
his<00:02:29.299> King<00:02:29.540> started<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.079> hadn't<00:02:33.410> seen

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
his King started so if I hadn't seen

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.979 
his King started so if I hadn't seen
this<00:02:33.799> other<00:02:34.250> idea<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.390> was<00:02:35.510> black<00:02:35.750> actually

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
this other idea if I was black actually

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.900 
this other idea if I was black actually
I<00:02:36.170> was<00:02:36.350> fought<00:02:36.560> Queens<00:02:36.799> takes<00:02:37.130> then<00:02:37.459> he'd<00:02:37.670> take

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
I was fought Queens takes then he'd take

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.759 
I was fought Queens takes then he'd take
then<00:02:38.180> I'd<00:02:38.269> we<00:02:38.570> should<00:02:38.720> hear<00:02:38.930> trapping<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
then I'd we should hear trapping the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.910 
then I'd we should hear trapping the
rook<00:02:39.920> alright<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.390> um<00:02:41.630> if<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.709> option

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
rook alright but um if that option

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.440 
rook alright but um if that option
wasn't<00:02:43.280> available<00:02:43.579> I<00:02:43.940> would<00:02:44.000> be<00:02:44.180> trying<00:02:44.299> to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
wasn't available I would be trying to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.970 
wasn't available I would be trying to
attack<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.930> White<00:02:45.140> King<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.620> go<00:02:45.799> for

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
attack the White King so I go for

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.060 
attack the White King so I go for
between<00:02:46.130> here<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.720> he<00:02:48.170> would<00:02:48.320> do<00:02:48.500> some<00:02:48.829> move

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
between here and he would do some move

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.210 
between here and he would do some move
anything<00:02:49.430> here<00:02:49.820> then<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.780> go<00:02:50.930> from<00:02:51.109> here<00:02:51.380> see

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
anything here then I go from here see

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.949 
anything here then I go from here see
then<00:02:52.400> I'd<00:02:52.850> be<00:02:53.000> studying<00:02:53.359> getting<00:02:53.630> ready<00:02:53.810> to

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
then I'd be studying getting ready to

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.180 
then I'd be studying getting ready to
try<00:02:54.109> and<00:02:54.170> attack<00:02:54.440> obviously<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.980> night's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
still protecting but I'm gonna try and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.910 
still protecting but I'm gonna try and
bring<00:02:57.410> Peters<00:02:57.799> around<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.430> help<00:02:59.739> attack<00:03:00.739> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
king and then meanwhile i can still

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.740 
king and then meanwhile i can still
oppose<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.010> open<00:03:04.280> file<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:07.750> especially

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
oppose the open file and especially

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.710 
oppose the open file and especially
since<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.920> black<00:03:10.609> and<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.359> black<00:03:11.480> white

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
since the black and the black white

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.720 
since the black and the black white
squared<00:03:11.989> bishop<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.470> unopposed<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.299> is

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
squared bishop is unopposed this this is

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.180 
squared bishop is unopposed this this is
pretty<00:03:16.730> good<00:03:16.940> like<00:03:17.980> something<00:03:18.980> about

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
pretty good like something about

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.039 
pretty good like something about
opposite<00:03:19.940> colored<00:03:20.209> bishops<00:03:20.540> because<00:03:20.750> he<00:03:20.870> has

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
opposite colored bishops because he has

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.009 
opposite colored bishops because he has
a<00:03:22.060> bishop<00:03:23.060> on<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> black<00:03:23.420> spur<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.959> a

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
a bishop on a black spur you have a

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.840 
a bishop on a black spur you have a
bishop<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.319> a<00:03:24.350> white<00:03:24.560> square<00:03:24.709> in<00:03:25.280> end<00:03:25.609> games

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
bishop on a white square in end games

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.400 
bishop on a white square in end games
when<00:03:26.150> there's<00:03:26.299> only<00:03:26.480> those<00:03:26.720> bishops<00:03:27.079> usually

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
when there's only those bishops usually

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.680 
when there's only those bishops usually
that's<00:03:27.590> very<00:03:28.430> very<00:03:28.609> high<00:03:28.880> probability<00:03:29.209> of

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
that's very very high probability of

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.379 
that's very very high probability of
being<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:30.019> draw<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:31.880> middle<00:03:32.180> games

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
being a draw but but in middle games

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.539 
being a draw but but in middle games
when<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.870> screams<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.440> other<00:03:34.040> minor<00:03:34.310> pieces

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
when the screams and other minor pieces

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.440 
when the screams and other minor pieces
in

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
in

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.650 
in
on<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.599> board<00:03:35.810> it's<00:03:36.530> actually<00:03:36.920> very

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
on the board it's actually very

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.970 
on the board it's actually very
dangerous<00:03:38.660> if<00:03:39.170> there's<00:03:39.440> opposite<00:03:39.800> color

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
dangerous if there's opposite color

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.890 
dangerous if there's opposite color
bishops<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.519> whoever<00:03:41.180> usually<00:03:41.599> gets<00:03:41.810> an

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
bishops and whoever usually gets an

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.839 
bishops and whoever usually gets an
attack<00:03:42.170> on<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.440> king<00:03:42.680> will<00:03:43.370> break<00:03:43.610> through

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
attack on the king will break through

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.360 
attack on the king will break through
because<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:45.470> can<00:03:45.650> use<00:03:45.800> all<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.040> your<00:03:46.069> pieces

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
because you can use all of your pieces

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.369 
because you can use all of your pieces
to<00:03:46.760> attack<00:03:47.120> one<00:03:47.360> color<00:03:47.599> and<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.930> can't<00:03:48.140> use

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
to attack one color and you can't use

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.259 
to attack one color and you can't use
that<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.370> Bishop<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.849> defend<00:03:50.180> that

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
that and that Bishop to defend that

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.059 
that and that Bishop to defend that
color<00:03:50.510> put<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.870> on<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.050> opposite<00:03:51.349> color<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:52.910> um

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
color put it on the opposite color so um

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.850 
color put it on the opposite color so um
yeah<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.099> would<00:03:55.400> have<00:03:55.489> been<00:03:55.610> trying<00:03:55.849> to

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
yeah I would have been trying to

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.760 
yeah I would have been trying to
organize<00:03:57.860> an<00:03:57.980> attack<00:03:58.099> on<00:03:58.280> his<00:03:58.519> key
