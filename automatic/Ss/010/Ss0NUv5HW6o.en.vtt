00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.140
 Kurt Beck Herbert he has Benedict XVI 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.610
 Ben Pater r 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.669
 and 10 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.470
 it's incredibly fun so the amplified 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 I am mature Schmitz I can not promise here in this film 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.599
 they speak to the wrong because parents speak for the yes that gives only way 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.180
 Noisy is wondering why you do that which no one so exactly 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.609
 but she wants to talk or 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.949
 but not otherwise 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.650
 that is not very clear but he's getting louder and louder 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.650
 but quite good or do so called 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.040
 this with charm and humor 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.960
 the whole time 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.930
 The whole thing is incredibly exciting and the biggest nonsense 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.120
 just tried it 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.389
 and there he is that this is the bright spot this is me red 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:52.690
 he's not at the top what he does not make a great position 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.840
 a key the key figure in this movie why 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.300
 he is the mediator between the worlds 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.160
 it's okay and dreaming 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.380
 when children dream 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.260
 then they glide over another way 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.600
 and maybe monsters are waiting for evil monsters but they can only live on it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.400
 and can grow bigger if the children are afraid of them Nikola no 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.030
 Would have been afraid 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.610
 if the whole thing is not about problems, we will not get any 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.470
 no violence is not given and this little one is no longer and 77 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.840
 percent 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.450
 they can no longer take care of it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.600
 therefore that has 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.100
 writing has betrayed me but now ask 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.939
 he helps 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.430
 in view because that does not think 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.450
 IPIC 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.520
 if it has to continue 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.000
 quite vacant to the mother 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.800
 if I continue 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.720
 he could actually go back to work 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.710
 Track is underlined 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.140
 So the roads were brought to victory 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 Paulo Bento 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.250
 No 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.510
 PÃ¶lten 7 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.250
 f 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.810
 in Beijing with Wittlich ddp the 11th 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.530
 with flowers we would have to win one today in the squad 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.279
 hectoliters 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.249
 it will be good that the end of Janka
