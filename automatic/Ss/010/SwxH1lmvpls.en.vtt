00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.089
 I'm have on the iwa in Nuremberg 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.099
 you met the alex and he shows off 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.110
 his extensive lamps collection 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.580
 a series together succeeded the idea 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.230
 lamp the firefox ff 3 we have here 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.770
 once the firefox that the third 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.330
 version was in small edition so to speak 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:28.560
 had produced 40 watt cd burner 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.430
 will be 4000 jews then here is the once 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.500
 akkupack for four batteries i have now 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.969
 her from panasonic the three ones 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 taken the unprotected I have that 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.680
 Whole time to run with the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.570
 white solar post that went 67 minutes 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.190
 good but then you could span 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.600
 Do not refill 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.890
 because the tension in the race is faster 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.590
 to have reacted the special it stops 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.239
 at 40 watts, the small size so the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 has the 40 watt level and should be the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.850
 lamps overheat that happens 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.559
 about after 78 minutes in the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.500
 closed room usually to 24 degrees 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 I have the front down 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 screwed on then you can too 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.869
 realize that the entire electronics was 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 they are installed laterally around the reflector 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.600
 So it was definitely one too 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.500
 I still work in that area 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.500
 did not see last year 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 if you turn it on, it shines in the back 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.190
 the switch and when the voltage 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.470
 it gets lower then it starts 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.420
 blink and I believe at 10 5 volts 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.470
 Stress does not make that anyway 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.790
 not occurring even unprotected he 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.460
 the skylight does not quite do it that way 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.550
 strongly focused as well as polarion 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.100
 is a bit of a tide to warm 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.090
 At first , therefore, always looked cold 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.729
 learned 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.829
 the light temperature up to 4300 kevin 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.350
 stated a bit slower than 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.119
 the exact polarion does not drive 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.819
 very fast maybe up to 25 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.479
 seconds and lynx value in the middle 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:57.650
 I measured about 100,800,000 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:00.980
 polarion i believe 500,000 and 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.610
 wisdom makes beautiful wide 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.610
 uniform 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.700
 for the big one I also recognize at the moment 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.360
 Not 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.360
 needs more 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.480
 all right for me
