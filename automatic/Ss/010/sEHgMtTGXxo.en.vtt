00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
 friends of puppies and ccoo are today I'm going 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.780
 to teach 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.360
 that your dog does at home yes 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 but that does not feel of the place with a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.910
 very simple way to do it and how 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.090
 treat the mushrooms at home so good what 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.530
 first is 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.910
 with a vinegar so it can be use 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:32.180
 of the parcel that is with alcohol that is 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.280
 very good vinegar yes because this one you put it 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.270
 with a cotton in the part that has 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.790
 mushrooms and it works for you so it works 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.739
 truth and the weeks you have to put 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.520
 five days two weeks a week 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.580
 and it rises and if good and for the eyes 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.180
 You can also use this campus which is 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:57.470
 very good that the new one if with 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.410
 never cola tar and unfriendly by 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.989
 that has a mean smell half freaky 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.360
 but it's very good and the cheapest of the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.080
 market because it's very good it comes out 25 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.030
 weights in the canteens and good has to 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.070
 have this mark on all the things that 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.380
 buy and it's very important that you have 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.810
 this mark which means that it can be 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.150
 used for dogs for cats and for 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.680
 babies that is for dogs for cats 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.380
 clear babies 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 good when you are going to give water that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.660
 you have to give half the glass of water 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.530
 I already have the glass of water so half 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.650
 of the glass of water and also you have to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.650
 give 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.250
 skim milk and 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.990
 and skim milk and can milk 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.439
 skimmed also to the same half of the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.680
 glass that we put water and boiled chicken 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.320
 with rice once a week without a 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.740
 only once a week if they do not eat rice 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.140
 you can put those soup cubes that 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.310
 the rice is put in the soup like that 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.860
 they will be very rich for you 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.369
 also if you like it like that but not and if 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.220
 good is little salt and they also have to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.370
 Mix pumpkin with potatoes and mash 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.460
 mix or thing with chicken and that's how they make me 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.510
 richer and good for the dog 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.890
 good thing else is that this food 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.220
 balanced that we have here well not me 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.760
 agreement a brand that contains oil 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.560
 vegetable is this single food that makes 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.890
 bad to the intestine yes to the dog 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.470
 and so I just recommend that you do not get 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.870
 this without 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.820
 and then we have another one that provokes 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.030
 diarrhea that I do not know either of which brand 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.040
 it was if I do not remember but because of what 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.030
 diarrhea that is a little bone of I do not know what 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.300
 Mark was good causes dog diarrhea 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.000

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.280
 join what the dog does with a little stick 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.960
 I have one of these palettes that I 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.000
 they came out very cheap 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.410
 I think seven pesos in Argentina are 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.950
 than to pick up the dog poop 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.750
 when he does if anywhere is 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.560
 Very economical and apart they can be hung 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.440
 anywhere and well this is for 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.040
