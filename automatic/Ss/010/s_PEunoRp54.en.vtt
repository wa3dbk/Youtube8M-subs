00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.590
 yes that myself from hello and today we 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.250
 tell you one very interesting 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.740
 a chip that I think many people knew but not 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.050
 just just didn't think about it in 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 general today with a guest game you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.420
 will tell about this phishing in detail and all 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.680
 explain and show what you can begin 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.360
 in general, everyone knows that with mako develop 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.900
 only when approaching an enemy hero 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.350
 and armpit no true sight nothing 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.290
 can't pierce through with mako and 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.250
 actually therefore me pushed on 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.730
 thought this action went trumpet 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 oh my god what are these magicians so 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.500
 level one crush the fountain of the enemy 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 Yes, that is, when Fahrion can be here and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.329
 courier to fall and that is enough 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.120
 useful trick of course I am more 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.520
 than sure afterwards we all knew bla 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.200
 blah blah and i'm actually from grub to me 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.970
 told the chip I did not know though the game 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.440
 long enough in dota maybe 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 would even just about this reproaches not 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.270
 thought before everything is very simple to 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.159
 madness but just didn't think about it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.810
 we think most did the same 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.299
 so and fumes from here to go on now 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.720
 start shooting that erased to explain 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.770
 why so I told me everything on it 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.360
 in more detail there are two conditions for 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.240
 distribution of females and more precisely 3 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.220
 if it ends if near the enemy 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.610
 hero or we come close paris 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.450
 towers 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.640
 so so could not finger and with intrigue not 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 scorch heme not scorch any 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.979
 absolutely any clearance that site true 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.189
 site and the fountain is not a hero and not a tower 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.560
 but he has true sight 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.350
 make open tour site so we 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.149
 quietly running fountain like something 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.009
 everything is just well, in general, I hope that 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.250
 someone it is even useful principle is 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.350
 not particularly helpful but maybe when it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.370
 will save your life or at least some 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.580
