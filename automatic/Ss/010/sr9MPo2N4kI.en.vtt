00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 I already learned how to make boards with 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.259
 bottles when you lived in Hawaii and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.300
 He decided to bring the idea to Brazil. 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.610
 through the girlfriend's initiative 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 carolina they developed the project 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.680
 ecological board where they teach children 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.439
 and adults to make 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.210
 surfing with plastic bottles 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.210
 they have already gone through schools in garopaba 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.189
 in the south of the state last month led to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.550
 idea for schools in other states of the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 country paraná são paulo and rio de janeiro 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.540
 We intend to continue this 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.120
 project there in 2013 in the northeast 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.670
 brazilian who knows even the whole country 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.010
 where you do not even have sea because we 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.920
 we also do the stand up you can 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.840
 working on the rivers can use the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 plank on the wires is the stand up is that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.430
 The biggest board is emo so the people 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.469
 Do you want to take this to the whole brazil already 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.809
 explains that it is very easy to make 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.550
 plank is only to gather about forty 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.449
 two bottles of two soda 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.949
 liters a scissors a sandpaper glue 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.220
 of polyurethane 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.869
 pvc pipe and blessed and just cut the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.970
 end of the bottle to make a 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.610
 type of fit leave the ends 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.630
 to apply the glue to make rows with 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.270
 the bottles 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 then just click the glue and merge with 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.330
 the PVC pipes apply the material of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.830
 send the ready to ecological board can 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.659
 To do at home what you need is a 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.630
 Easy material to glue that is the secret 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.310
 dry ice the scissors a sandpaper to power 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 remove this material from the same 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.659
 one day suddenly it is floating in the sea 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.210
 a polluting pond there then perhaps being 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.310
 used for an end of fun now and 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.829
 to show that you can surf with 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.159
 an ecologically friendly board 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.790
 or jaolina carolina promote the 1st championship 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.040

 with the presence of surfers 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.270
 professionals and amateurs who will play 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.540
 with the plates made of pet bottle and the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.460
 idea is not to make a champion will want 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.740
 that winners without the means 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.509
 environment is the winner of this 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.119
 project because that way we are 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.100
 taking several bottles of nature right 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.320
 We can get a job done there. 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.870
 very cool with the kids the goal of 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.150
 couple is to encourage sports 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.220
 allied to environmental education 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.810

 example of how to help preserve the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.560
 environment 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.060
 ae 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.830
