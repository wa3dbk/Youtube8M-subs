of covered this in previous tutorials
like<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.400> lava<00:00:11.750> tutorial<00:00:12.750> but<00:00:13.049> I'm<00:00:13.500> just

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
like that lava tutorial but I'm just

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.959 
like that lava tutorial but I'm just
going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.830> try<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.040> relate<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.820> water

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
going to try and relate it to the water

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.300 
going to try and relate it to the water
toys<00:00:15.299> I've<00:00:15.540> been<00:00:15.690> doing<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:17.190> know

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
toys I've been doing so I'm you know

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.920 
toys I've been doing so I'm you know
making<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.760> material<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.390> texture<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.869> all

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
making the material in texture and all

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.070 
making the material in texture and all
that<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> basically<00:00:21.150> I'm<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.869> show

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
that so basically I'm just going to show

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.810 
that so basically I'm just going to show
you<00:00:22.140> what<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.640> pretty

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you what to do is going to be pretty

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.550 
you what to do is going to be pretty
simple<00:00:24.300> pretty<00:00:24.630> quick<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.140> i'll<00:00:25.260> show<00:00:25.500> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
simple pretty quick but i'll show you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.109 
simple pretty quick but i'll show you
some<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> results<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.880> how

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
some of the results you can get and how

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.839 
some of the results you can get and how
you<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.330> experiment<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:28.949> effects<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
you can experiment to get effects so

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.150 
you can experiment to get effects so
this<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.840> thing<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.380> i<00:00:31.529> did<00:00:31.590> right<00:00:31.920> here

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
this is one thing that i did right here

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.910 
this is one thing that i did right here
is<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.940> looks<00:00:33.180> terrible<00:00:33.360> obviously<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.860> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
is it looks terrible obviously but you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.569 
is it looks terrible obviously but you
can<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.520> animating<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> texture

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
can see that animating the texture

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
can see that animating the texture
clouds<00:00:38.579> texture<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.210> makes<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.260> look<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
clouds texture here makes it look like a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.720 
clouds texture here makes it look like a
block<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.829> minecraft<00:00:43.829> water<00:00:44.010> i<00:00:44.190> guess<00:00:44.460> but

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
block of minecraft water i guess but

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.369 
block of minecraft water i guess but
more<00:00:45.090> realistic<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.200> um<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:47.850> know

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
more realistic which is um you know

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.110 
more realistic which is um you know
water<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.800> moving<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> there's<00:00:50.940> some

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
water and it's moving and there's some

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.580 
water and it's moving and there's some
problems<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> know<00:00:51.960> I've<00:00:52.110> still

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
problems with this you know I've still

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
problems with this you know I've still
got<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.890> figure<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> coordinates

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
got to figure out like the coordinates

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
got to figure out like the coordinates
so<00:00:55.260> I'm<00:00:55.410> guessing<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:57.059> only<00:00:57.180> way<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> do

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so I'm guessing that the only way to do

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.889 
so I'm guessing that the only way to do
this<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:58.020> by<00:00:58.199> UV<00:00:58.590> mapping<00:00:58.829> somehow<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.640> then

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
this was by UV mapping somehow and then

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.150 
this was by UV mapping somehow and then
animating<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.829> little

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
animating that but like all these little

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.299 
animating that but like all these little
faces<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.940> separating<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.719> stuff<00:01:04.530> it's

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
faces or like separating them stuff it's

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.630 
faces or like separating them stuff it's
more<00:01:05.489> complex<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.549> looks

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
more complex but you can see it looks

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
more complex but you can see it looks
quite<00:01:09.000> cool<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.570> mean<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.260> get<00:01:10.380> some

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
quite cool I mean you can get some

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.920 
quite cool I mean you can get some
really<00:01:10.590> cool<00:01:10.770> effects<00:01:11.270> but<00:01:12.270> yeah<00:01:12.630> that's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
really cool effects but yeah that's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.070 
really cool effects but yeah that's
that's<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.650> thing<00:01:14.580> I've<00:01:14.909> also<00:01:15.479> been<00:01:15.720> making

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that's one thing I've also been making

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.710 
that's one thing I've also been making
this<00:01:16.229> scene<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.560> quick<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.479> see

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
this scene really quick and you can see

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.830 
this scene really quick and you can see
the<00:01:18.810> water<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.250> M<00:01:20.689> this<00:01:21.689> is

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the water here and this is the M this is

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.980 
the water here and this is the M this is
the<00:01:21.930> water<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.530> animating<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.460> yeah<00:01:24.060> just

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the water will be animating so yeah just

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.310 
the water will be animating so yeah just
reposition<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> camera<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.070> you'll<00:01:26.369> shift<00:01:26.610> F

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
reposition the camera so you'll shift F

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.990 
reposition the camera so you'll shift F
to<00:01:28.320> move<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> camera<00:01:29.130> around<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.880> just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
to move the camera around and I'm just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.310 
to move the camera around and I'm just
going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.210> zoom<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> water<00:01:30.930> there<00:01:31.290> um

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
going to zoom in on the water there um

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.300 
going to zoom in on the water there um
so<00:01:34.320> basically<00:01:35.420> what<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.900> select<00:01:37.500> what

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so basically what you do is select what

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.160 
so basically what you do is select what
you<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.729> use<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> water

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you want to use so like the water

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.210 
you want to use so like the water
obviously<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.310> click<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.549> select<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
obviously so right click to select and

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.300 
obviously so right click to select and
quickly<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.369> rid<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> keyframes<00:01:45.180> here

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
quickly get rid of the keyframes here

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
quickly get rid of the keyframes here
now<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.729> ignore<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.119> did<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.479> shouldn't<00:01:48.810> have

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
now just ignore I did you shouldn't have

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.179 
now just ignore I did you shouldn't have
any<00:01:48.990> key<00:01:49.350> frames<00:01:49.649> unless<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.070> have

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
any key frames unless you have

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.389 
any key frames unless you have
previously<00:01:51.149> done<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.229> test<00:01:53.220> or

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
previously done it like a test or

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.520 
previously done it like a test or
something<00:01:53.479> anyway<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> got<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
something anyway and so you got the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.609 
something anyway and so you got the
water<00:01:55.770> selected<00:01:56.340> basically<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.960> ignore<00:01:58.409> all

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
water selected basically just ignore all

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.219 
water selected basically just ignore all
of<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> material<00:01:59.790> that's<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.360> there<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
of the material that's just there that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.050 
of the material that's just there that
you<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.409> really<00:02:01.649> need<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.820> any<00:02:03.030> of

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you don't really need to know any of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
you don't really need to know any of
this<00:02:03.210> stuff<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:04.009> just<00:02:05.009> go<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
this stuff right now just go to the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.850 
this stuff right now just go to the
texture<00:02:05.850> basically<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.619> where<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.680> says

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
texture basically and where it says

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.910 
texture basically and where it says
offset<00:02:08.429> under<00:02:08.729> mapping<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.140> basically

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
offset under mapping this is basically

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.559 
offset under mapping this is basically
this<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.220> what

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
this is what

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.809 
this is what
animating<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.409> all<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.040> need<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.219> do<00:02:13.519> to

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
animating so all you need to do to

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.580 
animating so all you need to do to
animate<00:02:14.329> a<00:02:14.359> texture<00:02:14.930> let's<00:02:15.680> go<00:02:16.010> hit<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:17.590> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
animate a texture let's go hit I the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.009 
animate a texture let's go hit I the
letter<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.859> over<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:20.420> area<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:20.900> it

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
letter I over the this area and it

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.509 
letter I over the this area and it
should<00:02:21.170> turn<00:02:21.349> yellow<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.859> that's<00:02:22.280> basically

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
should turn yellow and that's basically

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.809 
should turn yellow and that's basically
is<00:02:22.819> insert<00:02:23.359> the<00:02:23.480> key<00:02:23.659> frame<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:24.700> move<00:02:25.700> to

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
is insert the key frame so we move to

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.580 
is insert the key frame so we move to
another<00:02:25.969> point<00:02:26.209> timeline<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.109> change<00:02:27.379> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
another point timeline and change the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.490 
another point timeline and change the
values<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.189> the<00:02:28.790> water<00:02:29.450> will<00:02:29.659> be<00:02:29.750> animated<00:02:30.290> so

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
values and the water will be animated so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.789 
values and the water will be animated so
if<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.099> go<00:02:31.129> to<00:02:31.250> frame<00:02:31.579> 1<00:02:31.639> hundreds<00:02:32.680> turn<00:02:33.680> this

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
if I go to frame 1 hundreds turn this

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.020 
if I go to frame 1 hundreds turn this
200<00:02:34.310> as<00:02:34.370> well<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.780> then<00:02:35.900> let's<00:02:36.109> say<00:02:36.579> we<00:02:37.579> change

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
200 as well and then let's say we change

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.309 
200 as well and then let's say we change
the<00:02:38.840> let's<00:02:39.709> just<00:02:40.010> see<00:02:40.389> ya<00:02:41.389> we<00:02:41.810> changed<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.319> Y<00:02:42.919> 2

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
the let's just see ya we changed the Y 2

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.129 
the let's just see ya we changed the Y 2
1<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.590> then<00:02:46.519> hit<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.909> again<00:02:47.389> to<00:02:47.659> make<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.959> yellow

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
1 and then hit I again to make it yellow

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.629 
1 and then hit I again to make it yellow
and<00:02:48.409> that'll<00:02:48.590> insert<00:02:48.859> keyframe<00:02:49.280> there<00:02:49.489> so

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
and that'll insert keyframe there so

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.339 
and that'll insert keyframe there so
when<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.909> scroll<00:02:50.569> up<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:50.840> down<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.079> timeline

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
when you scroll up and down the timeline

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.539 
when you scroll up and down the timeline
you<00:02:51.829> can<00:02:51.859> see<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:52.280> texture<00:02:52.969> changes<00:02:53.449> here<00:02:53.719> and

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
you can see the texture changes here and

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.179 
you can see the texture changes here and
yet<00:02:55.549> can<00:02:56.329> do<00:02:56.449> the<00:02:56.540> same<00:02:56.719> for<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.989> x-axis<00:02:57.620> let's

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
yet can do the same for the x-axis let's

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.199 
yet can do the same for the x-axis let's
change<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:58.639> one<00:02:58.939> and<00:02:59.980> basically<00:03:01.120> if<00:03:02.120> you

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
change that to one and basically if you

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.459 
change that to one and basically if you
have<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.389> render<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:02.719> out<00:03:02.900> now<00:03:02.959> will<00:03:03.319> have

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
have to render this out now will have

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.709 
have to render this out now will have
nice<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:04.189> a<00:03:04.219> nice<00:03:04.459> M<00:03:04.959> sorry<00:03:06.219> sort<00:03:07.219> of<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> nice

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
nice like a nice M sorry sort of a nice

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.539 
nice like a nice M sorry sort of a nice
water<00:03:08.719> movement<00:03:09.199> on<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.739> material<00:03:10.219> and<00:03:10.370> you

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
water movement on the material and you

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.539 
water movement on the material and you
can<00:03:10.699> see<00:03:10.849> we<00:03:10.969> go<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.299> plain<00:03:11.540> view<00:03:12.519> with<00:03:13.519> the

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
can see we go to the plain view with the

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.220 
can see we go to the plain view with the
transparency<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.359> stuff<00:03:14.599> actually<00:03:14.900> looks

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
transparency and stuff actually looks

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.420 
transparency and stuff actually looks
like<00:03:15.409> water<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.099> that's<00:03:16.280> good<00:03:17.949> but<00:03:18.949> what<00:03:19.189> else

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
like water so that's good but what else

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.689 
like water so that's good but what else
is<00:03:19.759> if<00:03:20.750> we<00:03:21.199> adjust<00:03:21.799> quickly<00:03:22.069> remove<00:03:22.549> these

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
is if we adjust quickly remove these

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.199 
is if we adjust quickly remove these
keyframes<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.359> dope<00:03:23.689> sheet<00:03:24.159> so<00:03:25.159> hey<00:03:25.790> twice

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
keyframes and dope sheet so hey twice

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.129 
keyframes and dope sheet so hey twice
then<00:03:26.720> X<00:03:27.169> to<00:03:27.409> delete<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:28.790> can<00:03:28.970> add<00:03:29.180> just<00:03:30.019> like

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
then X to delete you can add just like

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.499 
then X to delete you can add just like
anything<00:03:30.409> else<00:03:30.590> really<00:03:30.859> can<00:03:31.159> add<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.549> noise

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:32.509 
anything else really can add a noise

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.300 
anything else really can add a noise
modifier<00:03:32.900> in<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.379> graph<00:03:33.590> editor<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.220> that

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
modifier in the graph editor and that

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.330 
modifier in the graph editor and that
will<00:03:34.400> give<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:34.669> a<00:03:34.729> random<00:03:35.000> sort<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.659> movement

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
will give this a random sort of movement

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.009 
will give this a random sort of movement
which<00:03:37.340> also<00:03:37.579> can<00:03:37.819> create<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.329> cool<00:03:38.629> water

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
which also can create a cool water

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.530 
which also can create a cool water
effect<00:03:39.439> so<00:03:40.129> basically<00:03:40.759> all<00:03:40.939> you<00:03:41.030> need<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.299> do

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
effect so basically all you need to do

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.149 
effect so basically all you need to do
is<00:03:41.810> drag<00:03:42.799> out<00:03:42.979> a<00:03:43.009> new<00:03:43.189> window<00:03:43.549> like<00:03:43.939> this

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
is drag out a new window like this

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.119 
is drag out a new window like this
change<00:03:46.159> this<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.489> graph<00:03:46.699> at<00:03:46.879> us<00:03:47.000> obviously<00:03:47.180> and

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
change this to graph at us obviously and

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.979 
change this to graph at us obviously and
you<00:03:49.129> need<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.340> insert<00:03:49.699> a<00:03:49.759> keyframe<00:03:49.970> what<00:03:50.900> you

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
you need to insert a keyframe what you

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.679 
you need to insert a keyframe what you
want<00:03:51.169> to<00:03:51.349> keep<00:03:51.919> frame<00:03:52.250> or<00:03:52.459> animate<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.479> very

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
want to keep frame or animate the very

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.349 
want to keep frame or animate the very
first<00:03:53.930> keyframe<00:03:54.109> away<00:03:54.530> wherever<00:03:55.359> so

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
first keyframe away wherever so

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.330 
first keyframe away wherever so
basically<00:03:57.139> just<00:03:57.349> hit<00:03:57.469> I<00:03:57.650> over<00:03:58.009> here<00:03:58.189> and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
basically just hit I over here and

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.420 
basically just hit I over here and
you'll<00:03:58.459> see<00:03:58.639> all<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:59.290> valley<00:04:00.290> well<00:04:00.680> these

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
you'll see all the valley well these

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.999 
you'll see all the valley well these
appear<00:04:02.269> which<00:04:02.449> is<00:04:02.569> what<00:04:02.689> you<00:04:02.780> want<00:04:03.019> basically

just hit T my way no hit this little
plus<00:04:07.819> button<00:04:07.879> here<00:04:08.359> then<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.079> should<00:04:09.229> pop

select<00:04:15.049> noise<00:04:15.199> which<00:04:15.949> is<00:04:16.239> good<00:04:17.239> because<00:04:17.509> if

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
select noise which is good because if

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.769 
select noise which is good because if
you<00:04:18.199> try<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.500> make<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.650> like<00:04:19.070> randomly<00:04:19.779> you

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:20.779 
you try and make it like randomly you

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.510 
you try and make it like randomly you
will<00:04:20.900> always<00:04:21.320> end<00:04:21.469> up<00:04:21.620> like<00:04:21.859> making<00:04:22.219> sort<00:04:22.430> of

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
will always end up like making sort of

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.710 
will always end up like making sort of
biased<00:04:22.880> effects<00:04:23.360> like

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
biased effects like

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.130 
biased effects like
it's<00:04:24.200> hard<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.380> explain<00:04:24.620> we<00:04:25.280> always<00:04:25.430> end<00:04:25.700> up

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
it's hard to explain we always end up

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.990 
it's hard to explain we always end up
not<00:04:27.140> actually<00:04:27.500> doing<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.160> ran<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.460> me<00:04:28.610> that

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
not actually doing it ran to me that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.210 
not actually doing it ran to me that
probably<00:04:29.240> doesn't<00:04:29.450> make<00:04:29.600> sense<00:04:29.780> but

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
probably doesn't make sense but

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.710 
probably doesn't make sense but
basically<00:04:31.220> I<00:04:31.340> want<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.700> do<00:04:31.850> now<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.300> tweak<00:04:32.630> the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
basically I want to do now is tweak the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.050 
basically I want to do now is tweak the
settings<00:04:32.930> in<00:04:33.530> this<00:04:33.620> modifier<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.850> ones

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
settings in this modifier so the ones

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.590 
settings in this modifier so the ones
really<00:04:35.590> tweak<00:04:36.590> our<00:04:36.890> this<00:04:37.580> scale<00:04:37.970> here<00:04:38.330> so

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
really tweak our this scale here so

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.060 
really tweak our this scale here so
normally<00:04:38.990> what<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.140> do<00:04:39.260> is<00:04:39.560> set<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.770> scale

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
normally what I do is set the scale

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.720 
normally what I do is set the scale
something<00:04:40.490> like<00:04:40.610> 10<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:43.100> strength<00:04:43.460> to

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
something like 10 and the strength to

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.570 
something like 10 and the strength to
something<00:04:44.000> like<00:04:44.090> point<00:04:44.360> 7<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:46.340> just

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
something like point 7 and that just

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
something like point 7 and that just
sort<00:04:46.670> of<00:04:46.730> decreases<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:50.030> strength<00:04:50.360> of<00:04:50.510> it

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
sort of decreases the the strength of it

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.110 
sort of decreases the the strength of it
really<00:04:51.130> but<00:04:52.130> yeah<00:04:52.280> just<00:04:52.580> mess<00:04:52.760> well<00:04:52.940> me<00:04:53.000> these

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
really but yeah just mess well me these

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.810 
really but yeah just mess well me these
settings<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:53.600> can<00:04:53.630> also<00:04:53.980> have<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.640> noise

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
settings you can also have the noise

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.210 
settings you can also have the noise
modifier<00:04:56.260> factor<00:04:57.260> certain<00:04:57.560> range<00:04:57.830> on<00:04:58.130> the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
modifier factor certain range on the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
range set the end frame to what let's

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.400 
range set the end frame to what let's
say<00:05:02.300> 100<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.670> start<00:05:04.670> to<00:05:04.940> one<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.540> that'll

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
say 100 and start to one and that'll

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.560 
say 100 and start to one and that'll
just<00:05:06.590> make<00:05:06.680> sure<00:05:07.130> that<00:05:07.730> even<00:05:08.420> though<00:05:08.510> it

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
just make sure that even though it

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.380 
just make sure that even though it
doesn't<00:05:08.690> matter<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.230> will<00:05:09.320> definitely<00:05:09.680> render

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
doesn't matter it will definitely render

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.770 
doesn't matter it will definitely render
on<00:05:11.390> the<00:05:11.690> timeline<00:05:11.960> here<00:05:12.410> where<00:05:12.740> we<00:05:12.860> are<00:05:12.980> so

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
on the timeline here where we are so

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.030 
on the timeline here where we are so
yeah<00:05:14.780> that's<00:05:14.990> that's<00:05:15.290> always<00:05:15.530> helpful<00:05:15.680> you

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
yeah that's that's always helpful you

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.320 
yeah that's that's always helpful you
can<00:05:16.070> do<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.370> same<00:05:16.400> for<00:05:16.610> obviously<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.090> white

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
can do the same for obviously the white

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.690 
can do the same for obviously the white
and<00:05:17.600> obviously<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:18.590> can<00:05:18.770> copy<00:05:19.070> over<00:05:19.520> the

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
and obviously you can copy over the

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.640 
and obviously you can copy over the
modify<00:05:20.210> here<00:05:20.419> by<00:05:20.570> clicking<00:05:20.690> this<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.410> then<00:05:21.500> go

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
modify here by clicking this and then go

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.670 
modify here by clicking this and then go
into<00:05:21.770> here<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.310> clicking<00:05:22.550> paste<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.810> I'll

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
into here and clicking paste and I'll

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.470 
into here and clicking paste and I'll
just<00:05:24.860> copy<00:05:25.070> over<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.400> exact<00:05:25.760> settings<00:05:26.210> as

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
just copy over the exact settings as

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
just copy over the exact settings as
this<00:05:26.690> one<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:28.340> that's<00:05:29.300> pretty<00:05:29.870> much<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.110> I

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
this one and that's pretty much it I

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.360 
this one and that's pretty much it I
think<00:05:32.740> what<00:05:33.740> else<00:05:33.860> is<00:05:34.040> there<00:05:34.160> to<00:05:34.220> cover<00:05:34.520> oh

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
think what else is there to cover oh

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.659 
think what else is there to cover oh
yeah<00:05:37.370> one<00:05:37.669> last<00:05:37.850> thing<00:05:39.010> when<00:05:40.010> if<00:05:40.280> you<00:05:40.490> do

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
yeah one last thing when if you do

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.330 
yeah one last thing when if you do
insert<00:05:41.000> a<00:05:41.060> keyframe<00:05:41.240> for<00:05:41.810> this<00:05:42.169> water<00:05:42.410> like<00:05:43.040> I

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
insert a keyframe for this water like I

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.710 
insert a keyframe for this water like I
have<00:05:43.700> it<00:05:43.729> moving<00:05:44.770> one<00:05:45.770> thing<00:05:46.100> to<00:05:46.130> note<00:05:46.460> is<00:05:46.490> that

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
have it moving one thing to note is that

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.140 
have it moving one thing to note is that
the<00:05:47.720> interpolation<00:05:48.260> will<00:05:49.010> sort<00:05:49.370> of<00:05:49.520> it'll

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
the interpolation will sort of it'll

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.850 
the interpolation will sort of it'll
slow<00:05:50.390> down<00:05:50.419> towards<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.140> end<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:51.440> speed<00:05:51.830> up

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
slow down towards the end and speed up

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.270 
slow down towards the end and speed up
at<00:05:52.640> the<00:05:52.790> start<00:05:53.090> so<00:05:53.390> it<00:05:53.570> won't<00:05:53.750> look<00:05:54.280> realistic

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
at the start so it won't look realistic

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.800 
at the start so it won't look realistic
and<00:05:55.460> lifelike<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:56.000> what<00:05:56.150> you<00:05:56.210> want<00:05:56.360> to<00:05:56.450> do<00:05:56.630> to

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
and lifelike so what you want to do to

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.830 
and lifelike so what you want to do to
avoid<00:05:57.050> that<00:05:57.290> is<00:05:57.500> all<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:59.060> keyframes<00:05:59.240> you've

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
avoid that is all the keyframes you've

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.640 
avoid that is all the keyframes you've
made<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:01.370> a<00:06:01.490> twice<00:06:01.850> in<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.360> dope<00:06:02.570> sheet<00:06:02.840> so

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
made it a twice in the dope sheet so

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.960 
made it a twice in the dope sheet so
just<00:06:03.890> select<00:06:03.950> this<00:06:04.220> hip<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:05.690> hip<00:06:06.140> tea<00:06:06.500> and<00:06:06.970> set

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
just select this hip and hip tea and set

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.300 
just select this hip and hip tea and set
the<00:06:08.180> interpolation<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:09.110> linear<00:06:09.530> because<00:06:09.830> by

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
the interpolation to linear because by

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.330 
the interpolation to linear because by
default<00:06:10.370> it's<00:06:10.850> set<00:06:10.910> to<00:06:11.060> Bezier<00:06:11.510> which<00:06:12.340> it's

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
default it's set to Bezier which it's

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.100 
default it's set to Bezier which it's
sort<00:06:13.520> of<00:06:13.640> a<00:06:13.850> curve<00:06:14.120> rather<00:06:14.419> than<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:14.780> straight

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
sort of a curve rather than a straight

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.510 
sort of a curve rather than a straight
line<00:06:15.290> so<00:06:15.500> you<00:06:15.560> want<00:06:15.740> this<00:06:15.860> straight<00:06:16.160> line<00:06:16.310> here

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
line so you want this straight line here

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.630 
line so you want this straight line here
so<00:06:16.760> make<00:06:17.360> sure<00:06:17.390> you<00:06:17.630> select<00:06:17.780> linear<00:06:18.140> and<00:06:18.640> if

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
so make sure you select linear and if

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.219 
so make sure you select linear and if
you<00:06:19.820> don't<00:06:20.030> want<00:06:20.210> it<00:06:20.360> to<00:06:20.479> affect<00:06:20.510> everything

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
you don't want it to affect everything

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.900 
you don't want it to affect everything
in<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:21.560> scene<00:06:21.770> make<00:06:21.979> sure<00:06:22.160> your<00:06:22.310> adult<00:06:22.640> sheet

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
in the scene make sure your adult sheet

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.050 
in the scene make sure your adult sheet
and<00:06:23.030> then<00:06:23.150> do<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.450> so<00:06:23.690> yeah<00:06:24.880> that's<00:06:25.880> pretty

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
and then do it so yeah that's pretty

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.120 
and then do it so yeah that's pretty
much<00:06:26.390> it<00:06:26.570> for<00:06:26.660> animating<00:06:27.290> textures<00:06:27.770> I<00:06:27.890> sort<00:06:28.100> of

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
much it for animating textures I sort of

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.890 
much it for animating textures I sort of
covered<00:06:28.430> in<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.640> lavas<00:06:28.970> tutorial<00:06:29.450> as<00:06:29.540> I<00:06:29.660> said

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
covered in the lavas tutorial as I said

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.210 
covered in the lavas tutorial as I said
but<00:06:30.110> I<00:06:30.140> thought<00:06:30.350> I<00:06:30.410> might<00:06:30.470> as<00:06:30.710> well<00:06:30.830> just<00:06:30.979> sort

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
but I thought I might as well just sort

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.150 
but I thought I might as well just sort
of<00:06:31.250> clarify<00:06:32.090> it<00:06:32.419> for<00:06:32.539> everyone<00:06:32.870> but<00:06:33.800> yeah<00:06:33.919> they
