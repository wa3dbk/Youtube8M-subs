above<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.760> command<00:02:15.060> blocks<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.599> make<00:02:15.870> sure

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
above the command blocks and make sure

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.710 
above the command blocks and make sure
that<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.530> far<00:02:16.830> away<00:02:16.950> from<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:18.269> little<00:02:18.540> guy

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that it's far away from that little guy

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.750 
that it's far away from that little guy
or<00:02:19.049> wherever<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.739> player<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.190> supposed<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.580> be

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
or wherever the player is supposed to be

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.030 
or wherever the player is supposed to be
so<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.959> do<00:02:22.110> not<00:02:22.230> hear<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.650> explosion

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
so that you do not hear that explosion

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.440 
so that you do not hear that explosion
so<00:02:23.459> basically<00:02:24.299> right<00:02:24.569> here<00:02:25.519> we<00:02:26.519> are<00:02:26.549> changing

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
so basically right here we are changing

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.670 
so basically right here we are changing
the<00:02:27.870> color<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:29.159> outfit<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:31.530> are

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the color of the outfit and we are

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.890 
the color of the outfit and we are
playing<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.190> fizz<00:02:32.640> zone<00:02:32.670> now<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.360> reason<00:02:33.780> why

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
playing a fizz zone now the reason why

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.110 
playing a fizz zone now the reason why
I'm<00:02:34.049> not<00:02:34.200> using<00:02:34.440> fuse<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.760> creeper

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
I'm not using fuse like the creeper

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.080 
I'm not using fuse like the creeper
noise<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:37.470> because<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.370> some<00:02:38.580> reason<00:02:38.610> it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
noise is because for some reason it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.500 
noise is because for some reason it
doesn't<00:02:39.420> work<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.519> type<00:02:41.819> in<00:02:42.000> play<00:02:42.209> sound

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
doesn't work if I type in play sound

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.979 
doesn't work if I type in play sound
random<00:02:42.720> dot<00:02:43.019> fuse<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:44.540> doesn't<00:02:45.540> play<00:02:45.720> any

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
random dot fuse it doesn't play any

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.630 
random dot fuse it doesn't play any
sound<00:02:46.349> at<00:02:46.500> all<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.829> I'm<00:02:46.980> pretty<00:02:47.190> sure<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.610> a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
sound at all so I'm pretty sure it's a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.030 
sound at all so I'm pretty sure it's a
bug<00:02:48.170> unfortunately<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.200> sure<00:02:49.590> would<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:49.980> to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
bug unfortunately I sure would like to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.190 
bug unfortunately I sure would like to
have<00:02:50.310> fuse<00:02:50.670> instead<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.180> fizz<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:51.750> fizz<00:02:51.959> is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
have fuse instead of fizz but fizz is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.930 
have fuse instead of fizz but fizz is
the<00:02:52.319> closest<00:02:52.709> thing<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:53.069> I<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.640> fuse

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the closest thing that I can get to fuse

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.789 
the closest thing that I can get to fuse
and<00:02:54.629> then<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.930> have<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.109> delay<00:02:55.849> the<00:02:56.849> armor<00:02:57.390> gets

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
and then we have a delay the armor gets

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.949 
and then we have a delay the armor gets
changed<00:02:58.799> colors<00:02:59.129> a<00:02:59.160> little<00:02:59.609> bit<00:02:59.730> lighter<00:02:59.959> does

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
changed colors a little bit lighter does

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.490 
changed colors a little bit lighter does
a<00:03:00.989> fist<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.920> again<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.870> then<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.140> summons

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
a fist and again and then it summons

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.699 
a fist and again and then it summons
this<00:03:04.680> creeper<00:03:05.629> now<00:03:06.629> it<00:03:06.780> summons<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.290> creeper

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
this creeper now it summons this creeper

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.599 
this creeper now it summons this creeper
and<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.579> attributes<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.190> generic

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
and the attributes have a generic

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.440 
and the attributes have a generic
movement<00:03:12.450> speed<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:13.019> zero<00:03:13.709> zero<00:03:14.700> zero<00:03:14.790> point

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
movement speed of zero zero zero point

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.259 
movement speed of zero zero zero point
one<00:03:15.629> or<00:03:15.840> point<00:03:15.959> zero<00:03:16.620> zero<00:03:16.680> one<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.880> custom

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
one or point zero zero one and a custom

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.449

name<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.720> baby<00:03:19.049> creepers<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:19.919> is<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.280> guy

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
name of baby creepers so this is the guy

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.309 
name of baby creepers so this is the guy
that<00:03:20.730> actually<00:03:20.760> does<00:03:21.359> all<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.720> damage<00:03:22.109> this

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
that actually does all the damage this

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.120 
that actually does all the damage this
adult<00:03:22.859> creeper<00:03:24.290> then<00:03:25.290> there<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> short

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
adult creeper then there is a short

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.210 
adult creeper then there is a short
delay<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.700> you'll<00:03:27.419> see<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.989> right<00:03:28.319> here<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
delay and you'll see that right here it

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.800 
delay and you'll see that right here it
basically<00:03:29.340> keeps<00:03:29.910> changing<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.419> color<00:03:30.720> of

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
we got this command block which

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.440 
we got this command block which

see<00:04:24.310> this<00:04:24.460> guy<00:04:24.639> down<00:04:24.700> here<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.889> now<00:04:26.889> he

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
see this guy down here and now he

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.920 
see this guy down here and now he
changed<00:04:27.430> his<00:04:27.639> color<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.240> outfit<00:04:28.540> so<00:04:28.690> I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
changed his color of the outfit so I

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.560 
changed his color of the outfit so I
really<00:04:29.590> don't<00:04:29.830> understand<00:04:30.700> what<00:04:31.120> could

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
really don't understand what could

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.680 
really don't understand what could
possibly<00:04:32.080> be<00:04:32.290> going<00:04:32.320> on<00:04:32.680> with<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.570> but<00:04:34.570> it

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
possibly be going on with that but it

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.030 
possibly be going on with that but it
seems<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.050> be<00:04:35.139> pretty<00:04:35.380> random

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
seems to be pretty random

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.680 
seems to be pretty random
let's<00:04:36.940> see<00:04:37.120> change<00:04:37.960> colors<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:38.850> will<00:04:39.850> have<00:04:40.419> a
