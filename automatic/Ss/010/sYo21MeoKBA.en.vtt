00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
keep my teas so it only makes sense to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.749 
keep my teas so it only makes sense to
keep<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.220> kettle<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.229> little<00:01:52.229> mug<00:01:52.740> rack<00:01:53.040> here

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.660 
keep the kettle and little mug rack here
and<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.509> did<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.750> purchase<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> mug<00:01:55.829> rock<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
and I did just purchase the mug rock to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.660 
and I did just purchase the mug rock to
keep<00:01:56.939> all<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> my<00:01:57.659> mugs<00:01:58.439> off<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.189> counter<00:01:59.640> I

think<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> looks<00:02:00.270> better<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.490> next

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
think it looks better that way and next

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.090 
think it looks better that way and next
to<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:02.909> tea<00:02:02.969> area<00:02:03.659> i<00:02:03.719> am<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.560> displaying

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
perfect to house my succulents which I'm

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.680 
perfect to house my succulents which I'm
obsessed<00:02:58.390> with<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:59.459> I<00:03:00.459> think<00:03:01.150> they<00:03:01.270> just<00:03:01.420> look

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
obsessed with and I think they just look

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.660 
obsessed with and I think they just look
neater<00:03:02.050> like<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.770> where<00:03:03.100> they're<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.400> just

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
neater like that where they're not just

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.060 
neater like that where they're not just
kind<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.300> lined<00:03:04.600> up<00:03:04.780> on<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:04.959> counter<00:03:05.440> but

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
kind of like lined up on the counter but

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.650 
kind of like lined up on the counter but
they're<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:06.459> kind<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.820> on<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.030> little<00:03:07.270> tray

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
they're just kind of on the little tray

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.890 
they're just kind of on the little tray
I<00:03:07.690> think<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:08.230> looks<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.680> much<00:03:08.860> cuter<00:03:09.250> and

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
I think that looks so much cuter and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.650 
I think that looks so much cuter and
makes<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.080> look<00:03:11.110> less<00:03:11.590> cluttered<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.970> then

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
makes it look less cluttered and then

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.860 
makes it look less cluttered and then
moving<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:15.190> way<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.760> corner<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.510> have

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
moving that way in that corner I have

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.479 
moving that way in that corner I have
our<00:03:17.230> clock<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.110> candle<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:20.980> a

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
our clock and I have a candle and a

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.900 
our clock and I have a candle and a
little<00:03:21.760> chicken<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.360> i<00:03:22.420> bought<00:03:22.780> at<00:03:22.840> my<00:03:23.170> goals

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
little chicken that i bought at my goals

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.490 
little chicken that i bought at my goals
what<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:24.940> did<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.269> declutter<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.780> space<00:03:26.230> was

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
what I did to declutter this space was

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.259 
what I did to declutter this space was
actually<00:03:26.860> had<00:03:27.010> three<00:03:27.340> candles<00:03:27.820> standing

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
actually had three candles standing

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.300 
actually had three candles standing
there<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:29.230> thought<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.590> was<00:03:29.709> too<00:03:29.980> much<00:03:30.010> so

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
there and I thought that was too much so

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.449 
there and I thought that was too much so
I<00:03:30.340> took<00:03:30.459> two<00:03:30.940> away<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:33.130> think<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.430> just

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
I took two away and I think it just

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.870 
I took two away and I think it just
looks<00:03:33.790> cleaner<00:03:34.269> with<00:03:34.630> just<00:03:34.930> one<00:03:35.170> candle<00:03:35.650> and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
looks cleaner with just one candle and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.570 
looks cleaner with just one candle and
then<00:03:36.880> next<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.810> sink<00:03:38.200> here<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.890> my<00:03:39.400> little
