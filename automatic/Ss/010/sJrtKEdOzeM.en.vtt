00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.880
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.370
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.740
 Nice to meet you Today's theme is 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 Here's a double sleeve 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.839
 I would like to introduce you to the foreboding Tsutsuki 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.849
 This is how you fit your back 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.890
 I wonder if you have a tutu 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.240
 Somehow against the other party's serve 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.530
 After all it is my third team to play 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.500
 Please hit me and please receive me 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.950
 I am often doing it unconsciously 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.470
 So a skill that does not require a sense of cutting today 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.200
 Because it is difficult to cut the apricot 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.330
 The other party can simply attack in one step without breaking 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.770
 Receive an effective receive that can not 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.100
 One simple receive such as holding leadership 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.000
 If you would like to transfer tips, please take a look 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.219
 In just one step, you're offensive 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:24.109
 It's a way, but one that strikes 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:30.319
 I'm going to push it out faster than usual 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.490
 Please do it already 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.170
 Googuru trying to cut off aggressively 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.399
 It is difficult than usual 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.840
 It is bound and can be caught by the tsutsuki basic vertex 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.049
 I think there are many, but not at the top 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.619
 Tatan Tatan already hit the ball just now after bouncing 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.590
 It is early after the bounce It is just after the bounce 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.329
 The ball will be quick at a stretch 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.969
 Press a little Press a little Back 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.709
 I will push a little on the back side 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.500
 Offensive early Tsutsuki that got on speed 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.030
 You will be getting deeper into the back of the bag 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.040
 It is often said that you accelerate the hit point with Tsuttsuki 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.510
 I often say that I will push a little while advancing 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.150
 I feel vaguely somehow 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.780
 Than doing Tsutsuki against the opponent's serve 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.500
 While pushing a little while in the back of the back 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.290
 While pressing a little earlier in the early timing 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.860
 I will do it with Tatan 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.480
 As it was early timing, we came to be stuck up and came 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.319
 The other party hit it firmly 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.010
 It feels like it's changed to Tsutsuki 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.849
 The opponent can not beat at all in the third game 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.260
 It feels like 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.269
 The most common doubles are Tsutsuki 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.319
 Because it is a receiving technique, there somehow 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.989
 If you can do it, go ahead a bit earlier 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.189
 Press a little 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.390
 It is a feeling that it pushes in the aspect of the tsutsuki 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.010
 Just doing so is completely different 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.079
 Even if you do not know the other party's serve, each other's faces 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.799
 Because swing speed goes up 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.300
 It will be less susceptible to rotation 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.870
 Even if you don't feel like it's cutting, you can't beat it 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.659
 And here in this early Tutsu Tsuki received 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.099
 The merit of being able to hold leadership is 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.100
 It's a lot of aggressive Tsutsuki 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.340
 Thank you for trying if you like
