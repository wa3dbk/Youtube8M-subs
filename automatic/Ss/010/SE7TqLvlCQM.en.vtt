kill<00:03:22.829> streak<00:03:23.190> because<00:03:24.030> obviously<00:03:24.419> I<00:03:24.720> don't

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
kill streak because obviously I don't

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.080 
kill streak because obviously I don't
know<00:03:25.199> what<00:03:25.349> I<00:03:25.500> think<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.829> needed<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.459> reload<00:03:26.879> or

maybe<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.479> don't<00:03:28.229> know<00:03:28.290> if<00:03:28.349> I<00:03:28.439> rana<00:03:28.620> ammunition

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
maybe I don't know if I rana ammunition

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.699 
maybe I don't know if I rana ammunition
but<00:03:29.400> some<00:03:29.729> reason<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.359> switched<00:03:30.870> weapon<00:03:31.530> I

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
but some reason that I switched weapon I

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.679 
but some reason that I switched weapon I
didn't<00:03:31.979> press<00:03:32.310> triangle<00:03:32.639> I<00:03:33.299> don't<00:03:33.479> know<00:03:33.540> about

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
didn't press triangle I don't know about

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.409 
didn't press triangle I don't know about
yeah<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.709> first<00:03:35.180> really<00:03:36.180> really
