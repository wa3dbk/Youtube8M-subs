so<00:00:01.410> how<00:00:01.650> many<00:00:01.709> times<00:00:02.040> do<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.190> think<00:00:02.250> that<00:00:03.030> that

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so how many times do you think that that

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.660 
so how many times do you think that that
machine<00:00:03.389> will<00:00:03.780> open<00:00:04.140> up<00:00:04.259> that<00:00:04.410> Ford<00:00:04.770> f-150s

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670

for doors the answer eighty-four
thousand<00:00:08.490> times<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.150> part<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.480> Ford's

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
durability testing and that whole

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.999 
durability testing and that whole
process<00:00:11.790> takes<00:00:12.480> about<00:00:12.719> eight<00:00:13.080> weeks<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.590> to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
process takes about eight weeks and to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.560 
process takes about eight weeks and to
make<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.280> even<00:00:14.370> harder<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.969> cold<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.480> there

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
make it even harder it's cold in there

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.080 
make it even harder it's cold in there
it's<00:00:15.780> freezing<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.470> durability<00:00:17.400> testing<00:00:17.940> of

we<00:00:47.030> take<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.960> actual<00:00:48.289> measurement<00:00:48.710> on<00:00:48.800> the

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
we take the actual measurement on the

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.979 
we take the actual measurement on the
seat<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.370> then<00:00:50.059> that's<00:00:50.359> what<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:50.629> robots

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
seat and then that's what the robots

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.990 
seat and then that's what the robots
simulating<00:00:51.589> so<00:00:52.070> each<00:00:52.339> one's<00:00:52.640> a<00:00:52.879> little

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
simulating so each one's a little

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.149 
simulating so each one's a little
different<00:00:53.149> there's<00:00:53.690> no<00:00:53.870> standard<00:00:54.589> and<00:00:54.979> yeah

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
different there's no standard and yeah

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.439 
different there's no standard and yeah
we<00:00:55.280> do<00:00:55.399> try<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.670> get<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.000> different<00:00:56.329> weights

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
we do try to get the different weights

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.539 
we do try to get the different weights
and<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.839> different<00:00:57.589> people<00:00:57.859> coming<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.339> and

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
and the different people coming in and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.819 
and the different people coming in and
it<00:00:58.940> measures<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.719> pressure<00:01:00.109> on<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.559> seats

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
it measures the pressure on the seats

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.319 
it measures the pressure on the seats
and<00:01:01.129> then<00:01:01.489> that's<00:01:01.670> what<00:01:01.879> we're<00:01:02.000> simulating

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
and then that's what we're simulating

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.749 
and then that's what we're simulating
with<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.930> robot<00:01:03.289> how<00:01:03.739> many<00:01:03.890> times<00:01:04.129> are<00:01:04.309> good<00:01:04.489> I

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
with the robot how many times are good I

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.249 
with the robot how many times are good I
think<00:01:05.750> it's<00:01:05.869> about<00:01:06.020> 50,000<00:01:06.860> 50,000<00:01:08.110> did<00:01:09.110> one

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
think it's about 50,000 50,000 did one

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.039 
think it's about 50,000 50,000 did one
will<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.530> take<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:10.580> takes<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.420> really<00:01:11.539> depends

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
will it take it takes it really depends

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.070 
will it take it takes it really depends
on<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.259> seat<00:01:12.470> because<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.189> load<00:01:13.399> pass<00:01:13.670> so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
on the seat because of the load pass so

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.800 
on the seat because of the load pass so
I'm<00:01:15.080> going<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.560> say<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.950> average<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.570> 10<00:01:17.570> days

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
I'm going to say the average is 10 days

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.719 
I'm going to say the average is 10 days
and<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.229> differentiate<00:01:19.009> between<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.460> truck

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
and you differentiate between the truck

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.029 
and you differentiate between the truck
in<00:01:19.909> a<00:01:20.000> car<00:01:20.179> what<00:01:21.080> we<00:01:21.170> do<00:01:21.289> is<00:01:21.380> put<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.590> seat<00:01:21.890> in

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
in a car what we do is put the seat in

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.639 
in a car what we do is put the seat in
the<00:01:22.399> actual<00:01:23.090> vehicle<00:01:23.569> and<00:01:23.899> people<00:01:24.200> get<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:24.500> and

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
the actual vehicle and people get in and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.590 
the actual vehicle and people get in and
out<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.100> if<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.729> opening<00:01:26.179> is<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.360> little

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
out so if the opening is a little

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.440 
out so if the opening is a little
different<00:01:27.080> if<00:01:27.850> different<00:01:28.850> heights<00:01:29.209> of<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
different if different heights of the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.149 
different if different heights of the
vehicle<00:01:29.840> we<00:01:30.229> have<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:30.560> measure<00:01:30.709> niche<00:01:31.009> and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
vehicle we have to measure niche and

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.190 
vehicle we have to measure niche and
every<00:01:31.399> time<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.179> about<00:01:32.659> simulate<00:01:33.110> for

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
every time and just about simulate for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.830 
every time and just about simulate for
that<00:01:33.350> is<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.619> yes<00:01:33.799> yes<00:01:34.580> every<00:01:35.030> every<00:01:35.479> time<00:01:35.690> we

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
that is it yes yes every every time we

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.779 
that is it yes yes every every time we
set<00:01:36.049> this<00:01:36.229> up<00:01:36.409> we<00:01:36.619> have<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.890> adjust<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.520> looks

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
set this up we have to adjust it looks

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.029 
set this up we have to adjust it looks
like<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.060> going<00:01:38.209> higher<00:01:38.479> got<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:38.750> good<00:01:39.039> yeah

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
like it's going higher got a good yeah

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.930 
like it's going higher got a good yeah
that<00:01:40.250> would<00:01:40.429> assume<00:01:40.729> that's<00:01:40.909> correct<00:01:41.179> yeah

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
that would assume that's correct yeah

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.390 
that would assume that's correct yeah
you<00:01:43.780> put<00:01:43.960> different<00:01:44.230> materials<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.070> robot

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
you put different materials on the robot

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.370 
you put different materials on the robot
that's<00:01:45.670> in<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.940> different<00:01:46.300> types<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.660> we<00:01:47.110> tent

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
that's in the different types of we tent

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.900 
that's in the different types of we tent
then<00:01:47.680> we<00:01:47.770> tend<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.040> use<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.400> one<00:01:48.580> material

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
then we tend to use the one material

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.970 
then we tend to use the one material
that<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> duck<00:01:50.110> cloth<00:01:50.380> that's<00:01:50.590> very<00:01:50.800> similar

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
that is a duck cloth that's very similar

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.930 
that is a duck cloth that's very similar
to<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.230> jeans<00:01:53.560> material<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.310> see<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.670> well

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
to like a jeans material I see it well

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.300 
to like a jeans material I see it well
and<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.080> that's<00:01:56.230> that's<00:01:56.620> only<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:57.040> we<00:01:57.160> use

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
and that that's that's only one we use

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.710 
and that that's that's only one we use
and<00:01:57.490> what<00:01:57.700> do<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.120> data<00:01:58.300> afterwards

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
and what do you do the data afterwards

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.840 
and what do you do the data afterwards
so<00:01:59.050> 50<00:01:59.680> thousand<00:02:00.070> times<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.610> then<00:02:00.730> what

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
so 50 thousand times and then what

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.940 
so 50 thousand times and then what
happens<00:02:01.210> there's<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:01.600> valuation<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.740> seat

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
happens there's a valuation of the seat

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.500 
happens there's a valuation of the seat
material<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.610> comfort<00:02:04.000> people<00:02:04.210> come<00:02:04.480> out

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
material and comfort people come out

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
and of course at the same time they

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.830 
and of course at the same time they
would<00:02:53.800> mount<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.310> pickup<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.030> machine<00:02:55.810> just

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
would mount the pickup on a machine just

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.350 
would mount the pickup on a machine just
like<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.709> one<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.430> could<00:02:57.580> compress<00:02:58.090> a

hours<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:01.690> today<00:03:01.930> they<00:03:02.140> do<00:03:02.200> something<00:03:02.650> even

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
hours but today they do something even

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.960 
hours but today they do something even
more<00:03:03.220> extraordinary<00:03:05.280> they<00:03:06.280> use<00:03:06.430> robotic

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
more extraordinary they use robotic

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.630 
more extraordinary they use robotic
drivers<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.780> can<00:03:07.959> drive<00:03:08.200> well<00:03:08.470> almost<00:03:08.739> 24/7

drivers that can drive well almost 24/7

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.150 
drivers that can drive well almost 24/7
we've<00:03:10.300> run<00:03:10.600> some<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:11.380> our<00:03:11.500> vehicles<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.010> could

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
we've run some of our vehicles you could

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160 
we've run some of our vehicles you could
choose<00:03:12.310> 10<00:03:12.610> 2<00:03:12.850> hours<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.239> run<00:03:13.420> time<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.840> one<00:03:13.959> day

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
choose 10 2 hours of run time in one day

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.280 
choose 10 2 hours of run time in one day
and<00:03:14.380> that's<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.950> event<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.239> then<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
and that's on the event so and then the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.130 
and that's on the event so and then the
vehicle<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:17.950> was<00:03:18.100> on<00:03:18.280> was<00:03:18.519> won<00:03:18.760> a

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
vehicle that that was on was won a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.750 
vehicle that that was on was won a
couple<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.260> roads<00:03:20.440> we've<00:03:20.680> said<00:03:20.980> are<00:03:21.130> so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
couple of the roads we've said are so

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.430 
couple of the roads we've said are so
severe<00:03:22.120> we<00:03:22.239> don't<00:03:22.420> allow<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.690> drivers<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.230> go

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
severe we don't allow the drivers to go

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.060 
severe we don't allow the drivers to go
on<00:03:23.590> them<00:03:23.709> anymore

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
on them anymore

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.170 
on them anymore
so<00:03:24.310> these<00:03:24.459> are<00:03:24.610> B<00:03:24.730> these<00:03:24.910> are<00:03:25.060> more

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
so these are B these are more

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.280 
so these are B these are more
representative

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
representative

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.229 
representative
and<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.099> would<00:03:28.220> do<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.610> for<00:03:28.939> say<00:03:29.180> you

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
and it would do that for say you

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.050 
and it would do that for say you
mentioned<00:03:30.170> up<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.409> 20<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.920> 24<00:03:31.370> hours<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.700> day<00:03:31.730> on

mentioned up to 20 to 24 hours a day on
pumps<00:03:32.510> like<00:03:32.689> that<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.489> obviously<00:03:34.489> it's<00:03:34.670> quite

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
pumps like that so obviously it's quite

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.640 
pumps like that so obviously it's quite
severe<00:03:35.299> for<00:03:35.569> people<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.110> that's<00:03:36.200> why<00:03:36.470> we've

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
severe for people and that's why we've

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.350 
severe for people and that's why we've
