step<00:02:01.690> around<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.810> bottom<00:02:03.080> of<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.350> insert

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
step around the bottom of the insert

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.670 
step around the bottom of the insert
it's<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.220> lot<00:02:04.550> trickier<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.990> didn't<00:02:06.560> have

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
it's a lot trickier and I didn't have

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.050 
it's a lot trickier and I didn't have
the<00:02:06.710> right<00:02:06.920> material<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.520> was<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> little<00:02:07.940> bit

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
the right material it was a little bit

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.400 
the right material it was a little bit
thicker<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.810> know<00:02:08.929> just<00:02:09.140> didn't<00:02:09.350> perform

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
thicker and you know just didn't perform

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.250 
thicker and you know just didn't perform
as<00:02:09.770> well<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:10.489> it's<00:02:10.640> very<00:02:10.790> durable<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.330> you

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
as well but it's very durable so you

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.890 
as well but it's very durable so you
know<00:02:12.350> I<00:02:12.380> wanted<00:02:12.680> something<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:12.980> was<00:02:13.100> both

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
know I wanted something that was both

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.880 
know I wanted something that was both
you<00:02:14.900> know<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.110> looked<00:02:15.320> good<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.709> looks

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
you know it looked good and it looks

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.220 
you know it looked good and it looks
pretty<00:02:16.280> much<00:02:16.580> apart<00:02:17.510> from<00:02:17.600> being<00:02:17.810> red<00:02:17.989> it's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
pretty much apart from being red it's

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.920 
pretty much apart from being red it's
very<00:02:18.500> very<00:02:18.650> similar<00:02:18.980> pattern<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.600> OEM

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
very very similar pattern to the the OEM

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.350 
very very similar pattern to the the OEM
one<00:02:21.110> but<00:02:21.950> um<00:02:22.100> yes<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:22.790> just<00:02:22.820> wanna<00:02:23.060> start<00:02:23.239> from

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
one but um yes I just wanna start from

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.240 
one but um yes I just wanna start from
the<00:02:23.450> top<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.840> work<00:02:24.350> your<00:02:24.500> way<00:02:24.560> down<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.040> just

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
the top and work your way down and just

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:35.410 
the top and work your way down and just
stretch<00:02:25.670> out<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.940> creases<00:02:26.480> and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:44.089 

you

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.489 

um<00:02:44.629> start<00:02:45.629> cutting<00:02:45.959> off<00:02:46.019> some<00:02:46.200> excess

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:46.499 
um start cutting off some excess

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:55.980 
um start cutting off some excess
material

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.850 

you<00:02:56.990> want<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.170> make<00:02:57.260> sure<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.500> do<00:02:57.680> leave

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
you want to make sure you do leave

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.530 
you want to make sure you do leave
enough<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.430> when<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.760> can<00:02:58.940> come<00:02:59.420> to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
enough so that when you can come to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.710 
enough so that when you can come to
trimming<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.020> can<00:03:00.200> have<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> bit<00:03:00.530> more<00:03:00.680> play

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
trimming it you can have a bit more play

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.000 
trimming it you can have a bit more play
so<00:03:02.720> around<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.050> corners<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.440> do<00:03:03.560> have<00:03:03.710> to<00:03:03.800> cut

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
so around the corners you do have to cut

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.130 
so around the corners you do have to cut
slight<00:03:04.820> strips<00:03:05.420> depending<00:03:05.780> how<00:03:05.870> stretchy

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
slight strips depending how stretchy

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.610 
slight strips depending how stretchy
your<00:03:06.350> material<00:03:06.740> is<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.270> just<00:03:08.300> helps<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.750> go

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
your material is and it just helps to go

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.100 
your material is and it just helps to go
around<00:03:09.770> corners<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.190> iron<00:03:10.850> out<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.120> creases

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.670 

now<00:03:17.920> on<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.220> inside<00:03:18.370> corner<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:20.440> do<00:03:20.560> have

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
now on the inside corner and you do have

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.490 
now on the inside corner and you do have
to<00:03:20.800> cut<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:20.980> small<00:03:21.370> slit<00:03:21.730> similar<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.930> what<00:03:23.380> I've

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
to cut a small slit similar to what I've

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.980 
to cut a small slit similar to what I've
got<00:03:23.680> here<00:03:23.890> now<00:03:24.670> this<00:03:25.180> side<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.450> completely

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
got here now this side is completely

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.390 
got here now this side is completely
hidden<00:03:26.170> when<00:03:26.470> it's<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.710> door<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.220> just

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
hidden when it's on the door so you just

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.100 
hidden when it's on the door so you just
need<00:03:27.520> a<00:03:27.550> depending<00:03:28.090> how<00:03:28.180> stretchy<00:03:28.570> again<00:03:28.870> your

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
need a depending how stretchy again your

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.290 
need a depending how stretchy again your
material<00:03:29.560> material<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.790> is<00:03:30.940> what<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.090> had

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
material material is this is what I had

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.530 
material material is this is what I had
to<00:03:31.390> do<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:33.040> crease<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:33.370> helps<00:03:33.850> hold

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
to do and that crease just helps hold

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.450 
to do and that crease just helps hold
everything<00:03:34.870> there<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.160> just<00:03:36.190> want<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
everything there and you just want to

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.910 
everything there and you just want to
work<00:03:36.640> your<00:03:36.820> way<00:03:36.940> around<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:38.500> make<00:03:38.590> sure
