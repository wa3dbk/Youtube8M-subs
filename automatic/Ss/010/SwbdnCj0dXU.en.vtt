00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
to baby or learn with us

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.440 
to baby or learn with us
and<00:03:11.830> he<00:03:13.650> said<00:03:14.650> well<00:03:15.030> actually<00:03:16.030> I've<00:03:16.420> been

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
and he said well actually I've been

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.059 
and he said well actually I've been
thinking<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.319> think<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.770> best<00:03:17.920> thing

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
thinking and I think that the best thing

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.559 
thinking and I think that the best thing
to<00:03:18.280> do<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.550> put<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:19.000> baby<00:03:19.180> up<00:03:19.300> for<00:03:19.390> adoption

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
to do is to put the baby up for adoption

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.220 
to do is to put the baby up for adoption
and<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.340> when<00:03:21.610> he<00:03:21.819> mentioned<00:03:22.300> adoption<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.959> just

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
and so when he mentioned adoption I just

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.520 
and so when he mentioned adoption I just
lost<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.620> because<00:03:24.450> there<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:25.630> absolutely<00:03:26.260> no

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
lost it because there is absolutely no

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.800 
lost it because there is absolutely no
way<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.099> million<00:03:27.580> sold<00:03:28.030> my<00:03:28.390> baby<00:03:28.599> up<00:03:28.780> for

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
way in a million sold my baby up for

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.780
