operator it's the brother of the MT 60
the<00:00:16.049> difference<00:00:16.439> being<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.189> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the difference being that this is a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.790 
the difference being that this is a
combi<00:00:17.760> unit<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:19.080> separate

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
combi unit so it's actually separate

fridge and freezer simultaneously so

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.830 
fridge and freezer simultaneously so
we've<00:00:22.350> got<00:00:22.530> a<00:00:22.619> 32<00:00:23.130> litre<00:00:23.340> fridge<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.270> 25

this end to adjust our temperature and
we've<00:01:13.140> also<00:01:13.320> got<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> digital<00:01:13.860> readout<00:01:14.430> here

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
we've also got a digital readout here

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.770 
we've also got a digital readout here
that<00:01:14.790> tells<00:01:15.000> us<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> temperature

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that tells us what the temperature

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.690 
that tells us what the temperature
inside<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> unit<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> without<00:01:17.310> having<00:01:17.610> to
