00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
adds a nice touch to it for our power

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.179 
adds a nice touch to it for our power
bank<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.840> definitely<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.380> very<00:00:31.650> slim<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
built for a power bank I wouldn't mind

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.760 
built for a power bank I wouldn't mind
showing<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.930> off<00:00:46.050> next<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.530> phone<00:00:46.739> because

showing it off next to my phone because
of<00:00:47.280> its<00:00:47.399> design<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.450> probably<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.870> of

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
of its design this is probably one of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.330 
of its design this is probably one of
the<00:00:49.020> best<00:00:49.230> looking<00:00:49.410> power<00:00:49.770> banks<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.190> I've

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the best looking power banks that I've

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.310 
the best looking power banks that I've
seen<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> while<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.809> thing<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.110> did

seen in a while the one thing that I did

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.869 
seen in a while the one thing that I did
notice<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.070> white<00:00:53.250> exterior<00:00:53.610> can

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
notice is that the white exterior can

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.209 
notice is that the white exterior can
get<00:00:54.059> dirty<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.629> easily<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.070> of
