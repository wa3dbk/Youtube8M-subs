00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
it like that and the idea is to have a

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.140 
it like that and the idea is to have a
the<00:06:19.840> omelet<00:06:20.169> in<00:06:20.350> France<00:06:20.710> usually<00:06:21.700> also<00:06:21.910> a

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
the omelet in France usually also a

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.090 
the omelet in France usually also a
little<00:06:22.479> still<00:06:23.020> a<00:06:23.050> little<00:06:23.260> liquid<00:06:23.530> they're<00:06:23.919> not

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
little still a little liquid they're not

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.000 
little still a little liquid they're not
totally<00:06:24.520> cooked<00:06:25.320> it<00:06:26.320> cook<00:06:27.130> through<00:06:27.430> aha<00:06:28.560> but<00:06:29.560> I

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
totally cooked it cook through aha but I

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.239 
totally cooked it cook through aha but I
guess<00:06:30.310> still<00:06:31.120> needs<00:06:31.330> a<00:06:31.419> little<00:06:31.600> more

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:35.249 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.789 

but<00:06:35.579> it's<00:06:35.759> looking<00:06:36.059> good<00:06:36.619> what<00:06:37.619> you're
