00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
there are two distinct ways when it's

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.069 
there are two distinct ways when it's
called<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.700> hard<00:03:04.970> break<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.660> other<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:06.049> a

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
called a hard break and the other is a

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.759 
called a hard break and the other is a
soft<00:03:06.410> way<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.880> soft<00:03:08.150> brake<00:03:08.480> raise<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.410> toe<00:03:09.590> on
