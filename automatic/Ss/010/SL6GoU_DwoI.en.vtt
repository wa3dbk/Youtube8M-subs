00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.460
 hello to all joffrey the south african 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.929
 at stake commented on the campus door 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.369
 he notes to the account of his life 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.189
 who was a big man in the midfield 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.890
 I'll think about it sooner for the more adventurous looking for a good camp 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.789
 drive 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.829
 from 42 euros 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.380
 his palm we have all kinds 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.909
 he kills your correct 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.469
 it's clear that this is the palm not the most disappointed thing about sports 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.660
 and that's okay m 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.450
 very very correct 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.670
 we find flat seams 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.790
 on the top of the ggan 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.670
 we find mainly latex 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 a small relief here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.060
 at the level of the phalanges 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.380
 % antoine mortuary 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.180
 when leaving classes 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.460
 corduant tissues 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.610
 for better flexibility 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.390
 the main characteristic of judgment 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 it is that his cut beast 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.070
 eight shots inside the camp 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 you have really allowed us to hold hands 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.670
 we can see right away we feel 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.689
 this layer of tax inside the camp the world 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 anti-slip that goes back to 22 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.780
 very very well maintain 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 despite everything we still find very good flexibility 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.630
 at the level of policed â€‹â€‹language a classic montage with a double fault 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.000
 Keestrack 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.980
 and sometimes 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.980
 we are in the country 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 very good flexibility 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.240
 however 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.050
 with a good price-quality ratio 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.870
 I really recommend 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.790
 all winners looking for a big 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.210
 good workout quality it was and I was braking waste there 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.880
 has only one step
