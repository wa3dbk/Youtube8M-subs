00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.430 
in this room where I don't know why but
it's<00:02:08.700> always<00:02:08.850> like<00:02:09.030> three<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> four<00:02:09.630> kills<00:02:09.869> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
it's always like three to four kills and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.100 
it's always like three to four kills and
then<00:02:10.679> they<00:02:10.770> become<00:02:10.950> non<00:02:11.160> aggressive<00:02:11.840> at<00:02:12.840> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
then they become non aggressive at that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.660 
then they become non aggressive at that
point<00:02:13.380> where<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.650> could<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.100> go<00:02:14.400> over<00:02:14.430> here
