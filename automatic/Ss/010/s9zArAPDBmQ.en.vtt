is<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:16.520> tank<00:00:16.850> proving<00:00:17.240> ground<00:00:17.480> which<00:00:18.020> will

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
is the tank proving ground which will

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.499 
is the tank proving ground which will
lead<00:00:18.800> you<00:00:18.950> into<00:00:19.099> imagine<00:00:19.939> what<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.150> course<00:00:20.360> is

lead you into imagine what the course is

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.359 
lead you into imagine what the course is
like<00:00:20.689> a<00:00:20.750> little<00:00:21.080> bit<00:00:21.169> so<00:00:21.560> just<00:00:21.830> on<00:00:21.919> the<00:00:22.009> recce

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
like a little bit so just on the recce

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.720 
like a little bit so just on the recce
it's<00:00:22.849> very<00:00:23.630> fast<00:00:24.110> in<00:00:24.529> places<00:00:25.220> there's<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.550> lot

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
it's very fast in places there's a lot

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.330 
it's very fast in places there's a lot
of<00:00:25.880> straights<00:00:26.570> far<00:00:27.380> from<00:00:27.590> our<00:00:27.739> lungs<00:00:28.009> some<00:00:28.250> of

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
of straights far from our lungs some of

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.280 
of straights far from our lungs some of
them<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:29.329> some<00:00:29.509> of<00:00:29.540> them<00:00:29.689> it's<00:00:29.779> very<00:00:29.989> smooth

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
them and some of them it's very smooth

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.740 
them and some of them it's very smooth
actually<00:00:30.770> it's<00:00:30.919> on<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:31.279> smooth<00:00:31.550> concrete<00:00:31.790> the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
actually it's on the smooth concrete the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.170 
actually it's on the smooth concrete the
rest<00:00:32.899> of<00:00:33.050> it<00:00:33.170> is<00:00:33.350> bumping<00:00:33.950> up<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:34.219> down<00:00:34.399> sort

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
rest of it is bumping up and down sort

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.280 
rest of it is bumping up and down sort
of<00:00:35.300> what<00:00:35.390> we<00:00:35.480> used<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.630> call<00:00:35.780> you<00:00:35.840> motocross

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
of what we used to call you motocross

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.500 
of what we used to call you motocross
work<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.649> do<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.160> you've<00:00:37.489> got<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:37.730> sort<00:00:38.360> of<00:00:38.450> a

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
work to do so you've got a sort of a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.810 
work to do so you've got a sort of a
horrible<00:00:38.809> resonant<00:00:39.770> sort<00:00:40.040> of<00:00:40.130> sets<00:00:40.340> up<00:00:40.579> in<00:00:40.730> the

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
horrible resonant sort of sets up in the

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.240 
horrible resonant sort of sets up in the
vehicle<00:00:41.239> where<00:00:41.510> it's<00:00:41.690> eating<00:00:42.200> a<00:00:42.290> breast<00:00:42.559> takes

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
vehicle where it's eating a breast takes

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.550 
vehicle where it's eating a breast takes
off<00:00:43.490> and<00:00:43.700> lands<00:00:43.910> on<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.330> upslope<00:00:44.810> of<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.260> next

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
off and lands on the upslope of the next

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.620 
off and lands on the upslope of the next
press<00:00:45.770> we'll<00:00:46.580> have<00:00:46.700> to<00:00:46.820> see<00:00:47.000> what<00:00:47.150> speed<00:00:47.450> we

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
press we'll have to see what speed we

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.569 
press we'll have to see what speed we
can<00:00:47.750> get<00:00:47.900> across<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.680> we'll<00:00:48.800> jump<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.340> clear

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
can get across and we'll jump and clear

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.130 
can get across and we'll jump and clear
and<00:00:49.760> land<00:00:49.940> on<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.210> downside<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.870> smoke

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
and land on the downside and smoke

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.720 
and land on the downside and smoke
unfortunately<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.100> lot<00:00:52.220> of<00:00:52.250> them<00:00:52.430> are<00:00:52.579> quite

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
unfortunately a lot of them are quite

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.580 
unfortunately a lot of them are quite
well<00:00:53.000> spaced<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:53.630> it's<00:00:54.020> gonna<00:00:54.140> be<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.320> case<00:00:54.440> of

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
well spaced so it's gonna be a case of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.040 
well spaced so it's gonna be a case of
driving<00:00:54.950> through<00:00:55.130> them<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:56.390> whether<00:00:56.780> our

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
driving through them so whether our

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.860 
driving through them so whether our
production<00:00:57.860> classes<00:00:58.210> limited<00:00:59.210> modifications

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
production classes limited modifications

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.030 
production classes limited modifications
are<00:01:00.020> going<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.200> hinder<00:01:00.380> us<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.620> bit<00:01:00.739> here<00:01:00.920> I'm

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
are going to hinder us a bit here I'm

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.700 
are going to hinder us a bit here I'm
not<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:01.340> sure<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.970> Modifieds<00:01:02.420> with<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.470> long

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
not so sure the Modifieds with the long

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.060 
not so sure the Modifieds with the long
travel<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.420> corner<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:09.229> we'll<00:01:09.829> see<00:01:09.979> how<00:01:10.040> we

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
travel to the corner so we'll see how we

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:22.990 
travel to the corner so we'll see how we
get<00:01:10.250> on

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.730 

well<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:23.960> was<00:01:24.080> there<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:24.530> was<00:01:24.650> an

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
well that was there it was an

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.770 
well that was there it was an
interesting<00:01:25.040> first<00:01:25.460> lap<00:01:25.850> as<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.450> said<00:01:26.630> there's

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
interesting first lap as I said there's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.470 
interesting first lap as I said there's
a<00:01:26.840> lot<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.080> whoops<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:27.590> there<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.180> it's<00:01:29.180> very

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
a lot of whoops in there and it's very

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.590 
a lot of whoops in there and it's very
soft<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.370> we're<00:01:31.370> kind<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:31.670> launching<00:01:32.180> off<00:01:32.330> one

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
soft so we're kind of launching off one

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.570 
soft so we're kind of launching off one
on<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.110> next<00:01:33.350> one<00:01:33.560> there's<00:01:33.830> a<00:01:33.920> big<00:01:34.160> rush

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
on to the next one there's a big rush

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.280 
on to the next one there's a big rush
where<00:01:34.880> we<00:01:35.000> had<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.120> heavy<00:01:35.360> impact<00:01:35.540> on<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.050> front

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
where we had a heavy impact on the front

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.440 
where we had a heavy impact on the front
I<00:01:36.350> think<00:01:36.470> everything's<00:01:36.920> all<00:01:37.070> right<00:01:37.270> we<00:01:38.270> did

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
I think everything's all right we did

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.600 
I think everything's all right we did
just<00:01:38.600> take<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.260> bit<00:01:39.380> cautiously<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.490> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
just take it a bit cautiously on the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.670 
just take it a bit cautiously on the
third<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.510> first<00:01:41.750> run<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.230> see<00:01:42.380> what<00:01:42.560> it

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
third on the first run to see what it

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.810 
third on the first run to see what it
was<00:01:42.770> like

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.670 

yeah<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.450> alright<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.930> rough<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.530> too

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
yeah it's alright it's rough it's too

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.650 
yeah it's alright it's rough it's too
rough<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.580> suspension<00:01:53.910> was<00:01:54.150> gone

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
rough really for the suspension was gone

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.620 
rough really for the suspension was gone
look<00:01:55.260> at<00:01:55.380> him<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:56.430> separate<00:01:57.390> set<00:01:57.600> of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
look at him this is a separate set of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.120 
look at him this is a separate set of
suspension<00:01:58.200> specially<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.800> here<00:01:58.920> but

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
suspension specially for here but

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.440 
suspension specially for here but
husband<00:01:59.460> not<00:01:59.550> been<00:01:59.700> here<00:01:59.820> before<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.270> don't

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
husband not been here before we don't

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:12.580 
husband not been here before we don't
know<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> look<00:02:00.840> at<00:02:00.930> it

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.610 

run<00:02:13.250> seven<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.090> just<00:02:14.300> completed<00:02:14.630> near<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.470> end

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
run seven we just completed near the end

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.949 
run seven we just completed near the end
of<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.069> stage<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.940> very<00:02:17.270> tight<00:02:17.569> hairpin

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
of the stage is a very tight hairpin

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.800 
of the stage is a very tight hairpin
left<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.800> it's<00:02:19.730> rough<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.300> think<00:02:20.510> it's

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
left and it's rough so I think it's

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.589 
left and it's rough so I think it's
tweaked<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.500> nearside<00:02:22.430> driveshafts<00:02:23.060> after

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
tweaked the nearside driveshafts after

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.540 
tweaked the nearside driveshafts after
cv<00:02:23.930> joined<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.349> expects<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.830> Gator<00:02:25.010> off<00:02:25.280> so

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
cv joined the expects the Gator off so

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.670 
cv joined the expects the Gator off so
we're<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:25.700> having<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.209> haven't<00:02:27.200> changed<00:02:27.530> that

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
we're just having a haven't changed that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.110 
we're just having a haven't changed that
so<00:02:27.950> we'll<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> look<00:02:28.370> at<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.610> joint<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.970> see

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
so we'll have a look at the joint to see

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.820 
so we'll have a look at the joint to see
whether<00:02:29.269> actually<00:02:29.660> did<00:02:29.840> switch<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.380> joint<00:02:30.590> or

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
whether actually did switch the joint or

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:40.710 
whether actually did switch the joint or
not

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.630 

we'll<00:02:41.230> come<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:41.560> down<00:02:41.740> ill<00:02:42.010> round<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.460> long

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
we'll come in down ill round a long

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.060 
we'll come in down ill round a long
right-hander<00:02:43.300> in<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.960> dust<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.590> they've<00:02:44.830> got

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
right-hander in the dust and they've got

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.720 
right-hander in the dust and they've got
these<00:02:46.110> these<00:02:47.110> concrete<00:02:47.680> bits<00:02:48.040> at<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.280> side<00:02:48.550> of

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
these these concrete bits at the side of

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.630 
these these concrete bits at the side of
the<00:02:48.850> track<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.390> stop<00:02:49.600> tanks<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.320> space<00:02:50.650> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
the track to stop tanks of space and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.420 
the track to stop tanks of space and
we've<00:02:52.210> had<00:02:52.510> we<00:02:53.470> went<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.710> little<00:02:53.740> bit<00:02:53.950> wide<00:02:54.190> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
we've had we went a little bit wide and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.040 
we've had we went a little bit wide and
hit<00:02:54.520> one<00:02:54.670> with<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.880> back<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.180> vehicle<00:02:55.360> but

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
hit one with the back of the vehicle but

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.200 
hit one with the back of the vehicle but
we<00:02:56.110> can't<00:02:56.440> believe<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.920> we've<00:02:57.190> got<00:02:57.340> damage

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
we can't believe that we've got damage

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:08.160 
we can't believe that we've got damage
and<00:02:58.510> always<00:02:58.750> expecting<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.800> lot<00:03:00.370> worse<00:03:07.110> okay<00:03:08.110> so

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
and always expecting a lot worse okay so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.040 
and always expecting a lot worse okay so
you<00:03:08.380> stay<00:03:08.650> tuned<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.370> our<00:03:10.060> lap<00:03:10.450> times<00:03:10.750> are

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
you stay tuned and our lap times are

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
you stay tuned and our lap times are
much<00:03:11.290> better<00:03:11.530> already

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
much better already

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.520 
much better already
yeah<00:03:12.520> we<00:03:12.730> just<00:03:12.760> got<00:03:13.270> out<00:03:13.450> really<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:14.050> do<00:03:14.320> some

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
yeah we just got out really to do some

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.580 
yeah we just got out really to do some
consistent<00:03:15.040> runs<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:16.200> strangely<00:03:17.200> where

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
consistent runs and strangely where

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.650 
consistent runs and strangely where
we're<00:03:18.250> going<00:03:18.430> quicker<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:19.090> with<00:03:19.270> us<00:03:19.450> because

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
we're going quicker so with us because

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.140 
we're going quicker so with us because
I'm<00:03:19.810> picking<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.440> better<00:03:20.620> line<00:03:21.060> rather<00:03:22.060> than

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
I'm picking a better line rather than

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.440 
I'm picking a better line rather than
just<00:03:22.420> going<00:03:22.630> out

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
just going out

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.290 
just going out
I<00:03:24.480> don't<00:03:24.690> know<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.050> maybe<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.950> consistency<00:03:26.670> is

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
I don't know so maybe the consistency is

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:40.309 
I don't know so maybe the consistency is
actually

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.319 

the<00:03:40.829> same<00:03:41.069> table<00:03:41.519> top<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.939> taught<00:03:42.299> us

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
the same table top of it taught us

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.360 
the same table top of it taught us
earlier<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.930> with<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.379> heavy<00:03:43.530> London<00:03:44.010> we<00:03:44.250> went

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
earlier on with the heavy London we went

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.880 
earlier on with the heavy London we went
extra<00:03:44.760> gentle<00:03:44.969> this<00:03:45.180> time<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.769> as<00:03:46.769> I've

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
extra gentle this time and as I've

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.410 
extra gentle this time and as I've
landed<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.400> think<00:03:47.609> I<00:03:47.790> must<00:03:48.030> have<00:03:48.060> been<00:03:48.209> touching

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
landed I think I must have been touching

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.209 
landed I think I must have been touching
the<00:03:48.569> brightest<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.079> mean<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.409> it's<00:03:49.560> Java<00:03:49.890> from

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:50.219 
the brightest I mean but it's Java from

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.369 
the brightest I mean but it's Java from
different<00:03:50.670> broken<00:03:50.879> from<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.150> dip<00:03:51.359> so<00:03:51.689> we've

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
different broken from the dip so we've

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.750 
different broken from the dip so we've
just<00:03:52.409> done<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.769> run<00:03:52.950> pretty<00:03:53.400> much<00:03:53.549> from<00:03:53.700> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
just done the run pretty much from the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.460 
just done the run pretty much from the
start<00:03:53.819> almost<00:03:54.379> into<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.409> drive<00:03:56.390> about

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
start almost into a drive about

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.800 
start almost into a drive about
insecticide<00:03:58.819> not<00:03:59.819> too<00:03:59.970> bad<00:04:00.120> I'm<00:04:00.390> gonna<00:04:00.510> grin

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
insecticide not too bad I'm gonna grin

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.809 
insecticide not too bad I'm gonna grin
it<00:04:00.900> again<00:04:01.140> it's<00:04:01.890> not<00:04:02.040> worthless<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.549> committee

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
it again it's not worthless to committee

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.300 
it again it's not worthless to committee
fountains<00:04:03.239> run<00:04:03.390> salty<00:04:03.870> for<00:04:04.470> one<00:04:04.650> run<00:04:04.859> what

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
fountains run salty for one run what

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.190 
fountains run salty for one run what
we're<00:04:05.459> game<00:04:05.609> so<00:04:05.970> we're<00:04:06.480> gonna<00:04:06.599> run<00:04:06.780> again<00:04:06.989> into

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
we're game so we're gonna run again into

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.300 
we're game so we're gonna run again into
or<00:04:07.349> drive<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.250> should<00:04:08.489> be<00:04:08.609> entertaining

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.150 

so<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.239> trucks<00:04:16.480> been<00:04:16.690> very<00:04:17.380> consistent<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:18.070> be

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
so the trucks been very consistent to be

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.979 
so the trucks been very consistent to be
honest<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.700> obviously<00:04:19.150> me<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.299> Russell<00:04:19.630> as

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
honest and obviously me and Russell as

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.500 
honest and obviously me and Russell as
well<00:04:20.170> we've<00:04:20.829> halved<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.670> lot<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:21.970> other<00:04:22.120> people

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
well we've halved a lot of other people

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.800 
well we've halved a lot of other people
with<00:04:22.870> mechanical<00:04:23.380> issues<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.570> we're<00:04:25.570> at<00:04:25.720> the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
with mechanical issues so we're at the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.390 
with mechanical issues so we're at the
end<00:04:25.960> which<00:04:26.169> is<00:04:26.200> what<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:26.470> all<00:04:26.560> counts<00:04:26.889> it's<00:04:27.220> all

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
end which is what it all counts it's all

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.940 
end which is what it all counts it's all
really<00:04:27.580> isn't<00:04:27.790> it<00:04:28.260> means<00:04:29.260> we<00:04:29.440> get<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.830> end

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
really isn't it means we get to the end

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.310 
really isn't it means we get to the end
remember<00:04:30.880> we<00:04:31.150> are<00:04:31.180> in<00:04:31.419> production<00:04:31.510> class<00:04:32.020> and

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
remember we are in production class and

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.379 
remember we are in production class and
pretty<00:04:32.650> much<00:04:32.740> everything<00:04:33.010> around<00:04:33.340> us<00:04:33.580> is

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
pretty much everything around us is

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.000 
pretty much everything around us is
modified<00:04:34.900> apart<00:04:35.320> from<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.530> Freelanders

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
modified apart from the Freelanders

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.430 
modified apart from the Freelanders
which<00:04:36.220> are<00:04:36.669> obviously<00:04:37.030> there<00:04:37.600> well<00:04:37.750> back<00:04:37.990> so

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
which are obviously there well back so

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.710 
which are obviously there well back so
we're<00:04:38.980> still<00:04:39.160> mixed<00:04:39.430> with<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.760> modified<00:04:40.120> even

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
we're still mixed with the modified even

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.320 
we're still mixed with the modified even
