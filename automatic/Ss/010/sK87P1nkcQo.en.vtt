00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
two to three weeks so it's going to be a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.429 
two to three weeks so it's going to be a
pain<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.210> ass<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.630> me<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.200> probably

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
pain in the ass for me so I'm probably

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
pain in the ass for me so I'm probably
gonna<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> buy<00:01:35.100> online<00:01:35.430> labels<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
prints them and they're pretty damn

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.370 
prints them and they're pretty damn
expensive<00:01:37.939> they're<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.420> 499<00:01:39.960> which

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
