00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
buildup of lint and dust but it just

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.430

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
the the rubber there just flex a little

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.979 
the the rubber there just flex a little
bit<00:03:46.400> but<00:03:46.519> with<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.880> with<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.420> sides<00:03:47.690> being

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
bit but with the with the sides being

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.380 
bit but with the with the sides being
locking<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.100> down<00:03:49.130> you're<00:03:49.940> not<00:03:50.060> going<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.269> get

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
locking it down you're not going to get

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.640 
locking it down you're not going to get
any<00:03:50.540> issues<00:03:50.900> with<00:03:51.019> that<00:03:51.080> coming<00:03:51.440> away<00:03:51.620> from

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
any issues with that coming away from

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.610 
any issues with that coming away from
the<00:03:52.070> from<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.820> phone<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:54.110> all<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.440> all<00:03:54.560> I

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
the from the phone and all in all I

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.020 
the from the phone and all in all I
think<00:03:54.769> it<00:03:54.980> offers<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> good<00:03:55.519> balance<00:03:55.940> between

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
think it offers a good balance between

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.120 
think it offers a good balance between
drop<00:03:56.660> protection<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.290> usability<00:03:57.650> you're<00:03:58.010> not

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
drop protection and usability you're not

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.500 
drop protection and usability you're not
adding<00:03:58.250> too<00:03:58.519> much<00:03:58.700> bolt<00:03:59.000> like<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.180> said<00:03:59.390> it's

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
adding too much bolt like I said it's

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.190 
adding too much bolt like I said it's
it's<00:04:00.019> 2.2<00:04:00.650> millimeters<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:02.000> it's<00:04:02.630> not<00:04:02.810> much<00:04:03.050> at

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
it's 2.2 millimeters so it's not much at

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.160 
it's 2.2 millimeters so it's not much at
all<00:04:03.320> and<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.700> lip<00:04:04.880> again<00:04:05.030> is<00:04:05.390> it's<00:04:05.930> pretty
