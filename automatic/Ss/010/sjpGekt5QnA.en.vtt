00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.660
 correct sitting position 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.770
 the team player attitude 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.950

 relaxed on the road on the road are the right seating position it the truck 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.850

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.519
 to replace the correct seating position 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.829
 usually it is little things that can make a lot like we do now 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.420
 The driver should not adjust the seat here 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.470
 in the correct sitting position, the length of the seat must be 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.050
 Distance to the hollow of the knee about half a hand of the driver should be on 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.909
 put the seat all the way back, leaning back against it very easily 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.300
 No pressure should be felt or a tightness in the abdomen to be felt 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.240
 Wild 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.400
 Asia just now he has his powerful and sometimes have the linden trees and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.250
 again warned traffic light card and again sand has been buried we have continued 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.060

 Martin Kaymer 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.810
 Of course, instead of Hofer, the feet have to reach the pedals well 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.420
 the backrest, the lumbar support must be set so 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.200
 That's why the spine has supported it without unpleasant pressure 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.249
 the right seating position a tree 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.079

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.149
 in the second row after the correct sitting position all games must be correct 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:46.069
 be set small tip the vehicle should be slightly on the mirror edge 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.839
 to be seen as well as in this image so that is guaranteed that the dead 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:55.519
 Angle type too lit are also the right on and off is 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.519
