revenge<00:01:33.579> hope<00:01:34.579> girl<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:37.430> question<00:01:37.759> was

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
revenge hope girl so the question was

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.359 
revenge hope girl so the question was
how<00:01:38.329> can<00:01:38.659> I<00:01:38.750> convey<00:01:39.289> those<00:01:39.619> emotions<00:01:40.219> to<00:01:40.340> the

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
how can I convey those emotions to the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.609 
how can I convey those emotions to the
audience<00:01:40.820> successfully<00:01:41.689> all<00:01:41.899> these

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
audience successfully all these

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.499 
audience successfully all these
different<00:01:42.890> emotions<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.640> such<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.909> short<00:01:44.240> time

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
different emotions is such a short time

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.880 
different emotions is such a short time
and<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:46.479> think<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.929> answer<00:01:48.170> was<00:01:48.560> relying

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
and I think the the answer was relying

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.810 
and I think the the answer was relying
on<00:01:49.359> approaching<00:01:50.359> musically<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.170> film<00:01:51.789> with<00:01:52.789> a

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
on approaching musically the film with a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.090 
on approaching musically the film with a
diversity<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.719> dramatic<00:01:54.259> material

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
diversity in the dramatic material

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.490 
diversity in the dramatic material
basically<00:01:55.880> every<00:01:56.509> word<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:56.810> i<00:01:57.170> mentioned

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
basically every word that i mentioned

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.060 
basically every word that i mentioned
before<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:58.039> presents<00:01:58.340> one<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:59.240> piece<00:01:59.929> of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
before it presents one a piece of

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.480 
before it presents one a piece of
musical<00:02:01.070> score<00:02:01.759> having<00:02:02.299> said<00:02:02.539> that<00:02:03.490> because

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
musical score having said that because

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.330 
musical score having said that because
the<00:02:04.759> film<00:02:04.939> itself<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> cycle<00:02:05.929> I<00:02:06.340> decided

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
the film itself is a cycle I decided

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.950 
the film itself is a cycle I decided
that<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:08.060> book<00:02:08.240> ends<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.630> movie<00:02:08.869> i'm

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
that the book ends of the movie i'm

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.250 
that the book ends of the movie i'm
going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.259> use<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.470> same<00:02:09.679> somatic<00:02:10.100> material

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
going to use the same somatic material

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.580 
going to use the same somatic material
differently<00:02:12.640> developed<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.760> course<00:02:14.030> and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
differently developed of course and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.800 
differently developed of course and
let's<00:02:15.590> not<00:02:15.620> forget<00:02:15.740> this<00:02:16.340> movie<00:02:16.819> doesn't<00:02:17.300> have

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
let's not forget this movie doesn't have

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.010 
let's not forget this movie doesn't have
dialogue<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.920> music<00:02:19.550> has<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.990> step<00:02:20.990> up

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
dialogue so the music has to step up

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.980 
dialogue so the music has to step up
even<00:02:21.800> more<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.190> case

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
even more in this case

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.130 
even more in this case
I<00:02:23.080> had<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.860> pleasure<00:02:24.070> of<00:02:24.250> recording<00:02:25.140> the

you<00:03:20.530> spend<00:03:20.800> more<00:03:20.950> time<00:03:21.190> actually<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.819> the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
you spend more time actually on the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.520 
you spend more time actually on the
composition<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.400> orchestration<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.580> the
