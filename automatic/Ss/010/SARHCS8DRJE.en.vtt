human community when one thinks about

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
treating a patient with compassion there

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.080 
treating a patient with compassion there
implies<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:06.159> maybe<00:02:06.369> there's<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.729> time<00:02:07.060> you

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
implies that maybe there's a time you

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.020
