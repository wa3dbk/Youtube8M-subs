00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.660
 The two cities are label label use 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.060
 I'm zero 2012 I'm doing freestyle 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.860
 rap and rap script I am now 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.840
 for three and a half years in berlin 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.840
 all the time in friedrichshain and 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:28.190
 probably also I 'm looking 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.520
 Forgetting politics now and again 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.470
 I did not want to go further 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.379
 steelhead already I do not know what I mean 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.270
 still reach a lot but where 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.910
 a lot of what you leave the tires 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.710
 who can justin conceive interview me 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.260
 have now on three panels 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.510
 participated and have now also the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.040
 last time managed to become x jam like that 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.440
 pretty cool is the point of the week 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.000
 just not one against one peters 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.899
 that there is a crash today if you something 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.430
 five disciplines 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.590
 you just have to be able to show that 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.690
 you may be able to with red back 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.180
 or that you can really flee 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.509
 of course the beats changwon can do that 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.060
 you do not have to agree on it now 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.030
 a small horse is not likely 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.140
 That's how I think I 've got everyone 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.440
 have panic he does not drive but 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.440
 perhaps 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.510
 cause is and you all people that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.870
 Good freestyle is what you can do 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.390
 easy 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.560
 You can just do it like that 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 also get his head free 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.020
 Just let it out and you can get that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.100
 to improve live all the time and texts 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.440
 Writing just did not help 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.680
 for frieslanders and I do not know what 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.680
 it has to be 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:06.680
 and now, web is an original one 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.510
 from a ddr proceeded that we so 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.010
 they often had easy appearances 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.140
 people words on the paper writes 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.100
 let objects give me that 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.810
 came up with the idea that the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.010
 Automate has a little script 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.930
 made then did that as well live already 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.120
 used and then together with one 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.650
 buddy roman evening we have there 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.150
 made outside website and now 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.800
 Meanwhile there is also a mobile app 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.810
 and it's great if you just 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.670
 train freestyle alone 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.860
 there are a random words 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.780
 probably has not seen that yet 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.010
 and in context you do not get on either 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.140
 the words even if you know them and 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.480
 This can improve alone 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.640
 i am not getting old and shaping world 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.460
 continue to take over my form 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.320
 change 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.630
 persuade I think I pretty much give 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.790
 Much time is not wasted on prayers 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.350
 for devices ad absurdum 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.600
 because we are both sides here now 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.520
 and write against direct no we are 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.770
 only rhyming on opposite sides and me 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.020
 now scratch all useless areas 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.810
 pay statement and statement speaking 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.850
 to make a difference the impact 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.130
 you can not even look we are 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.320
 now grow here so fast again 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.920
 as burton is the first time the whole thing 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.000
 web script written with c got one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.710
 to start typing 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.210
 but is the good google the same 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.580
 So that's a webcrypt like it 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.020
 looks like for me , make up and here 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.020
 come some things set 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.610
 most important is first left here 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.440
 above there are the three level one's and 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.730
 Per 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.400
 there you should still be fair 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.720
 because you can also here 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.240
 below then what's important to her 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.540
 adjust speed 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.150
 default is 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.870
 every six seconds a word and that 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.680
 goes up to ad 2 seconds already 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.740
 I would say a challenge 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.820
 up to twelve seconds or for me the 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.590
 Challenge would be for me 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.930
 twelve seconds to try on that word 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.840
 to stay when he comes next 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.800
 changing theme can be an important side 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.550
 one spoke 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.550
 there are german english french 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:22.010
 fast is loads out of me to refrain 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:24.620
 spanish english and up here then 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.050
 also very important at full speed 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.530
 screen increased difficulty two 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.530
 seconds 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.950
 it should be a lesson like that of the 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.110
 Chrysler again but the purpose 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.980
 is not yet salutary let alone 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.780
 effective 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.450
 because I am better and better again 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.010
 better boys the presence of so 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.300
 I'll go to many bad things 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.740
 again what do you want the children 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.380
 determine so I do think that 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.300
 freestyle still an even bigger future 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.860
 maybe that's how it is 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.820
 tools like web script that's what people do 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.310
 really understand 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.840
 So no idea of freestyle 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.460
 have okay since that really thinks 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.810
 out of it makes it spontaneous and the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.220
 linked creates any things 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.450
 maybe even a story too 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.240
 build that random one 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.530
 words that's just more 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.630
 is accepted as has for example 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.850
 also the improvisation in the jazz where that 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.210
 is an art that has been discussed or 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.100
 improvisational theater in 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.080
 futures from this forest after all 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.740
 not much like a director 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.260
 durable 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.669
 this may be my teeth 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.830
 you can not understand because I have 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.570
 it acquainted with italy 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.340
 team managed and autumn what is 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.080
 Well international again what you like 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.700
 says I am now in the Write 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.560
 still only long live and the on 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.169
 and still wait twice from the garden 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.710
 reyhofen freed but the injured wants 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.390
 nothing with 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.240
 I go to the microphone and then the 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.640
 Report reports linux or mac os or 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.320
 finished like the microphone soldiers have 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.540
 I'm not so on the desktop because I 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.100
 people to the lombardy architects 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.990
 are skillful and you will come again 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.970
 I'm doing a Schaumburg one 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.040
 Foam party but now we are 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.290
 alone with philips geiler friend 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.900
 simon two that is she actually 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.969
 not the communities are 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.009
 probably 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.839
 Regina probably still china and 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.919
 his wife so that rhymes with each 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.149
 bring case because since you can not 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.409
 just like that you have to learn 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.979
 you may have a quick one 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.659
 but so must one 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.429
 I want to have fun with it 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.659
 just stay tuned then you will open 

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:20.699
 say every case better than that 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.349
 city ​​council has so shows what small me 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.149
 a work service you are not 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.159
 frankfurter because you do not have enough money 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:29.069
 despite how I am maria times 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:30.959
 busy again and a person like frank 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.969
 who the boats know too 

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:35.219
 so to speak with car I'm never on 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.139
 Governor Bombay peeled louder and 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:39.149
 Recently, the web script finally 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.039
 also and on the go as an app for 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.860
 iphone so far only hopefully in the 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:46.409
 android app script here the setting 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.829
 Sitemap travel four is saying 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:51.149
 fixed times 

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:53.219
 you do not even have the breath of a chance 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:55.709
 down at the microphone I'm not here 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:57.599
 visited and have a wall in my frame 

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:58.949
 still get the dampness would be damp 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.839
 and the whole and ringing it 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:03.089
 the fore what they need what did 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:05.429
 you probably a visit in 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.769
 a state institute I'm not 

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:09.509

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.839
 maybe my parsley format below 

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:27.479
 other industrial family yet me 

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:30.449
