00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.090 

and<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.430> seed<00:01:06.119> pods<00:01:06.799> right<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:08.070> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and we have seed pods right there I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.210 
and we have seed pods right there I
don't<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.390> well

and<00:01:16.760> as<00:01:17.630> they<00:01:17.870> grow<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.590> flowers<00:01:18.979> grow<00:01:19.250> from

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
and as they grow the flowers grow from

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.700 
and as they grow the flowers grow from
the<00:01:20.060> base<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.450> stem<00:01:20.690> upward<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.380> then

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
the base of the stem upward and then

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.340 
the base of the stem upward and then
you'll<00:01:21.950> find<00:01:22.250> seed<00:01:22.550> pods<00:01:22.900> growing<00:01:23.900> up<00:01:24.050> behind

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
you'll find seed pods growing up behind

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.310 
you'll find seed pods growing up behind
the<00:01:24.620> flowers<00:01:25.040> as<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.400> plant<00:01:25.670> matures<00:01:26.320> this

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
the flowers as the plant matures this

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.810
