00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.980 

I'm<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.050> be<00:01:04.199> using<00:01:05.690> purple<00:01:06.690> eyeliner<00:01:07.050> in

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
wine from prestige and I'm going to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.240 
wine from prestige and I'm going to
start<00:01:13.380> making<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.860> little<00:01:14.159> purple<00:01:16.250> stripes

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
so I'm going to start in the middle

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.530 
so I'm going to start in the middle
since<00:01:19.800> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> purple<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.330> on

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
since I don't want the purple to be on

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.420 
since I don't want the purple to be on
the<00:01:21.660> inside<00:01:21.810> since<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:22.650> makes<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.070> hole<00:01:23.250> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
the inside since that makes your hole I
look<00:01:23.640> darker<00:01:24.150> i'm<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> start<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:25.410> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
look darker i'm going to start from the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.109 
look darker i'm going to start from the
light<00:01:25.770> first<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.460> i'm<00:01:26.550> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> draw<00:01:26.910> in<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.400 
light first but i'm going to draw in the
darker<00:01:27.509> first<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:33.080> just<00:01:34.080> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> make<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
darker first so just going to make a

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:51.950 
darker first so just going to make a
line<00:01:34.649> going<00:01:34.830> straight<00:01:35.310> down

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.240

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
going to do about like I guess like a

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:11.990

centimeter<00:01:59.220> apart

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.240 

and<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.810> last<00:02:13.050> one<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.380> going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.710> be

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:32.990 

on<00:02:19.760> me<00:02:20.030> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.320 

like<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.310> ok<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:37.700> I'm<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.940> go<00:02:39.060> ahead<00:02:39.090> and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
like so ok so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.220 
like so ok so I'm going to go ahead and
do<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:41.180> darker<00:02:42.180> part<00:02:42.450> first<00:02:42.720> since<00:02:43.080> it's

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
do the darker part first since it's

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.290 
do the darker part first since it's
easier<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.770> cover<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.460> few<00:02:44.610> mess<00:02:44.790> up<00:02:45.030> I'm

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.850 
easier to cover it up a few mess up I'm
going<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.050> be<00:02:46.140> using<00:02:46.230> an<00:02:46.620> prestige<00:02:48.860> amethyst

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
and I'm going to be using a makeup

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.180 
and I'm going to be using a makeup
sponge<00:02:53.640> because<00:02:54.650> they're<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> little<00:02:55.890> bit<00:02:56.070> more

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
sponge because they're a little bit more

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.620 
sponge because they're a little bit more
precise<00:02:56.610> than<00:02:56.880> brushes<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.510> my<00:02:57.630> opinion

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
precise than brushes in my opinion

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.030 
precise than brushes in my opinion
because<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.870> know<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.050> guys<00:03:01.230> don't<00:03:01.500> all<00:03:01.770> have

because I know you guys don't all have
like<00:03:02.340> full<00:03:02.790> brush<00:03:03.090> sets<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> these<00:03:04.800> are<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
like full brush sets so these are the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.900 
like full brush sets so these are the
easiest<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.730> come<00:03:06.120> across<00:03:07.340> just<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.700> to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
easiest to come across just going to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:27.720 
easiest to come across just going to
fill<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:10.500> purple

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
wing it out so it's like a cat you're

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.909 
wing it out so it's like a cat you're
just<00:05:20.360> going<00:05:20.479> to<00:05:20.539> follow<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:21.050> bottom<00:05:21.379> line<00:05:21.590> and

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
just going to follow the bottom line and

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.580 
just going to follow the bottom line and
keep<00:05:22.550> going<00:05:22.970> outwards<00:05:23.449> to<00:05:23.780> make<00:05:23.930> them<00:05:24.110> even<00:05:24.319> on

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590

keep going outwards to make them even on
both<00:05:24.740> sides<00:05:25.099> and<00:05:25.930> I'm<00:05:26.930> going<00:05:27.110> to<00:05:27.139> use<00:05:27.259> the<00:05:27.409> same

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
both sides and I'm going to use the same

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.119 
both sides and I'm going to use the same
technique<00:05:28.159> to<00:05:28.190> make<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.879> inside<00:05:29.449> corner<00:05:30.129> I'm

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
technique to make the inside corner I'm

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:42.519 
technique to make the inside corner I'm
going<00:05:31.280> to<00:05:31.370> follow<00:05:31.490> this<00:05:31.849> line<00:05:32.169> down

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.529

just<00:05:43.219> like<00:05:43.399> that<00:05:43.579> and<00:05:43.939> then<00:05:44.659> the<00:05:44.839> last<00:05:44.869> step<00:05:45.259> is

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:45.709 
just like that and then the last step is

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:47.649 
just like that and then the last step is
I<00:05:46.399> made<00:05:46.669> these<00:05:46.819> kind<00:05:47.089> of<00:05:47.149> little<00:05:47.419> cat
