00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you do turn them like this it does

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.539 
you do turn them like this it does
become<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.259> more<00:01:16.290> skiable<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.310> like

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
become a little more skiable I do like

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
become a little more skiable I do like
that<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:18.119> why<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> actually<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> on

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that that's why I actually have it on

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.399 
that that's why I actually have it on
display<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.700> them<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.290> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
display is with them like that so that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.179 
display is with them like that so that
it<00:01:22.439> stays<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:23.070> bit<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:24.330> displayable

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
it stays a little bit more displayable

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
it stays a little bit more displayable
but<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.790> me<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> very

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
but that's just me and it is very

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
but that's just me and it is very
fragile<00:01:31.439> I'm<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> pick<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> up

disappointing if they could have found a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.920 
disappointing if they could have found a
way<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.080> throw<00:02:22.650> them<00:02:22.770> back<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.480> throw<00:02:24.480> them<00:02:24.720> on
