00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
rather than his arrival in Las Vegas

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
rather than his arrival in Las Vegas
you've<00:01:30.540> done<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.689> little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.140> press

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
you've done a little bit of a press

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
you've done a little bit of a press

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
conference and he looks more like

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
conference and he looks more like
smaller<00:01:34.320> than<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> thought<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.159> think

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
smaller than what I thought so I think

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
smaller than what I thought so I think
they're<00:01:35.520> obviously<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.360> speed<00:01:36.659> in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

this<00:01:37.049> fight<00:01:37.259> they're<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> try<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> get

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
this fight they're going to try to get

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
in and out but the thing you need to

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.780 
in and out but the thing you need to
understand<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.100> Floyd<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.670> he's

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
understand is with Floyd is that he's

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.469 
understand is with Floyd is that he's
very<00:01:41.840> smart<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.180> hard<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
very smart and it's going to be hard to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.109 
very smart and it's going to be hard to
get<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.960> him<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.939> that's<00:01:47.939> where<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
get to him and get out that's where I

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
get to him and get out that's where I
think<00:01:48.180> manage<00:01:48.540> problem<00:01:48.899> will<00:01:49.500> come<00:01:49.740> from<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
think manage problem will come from is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.760 
think manage problem will come from is
you<00:01:51.119> can't<00:01:51.390> lunge<00:01:51.600> because<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.140> he<00:01:52.200> lunges<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you can't lunge because if he lunges it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
you can't lunge because if he lunges it
open<00:01:53.040> himself<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.640> counter<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.450> hand

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
open himself up for a counter right hand

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.209 
open himself up for a counter right hand
and<00:01:55.009> I<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.610> he<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:58.070> it's<00:01:59.070> just

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and I think if he you know it's just

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.139 
and I think if he you know it's just
going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.460> interesting<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.790> see<00:01:59.939> how<00:01:59.969> he

that Floyd will come out I think that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.350 
that Floyd will come out I think that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
in this fight because if he does Manny

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.400 
in this fight because if he does Manny
will<00:03:15.000> rack<00:03:15.150> up<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> rounds<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.230> best

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
will rack up the rounds that's the best

one<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> problems<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:16.980> Floyd<00:03:17.220> could

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
one of the problems that Floyd could

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.400 
one of the problems that Floyd could
face<00:03:17.609> is<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.060> if<00:03:18.269> he<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:21.390> he's<00:03:21.600> waiting<00:03:22.230> for

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
face is that if he if he's waiting for

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.810 
face is that if he if he's waiting for
money<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.799> continues<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.370> wait<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.670> money

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
money and continues to wait for money

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.130 
money and continues to wait for money
and<00:03:23.910> try<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.150> look<00:03:24.299> for<00:03:24.420> those<00:03:24.480> counters<00:03:24.930> and

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
and try to look for those counters and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.840 
and try to look for those counters and
money<00:03:25.320> does<00:03:25.560> get<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.100> gets<00:03:26.280> out<00:03:26.519> fros

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
money does get in and gets out fros

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.520 
money does get in and gets out fros
loaded<00:03:27.180> punches<00:03:27.480> he<00:03:27.600> could<00:03:27.810> lose<00:03:27.959> roams<00:03:28.230> just

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
loaded punches he could lose roams just

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.840 
loaded punches he could lose roams just
off<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.769> work<00:03:28.920> rate<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.340> that's<00:03:29.489> what<00:03:29.640> Freud

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
off of work rate and that's what Freud

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.370 
off of work rate and that's what Freud
can't<00:03:30.060> do<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.390> fluid<00:03:30.630> will<00:03:30.750> need<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.200> engage

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
can't do so fluid will need to engage

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.319 
can't do so fluid will need to engage
fluid<00:03:31.980> will<00:03:32.069> need<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.400> get<00:03:32.549> into<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:33.120> fight

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
fluid will need to get into the fight

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.740 
fluid will need to get into the fight
and<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:34.799> think<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.549> Floyd<00:03:35.790> will<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.209> think<00:03:36.600> that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
and I think that Floyd will I think that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.410 
and I think that Floyd will I think that
Floyd<00:03:37.019> will<00:03:37.290> pick<00:03:37.650> money<00:03:37.950> apart<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.880> think<00:03:39.329> that

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
Floyd will pick money apart I think that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.180 
Floyd will pick money apart I think that
when<00:03:39.569> money<00:03:39.750> comes<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.290> at<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.709> big<00:03:40.829> early

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
when money comes in at the big early

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.039 
when money comes in at the big early
rounds<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.670> think<00:03:41.910> he's<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.269> try<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.750> do

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
rounds I think he's going to try to do

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.390 
rounds I think he's going to try to do
the<00:03:43.170> game<00:03:43.319> plan<00:03:43.530> which<00:03:43.739> will<00:03:43.829> be<00:03:43.950> whatever<00:03:44.130> it

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the game plan which will be whatever it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.620 
the game plan which will be whatever it
is<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.639> try<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:44.850> cut<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.239> distance<00:03:45.540> between

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
is to try to cut the distance between

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.599 
is to try to cut the distance between
him<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:46.019> fluid<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.709> has<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.859> huge<00:03:47.250> reach

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
him in fluid so it has a huge reach

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.849 
him in fluid so it has a huge reach
advantage<00:03:47.819> over<00:03:48.209> him<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.930> when<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.650> think

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
advantage over him and when I think

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.170 
advantage over him and when I think
Manny<00:03:50.040> realizes<00:03:50.430> that's<00:03:50.549> not<00:03:50.819> going<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.150> work

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
Manny realizes that's not going to work

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.550 
Manny realizes that's not going to work
I<00:03:51.569> think<00:03:51.989> he's<00:03:52.109> going<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.410> bit

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
I think he's going to get a bit

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.900 
I think he's going to get a bit
frustrated<00:03:53.040> he's<00:03:53.190> going<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.370> revert<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.790> type

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
frustrated he's going to revert to type

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.129 
frustrated he's going to revert to type
and<00:03:54.329> that's<00:03:54.480> when<00:03:54.630> it's<00:03:54.720> going<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.870> start<00:03:55.049> to

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
and that's when it's going to start to

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.900 
and that's when it's going to start to
jump<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.859> lunge<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.609> think<00:03:56.639> he's

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
jump in and lunge in and I think he's

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.250 
jump in and lunge in and I think he's
just<00:03:56.970> going<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.209> leave<00:03:57.329> himself<00:03:57.450> open<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:58.019> the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
just going to leave himself open to the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.550 
just going to leave himself open to the
Cook<00:03:58.440> County<00:03:58.470> right<00:03:58.920> hand<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.730> think<00:03:59.940> now

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
Cook County right hand and I think now

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.840 
Cook County right hand and I think now
Floyd<00:04:01.560> will<00:04:01.769> pick<00:04:01.950> him<00:04:02.069> apart<00:04:02.600> money<00:04:03.600> could<00:04:04.049> do

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
Floyd will pick him apart money could do

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.910 
Floyd will pick him apart money could do

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
interesting

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.540 
interesting
especially<00:04:28.169> with<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.680> tactic<00:04:29.189> is<00:04:29.370> that

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
especially with that tactic is that

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.279 
especially with that tactic is that
Freddie<00:04:29.789> Roach<00:04:29.999> is<00:04:30.270> spin<00:04:30.810> saying<00:04:31.050> all<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.199> way

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
but I think it's going to be a very very

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.649 
but I think it's going to be a very very
hard<00:04:57.539> may<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.930> guess<00:04:58.139> it's<00:04:58.949> going<00:04:59.039> to<00:04:59.129> be<00:04:59.189> a<00:04:59.219> very

very<00:05:00.659> hard<00:05:00.900> fight<00:05:01.139> for<00:05:01.319> Floyd<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.710> think<00:05:01.979> that

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
very hard fight for Floyd I think that

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.740 
very hard fight for Floyd I think that
money<00:05:02.250> will<00:05:02.460> give<00:05:02.699> him<00:05:02.819> problems<00:05:03.029> I<00:05:03.419> think

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
money will give him problems I think

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.679 
money will give him problems I think
that<00:05:03.870> Floyd<00:05:04.080> will<00:05:04.319> I<00:05:05.270> think<00:05:06.270> fluids<00:05:06.509> going<00:05:06.539> to
