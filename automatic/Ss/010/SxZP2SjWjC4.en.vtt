00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
 Hail people who say that they need workers is not 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.540
 We did not throw everything for you. 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.880
 how to format your computer 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.709
 next staff 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:10.969
 I would go 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.770
 I was going to do the virtual swimming machine 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.969
 Let's give it to you on your feet. 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.130
 only I found an easier way to use the formatting simulator 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.269
 domains I think it's easier for you to have power but here on the site 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 on site www portovelho they are not good 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.600
 already makes three sets of simulators record formatting 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.710
 Let's be clear. 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.270
 You can walk with him directly. 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.460
 fastest most downloads in the quote collide directly 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 so you can leave 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
 There you will or you will get here simulator 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.690
 simulator racing are prohibited 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.630
 personal accident 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.120
 for those who do not know yet 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.700
 probably you are already configured for the boutique and 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.270
 lips 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.320
 pesky 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.430
 who did not like to play another game explaining this cet 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.100
 but if you on my computer and start 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.210
 when it is starting you put the minute cd 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.050
 before it opens the screen 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.820
 it's him 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.200
 probably already going from the boutique 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.320
 the computers day 20 factory with an option to dabul title was direct 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.760
 each and will start this one 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.190
 the barca is here 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.000
 I'm going to do another class time explained how configured beauty 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.170
 let's go then 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.709
 Simulator of defense will open an eclectic table clash 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.040
 He's going to carry God. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.690
 in the event of withdrawal 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.630
 there he asked me to press a key to enter the cd in this track and you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690
 will have to be fast for any technician 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.190
 it will start installing windows 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
 usually vote seems to be 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.600
 this part that can be a bit time consuming a little tiring 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.720
 here's how I 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.460
 wrong simulation 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.490
 here you fall singer when that part appears 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.490
 asked if they really are slow 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.539
 it will appear the license agreement 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.569
 you are bound to lose 8 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.559
 otherwise he was not 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.169
 black sp 8 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.570
 now he's staying 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.139
 up to the part of philippe artisan 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.769
 since the mercedes sosa 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.749
 here it will probably already have a portion of what is the part in which you 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.749
 it's been years you'll have to delete this faction 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.650
 now it will fall like this 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.289
 When 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.950
 when it appears on your computer 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.299
 Do you see that they participate in it? 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.999
 even with the pec 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.209
 even when it's cowardly 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.499
 he still warns that the loss if you really care 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.649
 all of them 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.449
 all 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.059
 I'm in charge here 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:57.179
 then the sister audience to confirm he denounced partial 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.389
 now you have here the space has not left anything 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.429
 then you will always tighten create a new partition 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.750
 There, people like to create 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.239
 two factions 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.590
 it's always good that two factions because it's a rebecca pick-up 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.290
 belatedly 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.539
 so you pick 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.239
 the number that can vary 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.670
 Then you get the number of tvs 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.100
 requires for two 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.400
 in case of losses of 44 put 1022 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.219
 gives an interview that the partition 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.219
 now you will create another partition by pressing 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.269
 it will stay with augusto is the inter created the partition 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.119
 now you have two b-series factions 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:39.759
 select the partition to be remembered at all by keyboard 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.919
 and technician has to hurry reports 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.919
 he will ask what type of 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.549
 part of the music file system 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.359
 lpf s fast and effective by mpf is excellent 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.379
 I advise you are 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.379
 country format is used ntfs file systems 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.069
 already the most effective of all 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.079
 can be a quick interface 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.980
 only he can do it because he can leave many addictions 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.089
 so leader of the ps 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:12.209
 in inter it will start beyond this action of the world 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.739
 it will take a little 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.999
 meanwhile you can 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:22.800
 have a coffee 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.360
 take a vestal 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 How good is a knife? 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.669
 Now back to investing in this part you have to be careful 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.520
 he will ask again without consequence proceeding 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.990
 this time with the session losing nothing is that it appears another 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.189
 he asked if he wanted to start with the taste this time sisnama pt nothing else 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.139
 He will start all over again. 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.229
 there he will start 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.060
 really is in the agreements that part can be a little delayed 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.639
 here not because it is a simulation 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.309
 advance 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:04.049
 you're going to have to indicate a name here, it's like talking the show right. 

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:07.049
 do not enter the name in the year with the name any law 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.999
 vinicius 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.020
 it will ask the product key 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.280
 here as a positive to stable situation 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.069
 today you usually exist in the academy of love letters 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.180
 this simulation of today's stage on the site 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.490
 so you can dictate anything and dance 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.460
 we need nothing right 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.300
 forward he will ask the computer name 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.120
 stela 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.529
 ppc 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.070
 have to put something 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.320
 here if you want to always place or put eja 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.819
 advance 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.819
 until the time you choose Brasilia time 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.020
 Protestant 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.039
 he goes 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.259
 started the installation again 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.960
 it will appear several days scenes 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.339
 here you leave the market option typical settings 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.100
 advanced and like all 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.699
 leave everything as it is 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.699
 advance forward 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.210
 without further secrets 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.139
 Of course it's not so fast on staff 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:17.740
 we are a little still 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.689
 she looked like a few more pieces 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:21.349
 I expect you 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.900
 with three more 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.219
 it stands to reason that formatting will not be so fast 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.589
 It's worth remembering, said Souman. 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:31.710
 simulation 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.330
 the pretext for the two missing persons 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.719
 business management doing here 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:38.050
 advance 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.050
 in this part that you are very keen to ignore 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.659
 the sweetheart asking if you want to do the microsoft online registration and 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.979
 advises maicon not to 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.930
 will advance back 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.729
 here the name of the user of the digital tv service at least a bit of 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:55.990
 prestige 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.770
 advances the performance 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.969
 ready 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.969
 here's windows' successfully formatted 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:04.729
 rapture 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.099
 them staff 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.960
 and this simulator here is an implant simulator 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.180
 cj power but here on the site from the lotus 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:16.650
 the data has been revised so that you can get more confidence 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.419
 when was informed to the computer 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:21.259
 during your trip the waitress had access to the site 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.389
 www account workers time to score well at the last point with
