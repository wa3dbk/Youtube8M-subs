billion times competing against yourself

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.390 
billion times competing against yourself
is<00:01:26.760> stressful<00:01:27.860> coming<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.220> these

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
is stressful coming up with these

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
is stressful coming up with these
scenarios<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.270> people<00:01:30.540> play<00:01:30.659> over<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.110> over

scenarios that people play over and over
again<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:32.310> how<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.580> we<00:01:32.820> rethink<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
again now how can we rethink that and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.760 
again now how can we rethink that and
create<00:01:33.930> something<00:01:34.080> that's<00:01:34.259> new<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
create something that's new and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.210 
create something that's new and
interesting<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.930> started<00:01:37.710> getting<00:01:37.799> more<00:01:38.100> in

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
interesting we started getting more in

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.090 
interesting we started getting more in
these<00:01:38.369> asymmetrical<00:01:38.759> maps<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:40.259> often<00:01:40.799> with

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
these asymmetrical maps it's often with

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.429 
these asymmetrical maps it's often with
defense<00:01:41.610> where<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.689> choke<00:01:42.900> point<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
defense where that's a choke point that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
defense where that's a choke point that
you<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> hold<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.450> high<00:01:45.570> ground

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you want to hold and I think high ground

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.460 
you want to hold and I think high ground
is<00:01:46.080> an<00:01:46.350> example<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:48.290> some<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is an example of that some of the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.350 
is an example of that some of the
specific<00:01:49.950> things<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.400> try<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.880> were

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
specific things that we try it out were

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179 
specific things that we try it out were
having<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.930> wall<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:52.979> past

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
having a wall that you have to get past

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.249 
having a wall that you have to get past
that<00:01:53.759> sort<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.090> defined<00:01:54.479> whether<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> want<00:01:55.170> or

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
lost the game then we stuck some towers

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.319 
lost the game then we stuck some towers
in<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.860> put<00:01:59.040> AI<00:01:59.280> Gunners<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.210> the

version of high ground that wall has

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.190 
version of high ground that wall has
been<00:02:14.800> rotated<00:02:15.400> 45<00:02:15.640> degrees<00:02:16.210> because<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.900> had

been rotated 45 degrees because it had

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.230 
been rotated 45 degrees because it had
two<00:02:17.500> turrets<00:02:17.770> up<00:02:18.070> here<00:02:18.310> as<00:02:18.580> well<00:02:18.760> as<00:02:18.880> two<00:02:19.030> turds

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
two turrets up here as well as two turds

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.880 
two turrets up here as well as two turds
in<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> other<00:02:19.660> tower<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.290> there's<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.650> lot<00:02:20.830> of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
in the other tower so there's a lot of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.580 
in the other tower so there's a lot of
firepower<00:02:21.160> coming<00:02:21.760> down<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.150> hill<00:02:22.300> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
firepower coming down on the hill that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.230 
firepower coming down on the hill that
got<00:02:23.590> all<00:02:23.800> simplified<00:02:24.400> into<00:02:24.760> one<00:02:24.970> turret

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
got all simplified into one turret

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.390 
got all simplified into one turret
actually<00:02:25.900> right<00:02:26.050> above<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.440> gate<00:02:26.620> which<00:02:27.040> we

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
actually right above the gate which we

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.170 
actually right above the gate which we
felt<00:02:27.610> was<00:02:27.700> not<00:02:27.910> as<00:02:28.060> brutal<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.050> attackers

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
felt was not as brutal to the attackers

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.940 
felt was not as brutal to the attackers
it's<00:02:31.180> pretty<00:02:31.450> obvious<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.900> us<00:02:32.200> when<00:02:32.500> when<00:02:32.860> we

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
it's pretty obvious to us when when we

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.320 
it's pretty obvious to us when when we
start<00:02:33.190> working<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.580> these<00:02:33.700> maps<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.210> they

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
start working on these maps that they

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.750 
start working on these maps that they
have<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.720> fun<00:02:35.020> for<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.040> hundredth<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
have to be fun for the hundredth and the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.160 
have to be fun for the hundredth and the
200th<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.690> one<00:02:37.780> thousandth<00:02:38.200> time<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.960> aren't

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
200th and one thousandth time you aren't

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.330 
200th and one thousandth time you aren't
figuring<00:02:41.500> out<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> switches<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.160> doors

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
figuring out the switches and the doors

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.950 
figuring out the switches and the doors
yeah<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.910> glow<00:02:43.150> circle<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.750> want<00:02:43.900> to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
yeah the glow circle like you want to

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.300 
yeah the glow circle like you want to
prolong<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.320> like<00:02:44.560> watching<00:02:44.650> people<00:02:45.010> run

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
prolong it like watching people run

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.830 
prolong it like watching people run
through<00:02:45.490> your<00:02:45.580> map<00:02:45.790> challenges<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> lot<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
through your map challenges a lot of the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.150 
through your map challenges a lot of the
assumptions<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.350> made<00:02:47.530> about<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.010> oh<00:02:48.130> I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
assumptions you made about it like oh I

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.030 
assumptions you made about it like oh I
think<00:02:48.490> people<00:02:48.640> will<00:02:48.880> use<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.330> Hill<00:02:49.540> for

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
think people will use this Hill for

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.620 
think people will use this Hill for
sniping<00:02:51.040> line<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.430> then<00:02:51.910> no<00:02:52.060> one<00:02:52.180> needs<00:02:52.360> it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
sniping line and then no one needs it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.050 
sniping line and then no one needs it
then<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.470> get<00:02:53.590> great<00:02:53.770> comments<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.490> this

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
then you get great comments like this

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.890 
then you get great comments like this
