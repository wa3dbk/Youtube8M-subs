00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.240
 nice guys are blisters from in this 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.320
 video I want to talk about games week 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.880
 held in Milan on 25 26 and 27 October 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.070
 for me it was the first time I went and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 it was a truly unique experience 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 beautiful in this video I will talk about 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.279
 positive and negative aspects of this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.990
 fair 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.770
 the downside is to start immediately with 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.180
 those is that there was no entrance 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.739
 adequate, that is, you entered and saw already 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 these stands and instead in my opinion it had to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.050
 be there type or a tunnel or curtains 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 in the giant screens that introduced you to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.250
 this fair is not that important 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 then there was nothing if it wasn't for 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.940
 play 4 for the xbox for nintendo 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.530
 also that he had a giant stand not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.640
 it didn't even look like I was at a fair 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 so so important because in these 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.180
 such gigantic stands of these houses 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.580
 such big builders had 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.770
 giant screens giant screens had in the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 play 4 ie in the playstation stand 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.979
 there were also video projectors that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.020
 projected all the various gameplay 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 there were game stations where you could 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.360
 play all the games 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.320
 there was a cool music lights was 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.439
 that is to say, to really enter into it 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.840
 instead of saliva the emotion came from 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.409
 these stands turned the corner and found you 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.960
 a normal stand with nothing 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 without billboards then the light that entered 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.180
 that is, I did n't like it at all 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.360
 in these respects then in this fair 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.049
 the phone didn't take a paradox 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 crazy the fair so evolved with all 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.030
 new things new phones etc. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.119
 don't take it this is really it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.860
 went to the detriment of me because it was me 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.570
 also organized but put it all 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
 but what we wanted we had to do 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.440
 feel like a friend I have 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.300
 known online with the playstation 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.100
 he will see it for the first time there 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.480
 we are seen I was really sorry 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.820
 much 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.220
 same thing with trouble kids a 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.720
 I had to find me we didn't find each other 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.220
 I really felt so sorry 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.130
 also because in the afternoon I am 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.630
 had to leave 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.030
 another negative thing was the headphones in 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.770
 this fair there was only one stand of the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.590
 big turtle beach 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.500
 I don't know a meter by two with three headphones 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.930
 really ugly and the headphones of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.200
 call of duty taste from 350 euros which not 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.910
 you could touch nothing but if 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.760
 go to their site 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.600
 there are thousands of headphones and lines 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.640
 they had brought 3 tell me you or then here 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.890
 I show you play 4 in these 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.290
 photo excuse me a little for the reflections pro 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.420
 it was the only place to be able to do the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.790
 photo to play 4 in peace because 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.700
 of the other parts there was really 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.930
 a carnage of people is seen live 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.750
 this console is a xbox show 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.030
 one sorry to redo the xbox is 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.010
 really twice as big as the apl 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.440
 the four I'm not kidding 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.780
 it's really a giant brick instead 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.890
 play 4 with this line is really 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:30.170
 wonderful then what else to say about aspects 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.420
 negative there was a madonna heat 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.610
 there were really waves of 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.190
 unlikely spotted armpit you were 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.489
 bad I saw so many great ones 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.680

 very nice very kind so not 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.640
 really has the head mounted like 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.090
 maybe some youtuber that I don't do the 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.540
 name that maybe they weren't present in 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.549
 this fair 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.200
 I can only gennaro generalizing 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.390
 I'm making appointments nothing really is 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.959
 it was wonderful here to show you a 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.489
 bit of assassin's killzone gameplay 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.740
 then creed of another game that I don't know 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.220
 what was the proper name really one 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.470
 crazy graphics will be for TV will be 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.220
 because they were in high definition and 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.509
 absurd and everything, however, really turned 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.620
 very well these games 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:39.900
 then another absurd thing was at the end 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.380
 right at the bottom of the fair all one 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.680
 stand where people played fifa e 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.479
 there was a stage i'm not kidding there was 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.849
 here is really a forum here is the 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.910
 exact word there is a football stand 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.380
 installed on where you could sit that 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.180
 to see the people playing fifa 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.509
 crazy there in fact at the end of the video vi 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.580
 I'll put this little clip 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.530

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.729

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.110

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.650
 professional playing 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.139

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.979

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.979

 battlefield etc. there was at least an hour 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.000
 and a half in a row and then maybe play 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.380
 five minutes really crazy things 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.080
 all of them were crazy 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.120
 young kids running around ran it 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.330
 stand of me i enjoyed it being assaulted 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.880
 there is if you were not there you cannot understand 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:48.370
 really everyone jerking 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.740
 they screamed or people then there were some 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.530
 stand that launched gadgets but gadgets 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.350
 stupid even key- ring keyring 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.310

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.930
 they climbed one above the other szabo 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.789
 really as crazy as that was as well 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.400
 really was beautiful because i could 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.770
 savor the excitement for the first time 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.300
 to go to a fair of this type 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.830
 clearly cannot be compared 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.310
 at the paris fair in these 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:19.479
 days because that freely e 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.880
 atomic however we say that we hope for the 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.979
 next year maybe go in 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.050

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:38.289
 we will be able to do this so here 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:42.310
 look at the stand really scared 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:44.260
 look at people that there was the carnage of 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.620
