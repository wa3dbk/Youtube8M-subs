00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.950
 week I had no voice three days 2000 the 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.990
 true but fortunately now 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.520
 I feel a lot better, I'm still a 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.619
 little bitten but the truth is not me 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.110

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.789

 I know I will love you because of 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.230
 made me wondering little things 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.149
 about this and not telling me how to show 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.940
 not give us a review and everything and that 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.920

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.440

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.089

 enjoy the video and we started and good 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.059
 What I want to talk about is about 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.039
 the kegel lipsticks I had already 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.620
 talked a little about these lipsticks 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.719
 in a first video the one of the top 5 them 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.329
 I had shown and several of you 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.329
 forever 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.479
 as an object it's not what brand they're good at 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.880
 and they are indelible not what wave and the truth 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.140
 is you want you can go they are super super 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.180
 good to me has me crazy right now 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.070
 I put every day or it's the same 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.409
 color but a different one but if I 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.119
 I put every day I love them and I 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.159
 I want to talk to you so much about 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.470
 advantages as the disadvantages of these 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.750
 elaborate lipsticks and it's something minimal 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.729
 but he asked to talk so they have 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.470
 as a whole general idea about 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.319
 these lipsticks and also if they are 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.500
 interested in acquiring them good I would 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.659
 I have here first in this capital I do not know 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.940
 why I like to put it is like in some 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.130
 small glasses and they exceed it as different and 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.869
 they give like another touch and it is me father by 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.240
 as for decoration like that and me 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.479
 love this and good first to start 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.970
 with the disadvantages of these lipsticks the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.220
 first disadvantage would be that they are very 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.039
 dry for the same thing they are indelible 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.840
 they are too dry then they make 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.860
 dry out on the lips and leave them 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.960
 fried means when you take them away is 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.870
 bad things but the truth I have them 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.390
 the tip that they use a moisturizer for the 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.790
 light lips forgiveness both before and 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.650
 after putting them on because the truth 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.020
 I do when I've taken it off sometimes not 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.110
 they remain like parties so cannon the 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.870
 lips but yes sit ras deposits 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.960
 then that is not father then 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.150
 a pretty one is super good and it's not going to 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.709
 affect so much but the truth if they are worth 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.870
 I'm sorry because anyway of the labial 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.270
 never going to fall then yes 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.790
 they are super super father also another 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.580
 disadvantage would be that when you 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.290
 you apply and it dries so fast that it does not 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.670
 know you can not put it on as 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.690
 a normal lipstick that you get from the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.310
 steps and you 're done 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.400
 If you do not have to wait for so many 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.080
 of raisins a layer and you wait 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.910
 even if it's a minute because if you 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.489
 you keep putting and putting and putting 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.560
 it goes like it's painting, so you go like 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.130
 that removing and not totally 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.290
 defined lips do not fit well 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.060
 then that is the only thing but 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.860
 with practice, because I'll quickly 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.170
 you put 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.200
 although also an advantage would be that it is 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.360
 singing because that males do not no 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.550
 soiled your clothes or whatever it is to me 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.590
 sometimes it happens that there are some label is that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.470
 they are so sticky that you hair 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.660
 If we work, you feel that 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.970
 is nothing father but those would be the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.010
 only disadvantages I have of these 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.930
 labial because from there the ear that 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.810
 I have are good things to say about 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.060
 this and good the advantages now I go with 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.740
 the advantages that they bring as one that are 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.080
 indelible the truth is that it is something 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.860
 super super plus that give you these 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.260
 lipsticks because 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.780
 then in need of you 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.700
 all the time then it's great and 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.130
 you can drink water you can kiss your boyfriend 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.740
 you can eat do what you want and not 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.530
 it's going to run for nothing then that 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.840
 It is terrific terrific terrific and 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.500
 good other things that bring solos 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.830
 as 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.970
 maika the truth is that there are some who 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.400
 it even seems that through marking 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.100
 literal text there are people that I stay 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.080
 good with a party face that wave like this 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.850
 with his mouth other people tell me how 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.430
 there is a super father and I do not know what but 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.770
 good already tastes likes to word 2 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.890
 the tones that the planet brings are 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:25.260
 super super parents to me I love and 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.570
 things are tones are a little bit like that 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.730
 as for the most daring when we're not going to 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.470
 as they also have other shades 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.630
 short but the truth is that these do not 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.460
 they are something like it is not very usual to see 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.980
 then this is also super super 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.640
 cool right now showing them each of 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.830
 the tones and I'm going to leave the switch 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.210
 how you live how you look on your lips and 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.449
 I 'll leave them in the names 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.240
 also from each one in the labials 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.969
 well first I want to start with the one 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.590
 I bring it since it is the pink flow 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:00.120
 I did not want to notice 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.120
 Anyway, I'm going to leave them 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.949
 here below the names of each one of 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.259
 the way consecutively as it 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.439
 I'm showing and it's the one I bring 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.889
 put right now it's like a super pink 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:16.559
 neon well rose mark text 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.240
 then super super powerful super neron 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:21.150
 maybe right now for the light to look like 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.449
 Rosita but if I move the dark look 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.449
 see 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.849
 already saw it super super powerful and the 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.320
 truth is that I think it exists in the 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.810
 darkness 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.230
 do not miss me because there is a publicist 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.870
 little by little because if it's super powerful 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.820
 but I love it I love it a lot 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.610
 I know you're going to like it a lot and now 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.950
 I 'm going to put the lipstick switch 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.240

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.140
 I love it is from my favorite tournaments 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.800
 This is the most use and I will 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.800
 to show here 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.229
 It's like gloss style and he had 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.629
 shown that it looks like it's a 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:11.790
 gloss but when you start to put 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:13.830
 he makes his magic is this one that is here 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.830
 Anyway, it will also leave you 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.840
 how the clip looks like how the 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.990
 lips of each of the labials at 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:26.120
 final and this is the pink flow I love 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.310
 well the next one that I love you 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.630
 show is this that I bring here I what 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.760
 I put on my lips so that you 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.890
 also go see how they look 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.560
 all ways remember that in the end they 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.500
 I'm going to leave and how they all look in the 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.360
 lips from the first to the last 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.360
 and this is the neon coral 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.440
 but you know I'm going to give you the 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.360
 names and everything you want here 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.940
 information and it is this that is 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.970
 like a super powerful orange like 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.890
 orange mark text tell you me and it's 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.800
 super powerful this turn I think it 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:03.160
 I would see beautiful beautiful beautiful love and 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.780
 girls very wands or like girls 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.120
 brunette of fire like that would be given 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.580
 amazing because it contrasts super nice 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.910
 with that pretty dark tanned skin 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.580
 and it 's super super cute orange 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:20.110
 right now the coral is fashionable 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:23.240
 neonazi the orange 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.430
 Naranjitas and Neon cited is super super 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.290
 right now the orange I do not know why but 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.280
 clear before by father and I'm going to 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.280
 show the switch 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.960
 here the short one where I put the other 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.900
 as you can see the rose is already dry 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.900
 it is completely dry 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.469
 it runs 

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:01.090
 nothing less 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:05.610
 so it dries super fast 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.610
 and now we continue with the next
