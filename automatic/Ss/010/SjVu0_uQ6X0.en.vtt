00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.800 
the population being from way far away
and<00:03:38.739> I've<00:03:39.519> speaking<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:39.939> local<00:03:40.209> language<00:03:40.599> we

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
and I've speaking the local language we

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.390 
and I've speaking the local language we
stopped<00:03:41.049> it<00:03:41.230> before<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:41.950> somehow<00:03:42.340> or

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
stopped it before that so somehow or

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.369 
stopped it before that so somehow or
other<00:03:42.489> this<00:03:43.209> has<00:03:43.420> got<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.719> be<00:03:43.749> stopped<00:03:44.109> and

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
other this has got to be stopped and

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.830 
other this has got to be stopped and
then<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:44.950> yes<00:03:45.579> there's<00:03:45.879> a<00:03:45.939> border<00:03:46.359> issue<00:03:46.540> how

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
then so yes there's a border issue how

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.449 
then so yes there's a border issue how
do<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.019> keep<00:03:47.200> them<00:03:47.379> from<00:03:47.590> just<00:03:47.859> sifting

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
do you keep them from just sifting

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.000 
do you keep them from just sifting
across<00:03:48.819> there's<00:03:49.599> all<00:03:50.079> sorts<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.620> other<00:03:50.739> ways

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
largest role other than the diplomats in
