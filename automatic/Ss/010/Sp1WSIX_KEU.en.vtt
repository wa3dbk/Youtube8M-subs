00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
it's really hard to buy fabric online

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.109 
it's really hard to buy fabric online
because<00:00:21.050> it's<00:00:21.380> hard<00:00:21.529> to<00:00:21.619> see<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.830> scale<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:22.789> I

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
because it's hard to see the scale so I

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.000 
because it's hard to see the scale so I
thought<00:00:23.359> I<00:00:23.390> would<00:00:23.689> show<00:00:24.109> you<00:00:24.140> what<00:00:24.230> I<00:00:24.350> got<00:00:24.410> and

thought I would show you what I got and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.200 
thought I would show you what I got and

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
then if you're looking at the same

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.970 
then if you're looking at the same
fabric<00:00:26.689> then<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:27.439> don't<00:00:27.560> have<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:27.710> better<00:00:27.890> idea

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
this would be really fun and subtle also

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:56.170 
this would be really fun and subtle also
with<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.240> boho<00:01:47.750> line<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:51.200> henna<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:56.000> see

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.040 

and<00:02:00.820> so<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:02.530> two<00:02:02.830> go<00:02:03.220> together<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.960> the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
and so these two go together from the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.170 
and so these two go together from the
same<00:02:05.230> collection<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.760> know<00:02:06.940> that<00:02:07.060> that

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180
