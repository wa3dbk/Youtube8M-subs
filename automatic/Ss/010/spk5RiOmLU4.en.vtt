 in seven pairs 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.230
 we put cpp as radio 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.820
 with which the increase 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.350
 I count with the br 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 it is reported that the port put the 81 from scratch 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.400

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.600
 radio globe one two three 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.020
 in this sense none

 the radio address the leader said with a touch the world 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.660
 the design settings were made successfully he nodded to the burning 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.119
 will appear here 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.750
 the configuration made not 32 kabat of the second 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.920
 what 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.759
 we will open the browser to disable the right auto of the time that we enter 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.280
 land that disables 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.280
 we access the citi radio tuma 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340

 not 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.119
 5 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:14.329
 We await loading 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.089
 I do not count it or minimize it 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.089
 how he got zeroed in on all that 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.839
 So 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.129
 good 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.969

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.499
 not 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.519
 the project 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.849
 a guard in march a loading team 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.459
 let's disable the other one of d as disable after placing on ground 15 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.449
 mm 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.849

 Grandson explained we are noon 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.629
 but the motion because here 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.169
 So 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.650
 the akita collection 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.650
 Stable not 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.849
 Bro 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:48.730

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.900
 we checked to see if other money is still in the area 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.169
 which I had to stop because they were kitana caesar 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.419
 so here 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.229
 No, I will not have messi 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.520
 we have to open the browser puts the bad laugh radio intermediate point 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.139
 computational point 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.289
 colo-colo guim 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.559
 when you have 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:13.449
 in this case the standing still 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.939
 no need to make any changes that we will automatically open 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:21.939
 the simplex pt already configured 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.919
 We are not here. 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.289
 I'm not 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.930
 so I'm 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.960
 from pc 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.719
 not 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.719
 so much 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.299
 liliane for this 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.360
 this as the sound of the microphone costs to the state only that we sin in account says 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.599
 and here in the settings that affected the right-clicking nodes 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.800
 movie 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 we switched right 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:07.569
 we have verified that he is signing in and three months 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.289
 performed live the one you understood 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.689
 How can you see live here? 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:15.669
 we can and it minimizes here 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.199
 and 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.309
 futebolsc with me wanted 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:24.259
 This is it, guys, success here on radio pleasure, dedication, done and done in life. 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.669
 It's obvious that it happens here. 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.530
 I programmed by josé santos 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.110
 and the tooth-thread well-being hope that everyone will have the adhesion rate 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.100
 teams did not have a good experience with the debts of the real 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.410
 beauty was worth any doubt their suggestion they doubts I'm deserving 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.479
 beauty 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.110
 So that's it, people, success. 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.979
 And that's it, they're going to put a heifer on top of it.
