Good Morning and Welcome to Aha Emi Ruchi!

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:37.598
I'm going to show the viewers how to make Chakkara Pongali
with Godhuma Rava (Broken Wheat)

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:47.107
Ingredients required to make Godhuma Rava Chakkara Pongali

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:58.619
Cracked Wheat, Green Gram, Jaggery, Sugar, Cardamom Powder,
Grated Coconut, Cashews, Raisins, Ghee

00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:35.674
Take 1 cup of cracked wheat and 1/2 cup of green gram,
add 3 glasses of water and boil them for about 15 - 20 mins.

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:59.784
It doesn't matter if you soak the green gram or not soak it before boiling it.

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:12.329
After boiling it, the cooked mixture should have the right consistency like this

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.936
Take a deep pan and heat some ghee

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.410
Add some raisins and remove once fried

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:04.215
Fry some cashew nuts

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:17.659
Instead of freshly grated coconut, you can use the grated coconut
that has been roasted and powdered

00:03:27.897 --> 00:03:30.814
Remove the cashews once fried

00:03:51.665 --> 00:04:00.628
Add 1 cup of crushed jaggery and 1/2 cup of sugar into the pan

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:08.802
Add a little water

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:28.050
Let it simmer till a syrup is formed

00:04:28.677 --> 00:04:34.154
Now add the boiled mixture of cracked wheat and green gram

00:04:36.226 --> 00:04:44.596
After cookin it for awhile add 1/2 cup of ghee

00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.152

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.150
