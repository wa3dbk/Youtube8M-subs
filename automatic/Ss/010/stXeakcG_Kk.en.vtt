00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.300
 from previous lessons we remember that 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.260
 information 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.200
 computers are presented as files 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.500
 files can be stored in folders and where 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.500
 eventually all information is stored 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.700
 how the repository itself is designated and how 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.370
 access it from the first 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.760
 lesson we remember that all the information 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.320
 stored on hard disk 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.700
 which is inside the system 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:48.910
 block how do we access 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:51.899
 hard drive on your desktop 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:56.370
 computer should have an icon 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.379
 computer precisely through this icon 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.360
 all memory accessed 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:09.450
 computer will open it with a double click 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:15.370
 the left mouse button a window will appear 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:19.110
 the computer that we are seeing us here 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.609
 Partitions are interested in hard drives and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.310
 removable media device 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:29.240
 the first thing to know here is that 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.520
 all disks on the computer all memory 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.600
 it is accepted to designate letters of English 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 alphabet 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.439
 and bcde and so on, we see these letters 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:54.569
 in parentheses 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:58.649
 and with de what are the rules here a and 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:02.969
 b are always indicated drives for 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:07.860
 read and write floppies unless of course 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:13.170
 you always have this letter c 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.989
 indicated by the hard drive and have more 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.030
 how will 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.560
 for example your hard drive for convenience 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:27.260
 can be divided into 2 parts like here 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.239
 it is a disk c and a disk d 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.690
 windows operating system always 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.060
 installed on drive c so if you have 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.180
 there are other drives 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.090
 for example, how here d drive is better 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.650
 store all the information exactly there she is 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.250
 drive c is better not to go at all and so 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.670
 any storage media such as hard 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.880
 disk 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.389
 flash drives are designated 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.049
 English letters in the hard section 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.799
 hard disk drives 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.359
 these discs have a distinctive icon 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:12.180
 there may be as many as you like 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:16.639
 usually this is 24 disks this is information 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.639
 which is stored on your computer 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.980
 in the device section with removable 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.049
 bearers are also in English letters 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.689
 all other devices are marked 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.340
 memory flash drives drives for example disk 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.090
 denotes a device to work with 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.250
 floppy disks 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.840
 and has a characteristic e drive icon 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.870
 designate a device to work with 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.040
 laser optical disks and also 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.379
 has a distinctive flash drive icon with us 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.500
 not represented here because it is not 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.719
 connected 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.900
 let's connect the flash drive and see what 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:59.480
 will be 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.629
 we include the USB stick in the usb socket of system 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.629
 block 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.699
 after a few seconds in the section 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.379
 removable media device 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:11.379
 a new disk f will appear 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:20.070
 removable disk f letter f to appear 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.790
 automatically just alphabetically 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:29.220
 order now we have access to 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:32.460
 memory on a flash drive to see the contents 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.380
 any disk is very simple just 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.530
 open the disk by double clicking the left 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.530
 click the d drive 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.790
 now in this window we see the contents 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.790
 disk d 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.930
 it is also possible to access 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:58.139
 flash drive just double it 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.139
 cry 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.030
 now we see the contents of the flash drive 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:11.319
 here is always written where we are 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:14.909
 now we are in this case 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.909
 removable disk f 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.400
 Now I will try to go to disk c 

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:30.889
 double click with the left mouse button 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.310
 I repeat that it does not work here 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.699
 recommended nothing better here 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.699
 touch 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.319
 what to do if you have only one 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:52.569
 hard drive c where is it then store 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:56.590
 in this case, save everything to a folder 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:06:01.180
 which is on the desktop 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.850
 or straight to the desktop but best 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:09.480
 will be if you still create a second 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.480
 hard drive inviting a specialist 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:18.010
 summarize the lesson to all devices 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:22.680
 information storage we carry 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:26.530
 access via computer icon 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:39.400
 all devices are denoted by English 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:42.460
 letters a c de f and so on and if you 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.090
 someone say for example what your report 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.950
 located on disk d in the report folder you 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.060
 will need to do the following 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:57.340
 actions open computer double 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:07:01.870
 click then open and drive d also 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:06.670
 double click then open folder 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:08.580
 reports are also double click here it is ours 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:13.050
 report 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.050
 open it also with a double click 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.350
 be sure to practice open 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:23.620
 computer icon look what drives 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:27.670
 what letters do you have? 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:31.000
 are designated look how much do you have 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.430
 hard drives if you're not the only one 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.990
 users of this computer specify 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:42.250
 what disk can you use 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:44.230
 remember to go to disk c that is 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.850
 open it to novice users 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:50.980
 This topic is not recommended either 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.530
 otherwise we will affect some 

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:57.690
 following lessons so you can 

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.690
 get to know her more closely
