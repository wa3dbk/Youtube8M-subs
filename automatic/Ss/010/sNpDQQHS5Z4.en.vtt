00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.980 

you<00:00:25.890> want<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.220> start<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> middle<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.390> just

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you want to start in the middle and just

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.740 
you want to start in the middle and just
roll<00:00:28.259> out<00:00:28.759> using<00:00:29.759> even<00:00:30.180> pressure<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.630> your

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
roll out using even pressure on your

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.850 
roll out using even pressure on your
rolling<00:00:31.019> pin<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:31.890> directions<00:00:33.620> trying<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
rolling pin in all directions trying to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
rolling pin in all directions trying to
keep<00:00:35.129> it<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.640> circle<00:00:36.059> shape<00:00:38.600> alright

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
keep it in a circle shape alright

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.380 
keep it in a circle shape alright
so<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> perfect<00:00:41.280> circle<00:00:41.970> but<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.239> is

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
so it's not a perfect circle but it is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810 
so it's not a perfect circle but it is
at<00:00:42.600> least<00:00:42.629> nine<00:00:43.470> inches<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.220> diameter<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.790> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
at least nine inches in diameter so I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.579 
at least nine inches in diameter so I
know<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.420> enough<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.379> cover

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
know it's going to be enough to cover

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.490 
know it's going to be enough to cover
the<00:00:46.769> cake<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.220> have<00:00:47.460> here
