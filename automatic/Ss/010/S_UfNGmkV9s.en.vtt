00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 I've been thinking I've come to the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.650
 conclusion that I have a slight 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.660
 obsession for the cushions and I have to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.400
 confess it when I go to the stores 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.410
 I can stay the long time watching the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.210
 designs but because I like them so much not 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.650
 I know I only know that I like them so good 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.420
 I started thinking and reviewing I gave 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.880
 realize that in the channel I do not have a single 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.920
 video where you make or where you make a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.689
 project like these I am the giorgio and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.760
 if you marry me in this video I'm going 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.480
 to teach how to make this cushion 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.480
 decorative 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.030
 and good for this project first thing 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.010
 what you will have to do will be such a heart 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.170
 than in a folded paper template 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.420
 in half and draw half of a 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.890
 heart in this way you will have a 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.510
 symmetrical heart 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.940
 using it as a template duplicate it 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 in felt coffee color or the color that you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 you prefer 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.989
 book a little aside and with help to 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.000
 continuation of a cover you're going to score 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.100
 circles on your felt the number of 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.640
 circles will depend on the size you have 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.640
 your heart 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 you 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.340
 so when you have the necessary you go 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.870
 to start trimming each of them 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.870
 spiral 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.370
 once you have the spirals 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.410
 start rolling starting at 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.610
 center just like I show it to you 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.610
 leave a flower 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.710
 it will only be necessary to seal the tip 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.079
 so that it does not unfold anymore 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.229
 then placing enough 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.400
 hot silicone on the bottom what 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.340
 let's continue like this 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.380
 across the surface of the heart we 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.150
 to upholster what is left with that 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.560
 Shiny appearance and full of flowers 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.560
 what are we looking for? 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.370
 to make this cushion against this 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.739
 fabric that the truth fascinates me since 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 I saw her singing because she can use it to 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.270
 perform many projects a bag and 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.819
 good in this case for a cushion 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.550
 perfect with abundant silicon I'm going to 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.490
 paste then into a folded rectangle 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.100
 in half of this fabric 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.530
 then once sealed is today the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.170
 back and I'm going to sew all four sides 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.450
 without forgetting to leave a space for 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.740
 then fill it with a sponge 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.740
 from polyester to pillows 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.099
 put stuffing closes the hole that 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.319
 we have left ready we will have like this 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.629
 finished our coj and design 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.330
 heart placed the space that most 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.690
 you prefer you can even use it as 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.690
 a gift
