00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.590
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.210
 a year of boxing from my new pc 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.850
 I take it now last time 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.890
 have and indeed are now so here I 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.029
 try a bit in the cameras 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.230
 show the bill 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.420
 and that cost just 1478 and indeed 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.910
 from monday maybe is already in the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.710
 title 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.570
 yes yes here I still try even a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 kinda focus on it somehow 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.809
 has worked not so good 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 it does not have that kind of stuff right now 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.670
 I reach space but no matter 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.160
 in any case yes has cost 278 yes 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.840
 a bit more w3c unbelievable 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.610
 shipping and packaging and stop because of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.809
 Amazon I always paid for my son 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.520
 so Amazon payments more 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.970
 become so or so reetz 30 euro 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.590
 Shipping costs thereby and one sees yes 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.909
 no fuzzy places I saw 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.229
 do not think so special about it 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 I stand for it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.659
 And besides, it does not even matter here 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.869
 you see as it is my power cord the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.900
 Truth at the top of the box 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.500
 opens here in this packaging are 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 stop all the series like cds and stuff 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.979
 continue and so on 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.939
 So I 'll just open it up again and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.659
 then we'll take it out of here 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.520
 bonn.de security cd and so on and so on 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.530
 on 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.200
 the restoration of the cd or what 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.159
 Whatever it is there is there too 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.780
 the graphics cards cd in it and so on 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.780
 then there are also some extras inside 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.670
 such as here these cables 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.369
 I did not need that now 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.350
 I think that it is replacement and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.299
 jordan let's see how the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.260
 carton so packaged here are just like that 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.040
 haas' great air 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.190
 package or something like that too 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.540
 protection and so on out now 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.770
 and then you are cold as you swing 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.560
 visage no matter 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.420
 In any case, here you see 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.910
 the cartons and boxes of sony times the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.770
 pc to take a bit out 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.750
 but unfortunately it is a bit strange 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.840
 if I actually got up 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.670
 but i can just try 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.880
 times vertically to present he is a 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:41.000
 there was nothing but nothing happened 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.790
 actually , a few were already loose 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.740
 Share in it so I have the same synonymous 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.150
 taken out or has decreased the same 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.900
 you see it too I'll do that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.300
 carton just gone and then we will as 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.450
 Ten gods are here again 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:02.750
 small styrofoam things on the side of 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.540
 pc off with it as a bit off and yours 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.390
 and the pc around it is just like that 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.900
 a weird foil was attached now 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.000
 also just off and then would have the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.320
 pc be already free 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.930
 as he will see, I make a film 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.520
 absurd there is such a funny cover 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.360
 you who have indiscriminate coach the 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.340
 you can lose weight 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.030
 I do not know what it is definitely for 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.880
 I was the one who lost everything 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.000
 not needed at the time of construction and york 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.410
 Here you see the pc right 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.230
 nice really good 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.770
 the market times so from the company on.de 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.110
 So assembled and in any case 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.209
 I'm actually quite satisfied 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.850
 so I had read twice now 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.650
 or so I make mistakes when booting 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.580
 or so I think that's why 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.000
 because I like the ketchup 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:09.700
 attributed in any case 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.989
 has and otherwise no errors so so 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.470
 the brand is really good 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.390
 the whole hts and I grab you everything 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.500
 new in the description about it would like 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.160
 I do not care 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.720
 and I would to enjoy the video still 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.380
 until the end I'll show you one more 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.510
 bit the pc so all around and still 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.460
 some pictures should be done and otherwise 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.460
 which is a lot of fun
