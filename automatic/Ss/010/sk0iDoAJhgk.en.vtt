00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.579 
hi I'm going to show you how to solve
this<00:00:03.360> annoyance<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:05.220> warning<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.589> have

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
this annoyance and this warning I have

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.580 
this annoyance and this warning I have
been<00:00:07.940> experimenting<00:00:08.940> with<00:00:09.150> using<00:00:09.360> cameo<00:00:10.170> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
been experimenting with using cameo to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.879 
been experimenting with using cameo to
package<00:00:11.550> up<00:00:11.759> programs<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:13.170> run<00:00:13.410> from<00:00:13.679> my

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
package up programs to run from my

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.550 
package up programs to run from my
network<00:00:14.400> attached<00:00:14.849> storage<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.260> can

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
network attached storage so that I can

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.760 
network attached storage so that I can
run<00:00:16.770> them<00:00:16.980> from<00:00:17.190> anywhere<00:00:17.900> it<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:19.170> went<00:00:19.410> well

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
run them from anywhere it all went well

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.939 
run them from anywhere it all went well
but<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.340> found<00:00:20.760> too<00:00:21.210> awkward<00:00:21.990> things<00:00:22.289> about<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
but I found too awkward things about it

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.970 
but I found too awkward things about it
which<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.430> managed<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.390> clear<00:00:24.689> away<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.830> I'm

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
which I managed to clear away so I'm

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.000 
which I managed to clear away so I'm
going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.430> share<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.910> solutions<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:28.010> first

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
going to share the solutions here first

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.080 
going to share the solutions here first
when<00:00:29.760> browsing<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.689> my<00:00:30.869> Nass<00:00:31.230> Turtwig<00:00:32.090> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
when browsing to my Nass Turtwig it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.410 
when browsing to my Nass Turtwig it
repeatedly<00:00:34.020> asks<00:00:34.649> me<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.130> enter<00:00:35.730> my<00:00:35.760> network

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
repeatedly asks me to enter my network

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.709 
repeatedly asks me to enter my network
password<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:38.040> works<00:00:38.340> fine<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.969> enter<00:00:39.329> them

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
password it works fine if I enter them

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.430 
password it works fine if I enter them
but<00:00:40.410> even<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.280> ask<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.300> remember<00:00:43.050> my

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
but even if I ask it to remember my

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.270 
but even if I ask it to remember my
credentials<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.640> still<00:00:45.329> asks<00:00:45.930> me<00:00:46.079> again<00:00:46.280> next

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
credentials it still asks me again next

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.500 
credentials it still asks me again next
time<00:00:47.670> here's<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.870> solution<00:00:49.820> go<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.360> your

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
