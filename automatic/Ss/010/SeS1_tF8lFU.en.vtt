00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:11.010
 I put this little film on 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.900
 youtube February 25, 2013 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.040
 ten days after fell 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 Chelyabinsk meteorite 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.119
 like a parody of a movie that was 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.960
 exposed 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.250
 further February 16 claim to be 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.939
 expecting that supposedly 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 the meteorite was hit by a rocket or other 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 then i put up a movie i meet 4 with 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 more detailed analysis and now you 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.129
 see this movie in this movie I want 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.140
 do a detailed analysis was and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.870
 really beaten Russian meteorite by 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.840
 Chelyabinsk rocket or inlog like 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.789
 claim some movies on these kinds 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.300
 notice the stains on the glass now 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.370
 mud 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 here but more follow one spot i 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 stopped the frame and showing this spot on 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.399
 glass look like it will 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.290
 move now regarding 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.380
 the relative motion of the meteorite will see 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.540
 meteorite moves to the left of the spot or 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.729
 as if the stain moves to the right along with 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.180
 him by the way this rocket moves 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.299
 if you see here on the frame now i'm 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.759
 I will note now 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:25.900
 straight line between the rocket and the spot on 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.470
 glass and show that this stain can be seen 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.550
 and rockets supposedly they are always on 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.520
 windshield 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.190
 in the same place obviously 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.050
 completely flashing but why is black 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.000
 passes through the comet 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.240
 because the car turns 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.850
 right and the comet itself in the image itself 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.540
 the comet moves relative to the glass shaft 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.790
 left 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.300
 because the car is moving on the right and 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.960
 respectively, respectively black 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.250
 passes when moving comet left 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.240
 glass through a meteorite here you saw that 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.880
 road besteht on turning right and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.030
 don't need big big ones here that 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.790
 you see that no rockets and even more 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.880
 Well, there was not here and it's just a highlight 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.820
 on the glass and thanks for watching and 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.570
 listened to me on my movie total 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.570
