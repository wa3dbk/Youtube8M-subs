out<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.390> base<00:02:18.660> piece<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.330> then<00:02:21.330> cut<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.600> out

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
out this base piece and then cut it out

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.640 
out this base piece and then cut it out
and<00:02:22.080> then<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.450> took<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.660> same<00:02:24.900> piece<00:02:25.350> I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and then I took the same piece I

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.580 
and then I took the same piece I
overlaid<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.790> another<00:02:27.120> piece<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:28.560> I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
overlaid it on another piece and then I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.260 
overlaid it on another piece and then I
traced<00:02:29.040> out<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.490> inside<00:02:31.460> wall<00:02:32.460> piece<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
traced out the inside wall piece and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.590 
traced out the inside wall piece and
then<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.690> cut<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.020> out<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.860> actual

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
then I cut it out this is the actual

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.300 
then I cut it out this is the actual
inside<00:02:36.600> wall<00:02:36.870> piece<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.860> can<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.220> see

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
inside wall piece so you can kind of see

you've got a lot of cardboard and you
don't<00:02:46.950> mind<00:02:47.130> burning<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.670> up<00:02:47.810> doing<00:02:48.810> wall

silhouettes<00:02:50.300> that's<00:02:51.300> great<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.530> don't

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
silhouettes that's great if you don't

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.200 
silhouettes that's great if you don't
have<00:02:52.920> as<00:02:53.010> much<00:02:53.160> cardboard<00:02:53.700> you're<00:02:53.850> gonna<00:02:54.030> want

have as much cardboard you're gonna want
to<00:02:54.300> actually<00:02:55.250> cut<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.730> fit<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:58.440> it's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
to actually cut this to fit so it's it's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.670 
to actually cut this to fit so it's it's
strictly<00:02:59.220> based<00:02:59.520> on<00:02:59.760> on<00:03:00.030> what<00:03:00.840> you've<00:03:01.110> got<00:03:01.380> to

strictly based on on what you've got to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.130 
strictly based on on what you've got to
work<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:02.240> as<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.570> see<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:03.960> got<00:03:04.110> some

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
work with as you can see it's got some

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.060 
work with as you can see it's got some
barrel<00:03:04.590> slits

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
barrel slits

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.050 
barrel slits
I<00:03:05.100> wanted<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.430> give<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.670> little<00:03:05.820> bit<00:03:05.970> of

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
I wanted to give it a little bit of

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.490 
I wanted to give it a little bit of
color<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> raised<00:03:07.740> up<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.160> arrow<00:03:08.340> slits<00:03:09.500> or

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
color so I raised up the arrow slits or

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.110 
color so I raised up the arrow slits or
I<00:03:10.560> cut<00:03:11.280> out<00:03:11.340> card<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:14.130> raised<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
I cut out card and that raised it and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.380 
I cut out card and that raised it and
then<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.390> took<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.720> red<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:17.700> just

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
then I took a red and I just just

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.030 
then I took a red and I just just
highlighted<00:03:18.959> it

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
highlighted it

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.500 
highlighted it
I<00:03:20.870> used<00:03:22.160> Scotty's<00:03:23.160> method<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.640> putting

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
I used Scotty's method of putting

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.990 
I used Scotty's method of putting
texture<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.470> with<00:03:25.650> hot<00:03:25.830> glue<00:03:25.860> which<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:26.970> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
texture on it with hot glue which is a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.360 
texture on it with hot glue which is a
really<00:03:27.510> nice<00:03:27.750> job<00:03:28.110> gives<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.770> it<00:03:28.830> gives<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.310> a

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
really nice job gives you it gives it a

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.370 
really nice job gives you it gives it a
really<00:03:29.520> solid<00:03:30.290> vertical<00:03:31.290> look<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:34.290> other

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
really solid vertical look the other

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.620 
really solid vertical look the other
thing<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.680> did<00:03:34.739> which<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.700> don't<00:03:35.880> have<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.239> do<00:03:36.390> I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
thing I did which you don't have to do I

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.610 
thing I did which you don't have to do I
just<00:03:37.050> did<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.560> do<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:39.060> taped<00:03:39.900> my<00:03:40.080> my

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
just did it to do it is I taped my my

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.830 
just did it to do it is I taped my my
corrugated<00:03:41.310> edges<00:03:41.640> just<00:03:41.970> fold<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.390> underneath

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
corrugated edges just fold it underneath

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.220 
corrugated edges just fold it underneath
and<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:45.030> makes<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.750> gives<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.110> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
and it makes it it gives it the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.050 
and it makes it it gives it the
appearance<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.770> being<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.600> one-piece<00:03:50.060> so

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
appearance of being a one-piece so

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.090 
appearance of being a one-piece so
that's<00:03:51.420> kind<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.780> nice<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.560> know<00:03:52.680> it's<00:03:52.860> it's

bead of hot glue around it and that's
the<00:04:24.630> wall

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
the wall

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.570 
the wall
you<00:04:25.469> know<00:04:25.590> if<00:04:25.800> that's<00:04:25.919> what's<00:04:26.159> so<00:04:26.310> awesome

you know if that's what's so awesome
about<00:04:26.939> his<00:04:27.449> system<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.879> you<00:04:29.879> can<00:04:30.300> add<00:04:30.689> or

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
about his system is you can add or

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.029 
about his system is you can add or
subtract<00:04:31.740> as<00:04:32.219> much<00:04:33.120> as<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.539> want<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.770> uh<00:04:34.889> its

subtract as much as you want it's uh its

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:44.119 
subtract as much as you want it's uh its
concept<00:04:38.039> is<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.879> flexible<00:04:41.990> its<00:04:42.990> its<00:04:43.529> beauty<00:04:44.009> is

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 
concept is so flexible its its beauty is

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.939 
concept is so flexible its its beauty is
its<00:04:44.310> simplicity<00:04:44.819> and<00:04:45.289> it<00:04:46.289> gives<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.800> an

far as you want you might do this entire
dungeon<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.169> decide<00:04:58.500> not<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.710> tape<00:04:59.039> it<00:04:59.159> and

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
dungeon and decide not to tape it and

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.529 
dungeon and decide not to tape it and
then<00:04:59.340> say<00:04:59.490> pow<00:04:59.699> I<00:04:59.849> really<00:05:00.150> like<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.419> way<00:05:00.509> that

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 
a truth this is more of a true 2.5 piece

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.180 
a truth this is more of a true 2.5 piece
of<00:07:07.900> terrain<00:07:08.080> looks<00:07:08.440> like<00:07:08.650> I<00:07:08.680> think<00:07:08.860> it's

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
of terrain looks like I think it's

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.980 
of terrain looks like I think it's
beautiful<00:07:09.460> I<00:07:09.940> think<00:07:10.150> it's<00:07:10.390> got<00:07:10.540> a<00:07:10.570> ton<00:07:10.960> of

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
beautiful I think it's got a ton of

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.750 
beautiful I think it's got a ton of
potential<00:07:11.440> um

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
potential um

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.260 
potential um
and<00:07:13.390> it's<00:07:13.630> cheap<00:07:13.870> and<00:07:14.080> it's<00:07:14.380> fast<00:07:15.130> unlike<00:07:15.940> the

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
and it's cheap and it's fast unlike the

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.500 
and it's cheap and it's fast unlike the
method<00:07:16.630> that<00:07:16.750> I'm<00:07:16.930> using<00:07:17.200> so<00:07:18.240> go<00:07:19.240> and<00:07:19.360> check

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
method that I'm using so go and check

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.420 
method that I'm using so go and check
out<00:07:19.630> his<00:07:19.720> channel<00:07:19.960> and<00:07:20.320> give<00:07:20.770> this<00:07:20.800> a<00:07:20.980> shot<00:07:21.310> if
