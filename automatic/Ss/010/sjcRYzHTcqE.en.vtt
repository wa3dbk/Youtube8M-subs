before<00:00:39.230> we<00:00:40.230> ever<00:00:40.410> really<00:00:40.890> finished<00:00:41.280> our

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
before we ever really finished our

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090 
before we ever really finished our
discussions<00:00:42.290> however<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.469> isn't<00:00:43.829> always

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
discussions however that isn't always

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.850 
discussions however that isn't always
the<00:00:44.430> case<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.719> always<00:00:46.410> made<00:00:46.829> us

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the case but they they always made us

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.940 
the case but they they always made us
feel<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.460> our<00:00:47.969> input<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:48.960> valid<00:00:49.469> until<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
feel like our input was valid until it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.549 
feel like our input was valid until it
came<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.370> actually<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.879> putting<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
came to actually in putting it and so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
came to actually in putting it and so
gradually<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> forum<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:54.270> disbanded<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
gradually the forum was disbanded and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
gradually the forum was disbanded and
the<00:00:55.530> new<00:00:55.739> employee<00:00:56.370> involvement<00:00:56.879> group

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the new employee involvement group

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.270 
the new employee involvement group
however<00:00:57.930> much<00:00:58.230> we'd<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
however much we'd like to think it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.819 
however much we'd like to think it
represents<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.270> employees<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.050> doesn't<00:01:01.620> it's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
represents the employees it doesn't it's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.100 
represents the employees it doesn't it's
selected<00:01:02.370> by<00:01:02.550> management<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.930> are

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
selected by management and they are

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.770 
selected by management and they are
people<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.640> good<00:01:05.970> flight<00:01:06.270> attendants

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
people that are good flight attendants

people that are good flight attendants
but<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.530> definitely<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.580> speak<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
but they definitely do not speak for the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
but they definitely do not speak for the
entire<00:01:09.360> group<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.110> flight<00:01:10.350> attendants<00:01:11.240> I'd
