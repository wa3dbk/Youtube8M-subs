00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
mechanics here and why these spawners

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
mechanics here and why these spawners
are<00:01:10.799> efficient<00:01:11.189> or<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> great

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
are efficient or not and this is a great

is<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.830> chunk<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.220> certain

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
is for one it's in one chunk a certain

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.010 
is for one it's in one chunk a certain
amount<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> mobs<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.299> only<00:01:27.420> spawn<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.840> one

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
amount of mobs can only spawn in one

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.990 
amount of mobs can only spawn in one
chunk<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.350> any<00:01:28.560> given<00:01:28.829> time<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.280> until<00:01:29.850> those

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
chunk at any given time and until those

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.990 
chunk at any given time and until those
mobs<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.390> dead<00:01:30.630> no<00:01:31.259> more<00:01:31.470> mobs<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.920> spawn<00:01:32.189> now

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
mobs are dead no more mobs can spawn now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.179 
mobs are dead no more mobs can spawn now
with<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.810> being<00:01:33.869> said<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.560> move<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
with that being said we move on to the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.340 
with that being said we move on to the
bigger<00:01:35.369> responders<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.020> goes

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
bigger responders which you know goes

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.770 
bigger responders which you know goes
into<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:37.950> chunks<00:01:38.280> boners<00:01:38.670> okay<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.270> now

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
into the two chunks boners okay so now

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.330 
into the two chunks boners okay so now
you<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.020> spotters<00:01:40.350> over<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.890> spawners

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
you have spotters over here spawners

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.999 
you have spotters over here spawners
over<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.799> better

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
over here you can you know get a better

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
over here you can you know get a better
spawn<00:01:44.399> rate<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.210> you're<00:01:45.390> still<00:01:45.570> limited

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
spawn rate but you're still limited

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.240 
spawn rate but you're still limited
because<00:01:46.170> they<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> fall<00:01:46.860> into<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> water

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
because they have to fall into the water

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
because they have to fall into the water
get<00:01:47.939> pushed<00:01:48.180> down<00:01:48.299> fall<00:01:48.899> down<00:01:48.930> fall<00:01:49.530> their

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
get pushed down fall down fall their

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
get pushed down fall down fall their
death<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.189> until<00:01:50.759> those<00:01:50.909> are<00:01:51.090> dead<00:01:51.240> more

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
death and until those are dead more

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.289 
death and until those are dead more
cannot<00:01:51.960> spawn<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:53.729> when<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.180> into

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
cannot spawn so that's when we get into

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.569 
cannot spawn so that's when we get into
the<00:01:54.479> bigger<00:01:54.659> ideas<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.680> might<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.460> get

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the bigger ideas now I might just get

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
the bigger ideas now I might just get
past<00:01:56.820> real<00:01:57.329> quick<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> we're<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
past real quick and we're just going to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.709 
past real quick and we're just going to
go<00:01:58.290> into<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:58.920> when<00:01:59.670> when<00:02:00.180> giant<00:02:00.540> creeper

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
go into this now when when giant creeper

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.300 
go into this now when when giant creeper
spawners<00:02:01.079> our<00:02:01.290> first<00:02:01.469> thought<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.979> lot<00:02:02.189> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
spawners our first thought up a lot of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.770 
spawners our first thought up a lot of
people<00:02:02.430> decided<00:02:03.180> they<00:02:03.210> wanted<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> do

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
people decided they wanted to do

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
people decided they wanted to do
something<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.860> admit<00:02:05.310> even

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
something like this now I admit even

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.639 
something like this now I admit even
myself<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:06.030> vortex<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.110> because

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
myself on vortex I have this because

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.180 
myself on vortex I have this because
honestly<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:08.759> too<00:02:08.910> late

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
honestly I'm too late

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.420 
honestly I'm too late
to<00:02:09.280> make<00:02:09.430> that<00:02:09.640> now<00:02:10.630> what<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:10.990> does<00:02:11.050> is<00:02:11.500> it's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
to make that now what this does is it's

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.840 
to make that now what this does is it's
a<00:02:12.550> big<00:02:12.730> open<00:02:13.090> box<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:14.620> know<00:02:14.650> 8<00:02:14.980> by<00:02:15.190> 8<00:02:15.220> 16<00:02:15.730> by

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
responder to be about 50 high at the top

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.600 
responder to be about 50 high at the top
of<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.900> spawner<00:02:20.230> let's<00:02:20.800> grab<00:02:21.130> some<00:02:21.340> blocks

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
of the spawner let's grab some blocks

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.450 
of the spawner let's grab some blocks
and<00:02:22.000> we'll<00:02:22.090> grab<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.300> fake<00:02:22.720> spawn<00:02:23.020> or<00:02:23.170> block<00:02:23.460> in

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
and we'll grab a fake spawn or block in

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.240 
and we'll grab a fake spawn or block in
this<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:24.820> look<00:02:25.030> nice<00:02:25.210> we<00:02:25.780> go<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:25.960> about<00:02:26.890> let's

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
this one look nice we go up about let's

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:37.650 
this one look nice we go up about let's
say<00:02:27.340> 30<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.210> just<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:33.220> 28<00:02:34.800> set<00:02:35.800> glass<00:02:36.760> okay<00:02:37.270> so

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
say 30 so just up 28 set glass okay so

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.750 
say 30 so just up 28 set glass okay so
you<00:02:37.720> can<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.200> that's<00:02:38.380> about<00:02:38.590> 30<00:02:38.860> high<00:02:39.070> now<00:02:39.730> a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
you can see that's about 30 high now a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.580 
you can see that's about 30 high now a
lot<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.150> people<00:02:40.240> they'll<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.080> these<00:02:41.290> pillars

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
lot of people they'll have these pillars

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.450 
lot of people they'll have these pillars
of<00:02:41.920> spawners<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.210> is<00:02:43.330> what<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.510> do<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
of spawners and this is what I do and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.800 
of spawners and this is what I do and
this<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.120> can<00:02:46.390> make<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.660> in

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
this is you know you can make this in

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.780 
this is you know you can make this in
one<00:02:46.960> or<00:02:47.080> two<00:02:47.110> chunks<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.460> doesn't<00:02:48.610> really

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
one or two chunks but it doesn't really

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.580 
one or two chunks but it doesn't really
matter<00:02:49.090> because<00:02:49.390> these<00:02:49.660> spawners<00:02:50.290> are<00:02:50.470> so

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
matter because these spawners are so

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.930 
matter because these spawners are so
efficient<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.040> have<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> few<00:02:51.580> pillars<00:02:51.910> of

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
efficient you have a few pillars of

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.240 
efficient you have a few pillars of
these<00:02:52.300> in<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:53.140> second<00:02:53.530> they<00:02:53.620> spawn<00:02:53.950> because

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
these in the second they spawn because

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.150 
these in the second they spawn because
they<00:02:54.370> can<00:02:54.520> spawn<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:54.970> midair<00:02:55.150> they'll<00:02:55.840> spawn

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
they can spawn in midair they'll spawn

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.400 
they can spawn in midair they'll spawn
fall<00:02:57.160> died<00:02:58.000> instantly<00:02:58.720> another<00:02:59.110> one<00:02:59.290> can

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
fall died instantly another one can

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.110 
fall died instantly another one can
spawn<00:02:59.710> and<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.490> maximizes<00:03:01.090> your

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
spawn and this is maximizes your

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.210 
spawn and this is maximizes your
spawning<00:03:01.480> rate<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.960> this<00:03:02.740> spawner<00:03:03.010> right

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
spawning rate and this spawner right

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.520 
spawning rate and this spawner right
here<00:03:03.430> even<00:03:03.940> if<00:03:04.030> it's<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.270> 2<00:03:04.480> by<00:03:04.690> 2<00:03:04.720> whole<00:03:05.140> with

here even if it's a 2 by 2 whole with
four<00:03:05.770> spawners<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.600> triple<00:03:07.600> as<00:03:07.660> efficient<00:03:08.080> as

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
four spawners is triple as efficient as

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.750 
four spawners is triple as efficient as
this<00:03:08.380> one<00:03:08.560> over<00:03:08.770> here<00:03:08.800> with<00:03:09.220> let's<00:03:09.400> say<00:03:09.550> five

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
this one over here with let's say five

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.220 
this one over here with let's say five
or<00:03:09.790> six<00:03:10.090> boners<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.510> that's<00:03:10.900> just<00:03:11.080> because

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
or six boners and that's just because

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.110 
or six boners and that's just because
more<00:03:11.620> responding<00:03:12.220> per<00:03:12.430> minute<00:03:12.730> per<00:03:12.940> hour

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
more responding per minute per hour

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.699 
more responding per minute per hour
everything<00:03:13.930> like<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.080> your<00:03:14.380> rates<00:03:14.560> are

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
everything like that your rates are

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.270 
everything like that your rates are
better<00:03:14.830> now<00:03:15.580> this<00:03:16.680> concept<00:03:17.680> right<00:03:17.860> here<00:03:18.130> as

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
better now this concept right here as

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.460 
better now this concept right here as
you<00:03:18.640> can<00:03:18.700> see<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.030> very<00:03:19.390> expensive<00:03:19.660> hoppers

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
you can see it's very expensive hoppers

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.229 
you can see it's very expensive hoppers
and<00:03:20.500> most<00:03:20.770> faction<00:03:21.100> servers<00:03:21.400> cost<00:03:21.670> money<00:03:21.940> you

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
and most faction servers cost money you

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.479 
and most faction servers cost money you
cannot<00:03:22.510> craft<00:03:22.870> them<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.370> know

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
cannot craft them and that you know

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.000 
cannot craft them and that you know
that's<00:03:24.730> an<00:03:24.850> issue<00:03:24.940> for<00:03:25.090> players<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:26.080> we<00:03:26.830> move

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
that's an issue for players so we move

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.710 
that's an issue for players so we move
into<00:03:27.190> something<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:27.970> which<00:03:28.270> is<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.480> lot

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
into something like this which is a lot

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.210 
into something like this which is a lot
of<00:03:28.750> gone<00:03:29.020> shoulder<00:03:29.260> factions<00:03:29.680> use<00:03:29.830> this<00:03:30.040> I

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
of gone shoulder factions use this I

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.830 
of gone shoulder factions use this I
personally<00:03:30.340> don't<00:03:31.270> like<00:03:31.360> doing<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.720> because

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
personally don't like doing it because

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.949 
personally don't like doing it because
it's<00:03:32.080> really<00:03:32.290> time<00:03:32.500> consuming<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:33.130> build

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
it's really time consuming to build

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's really time consuming to build
personally<00:03:34.959> for<00:03:35.080> me<00:03:35.200> because<00:03:35.470> I'm<00:03:35.560> very<00:03:35.680> bad

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
personally for me because I'm very bad

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.530 
personally for me because I'm very bad

at placing fences and cobblestone walls

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.600 
at placing fences and cobblestone walls
it's<00:03:38.170> all<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.410> says<00:03:38.560> cobblestone<00:03:39.130> walls<00:03:39.370> and

it's all it says cobblestone walls and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.850 
it's all it says cobblestone walls and
fences<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.239> stagger<00:03:40.540> them<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.380> when<00:03:41.830> a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
fences and you stagger them so when a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.610 
fences and you stagger them so when a
mob<00:03:42.070> Falls<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:43.060> dies<00:03:43.269> from<00:03:43.540> fall<00:03:43.810> damage<00:03:44.140> it

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
stuff falls into the water and gets

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.090 
stuff falls into the water and gets
pushed<00:03:46.540> into<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.780> hopper<00:03:46.989> system<00:03:47.470> now<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
pushed into a hopper system now the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.680 
pushed into a hopper system now the
spawn<00:03:48.610> rates<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:48.880> can<00:03:48.910> be<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.150> exact<00:03:49.360> same<00:03:49.540> is

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
spawn rates you can be the exact same is

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.210 
spawn rates you can be the exact same is
that<00:03:49.840> because<00:03:50.110> as<00:03:50.350> soon<00:03:50.500> as<00:03:50.590> they<00:03:50.680> spawn<00:03:50.920> they

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
that because as soon as they spawn they

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.000 
that because as soon as they spawn they
fall<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.670> ok<00:03:52.420> now<00:03:52.930> clear<00:03:53.470> lag<00:03:53.620> could<00:03:53.830> remove

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
fall and I ok now clear lag could remove

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.380 
fall and I ok now clear lag could remove
some<00:03:54.220> mere<00:03:54.370> items<00:03:54.640> it's<00:03:54.880> not<00:03:55.060> like<00:03:55.209> it's<00:03:55.330> that

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
some mere items it's not like it's that

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.930 
some mere items it's not like it's that
big<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.840> deal<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.290> know<00:03:56.380> what<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.530> mean<00:03:56.940> the

big of a deal you know what I mean the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.370 
big of a deal you know what I mean the
spawner<00:03:58.239> can<00:03:58.480> be<00:03:58.600> as<00:03:58.690> big<00:03:58.900> as<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.140> want

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
spawner can be as big as you want

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.930 
spawner can be as big as you want
