his toughness we've got to perk threes

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.140 
his toughness we've got to perk threes
and<00:02:17.709> therefore<00:02:18.069> we<00:02:18.129> have<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.280> perk<00:02:18.580> 3<00:02:18.849> greed

dexterity goleta which of the c4 and
we've<00:02:24.430> got<00:02:24.580> tactical<00:02:25.120> which<00:02:25.599> is<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.810> EMP

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
we've got tactical which is the EMP

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.320 
we've got tactical which is the EMP
grenade<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.340> split<00:02:27.519> on<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.730> class<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.150> and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
grenade and I split on this class up and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.420 
grenade and I split on this class up and
actually<00:02:28.450> see<00:02:28.870> why<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.140> applies<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.220> name

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
actually see why it applies to the name

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.330 
actually see why it applies to the name
terminator<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.930> with<00:02:32.140> Elsa<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.799> very<00:02:33.129> very

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
terminator so with Elsa is a very very

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.970 
terminator so with Elsa is a very very
strong<00:02:33.519> lmg<00:02:34.239> weapon<00:02:34.569> practically<00:02:35.349> penetrates

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
strong lmg weapon practically penetrates

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.860 
strong lmg weapon practically penetrates
everything<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.700> do<00:02:36.879> feel<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.360> should<00:02:37.420> have<00:02:37.690> put

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
everything I do feel I should have put

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.930 
everything I do feel I should have put
FMJ<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.920> didn't<00:02:39.190> think<00:02:39.340> maybe<00:02:39.640> that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
FMJ on it but I didn't think maybe that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.910 
FMJ on it but I didn't think maybe that
would<00:02:40.090> be<00:02:40.120> best<00:02:40.480> cuz<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.900> thought<00:02:41.110> adjustable

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
would be best cuz I thought adjustable

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.229 
would be best cuz I thought adjustable
stock<00:02:42.160> way<00:02:42.310> better<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.819> can<00:02:42.910> move<00:02:43.180> a

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
stock way better so you can move a

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.449 
stock way better so you can move a
little<00:02:43.510> bit<00:02:43.599> faster<00:02:44.170> since<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.769> have<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.950> LSAT

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
little bit faster since we have the LSAT

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.740 
little bit faster since we have the LSAT
and<00:02:45.489> therefore<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.000> have<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.329> steadiness

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
and therefore you have that steadiness

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.720 
and therefore you have that steadiness
with<00:02:47.079> you<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.500> target<00:02:48.160> finder<00:02:48.370> merely

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
with you and target finder merely

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.220 
with you and target finder merely
because<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:49.090> can<00:02:49.239> mark<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.660> enemy<00:02:50.049> from

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
because you can mark the enemy from

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.870 
because you can mark the enemy from
wherever<00:02:50.500> they<00:02:50.680> are<00:02:50.829> so<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.489> guys<00:02:51.640> have<00:02:51.760> ever

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
wherever they are so you guys have ever

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.100 
wherever they are so you guys have ever

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
like the target find that does as well

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.580 
like the target find that does as well
now<00:03:01.390> let's<00:03:01.599> go<00:03:01.750> through<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.079> perks<00:03:02.349> as<00:03:02.560> a

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
windows gun fights a lot more I decided

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.770 
windows gun fights a lot more I decided
to<00:04:14.260> put<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.799> perk<00:04:15.099> just<00:04:15.819> in<00:04:16.030> case<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.359> just

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
to put that perk just in case and just

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.950 
then pick up the kill EMP grenade i
would<00:04:30.250> actually<00:04:30.340> think<00:04:30.759> this<00:04:30.970> that's<00:04:31.720> cause

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
would actually think this that's cause

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.300 
would actually think this that's cause
very<00:04:32.320> very<00:04:32.500> important<00:04:32.889> because<00:04:32.949> you<00:04:33.190> can

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
very very important because you can

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.279 
very very important because you can
throw<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.699> at<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.940> enemy's<00:04:34.270> equipment<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.050> it

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
throw it at the enemy's equipment and it

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.990 
throw it at the enemy's equipment and it
will<00:04:35.410> just<00:04:35.560> stop<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.220> from<00:04:36.340> being<00:04:36.490> able<00:04:36.729> to<00:04:36.789> use

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
will just stop it from being able to use

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.610 
will just stop it from being able to use
just<00:04:37.300> like<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.570> tomato<00:04:37.870> could<00:04:38.020> do<00:04:38.229> in<00:04:38.470> the
