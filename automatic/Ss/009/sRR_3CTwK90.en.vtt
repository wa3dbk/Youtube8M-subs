00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hi friends today we will have 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.919
 life hacking and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.170
 one small ad each of you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.750
 faced such a problem that on 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.240
 workplace during lunch either just 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.630
 when you miss uncomfortable watching your 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.670
 series or some interesting video 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.010
 you can solve the issue is very easy to buy 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.849
 stand for and pdn or go others 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.859
 by not buying these under 2 very 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.890
 a lot and make it easy for them 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.100
 enjoy and cheap can go by 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.370
 another way and i took one worker 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.930
 model without plaster cast where he 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.520
 small cuts and now you can 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.670
 put ipad and use let's say 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 This podstavochka draw and conveniently you not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 you need to carry it every single time 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.780
 Places on the other can just be done 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.710
 several pieces and you and your colleagues can 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.079
 no problem using such 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.020
 creative solution to this problem for 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.960
 this you need to take a model to position your 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.330
 office credit from the angle that you 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.479
 it will be convenient for me it is 10 to 15 degrees 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.480
 and make small ticks where you don't 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.810
 best to see, respectively, 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.650
 you need to make a groove 5 10 millimeter 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.710
 and do not need to have ipad far 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.140
 intently either vestibular area 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.340
 better place it somewhere in the middle 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.960
 106 you will be and popular 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.980
 sorry distal who can 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.840
