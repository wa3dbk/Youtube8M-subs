00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.589
 youtube channel of cottonou m today 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.570
 a video a bit special about a 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.099
 technique that is used in bodybuilding 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.840
 the super 7 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.450
 so this is a technique that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.640
 normally we use rather in phase 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.230
 cuttlefish and yet if one uses 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.390
 correctly we can also have very 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 good results on a wedding 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.990
 so I think you all have already 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.490
 heard about super 7 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.769
 but do you really know 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.660
 how we use them and how we use them 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.160
 integrates into a March take program 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 this is what we will see in this video 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.140
 first let's see what exactly are 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.579
 the super 7 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.500
 so a super 7 is very simple 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.719
 comes from languages ​​and 7 in English these 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.309
 series so super series that's it 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.739
 simply the sequence of several 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.559
 exercises so in the announced two even 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.930
 three in a row without time count of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 recovery okay so like a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.690
 example is much better than a long 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 explanation 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.210
 here is an example of a super 7 you have 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.930
 Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 in our 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.699
 super 7 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.129
 so you are asked to do some 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.710
 repetitions on each one you do 10 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.820
 repetitions of exercise one 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.340
 immediately followed with the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.110
 rehearsals on exercise 2 and that's 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 only after that you take your 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.340
 one minute thirty minutes 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.950
 okay all this is not considered 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.479
 as a single series there you have a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.970
 super done on two exercises 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.220
 I kept the 10 repetitions and the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.259
 minute thirty to fit with the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.689
 mass-gain programs but 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.939
 following the program that you do 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.640
 it can be numbers completely 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.799
 different we 'll talk about it later so 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 the principle of super 7 is extremely 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.470
 simple 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.659
 now how to introduce it into a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.980
 program more of the masses the problem 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.300
 from a lot of 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.750
 two people the mistake that is made 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.100
 it's working on this method 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.230
 on the same muscle group 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.670
 for example for the pecs people 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.470
 you work them in super 7 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.630
 while they are in mass hold and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.130
 will work on two exercises for 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.260
 the pectorals the bench press and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.390
 keep away from me lying down for example 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.520
 so it's true that even without work 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.570
 not exactly on the same fiber one 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.570
 is still on the same group 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.490
 muscle the pectoralis major and so he 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.800
 there is still a risk of getting out of 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.480
 logic of gaining mass so what I 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.250
 offers you is to work on 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.510
 two muscle groups completely 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.960
 different who do not work 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.180
 together 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.190
 if for example you want to boost a 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.430
 little your weight gain and that you 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.210
 are tired of the classic pattern in 10 10 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.680
 if you are designing a peck biceps session 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.540
 tried alternating on a super concept 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.090
 you do for example in your 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.310
 program on the series you that you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.950
 design a bench press 10 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.380
 repetitions chained immediately with 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.120
 a heart to the bar on 10 repetitions 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.340
 and only after you take your 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.610
 minutes of recovery and so of 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.220
 after 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.330
 always at the pecs exercise with a 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.280
 biceps exercise 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.100
 it will have more work on two 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.900
 muscle groups that normally 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.880
 according to the exercises does not solicit 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.550
 one and the other and so you will see that 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.970
 conversion the sensation is not the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.980
 war 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.280
 this method will have the effect 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.470
 to intensify a maximum your sessions this 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.420
 which will trigger the process of 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.490
 recovery and reconstruction 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.990
 muscular much earlier some 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.610
 people need a lot of sessions 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.260
 more intense to have better 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.790
 sensations and for their bodies 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.890
 begin to react 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.290
 this is the case for example damien one of the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.370
 clients that I am thanks to the method 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.380
 cotonou had the programs 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.540
 custom that had a lot of 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.790
 bad to put on weight and in estonia 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.459
 with a profession that engenders a 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.709
 very high energy expenditure your very 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.990
 hard to gain mass and to 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.550
 delays according to him on the gene arms have 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.459
 plenty of products in his sessions 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.250
 a great work especially on 7 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.530
 full sessions dedicated to the arms 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.330
 triceps 10 aix work at the same time 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.520
 to give you an example of what he 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.560
 had in his sessions super 7 2 dips 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.260
 with his chorus of larry scott 10 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.270
 series 10 repetitions no dips 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.220
 chained immediately with 10 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.020
 rehearsals of heart or larry scott 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.870
 before taking the time to retrieve 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.410
 it had the effect of intensifying 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.840
 a lot of these sessions 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.220
 he was completely shaved both 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.269
 first weeks while yet he 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.709
 will admit that the sessions were 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.930
 much shorter than they 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.359
 used to do but on the 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.350
 three months of follow-up that the mother lasts 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.590
 did not have other Chinese coasts 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.330
 we arrived at a total of seven kilos 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.250
 of a gain of mass so this 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.440
 parade especially for annick you lie and 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.460
 especially he caught up with the delay they 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.890
 had on the branches taking 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.660
 a few centimeters so to sum up 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.040
 and for you to know not to do so 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.530
 you opt for the method which is super 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.810
 7 is not super 7 on the same or 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.970
 muscle if you get tired retro 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.680
 muscle and you would go against 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.690
 principles of peace tomorrow is chosen 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.990
 his two different muscle groups 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.070
 and keep the 10 repetitions and the 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.710
 line 32 reclaimed 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.060
