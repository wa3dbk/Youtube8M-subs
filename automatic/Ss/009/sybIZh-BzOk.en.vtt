00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.980
 Yes 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.130
 Glove cruiser I following the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.860
 Lifestyle Series in Lifestyle State 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.210
 I would like to introduce Gloveful 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.400
 It is here of headphones 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.810
 Feature is 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.910
 2 types 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.410
 mainly 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.260
 There is 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.610
 First of all Bluetooth 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.470
 Disappearing into the in 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.930
 It will be called real headphones 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.170
 That is 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.170
 a ridge 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.550
 It has a high degree of portability and is lightweight 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.680
 The rest is thin 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.090
 When it can be stored thinly 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.350
 It feels like 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.800
 It seems like there is this picture in 8 well 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.520
 I'm pulling a card like this, but that way 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.240
 The main thing is to use it for travel 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.560
 Is this a concept 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.730
 This is pretty 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.190
 Adult design 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.220
 I Do with 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:17.450
 Because I feel that say of the adults in your 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.909
 I bit segment or let's open immediately or that personality 's Ne' through 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.850
 I 'm not serious 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.689
 Why not open it 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.689
 By say 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.580
 Familiar 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.890
 But it has entered pompous package 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.890
 I think the color is also hurts Do beautiful slightly 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.170
 Came out in this 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.479
 It's amazing 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:57.150
 It seems like something like this ipad put 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.150
 The headphones are burnt in 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.240
 It is such feeling It is cool It is this 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.320
 Do not try to see in a little up 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.320
 It's like this 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.670
 Real Well Apply 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.030
 I feel like this 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.730
 This is 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:27.350
 I think Na are here pun after feeling that will be or has decreased in was the cause of death 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:32.780
 Isn't this a butterfly Aban this 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.810
 This looks Choi is Wal feeling it this Choi Wal point 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.710
 Like 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.650
 Feeling 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.480
 There are few corner years 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:47.319
 A sound looks good 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.319
 There is an atmosphere, and on the 9th this is a sheep 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.629
 I'm sorry I am a soft guy 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.629
 Because I do not have to do it 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.110
 I feel say 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.020
 So I would like to listen immediately it is this much trouble why bluetooth 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.490
 Or Let's hear carved in 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.780
 This is it 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.440
 Please press and hold 4 seconds 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.040
 Long press 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.040
 Do not go and shine not red because it Hikari with your network Do 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.060
 It was Pipau 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.170
 In this 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.620
 Well iphone for 4th generation 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.620
 with this 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.920
 Only 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.630
 It's over 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.040
 What kind of sound does this sound? 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:48.099
 I would like to ask you for a moment 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.099
 Well this is that fit 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.099
 Pretty fit 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.940
 Better than I thought 9 cushions are so soft that it fits the shape of their ears 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.660
 Like us in Sumikon Anne Te 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.660
 It feels like 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.129
 Well then 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.710
 Hear 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.840
 Well, in this regard 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:43.120
 It's fine, I guess this is a really realistic trip 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:48.689
 But that focus is I feel that it 's such a what is out 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.100
 It has become a design not too tired listening stick for a long time to real 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.529
 8 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.769
 Oh dear 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:05:03.260
 The frequency band where human beings work well and I am very tired if I say a fine story from 20,000 

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:05.689
 Like everywhere around here are rounded pretty I'd two million people 1000hz and his Rahen to 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.670
 Feeling image 4 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.920
 Lo is not so violent 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.150
 Oh dear 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.110
 I have also heard tell the truth and thus entered in advance in order to really take Well I How 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.950
 but 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.030
 It is about 4 hours more really 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.060
 If you want to leave me alone, this is definitely it 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.540
 Say 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:31.490
 It is a music production because I feel it, but I really specialize in it, but the sense is great. 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.190
 Not this 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:39.230
 Whether it is music production 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:44.020
 I 'm not asking what I 'm doing in pursuit of some sort of ideal sound 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:48.400
 It has been casually dressed Toka to accompany Really Well day 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:51.610
 Isn't there anything more than this? 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.790
 I'm worried about this little bit of feeling 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.850
 Really even this personally and hate 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.300
 I feel great envelopment is also good 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.300
 Long time 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:07.960
 I am not tired even if I listen 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:10.460
 The great concept is clear and this is great 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.670
 I think it's piping yes 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.639
 That's why this is a carrying case 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.050
 It will be fine 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.729
 Seriously De 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.729
 It means that you are tired 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.360
 Because this is that too, hey- 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.960
 Over there yeah yeah 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.000
 Yeah ene 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.880
 It feels like you get charged 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.770
 It's like that 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.770
 But this is carrying case day 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.000
 When picked in this kind of feeling 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.000
 In particular say 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.920
 Like this 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.449
 Horn 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.160
 It will be something 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:57.910
 Oh dear 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:02.160
 Do Well Toka after a business trip or saying for a long time force many people to 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.160
 It's not quite good, isn't it? 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:10.830
 Somehow I got water and it was a long time 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.830
 that 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:20.020
 A person who wants to live 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:21.220
 People who listen to their headphones for a long time and say that their ears get tired 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.420
 Parallel 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.530
 It is recommended this was 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.530
 Feeling that
