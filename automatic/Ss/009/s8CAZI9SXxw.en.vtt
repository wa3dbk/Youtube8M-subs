00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
at all costs you know and let the thing

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.039 
at all costs you know and let the thing
is<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.299> he's<00:03:19.419> was<00:03:19.569> thinking<00:03:19.840> for<00:03:19.989> himself

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
is that he's was thinking for himself

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.289 
is that he's was thinking for himself
most<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.650> season<00:03:20.980> he<00:03:21.370> had<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.549> terrible<00:03:22.090> game
