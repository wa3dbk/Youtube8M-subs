00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.959
 Hi, I'm Spanish or the carp, I'm 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.940
 studying the communications career 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.400
 Now I'm in the third cycle 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.469
 in college good lime makes a 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.560
 week on the youtube channel that I have 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.849
 with a friend is called do not miss you 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.210
 we decided to conduct a social experiment 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.789
 which consisted 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.340
 to see that he was honored are the 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.500
 Peruvians then the experiment let's say 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.050
 a bill of 10 soles to the ground opens to 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.670
 side of someone and let's see what was their 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.140
 reaction not if you keep the ticket or 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.140
 if the people returned it 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.240
 we did this experiment because I already know 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.880
 had done in our countries as 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.410
 mexico and spain if I'm not wrong 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.180
 also ecuador 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.059
 obviously they had some 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.620
 results and we wanted to see what they were going to 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.270
 be the results here in our country 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.590
 in Peru then we already imagined that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.600
 actions were going to have people but 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 we can not confirm anything until we can 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.250
 know it by doing the video 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.340
 we're recording today to see if the 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.610
 people return the tickets when they 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.980
 it falls 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.980
 look look this is two big and the 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.700
 People do not see money when it falls out 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.700
 and I would throw him 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.290
 in fact if we thought it was going to be 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.450
 quite shared by people but not 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.280
 to the point that they will come out in all 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.780
 media in the newspapers most important 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.860
 from the country 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 however it will be a video that we did 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.979
 with the intention of creating awareness in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.460
 the people the media had helped 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.350
 sharing it not inside the channel yes 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.300
 we plan to continue doing 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.310
 social experiments this has been the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.899
 first we have done 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.930
 the people that we hope we 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.909
 return the money they did not and the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.879
 we hope they do not return it if 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:20.280
 they did then there like we 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.989
 we are like what is happening here and there 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.120
 it was where the moral that came out was 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.159
 at the end of the video that is part of the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.140
 reflection for the people who have 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.990
 seen the video 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.830
 can you can see that something for 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.830
 eat something that people like you
