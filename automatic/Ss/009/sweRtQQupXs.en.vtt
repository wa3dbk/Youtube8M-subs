I guess

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
I guess
they<00:01:35.760> say<00:01:35.939> everything<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.299> Florida<00:01:36.689> rots

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

that's<00:01:37.260> that<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.439> don't<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:37.979> I've<00:01:38.100> been

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that's that I don't think so I've been

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
that's that I don't think so I've been
to<00:01:38.340> Florida<00:01:38.640> what's<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.570> thing<00:01:39.720> look<00:01:39.900> like

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
to Florida what's this thing look like

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.240 
to Florida what's this thing look like
underneath<00:01:40.290> complete

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
underneath complete

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.539 
underneath complete
oh<00:01:41.930> this<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.080> late<00:01:43.350> 63<00:01:44.010> because<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.400> has<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
oh this is a late 63 because it has a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
oh this is a late 63 because it has a
through<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.299> gas<00:01:45.509> tank<00:01:45.900> shifter<00:01:46.350> yep<00:01:46.710> which

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
through the gas tank shifter yep which

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.399 
through the gas tank shifter yep which
is<00:01:47.310> much<00:01:47.490> more<00:01:47.670> complicated<00:01:48.259> because<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
is much more complicated because you

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.920 
is much more complicated because you
gotta<00:01:49.619> drop<00:01:50.040> stuff<00:01:50.369> extra<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.150> works<00:01:51.689> better

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
gotta drop stuff extra but works better

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.780 
gotta drop stuff extra but works better
more<00:01:52.229> direct<00:01:52.530> shifting<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> that's<00:01:53.250> great<00:01:53.580> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
more direct shifting and that's great it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.030 
more direct shifting and that's great it
feels<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.540> yeah<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.470> other<00:01:55.590> ones<00:01:55.799> called

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
feels really yeah the other ones called

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.219 
feels really yeah the other ones called
the<00:01:56.100> mystery<00:01:56.430> shifter<00:01:56.909> maybe<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.780> get<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:57.960> year

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the mystery shifter maybe you get a year

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.260 
the mystery shifter maybe you get a year
maybe<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.590> don't

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270
