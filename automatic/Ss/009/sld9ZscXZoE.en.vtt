Guzman<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.200> come<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.470> against<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:35.100> very

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
Guzman we come up against a very very

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.969 
Guzman we come up against a very very
pasty<00:01:35.850> brazilian<00:01:36.600> side<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.799> was

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
pasty brazilian side there and it was

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.469 
pasty brazilian side there and it was
quite<00:01:38.250> difficult<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.759> me<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> create<00:01:39.150> chances

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
quite difficult for me to create chances

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.359 
quite difficult for me to create chances
in<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.960> first<00:01:40.140> half<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.650> he<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.890> picks

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
in the first half and he actually picks

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.760 
in the first half and he actually picks
up<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> penalty<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.659> he<00:01:43.229> will<00:01:43.530> actually

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
up a penalty here and he will actually

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
up a penalty here and he will actually
hit<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> bar<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.119> very<00:01:45.329> lucky<00:01:45.810> there

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
hit the bar so I get very lucky there

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.649 
hit the bar so I get very lucky there
and<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.979> still<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> only<00:01:47.759> nil<00:01:48.180> nil<00:01:48.420> then

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and it's still in the only nil nil then

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
and it's still in the only nil nil then
in<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> 20th<00:01:49.380> minute<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.950> shot<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.430> my

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
in the 20th minute I get a shot in my

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.880 
in the 20th minute I get a shot in my
first<00:01:50.820> proper<00:01:51.119> shot<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> half<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
first proper shot in the half and it's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
first proper shot in the half and it's
not<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> best<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.790> goals<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> makes<00:01:54.540> it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
not the best of goals but it makes it

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.200 
not the best of goals but it makes it
one<00:01:54.930> nil<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.619> he<00:01:55.860> gets<00:01:56.130> another<00:01:56.729> penalty

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
one nil and then he gets another penalty

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990 
one nil and then he gets another penalty
not<00:01:57.540> quite<00:01:57.869> sure<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:58.829> Pato<00:01:59.159> who<00:01:59.670> got

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
not quite sure if it was Pato who got

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.850 
not quite sure if it was Pato who got
Tangela<00:02:00.450> what<00:02:00.600> actually<00:02:00.990> happened<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.799> he

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
Tangela what actually happened but he

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.889 
Tangela what actually happened but he
will<00:02:02.040> convert<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.880> make<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.270> 1-1<00:02:03.750> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
will convert that to make it 1-1 and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
will convert that to make it 1-1 and
then<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.380> into<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.890> second<00:02:05.250> half<00:02:05.280> why

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
then we go into the second half why

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.370 
then we go into the second half why
would<00:02:06.119> start<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> create<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.780> whole<00:02:07.020> lot<00:02:07.200> more

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
would start to create a whole lot more

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
would start to create a whole lot more
chances<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.920> kind<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.310> started<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.789> find<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.149> way

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
chances I kind of started to find a way

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
chances I kind of started to find a way
to<00:02:09.330> break<00:02:09.599> him<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.500> he<00:02:10.709> did<00:02:11.039> rush

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
to break him down because he did rush

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
to break him down because he did rush

a little<00:02:13.600> bit<00:02:13.690> patient<00:02:13.930> before<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.500> took<00:02:14.620> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
a little bit patient before it took the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.980 
a little bit patient before it took the
chances<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.820> make<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.240> everyone<00:02:16.810> here

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
substitutions what would build in the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.600 
substitutions what would build in the
start<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.830> series<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.340> come<00:03:09.490> up<00:03:09.580> with

really tough game it was very good at
defending<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.830> I<00:03:14.890> didn't<00:03:15.160> create<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.490> that

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
defending and I didn't create and that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.160

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
get a bag onto it would pass it around

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.310 
get a bag onto it would pass it around
and<00:03:21.730> we<00:03:21.850> find<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.360> wrap<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.750> go<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.110> little

that<00:03:31.090> he<00:03:31.180> gets<00:03:31.450> through<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.590> could<00:03:32.769> already

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
that he gets through and I could already

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.949 
that he gets through and I could already
see<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.340> could<00:03:33.550> not<00:03:33.580> catch<00:03:33.970> up<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.480> tried<00:03:34.810> to

never<00:03:36.970> get<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:38.200> he<00:03:38.350> makes<00:03:38.560> it<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.860> 1-1<00:03:39.430> and

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
little bit of a difficult time creating

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.100 
little bit of a difficult time creating
any<00:05:16.060> chance<00:05:16.300> because<00:05:16.479> you<00:05:16.719> just<00:05:16.900> stood

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
any chance because you just stood

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.629 
any chance because you just stood
watching<00:05:17.409> me<00:05:17.680> for<00:05:17.830> most<00:05:18.039> of<00:05:18.159> the<00:05:18.250> time<00:05:18.460> with

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
watching me for most of the time with

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.399 
watching me for most of the time with
the<00:05:18.729> contain<00:05:19.150> so<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.719> makes<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.110> little<00:05:20.199> bit

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
the contain so it makes a little bit

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:21.930 
the contain so it makes a little bit
difficult<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.860> get<00:05:21.159> those<00:05:21.340> kill<00:05:21.580> moves<00:05:21.729> going

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.600 
difficult to get those kill moves going
but<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.240> will<00:05:22.539> make<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:22.990> if<00:05:23.139> 21<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.069> I'll<00:05:24.400> get

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
but I will make it if 21 and I'll get

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.209 
but I will make it if 21 and I'll get
another<00:05:24.729> chance<00:05:25.180> at<00:05:25.419> web<00:05:25.539> pick<00:05:25.930> up<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.500> penalty

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
passes there I tried to intercept it but

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.320 
passes there I tried to intercept it but
I<00:06:17.289> couldn't<00:06:17.740> get<00:06:17.889> onto<00:06:18.279> it<00:06:18.310> and<00:06:18.550> he<00:06:18.909> makes<00:06:18.940> it

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
I couldn't get onto it and he makes it

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.300 
I couldn't get onto it and he makes it
11<00:06:19.629> and<00:06:20.020> that<00:06:20.139> was<00:06:20.259> his<00:06:20.440> only<00:06:20.560> shot<00:06:20.770> in<00:06:21.159> the

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.610 
11 and that was his only shot in the
half<00:06:21.520> so<00:06:21.729> I<00:06:21.759> felt<00:06:22.120> I<00:06:22.330> should<00:06:22.569> try<00:06:23.110> and<00:06:23.169> get<00:06:23.349> back

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
on target so I was a little bit of

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.870 
on target so I was a little bit of
frustrated<00:06:51.860> that<00:06:51.950> I<00:06:51.980> didn't<00:06:52.310> have<00:06:52.340> the<00:06:52.640> lead

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880

but he did a pretty good job at
defending<00:06:55.850> and<00:06:56.000> I<00:06:56.060> could<00:06:56.210> never<00:06:56.450> get<00:06:56.810> that

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
defending and I could never get that

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.230 
defending and I could never get that
