00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
hello Here I am talking about this wiper

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.010 
hello Here I am talking about this wiper
delay<00:00:14.910> again<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.980> this<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.310> second

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
delay again and this is the second

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.390 
delay again and this is the second
generation<00:00:19.020> or<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.289> next<00:00:19.590> gen<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.279> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
generation or the next gen as I like to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.420 
generation or the next gen as I like to
call<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.630> sounds<00:00:21.930> cool<00:00:22.010> but<00:00:23.010> this

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
call it because it sounds cool but this

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.000 
call it because it sounds cool but this
one<00:00:23.609> uses<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.470> remotely<00:00:25.470> locatable

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
one uses the remotely locatable

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.450 
one uses the remotely locatable
potentiometer<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.869> hmm<00:00:28.590> probably<00:00:28.920> close

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
potentiometer you got hmm probably close

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.170 
potentiometer you got hmm probably close
to<00:00:29.640> three<00:00:29.880> feet<00:00:30.090> worth<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.539> high<00:00:31.170> quality

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
to three feet worth of high quality

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.430 
to three feet worth of high quality
cable<00:00:33.350> for<00:00:34.350> wire<00:00:34.880> cable<00:00:35.880> nicely<00:00:36.840> heat<00:00:37.079> shrink

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
cable for wire cable nicely heat shrink

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.459 
cable for wire cable nicely heat shrink
there<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.040> say<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.399> myself

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
there if I do say so myself

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.950 
there if I do say so myself
to<00:00:40.610> locate<00:00:41.610> wherever<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> want<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> locate<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to locate wherever you want to locate it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440 
to locate wherever you want to locate it
I'm<00:00:43.320> gonna<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.739> backwards<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.329> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
I'm gonna do this backwards it's kind of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.430 
I'm gonna do this backwards it's kind of
just<00:00:47.180> penciled<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.329> there<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> speak<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
just penciled in there so to speak to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
just penciled in there so to speak to
show<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> operation<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.300> same<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
show the operation is the same as the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.520 
show the operation is the same as the
first<00:00:52.590> generation<00:00:55.399> it's<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.730> wired<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.530> like

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
first generation it's it's wired in like

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.130 
first generation it's it's wired in like
I'd<00:00:58.680> say<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.480> I'm<00:01:00.480> gonna<00:01:00.660> I'm<00:01:00.960> gonna<00:01:01.020> go

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I'd say just just I'm gonna I'm gonna go

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.709 
I'd say just just I'm gonna I'm gonna go
backwards<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.920> take<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> then

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
backwards I'm gonna take it out and then

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
backwards I'm gonna take it out and then
show<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.049> some<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> pieces<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
show you some of the pieces of it but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
show you some of the pieces of it but
basically<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.810> far<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.140> operation<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
basically as far as operation is

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.550 
basically as far as operation is
concerned<00:01:08.659> yeah<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:09.869> holding<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> bracket

concerned yeah I'm holding this bracket

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
concerned yeah I'm holding this bracket

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
put it in the 5/16 hole I mean maybe you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.469 
put it in the 5/16 hole I mean maybe you
know<00:01:32.159> put<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> hole<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:33.000> bezel<00:01:33.180> or

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
know put a hole in your bezel or

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.090 
know put a hole in your bezel or
something<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.079> might<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.950> your

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
something like that might not be your

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
something like that might not be your
first<00:01:35.280> choice<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.210> think<00:01:36.810> it'll<00:01:36.960> look

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
first choice but I think it'll look

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
first choice but I think it'll look
pretty<00:01:37.320> sweet<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.670> below<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
pretty sweet actually right below that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.569 
pretty sweet actually right below that
your<00:01:39.119> existing<00:01:39.540> wiper<00:01:40.530> switch<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.220> again<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
your existing wiper switch but again the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.719 
your existing wiper switch but again the
bracket<00:01:42.000> does<00:01:42.180> come<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.780> cut<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.979> any<00:01:44.610> way

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
bracket does come with it cut it any way

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.840 
bracket does come with it cut it any way
you<00:01:44.759> want<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.479> know<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.600> leave<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.850> 5/16

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
you want you know just leave one 5/16

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.999 
you want you know just leave one 5/16
hole<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.509> already<00:01:48.720> pre<00:01:49.049> drill<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.380> 5/16

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
hole on it I already pre drill at 5/16

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.179 
hole on it I already pre drill at 5/16
for<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.829> here's<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
for you so that's that but here's the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.440 
for you so that's that but here's the
operation<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> key<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:56.450> this

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
operation I got the key on this

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.190 
operation I got the key on this
potentiometer<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.399> backwards<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.930> gives

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
potentiometer is backwards so it gives

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.530 
potentiometer is backwards so it gives
me<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.829> most<00:02:02.070> delay<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> first<00:02:03.149> turn<00:02:03.420> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
me the most delay when I first turn it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.410 
me the most delay when I first turn it
on<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:04.950> gonna<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:05.310> open<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> way

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
on so I'm gonna go open it all the way

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.660 
on so I'm gonna go open it all the way
up<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.899> give<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> least<00:02:07.380> delay<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.369> can't

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
up to give you the least delay you can't

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.730 
up to give you the least delay you can't
see<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.629> wipers<00:02:10.020> moving<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.530> but

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
see the the wipers moving right now but

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.020 
see the the wipers moving right now but
you<00:02:13.740> hear<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.730> know<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.210> hear<00:02:15.450> them<00:02:16.610> if<00:02:17.610> I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
you hear you know you can hear them if I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.170 
you hear you know you can hear them if I
wanted<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:20.810> get<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.230> wiper<00:02:23.060> modal<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
wanted to get out of the wiper modal a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.949 
wanted to get out of the wiper modal a
mode<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.990> simply<00:02:25.560> turn<00:02:25.770> on<00:02:26.420> my<00:02:27.420> wipers<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
mode I can simply turn on my wipers to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.890 
mode I can simply turn on my wipers to
low<00:02:28.110> speed<00:02:29.000> turn<00:02:30.000> my<00:02:30.150> wipers<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.630> high

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
low speed turn my wipers on the high

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.070 
low speed turn my wipers on the high
speed<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.700> delay<00:02:32.970> box<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.420> still<00:02:33.510> working<00:02:33.959> but

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
speed the delay box is still working but

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.449 
speed the delay box is still working but
again<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.440> has<00:02:34.590> no<00:02:34.800> effect

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
again it has no effect

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:45.920 
again it has no effect
I<00:02:41.209> can<00:02:42.209> go<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.360> fully<00:02:42.660> off<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.750> my

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
I can go to fully off so I have my

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.990 
I can go to fully off so I have my
existing<00:02:46.590> wipers<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.130> got<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> wash<00:02:47.640> feature

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
existing wipers I got the wash feature

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.650 
existing wipers I got the wash feature
as<00:02:48.239> well<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:49.530> again<00:02:49.620> there<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.660> delay

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
as well but again there it is delay

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.840 
as well but again there it is delay
anywhere<00:02:52.140> from<00:02:52.290> three<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.590> thirty<00:02:52.830> seconds<00:02:53.510> so

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
anywhere from three to thirty seconds so

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.949 
anywhere from three to thirty seconds so
well<00:02:56.850> maybe<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.209> little<00:02:57.360> less<00:02:57.540> than<00:02:57.750> three

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
well maybe a little less than three

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.350 
well maybe a little less than three
seconds<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.370> 30<00:02:59.580> seconds<00:03:00.090> I'll<00:03:00.180> good

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
seconds but up to 30 seconds I'll good

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.410 
seconds but up to 30 seconds I'll good
I'll<00:03:00.780> show<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.110> full<00:03:01.320> 30<00:03:01.560> seconds

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
I'll show you the full 30 seconds

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.300 
I'll show you the full 30 seconds
starting<00:03:03.420> now

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.130 

thirty<00:03:08.940> seconds<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:10.310> nothing<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.930> listen

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
thirty seconds of nothing but listen

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.530 
thirty seconds of nothing but listen
you'll<00:03:13.560> hear<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.860> wipers<00:03:14.220> go<00:03:14.400> over<00:03:14.730> probably

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
you'll hear the wipers go over probably

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.110 
you'll hear the wipers go over probably
another<00:03:15.840> 15<00:03:16.200> seconds<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.700> can<00:03:17.850> see<00:03:18.000> you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
another 15 seconds so you can see you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.690 
another 15 seconds so you can see you
get<00:03:18.240> a<00:03:18.270> lot<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:19.170> lot<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.070> delay<00:03:22.250> more<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.490> than

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
get a lot of a lot of delay more so than

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.900 
get a lot of a lot of delay more so than
any<00:03:23.850> manufactured<00:03:24.690> car<00:03:24.959> today<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.620> know<00:03:26.370> my<00:03:26.670> car

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
any manufactured car today I know my car

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.060 
any manufactured car today I know my car
is<00:03:27.030> only<00:03:27.180> six<00:03:27.570> seconds<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.230> on<00:03:28.440> its<00:03:28.650> most

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
is only six seconds and on its most

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:37.790 
is only six seconds and on its most
delay

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.850 

there<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.460> is<00:03:38.610> 30<00:03:39.480> seconds<00:03:39.960> shut<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.740> off

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
there it is 30 seconds shut it off

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.730 
there it is 30 seconds shut it off
completely<00:03:43.700> shut<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.790> key<00:03:44.910> off<00:03:45.020> so<00:03:46.020> here<00:03:46.650> it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
completely shut the key off so here it

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.910 
completely shut the key off so here it
is<00:03:46.890> as<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.820> take<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.150> apart<00:03:49.100> here's<00:03:50.100> my<00:03:50.280> ground

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
is as I take it apart here's my ground

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.470 
is as I take it apart here's my ground
and<00:03:52.920> again<00:03:53.040> very<00:03:54.020> rudimentary<00:03:55.020> ground<00:03:56.480> you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and again very rudimentary ground you

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.790 
and again very rudimentary ground you
could<00:03:57.660> put<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:57.960> ground<00:03:58.260> wire<00:03:58.470> obviously

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
could put this ground wire obviously

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.150 
could put this ground wire obviously
anywhere<00:03:59.490> you<00:03:59.610> want<00:03:59.820> I<00:04:00.470> just<00:04:01.470> grab<00:04:01.680> around

you the box box is pretty compact it

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.469 
you the box box is pretty compact it
doesn't<00:06:13.310> come<00:06:13.430> with<00:06:13.580> a<00:06:13.610> bracket<00:06:13.850> the<00:06:14.120> math<00:06:14.270> it

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
doesn't come with a bracket the math it

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.659 
doesn't come with a bracket the math it
anymore<00:06:14.660> it's<00:06:15.080> so<00:06:15.470> compact<00:06:15.949> you<00:06:16.190> can<00:06:16.340> simply

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
anymore it's so compact you can simply

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.500 
anymore it's so compact you can simply
use<00:06:17.169> some<00:06:18.169> high<00:06:18.919> quality<00:06:19.400> tape<00:06:19.639> to<00:06:19.910> bury<00:06:20.360> it

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
use some zip ties or something like that

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.840 
use some zip ties or something like that
tie<00:06:26.780> it<00:06:26.840> up<00:06:27.110> fast<00:06:27.470> and<00:06:27.680> it's<00:06:27.800> this<00:06:27.889> structure

or something underneath there again you

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.520 
or something underneath there again you
could<00:06:31.820> put<00:06:32.000> this<00:06:32.120> control<00:06:32.540> up<00:06:32.750> to<00:06:32.780> up<00:06:33.139> to<00:06:33.169> three

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
could put this control up to up to three

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.620 
could put this control up to up to three
feet<00:06:33.740> away<00:06:33.919> almost<00:06:34.340> three<00:06:34.820> feet<00:06:35.030> there's<00:06:35.389> this

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
feet away almost three feet there's this

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.620 
feet away almost three feet there's this
this<00:06:36.020> on<00:06:36.260> laws<00:06:36.470> but<00:06:36.770> I<00:06:37.610> start<00:06:38.300> with<00:06:38.600> a

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
this on laws but I start with a

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.700 
this on laws but I start with a
three-foot<00:06:39.139> piece<00:06:39.410> and<00:06:39.770> as<00:06:40.070> as<00:06:40.370> I<00:06:40.700> connect<00:06:41.150> and

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
three-foot piece and as as I connect and

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.690 
three-foot piece and as as I connect and
terminate<00:06:42.710> stuff<00:06:43.040> like<00:06:43.220> that<00:06:43.370> it<00:06:43.460> gets<00:06:43.639> a

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
terminate stuff like that it gets a

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.080 
terminate stuff like that it gets a
little<00:06:43.820> bit<00:06:44.000> shorter<00:06:44.030> so<00:06:45.610> there<00:06:46.610> you<00:06:46.850> have<00:06:46.880> it

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
little bit shorter so there you have it

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.180 
little bit shorter so there you have it
there's<00:06:47.870> your<00:06:48.080> wiper<00:06:48.290> delay<00:06:48.650> at<00:06:48.800> sixty<00:06:49.160> two

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
there's your wiper delay at sixty two
