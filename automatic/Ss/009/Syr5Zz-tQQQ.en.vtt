 I show you on pc files 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.179
 your ios device installs without itunes 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.880
 First of all what do you need for this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.770
 a program to access the most 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.439
 i can have two fan box for that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 I would probably like you still 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 a packer i have to winrar for 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 but it could also be 7 zip or something 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.439
 always like where do you find it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.120
 first the party goes by 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.460
 just click on the windows button here music 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 then on itunes itunes media mobile 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 applications and here you will find 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.120
 all the files he has on itunes 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.430
 downloaded this video here 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 is not just about ipa in general 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.079
 I have files for this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.440
 Yes subway servers achieved everything ipa 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.280
 file copied out and goes first and foremost 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.620
 then with the right mouse button 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.530
 on it our ipa files do the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.539
 Rename and make ipa 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.420
 eg file extension and that is what we want to change 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.549
 and the whole thing takes the icon 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 our cent packers is on my case 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.850
 here just winrar just went double 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.640
 on it by payload places and that means 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.430
 keynote at every apple and in here 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.610
 right now and here in now 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.680
 the name of the app we get this folder 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.479
 get us out of here and that 's about it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 already pretty much anything you need 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.970
 only in our program with us 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.860
 our ai weiweis can access 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.750
 join us Aldi, the all 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.880
 Here's how we go from here 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.369
 Our device does it all without 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.329
 unfold picture the little plus go 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:52.909
 here on file system you have now yes 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.100
 translated and then here on applications 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.860
 here we find all the apps in 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.149
 drive around this folder 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.509
 By the way , everything was not in there via 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.140
 apps rum and all apps from home 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.259
 installed and now we push 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.720
 This unpack dot folder everywhere 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.790
 funbox also in this one 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.830
 with purely copied the whole here is with 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.430
 Strange to me on a 170 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.470
 megabyte big but ok updated 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.530
 the whole and down here we see 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.320
 even that it's off usa cycle and we 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.290
 should now all the files 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.600
 Space travel in front of our app so who is 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.480
 now has a bit of experience 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.280
 with apps are installed yes and where 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.720
 makes and where is the documents now 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.270
 folder or the saved 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.330
 scores and in there are the whole thing 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.810
 is not here then go for it 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:53.450
 we go back to a spray file system 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:56.420
 here was mobile documents and here 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.459
 all documents are now in there 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.830
 of those apps installed above 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.770
 saved by subway server is the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.500
 now here player data 0 to 4 that is 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.610
 everything from subway servers it comes off 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.140
 Im immediately that in this only 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.360
 applications came that was here 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.519
 mobile documents so if we are there 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.350
 somehow you still have as spielstÃ¤nde the 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.650
 acts then could just delete you 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.269
 until I write something about it and then 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.450
 He could also order your from 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.860
 use saved games when it is 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.450
 possibly the same at startup 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.330
 it should fall again 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.280
 because the authority does not agree that 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.880
 there you have to be, for example, with zeal 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.980
 in the game file so the actual 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.989
 Part saved is then started 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.850
 I just put the file without ending 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.400
 that the file is started when 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.380
 He starts the game in which we need to 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.930
 to change the authority here it is 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.570
 not now because you have to open ssl 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.430
 we have installed on the device but we 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.790
 You can celebrate it all over the place 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.430
 make device and there you go then 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.459
 easy to detail then goes on the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.739
 blue button scrolls right beside it and 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.430
 down to the authority and then have to 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.810
 you with user he goes to it 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.640
 hooks in the first three do that 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.409
 I think I read and execute 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.120
 to edit 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:23.599
 Steg left it for he does not need 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.699
 have activated and then it should be quite 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.680
 by the way, after that , by the way 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.970
 it will still be copied completely 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.250
 not shown because you have yours 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.050
 details like jumping if I know what 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.710
 it's there that makes power easy 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.470
 and again 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.680
 or you go into mobile terminal gives 1 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.389
 su password is alpine and reboot is but 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.740
 also shit it does the same usa 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.030
 That's why new ones would not have to be back 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.030
 switch on manually
