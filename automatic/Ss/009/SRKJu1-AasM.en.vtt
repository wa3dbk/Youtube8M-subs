00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.340
 Hello guys 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.200
 it 's buner 's way again 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.440
 I take advantage of a subject that is 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.550
 controversy on the site is that it is the 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.680
 name 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 I did a little joke and using 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 my incredible editing docs 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.140
 video that takes who knows in 10 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.140
 I did not get the mothers 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.820
 But seriously, there are people out there who 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.180
 cola mean there are people who speak my I am 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.600
 of the team that sticks to my now shape 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.440
 Correct even sun leaving to be able to speak 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.390
 for people who is the creator of the site and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.880
 There are a lot of people asking the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.400
 Where did the inspiration come from? 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.630
 name 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.630
 following the words of his own 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.729
 feeling of the band kids a program of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.790
 band tv friends 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.730
 rui and it is an anime that had a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.510
 very soft female character who 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.930
 transformed into a spaceship 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:28.440
 bizarre even if it turns out 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.340
 she was screaming of her being of the union and 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.530
 turned blessed ship nothing special 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.860
 the show is cool, he solved it 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.190
 baptize the site with the name dna 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 there the site that we love so much 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.950
 hence the name of it appears zoeira 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.860
 But it's serious people, that's where it came from. 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.470
 the inspiration this time I do not have 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.600
 much to talk more about 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.729
 pronunciation of site name 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.790
 but I wanted to take this opportunity to thank 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.710
 an earl received many more questions 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 of what I expected for this contact 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.580
 but you need to organize yourself for 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.349
 answer everything right and see if the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.170
 From next week I can 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.670
 answer the first ones there that are 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.959
 cool questions 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.010
 but do not get discouraged is one of the questions 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.930
 people through our official channels 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.750
 be there by the main page of the site 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.659
 right here on youtube and leaving your 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.200
 I asked down there for people. 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:36.689
 I think it's just a hug and even the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.299
 next and stay there with a few more 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.299
