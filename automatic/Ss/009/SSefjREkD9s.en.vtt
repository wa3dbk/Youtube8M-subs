as<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.009> goes<00:01:56.159> round<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.030> drag<00:01:57.390> slows<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
as it goes round and that drag slows it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
as it goes round and that drag slows it
down<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.350> sooner<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:58.710> later<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.159> come

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
down and sooner or later it will come

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.709 
down and sooner or later it will come
back<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.700> earth<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.119> will<00:02:00.210> burn<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
back to earth and it will burn up in the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.270 
back to earth and it will burn up in the
Earth's<00:02:00.810> atmosphere<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.560> most<00:02:01.740> cases<00:02:01.950> that's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
Earth's atmosphere in most cases that's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.880 
Earth's atmosphere in most cases that's
really<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.909> unusual<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.200> why<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.469> we

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
really not that unusual so so why do we

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.020 
really not that unusual so so why do we
not<00:02:04.979> know<00:02:05.130> how<00:02:05.280> much<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.790> going<00:02:05.909> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
not know how much of this is going to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.850 
not know how much of this is going to
burn<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.329> some<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> satellite<00:02:07.560> rather

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
burn up some of the satellite rather

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.169 
burn up some of the satellite rather
than<00:02:07.920> being<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.250> made<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.550> materials<00:02:09.000> which

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
than being of made of materials which

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.820 
than being of made of materials which
will<00:02:09.420> burn<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.840> which<00:02:10.020> will<00:02:10.200> disintegrate<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
will burn up which will disintegrate a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.910 
will burn up which will disintegrate a
relatively<00:02:11.370> low<00:02:11.520> temp

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
relatively low temp

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.740 
relatively low temp
is<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.160> lot<00:02:12.280> tougher<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.940> fuel<00:02:13.240> tanks<00:02:13.599> for

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
is a lot tougher the fuel tanks for

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.210 
is a lot tougher the fuel tanks for
example<00:02:14.200> these<00:02:14.319> are<00:02:14.470> things<00:02:14.620> made<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.920> steel

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
example these are things made of steel

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.160 
example these are things made of steel
and<00:02:15.280> titanium<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.270> they'll<00:02:16.630> survive<00:02:16.959> the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
and titanium and they'll survive the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.449 
and titanium and they'll survive the
passage<00:02:17.500> through<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.739> atmosphere<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.250> so

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
passage through the atmosphere and so

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.920 
passage through the atmosphere and so
you'll<00:02:18.640> get<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.970> fair<00:02:19.180> number<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.480> smaller

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
you'll get a fair number of smaller

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.660 
you'll get a fair number of smaller
chunks<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:21.040> make<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.340> all<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.489> way<00:02:21.580> down

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
chunks that do make it all the way down

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.670 
chunks that do make it all the way down
to<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:22.030> earth<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.720> any<00:02:22.989> more<00:02:23.050> likely<00:02:23.650> or

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680 
to the earth is this any more likely or
less<00:02:23.770> likely<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.250> cause<00:02:24.430> damage<00:02:24.640> than<00:02:25.090> the

because<00:02:32.350> it's<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.590> bit<00:02:32.709> bigger<00:02:32.950> because<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
because it's a bit bigger because the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.160 
because it's a bit bigger because the
pieces<00:02:33.760> are<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.910> bit<00:02:34.060> bigger<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.690> numbers

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
pieces are a bit bigger but the numbers

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.960 
pieces are a bit bigger but the numbers
are<00:02:35.200> still<00:02:35.440> very<00:02:35.800> very<00:02:35.920> comforting<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.819> mean

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
are still very very comforting I mean

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.640 
are still very very comforting I mean
you<00:02:37.209> know<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.569> don't<00:02:37.959> want<00:02:38.140> anything<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.560> happen

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
you know I don't want anything to happen

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.259 
you know I don't want anything to happen
to<00:02:38.830> anybody<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> result<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:39.910> but

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
to anybody as a result of this but

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.570 
to anybody as a result of this but
you're<00:02:40.660> looking<00:02:40.750> at<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.050> 1<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.380> 3,000<00:02:42.099> chance<00:02:42.310> of

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
you're looking at a 1 in 3,000 chance of

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.490 
you're looking at a 1 in 3,000 chance of
somebody<00:02:42.910> somewhere<00:02:43.780> on<00:02:43.900> earth<00:02:43.930> having<00:02:44.440> a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
somebody somewhere on earth having a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.320 
somebody somewhere on earth having a
problem<00:02:44.709> how<00:02:45.459> do<00:02:45.519> they<00:02:45.640> work<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.970> out<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
problem how do they work that out it

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.180 
problem how do they work that out it
seems<00:02:46.480> like<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.690> ludicrous<00:02:47.140> statistic<00:02:47.620> look<00:02:48.100> at

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
seems like a ludicrous statistic look at

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.559 
seems like a ludicrous statistic look at
the<00:02:48.280> size<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.640> satellite<00:02:49.030> look<00:02:49.300> at<00:02:49.390> how

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
the size of the satellite look at how

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.150 
the size of the satellite look at how
it'll<00:02:49.750> break<00:02:49.930> up<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.410> know<00:02:50.530> look<00:02:50.709> at<00:02:50.799> how<00:02:50.920> big

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
it'll break up you know look at how big

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.710 
it'll break up you know look at how big

you come up with that number and if you

look at it for you or I the odds of you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.280 
look at it for you or I the odds of you

about one in 20 trillion so you're much

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.910 
about one in 20 trillion so you're much
more<00:03:04.480> likely<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.810> win<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.110> lottery<00:03:05.290> or<00:03:05.560> much

is<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.090> it's<00:03:13.360> got<00:03:13.420> sharp<00:03:13.810> edges<00:03:14.140> there's<00:03:14.380> no

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
is that it's got sharp edges there's no

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.170 
is that it's got sharp edges there's no
suggestion<00:03:14.860> it's<00:03:15.489> really<00:03:15.790> really<00:03:16.000> dangerous

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
suggestion it's really really dangerous

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.699 
suggestion it's really really dangerous
or<00:03:16.630> anything<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:17.019> just<00:03:17.049> look<00:03:17.320> it<00:03:17.410> might<00:03:17.560> be<00:03:17.680> a

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
or anything it's just look it might be a

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.259 
or anything it's just look it might be a
bit<00:03:17.890> sharper<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.640> is<00:03:18.730> actually<00:03:18.910> still

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
bit sharper and it is actually still

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.370 
bit sharper and it is actually still
technically<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.840> property<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.260> US

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
technically the property of the US

technically the property of the US
government<00:03:20.530> just<00:03:21.100> finally<00:03:21.579> let<00:03:22.359> me<00:03:22.450> also<00:03:22.570> ask

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
government just finally let me also ask
