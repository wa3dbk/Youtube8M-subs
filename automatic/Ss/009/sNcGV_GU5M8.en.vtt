00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
technique that I wish everybody knew

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.810 
technique that I wish everybody knew
because<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> great<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.430> really

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
because this is a great one that really

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.600 
because this is a great one that really
only<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.180> few<00:02:03.390> people<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.200> basically<00:02:04.649> so

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
only a few people know it's basically so

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.160 
only a few people know it's basically so
say<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.000> round<00:02:06.270> two<00:02:06.540> would<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
say it round two would you do is you

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.740 
say it round two would you do is you
take<00:02:07.200> an<00:02:07.409> m14<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.369> shoot<00:02:08.640> them<00:02:08.759> once<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
take an m14 you shoot them once you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.660 
take an m14 you shoot them once you
menya<00:02:09.989> knife<00:02:10.319> hung<00:02:10.619> round<00:02:10.920> three<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.430> shoot

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
menya knife hung round three you shoot

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.930 
menya knife hung round three you shoot
them<00:02:11.760> twice<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.420> unite<00:02:12.660> for

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
them twice and unite for

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.730 
them twice and unite for
around<00:02:13.120> four<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.630> shoot<00:02:13.840> him<00:02:13.870> three<00:02:14.230> times<00:02:14.470> in

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
around four you shoot him three times in

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.310 
around four you shoot him three times in
knife<00:02:14.980> them<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:16.180> basically<00:02:16.390> this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
knife them and then basically this

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.260 
knife them and then basically this
allows<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.950> night<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.220> zombies<00:02:18.850> at<00:02:19.030> any

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
round although in the later rounds of

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.650 
round although in the later rounds of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
especially when you don't have

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.360 
especially when you don't have
juggernaut<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.230> they're<00:02:23.530> all<00:02:23.680> coming<00:02:23.950> at<00:02:24.130> you

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.970 
juggernaut and they're all coming at you
it<00:02:24.820> can<00:02:25.000> become<00:02:25.120> especially<00:02:25.510> hard<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> found

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
it can become especially hard so I found

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.350 
it can become especially hard so I found
that<00:02:27.100> especially<00:02:27.640> at<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.790> time<00:02:27.820> like<00:02:28.060> around

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
that especially at a time like around

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.070 
that especially at a time like around
five<00:02:28.750> I'd<00:02:29.410> might<00:02:29.890> as<00:02:30.040> well<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.490> go<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.090> kind

talking about but I hardly ever take the
Landers<00:03:31.840> when<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.050> play<00:03:32.260> attention<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:32.980> only

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
Landers when I play attention I only

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.729 
Landers when I play attention I only
take<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.820> pack<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.030> punch<00:03:34.420> it's<00:03:35.110> not<00:03:35.410> really

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
take it to pack a punch it's not really

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.070 
take it to pack a punch it's not really
something<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.220> finding<00:03:36.880> useful<00:03:37.030> but<00:03:37.570> I<00:03:37.780> never

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
something I finding useful but I never

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.199 
something I finding useful but I never
noticed<00:03:38.380> how<00:03:38.620> cool<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.130> views<00:03:39.489> are<00:03:39.700> from<00:03:40.090> the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.840 
noticed how cool the views are from the
Landers<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.840> mean<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:41.290> normally<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:42.100> take<00:03:42.610> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850

attention<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.430> scenery<00:03:45.730> but<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:46.780> just

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
attention to the scenery but it's just

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.380 
attention to the scenery but it's just
for<00:03:46.989> some<00:03:47.380> reason<00:03:47.410> during<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.280> game<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.850> was

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
enough to get myself a sickle and then

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.750 
enough to get myself a sickle and then
maybe<00:04:10.810> I'd<00:04:11.560> be<00:04:11.800> able<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.040> do<00:04:12.160> a<00:04:12.190> last-minute

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
round is 2500 points which is kind of

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.550 
round is 2500 points which is kind of
crazy<00:04:31.430> but<00:04:32.330> so<00:04:32.690> as<00:04:32.900> you'll<00:04:33.080> see<00:04:33.230> now<00:04:33.410> I'm

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
crazy but so as you'll see now I'm

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.860 
crazy but so as you'll see now I'm
landing<00:04:33.950> this<00:04:33.980> final<00:04:34.580> lander<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.540> believe

right now I pick myself up some
important<00:04:38.300> ammo<00:04:38.540> because<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:39.170> don't<00:04:39.320> think<00:04:39.380> I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
important ammo because I don't think I

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.080 
important ammo because I don't think I
