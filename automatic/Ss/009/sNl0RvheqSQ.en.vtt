00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:20.359 

I<00:00:18.380> think<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.470> define<00:00:19.770> us<00:00:19.890> out<00:00:20.010> mania

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
I think we define us out mania

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.390 
I think we define us out mania
sculptures<00:00:21.020> what<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.710> don't<00:00:22.830> see<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.190> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
sculptures what we do we don't see is to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.760 
sculptures what we do we don't see is to
toy

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
toy

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:32.380 
toy
plus<00:00:25.400> it's<00:00:25.670> a<00:00:25.820> sculpture

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.860 

i'm<00:00:32.780> mark<00:00:33.020> times<00:00:33.500> when<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.280> are<00:00:34.430> course

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
i'm mark times when and we are course

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.450 
i'm mark times when and we are course
the<00:00:35.870> reason<00:00:36.050> why<00:00:36.440> one<00:00:36.680> I<00:00:36.710> rather<00:00:36.890> started<00:00:37.340> the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
the reason why one I rather started the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.030 
the reason why one I rather started the
project<00:00:37.640> with<00:00:38.149> us<00:00:38.329> was<00:00:39.170> because<00:00:39.770> they<00:00:39.890> wanted

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
project with us was because they wanted

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.890 
project with us was because they wanted
to<00:00:40.220> have<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.370> completely<00:00:40.820> new<00:00:41.000> take<00:00:41.300> on<00:00:41.480> the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
to have a completely new take on the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:50.090 
to have a completely new take on the
collectors<00:00:42.559> figure

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.270 

for<00:00:50.550> me<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:50.760> fun<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.690> design<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.500> Scorpion's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
for me it was fun to design a Scorpion's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.060 
for me it was fun to design a Scorpion's
appearance<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.239> had<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> chance<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
appearance because I had a chance to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.819 
appearance because I had a chance to
give<00:00:56.760> some<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:57.539> unique<00:00:57.719> ideas<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
give some really unique ideas to the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.090 
give some really unique ideas to the
figure<00:00:59.159> and<00:01:00.079> coming<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.859> concept

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
figure and coming up with the concept

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.090 
figure and coming up with the concept
for<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> character<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:04.350> always<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
for a character that was always one of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.789 
for a character that was always one of
my<00:01:05.220> favorite<00:01:05.640> ones<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.659> spent<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.350> huge<00:01:07.590> amount

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
my favorite ones we spent a huge amount

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.029 
my favorite ones we spent a huge amount
of<00:01:08.159> time<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.759> sketching<00:01:09.509> just<00:01:09.930> trying<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.560> get

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
of time on sketching just trying to get

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.460 
of time on sketching just trying to get
to<00:01:11.280> look<00:01:11.490> right<00:01:11.759> but<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.020> sculpting

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
to look right but then the sculpting

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050 
to look right but then the sculpting
process<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> actual<00:01:14.430> process<00:01:14.759> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
process is the actual process of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.779 
process is the actual process of
creation<00:01:15.450> our<00:01:15.990> approach<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.369> we

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
creation our approach is more that we

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.190 
creation our approach is more that we
start<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> three-dimensional<00:01:19.170> object

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
start with a three-dimensional object

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
start with a three-dimensional object
when<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:20.190> with<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.399> three-dimensional

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
when you think with a three-dimensional

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.990 
when you think with a three-dimensional
of<00:01:21.270> interest<00:01:22.100> we<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.399> pay<00:01:23.550> attention<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
of interest we really pay attention to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.930 
of interest we really pay attention to
every<00:01:24.300> line<00:01:24.509> every<00:01:24.590> detail<00:01:25.590> every<00:01:25.619> shape<00:01:26.190> so

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
every line every detail every shape so

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.460 
every line every detail every shape so
it's<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.240> about<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.659> sculpture<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.259> think

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it's really about the sculpture I think

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.830 
it's really about the sculpture I think
that's<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.069> most<00:01:29.310> important<00:01:29.819> part<00:01:29.850> being

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that's the most important part being

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
that's the most important part being
part<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.440> collectors<00:01:31.830> edition<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.580> great

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
part of the collectors edition is great

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.790 
part of the collectors edition is great
because<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:34.050> can<00:01:34.259> bring<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.619> same

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
because be we can bring the same

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.889 
because be we can bring the same
experience<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> show<00:01:35.909> our<00:01:36.090> work<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.569> a<00:01:36.600> much

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
experience and show our work to a much

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:49.270 
experience and show our work to a much
larger<00:01:37.229> audience

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.120 

I<00:01:49.340> think<00:01:49.850> all<00:01:50.390> our<00:01:50.780> decisions<00:01:51.080> in<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.799> lining

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
I think all our decisions in the lining

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.899 
I think all our decisions in the lining
scorpion<00:01:53.119> reflect<00:01:53.900> our<00:01:54.140> way<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.909> translate

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
scorpion reflect our way to translate

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.710 
scorpion reflect our way to translate
this<00:01:56.659> broken<00:01:57.350> character<00:01:57.909> into<00:01:58.909> shapes<00:01:59.270> and

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
this broken character into shapes and

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.260 
this broken character into shapes and
forms<00:01:59.979> we<00:02:00.979> have<00:02:01.130> them<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.369> around<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:01.940> our

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
forms we have them that around that our

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.539 
forms we have them that around that our
spin<00:02:02.690> on<00:02:02.930> scorpion<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.830> going<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.130> find<00:02:04.310> its

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
spin on scorpion is going to find its

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.430 
spin on scorpion is going to find its
