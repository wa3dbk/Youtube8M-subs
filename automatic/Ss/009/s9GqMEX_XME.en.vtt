00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.130
 nature friends today it's about the topic 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.680
 chocolate leaking 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.210
 if you have a leaky turbo 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.420
 of course then have to agree 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.130
 distinguish between a loss of oil 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.050
 and escape from exhaust here in 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.210
 this case, I have set before you today a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.609
 Turbocharger with brought on the gases 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.310
 escape 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.550
 we now simply drive to a closer 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.250
 the exhaust gases escape at the deflection 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.079
 the unpressurized and if you are on the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.550
 other side look on the tight 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.750
 Plan you can see that below 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.399
 Everything is beautiful, all colors are recognizable 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.140
 that everything is clean ever since 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.780
 We are exactly correct after an accident 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.260
 opposite the diversion is everything 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.920
 black and sooty as the escape 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 whole exhaust fumes at this deflection and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.710
 mess up the whole turbocharger the question 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.989
 I always ask myself why why 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.439
 now escape the exhaust gases to this 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.780
 put a real problem now with one 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.640
 fixed a new turbocharger or would I have 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.610
 the problem a short time later again 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.390
 I have now removed the exhaust gas 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.280
 and we see an increased on the vtg 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.330
 training we see on the inside 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.100
 the hull group has increased soot formation 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.460
 that can not and should not really be 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.000
 because this heat shield is the perfect one 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.520
 in tactical and has no defects 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.020
 it is responsible that the exhaust gases just 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 Do not foreground on the top 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.259
 the inside and the rough get 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.930
 ill therefore also no exhaust fumes at the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.450
 deflection may escape 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.509
 as I said the heat shield me 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.759
 completely intact the customer lead that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.280
 the exhaust gases are still through the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.670
 heat shield escape 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.119
 and also escape through the diversion 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.580
 can 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.560
 I am an authority backwater of the exhaust system 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.009
 Diagnosis come here purely after 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.370
 below 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.160
 in this direction to the exhaust system 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.720
 but if it does not drain away 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.150
 in the correct speed of 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.520
 can drain away 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.530
 there is an increased raw material and 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.709
 the exhaust just do another 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:33.650
 away through this heat shield on the vde 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.709
 and on the inside of the hull group 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.280
 and then escape over it 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.600
 deflection papers diesel particulate filter 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.910
 dare from the other 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.819
 the diesel particulate filter is a 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.180
 I'll clogged the top now 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.709
 From flexed then we can do this 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.840
 constipation just look like 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.319
 said this diesel particle filter me 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.069
 from another dare 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:05.150
 we are seeing the heavy pollution here 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.700
 on the diesel particle filter that's me 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.049
 so clogged there of course 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.730
 hardly exhale through this 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.430
 Blockages are after a turbocharger 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.410
 caused damage 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:24.230
 we see extreme encrustations here 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.500
 Of course, they can barely exhaust themselves 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.560
 and of course that will be over the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.350
 then escape because of the turbocharger 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.769
 backlog of these let particulate filter 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:41.150
 I'm not that strong 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.980
 can flow through the problems their 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.880
 turbocharger you have with us at the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.570
 right address 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.209
 If you want us we will test the turbocharger 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.010
 tell him true homer messy thing to 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.160
 the turbocharger chaotic and above all 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.470
 what you need to do on the vehicle 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.590
 should return before the turbo year 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.590
 on
