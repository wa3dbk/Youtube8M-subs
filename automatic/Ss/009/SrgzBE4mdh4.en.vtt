beanbags<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.529> variation<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.460> up

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
beanbags it's a variation of the one up

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.720 
beanbags it's a variation of the one up
two<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:20.970> combination<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.470> our<00:00:22.830> next<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.670> each

other<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.869> separate<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:26.220> would<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.670> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
other one is separate this would be a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.150 
other one is separate this would be a
3-ball<00:00:27.599> split<00:00:28.019> leading<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> right

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
3-ball split leading with the right

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.030 
3-ball split leading with the right
this<00:00:29.910> would<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.539> 3-ball<00:00:31.260> split<00:00:31.619> leading

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this would be a 3-ball split leading

this would be a 3-ball split leading
with<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> left<00:00:34.880> now<00:00:35.880> we're<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
with the left now we're going to do the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.150 
with the left now we're going to do the
same<00:00:37.020> thing<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.380> knives<00:00:37.590> now<00:00:37.860> how<00:00:37.980> does<00:00:38.040> one

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
same thing with knives now how does one

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
same thing with knives now how does one
get<00:00:38.430> started<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.239> ask<00:00:39.649> there's<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
get started on this you ask there's a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.040 
get started on this you ask there's a
slight<00:00:41.040> lag<00:00:41.309> time<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> pattern<00:00:42.270> because

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
slight lag time in the pattern because

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110 
slight lag time in the pattern because
your<00:00:43.230> left<00:00:43.469> hand<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.070> only<00:00:44.280> juggling<00:00:44.879> one

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
your left hand is only juggling one

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.139 
your left hand is only juggling one
that's<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.430> hand<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.090> doing

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that's going up the right hand is doing

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.529 
that's going up the right hand is doing
too<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.649> start<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> cascade<00:00:51.000> then

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
too so you start with a cascade then

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
too so you start with a cascade then
there's<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.809> lag<00:00:51.989> time<00:00:52.460> your<00:00:53.460> left<00:00:53.670> hand<00:00:54.000> holds

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
there's a lag time your left hand holds

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.049 
there's a lag time your left hand holds
the<00:00:55.230> object<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.890> beat<00:00:56.070> while<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> first

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the object for beat while the first

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.020 
the object for beat while the first
throw<00:00:57.360> goes<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.770> nearly<00:00:59.129> joins<00:00:59.520> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
throw goes and then it nearly joins the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
throw goes and then it nearly joins the
right<00:01:00.239> hand<00:01:00.480> throw<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> outside<00:01:01.920> throw

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
right hand throw for the outside throw

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.329 
right hand throw for the outside throw
or<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.969> inside<00:01:03.300> ball<00:01:03.860> we're<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
or the inside ball we're going to do the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.850 
or the inside ball we're going to do the
same<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:05.939> knives<00:01:06.680> we're<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
same thing with knives we're going to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.260 
same thing with knives we're going to
start<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> cascade<00:01:09.680> hold<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> left<00:01:11.270> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
start with a cascade hold the left and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
start with a cascade hold the left and
there<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.799> was<00:01:14.150> right<00:01:15.150> hand<00:01:15.770> three

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
there you have that was right hand three

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
there you have that was right hand three
nice<00:01:16.920> split<00:01:18.140> one<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.200> time<00:01:20.420> starting<00:01:21.420> with

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
nice split one more time starting with

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.440 
nice split one more time starting with
the<00:01:21.540> Cascade<00:01:22.080> hold<00:01:23.000> three<00:01:24.000> nice<00:01:24.180> splits<00:01:26.450> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the Cascade hold three nice splits and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.940 
the Cascade hold three nice splits and
now<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.130> now<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.430> dropped<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.110> now<00:01:31.350> we'll<00:01:31.829> do

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
now and now it dropped and now we'll do

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.780 
now and now it dropped and now we'll do
it<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> left<00:01:32.340> hand<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.869> again<00:01:37.610> one<00:01:38.610> more
