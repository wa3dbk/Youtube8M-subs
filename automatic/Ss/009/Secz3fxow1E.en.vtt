00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello youtube friends today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.560
 I'm going to teach how to format 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.620
 any device from the windows and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:18.839
 since ms 2 good let's start with the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:23.249
 logo and we continue good once being 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:25.099
 here in team I have a usb is the 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.989
 that I am going to form have in this case 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.490
 For this reason, good is very easy. 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.440
 is 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.090
 to format from the windows it is 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.730
 very easy without any problem there is only 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.140
 that give right button format in this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.210
 part right button informs earth 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.700
 well I'm going to click on format 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.129
 and we will see a small window that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.670
 says formatting removable disk here is 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.540
 the capacity the type of system can 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.969
 be it for 32 for usb for disk 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.969
 it is the nt fs 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.640
 when the volume label is the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.220
 name we want to give to 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.580
 device is in this part I'm going to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.580
 put 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.030
 system 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.600
 ok it does not leave me more expensive then I'm going to 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.400
 put angel and thesis a format 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.400
 fast when 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.730
 they are important files, well , good 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.000
 we need them to be deleted 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.150
 correct without any problem you have to 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.340
 preferably you have to format them in 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.620
 format that is not fast format will 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 We removed this and well, well, do not say 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.659
 nothing you just have to remove it 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.850
 this because as there are programs where 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.189
 when after formatting you can 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.009
 extract information then what 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.390
 we want to avoid in a certain part it is therefore 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.969
 is that you can not recover 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.060
 information for this house of formatting 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.479
 fast or format it fast and what 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.479
 we start 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.380
 although already after starting it then 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.760
 good start to start loading this 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.790
 bar 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.220
 and he's going to tell us that the format has been 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.110
 completed a formatting has been completed 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.900
 you have to only accept them 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.960
 this part so good this from windows 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.230
 now you have to do it from ms 2 to 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.820
 we are going to look for the beginning all the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.440
 programs to run or with the button 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.100
 start 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.100
 and the e 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.920
 the beginning and the r 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.180
 on your keyboard it comes like in this case I 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.930
 I have 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.640
 is a computer with windows defines the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.980
 start key a little flag and 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.030
 we press tight to that key 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.879
 start and then the letter r is going to 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.910
 appear a little window that says execute 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:05.560
 and we are going to put cmd 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.090
 to put you to accept this is the ms 2 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.770
 Well then let's take these routes 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.010
 let's put sm cmd 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.860
 what tells us here cmd cmd 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.920
 all the way down on the bottom 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.900
 comment I will leave a page 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.870
 where will you say code in the part of 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.099
 below and they will be able to see this code then 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.750
 as he was doing step by step 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.120
 here we are going to put 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.790
 when we just checked which letters 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.989
 which is assigned to our memory 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.880
 mine is h We check that is assigned to 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.930
 the letter h 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:52.080
 and we're going to ms 2 and we're going to put h 2 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.080
 points we are going to put you in shape 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.080
 normal 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.020
 h 2 points 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.210
 this form of h colon will appear 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.660
 and then he says to insert the disk and 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.030
 press enter is already inserted let's 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.860
 press enter says they're open 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.840
 the memory is operating in 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.420
 the system and well, you have to 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.530
 disassemble it for it we are going to put the 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.680
 s yes if we want to be removed and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.270
 is going to start doing a format 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.520
 the deletion of all files 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.010
 good you have to do backup in your case 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.160
 Well, if they already did and want to start 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.650
 with a clean memory this removes viruses 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.140
 so then good is very valuable in 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.390
 this part processes a full format 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.360
 here there is no fast or slow formatting 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.420
 if it is not a full format 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.760
 directly on the usb so good this 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.160
 type of format is very is more 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.460
 recommended, well, you have to wait 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.480
 only already ending because it tells us 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.430
 which it has been completed successfully 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.320
 and well, let's pause the video 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.590
 for thermal include it in a ccoo way 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.170
 good friends good continuing with the 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.930
 video after passing it because then 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:16.630
 good is a little late 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:18.970
 good already passed 99 percent and as 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.060
 well tell us write a label 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.070
 11 character volume 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.710
 a moment ago at the beginning of the video 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.280
 we saw that we put a name in this 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.280
 case i 'm going 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.779
 a while ago we put him angelito system 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.629
 right now I'm going to put place then 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:40.369
 Well, it's the name of the label 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:43.759
 now if we check the name has 

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:45.319
 to say place and not angel there are your 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.860
 good was the name of the label that 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.860
 we assign him 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.770
 the name of the label is now called 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.370
 place and well then this is how 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:59.520
 land in these two ways from ms 2 or 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.860
 from windows to the moment after good 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.960
 with right button if you liked the video 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.110
 if a little hand helped them up 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.450
 forget to subscribe 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.710
 and I leave you in the comments the code 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.710
 what do I use until then
