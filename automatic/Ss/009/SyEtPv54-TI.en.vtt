can get for them

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.279 
can get for them
when<00:00:56.760> dr.<00:00:57.030> Earhart<00:00:57.299> told<00:00:57.539> us<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.899> he'd<00:00:58.139> have

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
when dr. Earhart told us that he'd have

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.660 
when dr. Earhart told us that he'd have
to<00:00:58.319> have<00:00:58.499> surgery<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.190> told<00:00:59.460> me<00:00:59.519> it<00:00:59.579> was

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
to have surgery and told me it was

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910 
to have surgery and told me it was
robotic<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.659> excited<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.620> knew

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
robotic I was excited because I knew

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.529 
robotic I was excited because I knew
about<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.459> I<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:02.699> aware<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.269> was<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
about it and I was aware that it was a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.990 
about it and I was aware that it was a
faster<00:01:04.080> recovery<00:01:04.199> time<00:01:04.769> less<00:01:05.519> time<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.880> this

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
faster recovery time less time in this

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.080 
faster recovery time less time in this
surgery<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.009> less<00:01:08.219> invasive<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:08.969> he

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
surgery and it was less invasive so he

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
surgery and it was less invasive so he
wouldn't<00:01:09.329> be<00:01:09.390> cut<00:01:09.659> open<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.950> being

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
wouldn't be cut open and all that being

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.490 
wouldn't be cut open and all that being
so<00:01:11.399> little<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.630> less<00:01:13.020> nervous<00:01:13.380> about

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
so little so I was less nervous about

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.940 
so little so I was less nervous about
the<00:01:13.680> surgery<00:01:13.829> just<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.680> this<00:01:16.680> da

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the surgery just because of that this da

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
organs in order to precisely get down to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.570 
organs in order to precisely get down to
the<00:02:09.789> point<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.660> needs<00:02:10.899> repair<00:02:11.739> when<00:02:12.459> you're

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
the point that needs repair when you're

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.580

talk a little bit about the surgery
today<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.550> fact<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.790> we're<00:02:21.970> going<00:02:22.060> to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
today and the fact that we're going to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.160 
today and the fact that we're going to
be<00:02:22.209> going<00:02:22.330> through<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.630> bellybutton<00:02:22.870> and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
be going through the bellybutton and

be going through the bellybutton and
those<00:02:23.319> small<00:02:23.440> incisions<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.640> also<00:02:24.940> how<00:02:25.030> for

those small incisions and also how for

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.449 
those small incisions and also how for
this<00:02:25.330> type<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.540> surgery<00:02:25.840> we<00:02:26.200> use<00:02:26.440> we<00:02:26.950> use<00:02:26.980> a

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
this type of surgery we use we use a

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.820 
this type of surgery we use we use a
robot<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.180> help<00:02:28.209> me<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.500> big<00:02:29.620> factors

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
robot to help me one of the big factors

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.800 
robot to help me one of the big factors
and<00:02:30.250> benefit<00:02:30.580> having<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.000> robotic<00:02:31.390> surgery

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
and benefit having the robotic surgery

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.479 
and benefit having the robotic surgery
is<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.020> there<00:02:32.440> would<00:02:32.560> be<00:02:32.590> minimal<00:02:32.950> scarring

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
is that there would be minimal scarring

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.460 
is that there would be minimal scarring
since<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.239> less<00:02:34.420> invasive<00:02:34.600> he'd<00:02:35.230> have

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
since it's less invasive he'd have

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.470 
since it's less invasive he'd have
believed<00:02:36.160> like<00:02:36.220> four<00:02:36.519> little<00:02:36.640> scars<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.330> one

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
believed like four little scars and one

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.820 
believed like four little scars and one
would<00:02:37.630> be<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.019> belly<00:02:38.140> button<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.709> you'd

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
would be in the belly button so you'd

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.860 
would be in the belly button so you'd
never<00:02:38.950> see<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.250> one<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.750> thankfully<00:02:40.750> he's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
never see that one and thankfully he's

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.050 
never see that one and thankfully he's
so<00:02:41.050> young<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.709> his<00:02:41.830> skin<00:02:42.160> has<00:02:42.400> time<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.730> heal

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
so young that his skin has time to heal

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.790 
so young that his skin has time to heal
and<00:02:43.510> he'll<00:02:43.630> grow<00:02:43.810> up<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.080> they'll<00:02:44.680> disappear

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
and he'll grow up and they'll disappear

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.410 
and he'll grow up and they'll disappear
it'll<00:02:45.280> be<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.580> never<00:02:45.790> happened<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.330> was

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
it'll be like it never happened it was

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.479 
it'll be like it never happened it was
never<00:02:46.569> there<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.290> he<00:02:47.380> won't<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.709> huge<00:02:48.069> scar

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
never there so he won't have a huge scar

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.400 
never there so he won't have a huge scar
for<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.850> rest<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.120> his<00:02:49.269> life<00:02:49.420> we're<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.350> the

get through a trying situation so the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.770 
get through a trying situation so the
first<00:03:39.190> thing<00:03:39.340> we<00:03:39.430> do<00:03:39.580> is<00:03:39.730> make<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.510> small

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
first thing we do is make a small

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.920 
first thing we do is make a small
incision<00:03:41.099> down<00:03:42.099> near<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.340> belly<00:03:42.580> button<00:03:42.930> then

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
incision down near the belly button then

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.190 
incision down near the belly button then
we<00:03:44.049> put<00:03:44.230> our<00:03:44.400> access<00:03:45.400> ports<00:03:45.760> in<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.150> then<00:03:46.989> what

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
we put our access ports in and then what

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.069 
we put our access ports in and then what
we're<00:03:47.319> going<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.470> do<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.940> get<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.090> robot<00:03:49.390> on

we're going to do is get the robot on

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.400 
we're going to do is get the robot on
over<00:03:51.329> put<00:03:52.329> it<00:03:52.420> up<00:03:52.510> against<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.870> patient<00:03:53.260> and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
over put it up against the patient and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.199 
over put it up against the patient and
then<00:03:53.799> sit<00:03:54.040> down<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.370> console<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:54.879> start<00:03:55.090> our

working and the kidney is located right
behind<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.510> intestine<00:04:02.849> in<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:04.390> area<00:04:04.690> where

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
behind the intestine in the area where

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.059 
behind the intestine in the area where
we<00:04:05.019> need<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.260> work<00:04:05.410> is<00:04:05.590> going<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.769> be<00:04:05.829> right

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
we need to work is going to be right

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.319 
we need to work is going to be right
here<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.549> we<00:04:06.640> can<00:04:06.760> go<00:04:06.879> through<00:04:07.090> that<00:04:07.180> we<00:04:07.299> can

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
here so we can go through that we can

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.610 
here so we can go through that we can
make<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.540> little<00:04:07.690> window<00:04:08.049> right<00:04:08.260> here<00:04:08.290> without

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
make a little window right here without

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.229 
make a little window right here without
having<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.160> move<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.340> intestines<00:04:10.000> on<00:04:10.150> the

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
having to move the intestines on the

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.300 
having to move the intestines on the
other<00:04:10.359> side<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.569> the<00:04:10.750> kidney<00:04:11.049> these<00:04:11.980> little

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
other side of the kidney these little

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.250 
other side of the kidney these little
pumping<00:04:13.269> things<00:04:13.510> here<00:04:13.780> are<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.049> blood

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
pumping things here are the blood

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.009 
pumping things here are the blood
vessels<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.650> carry<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:16.359> oxygen<00:04:16.840> and

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
vessels that carry the oxygen and

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.509 
vessels that carry the oxygen and
nutrients<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.680> intestines<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:18.310> we<00:04:18.430> have

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
nutrients to the intestines so we have

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.770 
nutrients to the intestines so we have
to<00:04:18.609> be<00:04:18.699> really<00:04:18.910> careful<00:04:19.299> about<00:04:19.329> working

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
to be really careful about working

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.339 
to be really careful about working
around<00:04:19.959> those<00:04:20.109> blood<00:04:20.350> vessels<00:04:22.139> we<00:04:23.139> didn't

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349
