there<00:00:11.790> are<00:00:11.910> many<00:00:12.120> immediate<00:00:12.720> threats<00:00:13.020> which

there are many immediate threats which

there are many immediate threats which
are<00:00:13.440> obvious<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.160> just<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.580> look<00:00:14.670> at<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
are obvious you just have to look at the

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.820 
are obvious you just have to look at the
newspapers<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.720> the<00:00:15.840> television<00:00:16.199> channels

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
newspapers and the television channels

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.159 
newspapers and the television channels
to<00:00:16.980> understand<00:00:17.429> that<00:00:17.640> conflicts<00:00:18.449> lack<00:00:18.990> of

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.169 
to understand that conflicts lack of

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
food droughts and natural disasters the

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.050 
food droughts and natural disasters the
these<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.900> all<00:00:21.929> upon<00:00:22.380> us<00:00:22.730> but<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.909> actually

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
these are all upon us but I actually

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.970 
these are all upon us but I actually
think<00:00:24.390> there's<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> deeper<00:00:24.929> systemic<00:00:25.710> threat

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
think there's a deeper systemic threat

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.589 
think there's a deeper systemic threat
and<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.310> has<00:00:26.489> to<00:00:26.669> do<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.179> way<00:00:27.329> that

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and it has to do with the way that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.720 
and it has to do with the way that
people<00:00:27.749> are<00:00:28.050> gathered<00:00:28.949> together<00:00:29.130> to

is collapsing around us and this

is collapsing around us and this
collapse<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:10.790> continue<00:01:11.790> until<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.900> deal

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
collapse will continue until we deal

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.490 
collapse will continue until we deal
with<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.740> fundamental<00:01:15.049> unsustainability<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
with the fundamental unsustainability of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
with the fundamental unsustainability of
the<00:01:17.130> way<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.399> which<00:01:17.610> we're<00:01:17.850> doing<00:01:18.119> business

the way in which we're living our lives
I<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.750> are<00:01:21.869> locked<00:01:22.229> into<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
I think really we are locked into a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
I think really we are locked into a
process<00:01:24.149> of<00:01:24.299> consumerism<00:01:24.930> at<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.860> when

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
process of consumerism at a time when

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
process of consumerism at a time when
we're<00:01:26.340> becoming<00:01:26.520> aware<00:01:27.149> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:28.250> enormous

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
we're becoming aware of the enormous

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.330 
we're becoming aware of the enormous
environmental<00:01:29.610> threats<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.689> growth<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.799> this

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
environmental threats to growth and this

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
environmental threats to growth and this
is<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:34.110> longer<00:01:34.979> running

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
is if you will the the longer running

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.469 
is if you will the the longer running
threat<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:37.040> proximate<00:01:38.040> threat<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:39.270> climate

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
threat the proximate threat is climate

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.249 
threat the proximate threat is climate
change

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259

we're<00:01:40.770> surpassing<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.450> capacity<00:01:43.439> of

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
we're surpassing I think the capacity of

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.010 
we're surpassing I think the capacity of
the<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.610> Earth's<00:01:45.090> life-support<00:01:45.689> system

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the the Earth's life-support system

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.289 
the the Earth's life-support system
we're<00:01:46.439> anticipating<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.460> doubling<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
we're anticipating a doubling in the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.450 
we're anticipating a doubling in the
urban<00:01:48.659> population<00:01:48.920> between<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.399> about

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
urban population between now and about

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.730 
urban population between now and about
2050<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.930> we're<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> grow<00:01:52.380> from<00:01:52.649> about

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
2050 so we're going to grow from about

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.209 
2050 so we're going to grow from about
3.6<00:01:53.520> billion<00:01:53.820> urban<00:01:54.450> dwellers<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.079> about<00:01:55.380> 6.3

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
survivable not by species as we know I

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.900 
survivable not by species as we know I
think<00:02:24.750> we're<00:02:25.050> running<00:02:25.170> out<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.400> access<00:02:26.880> to

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
think we're running out of the access to

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.900 
think we're running out of the access to
clean<00:02:27.660> water<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:28.410> everybody<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:29.670> are<00:02:29.730> running

out of access to energy housing material

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
shelter I think a big threat is our

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800 
shelter I think a big threat is our

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
more information out there a lot of it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.770

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.380 
credible underlying all these sentence
there<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.970> root<00:02:54.870> cause<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:56.400> idea<00:02:57.030> that

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
there is a root cause the idea that

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.370 
there is a root cause the idea that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
society should be completely regulated

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.860 
society should be completely regulated
by<00:03:02.180> market<00:03:03.180> forces<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.019> profit<00:03:04.980> maximization

so<00:03:06.870> unless<00:03:07.800> we<00:03:08.040> change<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.910> pattern<00:03:09.239> of

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
so unless we change this pattern of

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.150 
so unless we change this pattern of
development<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:12.090> cannot<00:03:12.600> address<00:03:13.440> all<00:03:13.890> these

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
development we cannot address all these

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.370 
development we cannot address all these
global<00:03:14.400> threats<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.600> solution<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.079> think<00:03:16.110> is

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
global threats the solution I think is

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.039 
global threats the solution I think is
to<00:03:16.590> recognize<00:03:17.450> what<00:03:18.450> actually<00:03:18.870> does

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
to recognize what actually does

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.960 
to recognize what actually does

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
to make sure that we constrain or

to make sure that we constrain or

of wealth by the already very rich the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.279 
of wealth by the already very rich the
problem<00:04:19.199> however<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:20.039> that<00:04:20.750> those<00:04:21.750> who<00:04:22.049> want

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
problem however is that those who want

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.800 
problem however is that those who want
to<00:04:22.380> change<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.919> world<00:04:23.160> don't<00:04:23.639> have<00:04:24.060> enough

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
to change the world don't have enough

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.340 
to change the world don't have enough
political<00:04:25.440> muscles<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.850> make<00:04:27.479> these<00:04:27.720> changes

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
political muscles to make these changes

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.260 
political muscles to make these changes
so<00:04:28.800> it's<00:04:29.729> both<00:04:30.060> an<00:04:30.750> economic<00:04:31.020> but<00:04:31.650> also

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
so it's both an economic but also

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.540 
so it's both an economic but also
psychosocial<00:04:33.470> change<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.919> we<00:04:35.070> need<00:04:35.100> to

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
psychosocial change that we need to

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.330 
psychosocial change that we need to
promote<00:04:36.380> what<00:04:37.380> we<00:04:37.470> have<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.710> do<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.979> really
