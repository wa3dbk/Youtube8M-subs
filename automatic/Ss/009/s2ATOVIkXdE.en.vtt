00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.549 
new laptops can receive signals better
than<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> PlayStation<00:00:35.239> basically<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:36.989> laptop

is a repeater sending a ethernet signal
to<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> PlayStation<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> PlayStation

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to the PlayStation but the PlayStation
