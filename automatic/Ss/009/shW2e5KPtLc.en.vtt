just more making a stand you know
against<00:02:41.379> Nintendo's<00:02:41.860> policy<00:02:42.280> because

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
especially if we were to kind of let

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.780 
especially if we were to kind of let
this<00:02:44.260> go<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.620> then<00:02:44.980> other<00:02:45.160> companies<00:02:45.430> could

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
this go on then other companies could

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.039 
this go on then other companies could
follow<00:02:46.030> suit<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:46.629> you<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:46.900> have<00:02:47.019> a

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
follow suit and then you just have a

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.930 
follow suit and then you just have a
regulated<00:02:47.620> system<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:48.250> let's<00:02:48.430> plays<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.700> I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
regulated system of let's plays and I

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.069 
regulated system of let's plays and I
think<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.420> sucks

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079

that maybe don't have as much work as
mine<00:02:56.859> but<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.069> do<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.250> lot<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.549> post-production

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
mine but I do a lot of post-production

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.330 
mine but I do a lot of post-production
editing<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.959> try<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.349> give<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.560> my<00:02:59.739> all<00:02:59.769> whenever

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
editing I try to give it my all whenever

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.789 
editing I try to give it my all whenever
I<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.319> stuff<00:03:02.650> I

helmet thing and Nintendo land and it's
not<00:05:13.300> quite<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:13.840> tall<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.770> game<00:05:14.950> but<00:05:15.220> this

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
not quite that tall in the game but this

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.920 
not quite that tall in the game but this
is<00:05:15.520> probably<00:05:15.790> I<00:05:15.880> think<00:05:15.910> what<00:05:16.240> suffice<00:05:16.570> is<00:05:16.750> the

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
is probably I think what suffice is the

is probably I think what suffice is the
best<00:05:17.170> and<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:18.010> I'm<00:05:18.340> gonna<00:05:18.520> take<00:05:18.760> it<00:05:18.850> to<00:05:18.880> a<00:05:18.970> new
