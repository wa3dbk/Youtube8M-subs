00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
situated on either side of it we've

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.399 
situated on either side of it we've
actually<00:00:44.789> got<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.120> dual<00:00:45.510> LED<00:00:45.749> flash<00:00:46.199> which

works incredibly well and the laser
autofocus<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.350> I'll<00:00:49.499> talk<00:00:49.679> a<00:00:49.710> bit<00:00:49.829> more

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
autofocus which I'll talk a bit more

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.130 
autofocus which I'll talk a bit more
about<00:00:50.339> later<00:00:50.609> the<00:00:51.359> actual<00:00:51.600> button<00:00:51.899> placement

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
about later the actual button placement

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.959 
about later the actual button placement
takes<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.679> bit<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.859> getting<00:00:52.949> used<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.789> it's

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
takes a bit of getting used to but it's

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.189 
takes a bit of getting used to but it's
actually<00:00:54.300> once<00:00:54.449> you've<00:00:54.629> got<00:00:54.749> used<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> an

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
actually once you've got used to an

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
actually once you've got used to an
adapted<00:00:55.679> to<00:00:55.859> it<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.579> actually<00:00:56.730> probably

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
adapted to it it's actually probably

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.759 
adapted to it it's actually probably
faster<00:00:57.569> than<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> typical<00:00:58.230> ones<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.679> on

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
faster than the typical ones you see on

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.099 
faster than the typical ones you see on
other<00:00:58.949> devices<00:00:59.390> on<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.569> bottom<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.960> have

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
other devices on the bottom we have

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
other devices on the bottom we have
these<00:01:01.289> suppose<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:01.979> one<00:01:02.190> watt<00:01:02.460> speaker<00:01:03.030> which

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
these suppose at one watt speaker which

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.149 
these suppose at one watt speaker which
I<00:01:03.539> wasn't<00:01:03.780> actually<00:01:04.199> particularly<00:01:04.589> impressed

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
I wasn't actually particularly impressed

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250

outdoor conditions however I would say

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.690 
outdoor conditions however I would say
that<00:01:34.200> colors<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.590> slightly<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.250> muted

they<00:01:37.350> were<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.500> little<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:37.890> punchier<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.060> as

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
they were a little bit punchier so as

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.000 
they were a little bit punchier so as
for<00:01:39.390> how<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.720> display<00:01:40.140> compares<00:01:40.620> to<00:01:40.800> say<00:01:40.980> a

1080p<00:01:41.760> panel<00:01:42.330> well<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.110> honest<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.530> most

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
1080p panel well to be honest in most

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530 
1080p panel well to be honest in most
scenarios<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.400> literally<00:01:44.760> can't<00:01:45.090> tell<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
scenarios you literally can't tell the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.540 
scenarios you literally can't tell the
difference<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.200> thus<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.710> suppose<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.400> of<00:01:47.460> my

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
difference and thus I suppose one of my

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.610 
difference and thus I suppose one of my
big<00:01:47.730> complaints<00:01:48.210> with<00:01:48.330> this<00:01:48.450> phone<00:01:48.750> however<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
big complaints with this phone however I

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.020 
big complaints with this phone however I
suppose<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.980> does<00:01:50.130> come<00:01:50.340> into<00:01:50.550> its<00:01:50.670> own<00:01:50.820> when

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
suppose it does come into its own when

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.510 
suppose it does come into its own when
reading<00:01:51.210> very<00:01:51.570> very<00:01:51.810> fine<00:01:52.050> text<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:53.310> another

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
reading very very fine text so another

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.000 
reading very very fine text so another
big<00:01:53.700> talking<00:01:54.000> point<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> LG<00:01:54.900> g3<00:01:55.140> was<00:01:55.830> its

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
big talking point with the LG g3 was its

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.070 
big talking point with the LG g3 was its
camera<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.210> category<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.720> have<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
camera now in this category I have to

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.210 
camera now in this category I have to
say<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.230> was<00:01:58.530> blown<00:01:58.800> away

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
say I was blown away

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.580 
say I was blown away
so<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.030> g3<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.660> has<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.960> 13<00:02:01.380> megapixel

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so the g3 actually has a 13 megapixel

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.430 
so the g3 actually has a 13 megapixel
camera<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.790> take<00:02:02.940> photos<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.600> 16<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.290> 9

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
camera but to take photos in 16 to 9

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.930 
camera but to take photos in 16 to 9
ratio<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:05.010> have<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.310> actually<00:02:05.550> lower<00:02:05.730> that<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
ratio you have to actually lower that to

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.210 
ratio you have to actually lower that to
10<00:02:06.330> having<00:02:07.200> said<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.440> though<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.710> actual

end result is pretty stellar the actual
detail<00:02:11.370> here<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:11.730> unrivaled<00:02:12.269> I've<00:02:12.659> not

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.539 
detail here is unrivaled I've not
actually<00:02:13.140> seen<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.530> phone<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.129> can<00:02:14.340> take

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
actually seen a phone which can take

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:14.940 
actually seen a phone which can take
this

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
this

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.280 
this
amount<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.310> detail<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.849> one<00:02:16.090> shot<00:02:16.510> well<00:02:17.140> this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
amount of detail in one shot well this

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.839 
amount of detail in one shot well this
is<00:02:17.410> due<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.709> combination<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.400> fairly<00:02:18.700> high

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
is due to a combination of fairly high

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.080 
is due to a combination of fairly high
megapixels<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:20.200> very<00:02:20.500> very<00:02:20.860> solid<00:02:21.129> lens<00:02:21.519> on

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
megapixels and a very very solid lens on

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.119 
megapixels and a very very solid lens on
top<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.510> we<00:02:22.629> have<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.930> laser<00:02:23.140> focus<00:02:23.860> and

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
top of that we have the laser focus and

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.680 
top of that we have the laser focus and
this<00:02:24.250> basically<00:02:24.640> helps<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.090> identify

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
this basically helps to identify

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.509 
this basically helps to identify
individual<00:02:26.230> objects<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:26.920> ensure<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
individual objects and ensure that the

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.280 
individual objects and ensure that the
whole<00:02:27.700> object<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.239> in<00:02:28.390> focus<00:02:28.599> at<00:02:28.900> any<00:02:29.050> one<00:02:29.260> time

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
whole object is in focus at any one time

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.620 
whole object is in focus at any one time
and<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.129> say<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.879> again<00:02:30.940> works

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
and I have to say this again works

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.080 
and I have to say this again works
amazingly<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.980> end<00:02:33.099> pictures<00:02:33.580> are<00:02:33.730> crisp

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
amazingly the end pictures are crisp

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.720 
amazingly the end pictures are crisp
punchy<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.019> there's<00:02:35.170> loads<00:02:35.349> of<00:02:35.560> light<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
punchy and there's loads of light the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.180 
punchy and there's loads of light the
video<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.180> also<00:02:37.390> very<00:02:37.810> impressive<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.920> not

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
video is also very impressive so not

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.030 
video is also very impressive so not
only<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:39.519> we<00:02:39.640> have<00:02:39.819> selective<00:02:40.420> focus<00:02:41.040> 1080p

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
only do we have selective focus 1080p

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.100 
only do we have selective focus 1080p
recording<00:02:42.370> at<00:02:42.790> 60<00:02:43.150> frames<00:02:43.239> per<00:02:43.420> second<00:02:43.870> and

recording at 60 frames per second and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.920 
recording at 60 frames per second and
also<00:02:44.440> 4k<00:02:45.129> at<00:02:45.340> 30<00:02:45.549> frames<00:02:45.879> per<00:02:45.940> second<00:02:46.360> but<00:02:46.810> we

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
also 4k at 30 frames per second but we

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.350 
also 4k at 30 frames per second but we
also<00:02:47.049> have<00:02:47.319> slow-motion<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.250> optical<00:02:49.060> image

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
also have slow-motion and optical image

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.300 
also have slow-motion and optical image
stabilization<00:02:49.810> Plus<00:02:50.500> which<00:02:50.709> makes<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.099> video

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
stabilization Plus which makes the video

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.699 
stabilization Plus which makes the video
playback<00:02:51.549> very<00:02:52.090> smooth<00:02:52.420> indeed<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.380> LG's

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
playback very smooth indeed so LG's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.440 
playback very smooth indeed so LG's
keyboard<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.400> pretty<00:02:54.730> good<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.209> haven't

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
keyboard is pretty good I haven't

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
keyboard is pretty good I haven't
actually<00:02:55.540> felt<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.019> need<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.200> use<00:02:56.440> a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
actually felt the need to use a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.770 
actually felt the need to use a
third-party<00:02:56.769> one<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.459> normally<00:02:57.700> do<00:02:58.150> it's

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
third-party one like I normally do it's

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.539 
third-party one like I normally do it's
generally<00:02:59.410> like<00:02:59.650> most<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.040> time<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.370> very

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
generally like most the time is very

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.890 
generally like most the time is very
very<00:03:00.790> responsive<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.599> can<00:03:01.750> actually

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
very responsive and you can actually

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.360 
very responsive and you can actually
change<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.380> size<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:02.950> keyboard

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
change the size of the keyboard

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.890 
change the size of the keyboard
depending<00:03:03.730> on<00:03:03.819> how<00:03:04.000> much<00:03:04.150> room<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.480> need<00:03:04.750> to

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
depending on how much room you need to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.319 
depending on how much room you need to

own and to be honest out of the two I

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.380 
own and to be honest out of the two I
say<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.380> still<00:03:11.769> prefer<00:03:11.950> chrome<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.269> although

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
say I still prefer chrome so although

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.330 
say I still prefer chrome so although
LG's<00:03:13.870> one<00:03:14.079> is<00:03:14.200> fairly<00:03:14.410> quick<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.160> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
LG's one is fairly quick and the

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
sometimes suffer these random errors

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.309

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
seen the actual general day-to-day usage

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.890 
seen the actual general day-to-day usage
of<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.069> UI<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.430> very<00:03:42.880> very<00:03:43.090> quick<00:03:43.420> however

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
of the UI is very very quick however

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.479 
of the UI is very very quick however
every<00:03:44.319> now<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.560> again<00:03:44.590> there'll<00:03:45.040> be<00:03:45.069> a<00:03:45.160> slight

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
every now and again there'll be a slight

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.759 
every now and again there'll be a slight
lag<00:03:45.790> spike<00:03:46.150> for<00:03:46.450> example<00:03:46.840> it'll<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.590> take<00:03:47.739> a

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
lag spike for example it'll just take a

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.379 
lag spike for example it'll just take a
bit<00:03:48.010> longer<00:03:48.220> than<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.519> should<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:49.000> actually

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
bit longer than it should to actually

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.990 
bit longer than it should to actually
sort<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.319> receive<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.069> information<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:51.790> your

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
sort of receive the information of your

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.599 
sort of receive the information of your
touch<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:53.079> gaming<00:03:53.470> performance<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.130> good<00:03:54.370> but

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
touch so gaming performance is good but

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.490 
touch so gaming performance is good but
not<00:03:54.760> great<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.600> is<00:03:55.660> again<00:03:55.989> due<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.319> the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
not great and this is again due to the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.670 
not great and this is again due to the
high<00:03:56.650> resolution<00:03:57.400> so<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.630> actual<00:03:59.290> phone<00:03:59.500> is

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
high resolution so this actual phone is

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.979 
high resolution so this actual phone is
powered<00:03:59.980> by<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.160> Snapdragon<00:04:00.310> 801<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.660> 2

powered by the Snapdragon 801 and 2
gigabytes<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.590> RAM<00:04:02.859> and<00:04:03.130> these<00:04:03.609> are<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.880> specs

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
gigabytes of RAM and these are the specs

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.849 
gigabytes of RAM and these are the specs
that<00:04:04.299> was<00:04:04.510> sort<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.720> designed<00:04:05.079> for<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.349> 1080p

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
that was sort of designed for a 1080p

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.860 
that was sort of designed for a 1080p
display<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:07.180> if<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.329> actually<00:04:07.450> had<00:04:07.720> the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
display so if you actually had the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.780 
display so if you actually had the
specification<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:08.739> 1080p<00:04:09.190> phone<00:04:09.519> the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
specification on a 1080p phone the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.759 
specification on a 1080p phone the
points<00:04:10.180> would<00:04:10.239> be<00:04:10.299> flawless<00:04:10.690> however<00:04:11.620> its

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
points would be flawless however its

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.289 
points would be flawless however its
current<00:04:12.099> resolution<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.819> pretty<00:04:13.060> much

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
current resolution is pretty much

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.629 
current resolution is pretty much
doubled<00:04:13.780> up<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.680> know<00:04:14.799> during<00:04:15.069> games<00:04:15.400> and

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
doubled up so you know during games and

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.219 
doubled up so you know during games and
stuff<00:04:15.790> this<00:04:16.000> phone<00:04:16.209> has<00:04:16.389> to<00:04:16.419> push<00:04:16.750> pretty<00:04:17.019> much

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
stuff this phone has to push pretty much

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.409 
stuff this phone has to push pretty much
twice<00:04:17.560> as<00:04:17.769> many<00:04:17.889> pixels<00:04:18.430> as<00:04:18.579> its<00:04:18.789> competitors

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
twice as many pixels as its competitors

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.599 
twice as many pixels as its competitors
and<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.440> actual<00:04:20.560> end<00:04:20.829> performance<00:04:21.160> is

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
and so the actual end performance is

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.550 
and so the actual end performance is
equivalent<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.330> basically<00:04:23.050> last<00:04:23.260> year's

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
equivalent to basically last year's

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.460 
equivalent to basically last year's
flagships<00:04:24.159> phones<00:04:24.820> like<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.240> galaxy<00:04:25.270> s4<00:04:25.870> and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
flagships phones like the galaxy s4 and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.280 
flagships phones like the galaxy s4 and
the<00:04:26.560> HTC<00:04:26.979> One<00:04:27.370> m7

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
the HTC One m7

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.650 
the HTC One m7
all<00:04:29.010> right<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.670> terms<00:04:29.910> of<00:04:30.090> build<00:04:30.360> which

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
all right so in terms of build which

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.510 
all right so in terms of build which
takes<00:04:30.930> into<00:04:31.200> account<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.620> appearance<00:04:32.220> the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
takes into account the appearance the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
feel of the device I'm gonna give the LG

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.900 
feel of the device I'm gonna give the LG
g3<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:37.380> 19<00:04:37.950> out<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.220> 20

g3 a 19 out of 20

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.270

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
so although the g3 is all plastic it's

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.130 
so although the g3 is all plastic it's
very<00:04:41.580> solid<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.390> be<00:04:42.450> honest<00:04:42.690> it's<00:04:42.840> light
