00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.240
 destroys the well-established notion of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.490
 color cubes new artek cubes 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 using a structure never seen before 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.169
 new cubes allow you to create all that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.329
 wouldn't it have come to mind 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.939
 displaying a huge number of forms 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.980
 it becomes possible we were 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.349
 unprecedented structure developed 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.569
 cubes on all sides of the dice 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.460
 there are numerous holes on 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:36.480
 one of them is a center pin 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.310
 connections the ability to connect our 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.230
 cubes vertically and horizontally and 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.270
 diagonal allows you to create such 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.270
 freedom as if in the hands of clay 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.280
 using only one single type 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.620
 dice you can create myriads 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.240
 amazing shapes 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 our cubes are most suitable for children 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.520
 each of which takes at least once 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.439
 hands colored cubes and using 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.509
 more cubes can be given 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.480
 the form of works of art capable 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.860
 strike the imagination even professionals 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.890
 they are also irreplaceable as 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.240
 math visuals with 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.520
 using just one set 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.050
 Artek cubes become possible 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.760
 constructing a multitude of mathematical 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.590
 puzzles and tools high 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.240
 which expressiveness level is possible 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 reach with our cubes and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.530
 ease of understanding their design 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.229
 opens up many opportunities for them 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.270
 use starting from design 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.460
 scientific experimental kits and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.030
 ending with the creation of manifold 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.220
 robots all that seemed impossible 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.409
 collect from ordinary cubes now with 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.970
 It is easy to create isar so light 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.409
 a unique tool appeared 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.409
 opening unlimited possibilities 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.240
 construction of existing cubes 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.490
 allows you to fasten them only on top 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.670
 each other as a result is often not 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.260
 It turns out to create what I would like to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.630
 difference from them even with a small 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.530
 the number of artek cubes can be one for 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.960
 another to design stunning shapes 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.060
 Children Playing always include the imagination and 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.400
 with the help of our cubes can it 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.140
 nice to express as they 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.210
 transform the two-dimensional forms into 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.190
 three-dimensional works of our cubes 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.770
 their enthusiasm for the game is increasingly 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.290
 increases by constructing from cubes and 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.180
 simple forms and complex models you see not 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.040
 just having fun but 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.430
 learn the skills of solving the set 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.410
 tasks and expressing our own thoughts we 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.600
 developed artek cubes in pursuit 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.170
 make it possible to create any form of 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.170
 colored cubes 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.090
 our cubes make it easy to create and 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.160
 simple but at the same time detailed as 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.050
 consequence it becomes possible to create 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.470
 rich expression and disturbing 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.900
 how much imagination works 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.620
 spokesmen can be works from 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.620
 our cubes 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.150
 another feature of artek cubes 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.239
 is the ease of creating works 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.620
 absolutely any size 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.430
 if usually to create large 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.010
 works 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.370
 detailed planning and glue required 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.650
 and accurate drawings now with cubes 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.150
 artek can be created without any problems 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.790
 figures even with spiral and 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.040
 diagonal elements and all this with 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.230
 help pin connection located 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.450
 near the center of the cube allowing 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.920
 attach it to any 6 sides of others 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.290
 cubes can finally be constructed 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.470
 works of large size without help 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.870
 glue of course such works 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.209
 easy to disassemble to create from cubes 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.100
 something new in this and 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.840
 The main difference is our 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.620
 cubes from other materials for 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.360
 modeling 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.880
 the fact that they can be used 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.500
 unlimited number of times to do them 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.019
 truly unique material for 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.269
 modeling beyond that artek 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.829
 allows you to naturally develop 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.790
 your imagination abilities and 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.790
 design 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:25.110
 this picture is entirely made up of ours 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:27.530
 cubes isn't it amazing cubes artek 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.880
 also suitable for studying mathematics 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.980
 excellent and not comparable to 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.570
 what other cubes do they make 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.120
 connectivity by either side 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.389
 ease of use and design 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.400
 Immediately clear and everyone with just 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.380
 one set of cubes child learns 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.450
 distinguish different shapes designs 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.550
 moving on to making grooves and 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.800
 recognition of numbers with simple 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.710
 mathematical instruments like bills 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.870
 well, it's not all the child will be able to know and 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.790
 square roots and the concept of square with 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.270
 volume and even learn to read the drawings 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.760
 and it's all fun playing besides 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.770
 other set includes a book of details 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.280
 explaining the task in different subjects and 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.139
 level to achieve the greatest 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.540
 the effect of learning a child should 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.040
 hands to touch science with 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.520
 visual sets for scientific 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.350
 experiments and and that will not cope with 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.550
 The role of such sets is better than 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.800
 educational toys 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.640
 because they provide an opportunity to dive into 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.560
 science is interesting and fun playing is considered 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.050
 that most nobel laureates 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.580
 prizes and great scientists grew in medium 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.710
 which made it possible 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.620
 experiment and touch science 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.120
 own hands 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.950
 artek company has developed a huge 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.130
 number of playing sets in physics 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.510
 biology chemistry and other sciences 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.470
 allowing to experience the joy of scientific 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.470
 discoveries at any age 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.940
 and using our new cubes without 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.230
 a single screw to construct a robot 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.520
 able to move as if he is alive 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.880
 generally accepted that the development of robots 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.830
 coupled with trial and error at that 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.110
 same time our company set up a robot 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.150
 includes motors and control panel 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.400
 which easily connects with cubes 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.170
 arter it makes our set perfect 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.800
 suitable for designing robots 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:19.560
 self-designed similar set 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.540
 waiting for a long time because with him anyone can 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.640
 create original robot and connect 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.120
 between a sensor puzzle set and 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.740
 puzzles 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.390
 includes a detailed manual for their 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.430
 create and allow the whole family 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.990
 have a wonderful time guessing 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.430
 a huge number of puzzles and 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.020
 collecting puzzles among puzzles and puzzles 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.630
 which can be collected using this 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.120
 set there are those who have hundreds and even 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.450
 thousands of solutions and such 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.930
 one or two and for those who like to break 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.300
 head 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.340
 there is a puzzle to solve 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.000
 which even an adult goes to 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.370
 on average a few months using only 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.410
 one type of artek cubes you can 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.320
 create and construct infinite 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.480
 variety of forms and with the addition of everything 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.760
 several additional details you 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.150
 be able to create amazing moving 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.070
 design and child and adult each 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.950
 It is able to create anything you would not only 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.200
 wanted new art cubes 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.550
 the more you play with them the more 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.550
 you are captured by the game
