anyway in these kind of situations but

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.200 
anyway in these kind of situations but
he<00:00:59.960> really<00:01:00.140> deferred<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.879> notion

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
he really deferred to the the notion

that<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.929> CBA<00:01:03.260> hasn't<00:01:03.649> been<00:01:03.739> agreed<00:01:04.010> to

yet<00:01:04.400> there's<00:01:04.640> no<00:01:04.729> document<00:01:05.330> sign<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.440> he

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
yet there's no document sign and so he

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.709 
yet there's no document sign and so he
only<00:01:06.890> has<00:01:07.130> an<00:01:07.250> outline<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.000> it's<00:01:08.119> hard<00:01:08.329> for<00:01:08.420> him

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
only has an outline so it's hard for him

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.050 
only has an outline so it's hard for him
to<00:01:08.930> truly<00:01:09.710> know<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.890> word<00:01:10.219> the<00:01:10.549> rules<00:01:10.790> and

lot of decisions once they get the

fifteenth of December so there might be

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.940 
fifteenth of December so there might be
a<00:02:02.509> slight<00:02:02.719> additional<00:02:03.289> flexibility<00:02:03.799> that

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
a slight additional flexibility that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.469 
a slight additional flexibility that
it'll<00:02:04.159> difficult<00:02:04.640> part<00:02:04.789> will<00:02:04.880> be<00:02:04.909> cashing<00:02:05.179> it

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
it'll difficult part will be cashing it

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.630 
it'll difficult part will be cashing it
out<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.710> getting<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.979> team<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.249> work<00:02:07.340> with<00:02:07.399> them

okay yes comment about Eric's comment

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.980 
okay yes comment about Eric's comment
about

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
about

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.950 
about
the<00:02:12.220> team<00:02:13.220> needing<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.850> adjust<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.630> short

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
the team needing to adjust on a short

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.170 
the team needing to adjust on a short
schedule<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.830> pretty<00:02:16.040> important<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:17.030> look

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
schedule is pretty important if we look

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.900 
schedule is pretty important if we look
at<00:02:17.270> history<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:18.190> 1999<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.310> had<00:02:19.460> another<00:02:19.670> lock

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
at history in 1999 we had another lock

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.060 
at history in 1999 we had another lock
every<00:02:20.270> 250<00:02:20.510> gave<00:02:20.840> season<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.440> minimal<00:02:21.830> training

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
every 250 gave season a minimal training

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.580 
every 250 gave season a minimal training
camp<00:02:22.430> minimal<00:02:23.360> practice<00:02:23.840> time<00:02:24.050> between<00:02:24.170> games

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
camp minimal practice time between games

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.490 
camp minimal practice time between games
so<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.070> similar<00:02:25.490> situation<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:27.110> year

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
so it's a similar situation that year

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.260 
so it's a similar situation that year
the<00:02:27.740> team<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.190> won<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.580> championship<00:02:29.120> was

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
the team that won the championship was

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.450 
the team that won the championship was
San<00:02:29.600> Antonio<00:02:30.020> Spurs<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.560> team<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:30.980> veteran

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
San Antonio Spurs a team of veteran

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.910 
San Antonio Spurs a team of veteran
players<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.210> same<00:02:32.570> coach<00:02:32.900> mostly<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.890> same

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360

ground running a veteran team with

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.690 
ground running a veteran team with
minimal<00:02:38.270> changes<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:40.010> Lakers<00:02:40.250> on<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
minimal changes now the Lakers on the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.580 
minimal changes now the Lakers on the
other<00:02:40.820> hand<00:02:41.030> were<00:02:41.480> transitioning<00:02:42.110> from<00:02:42.500> one

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
other hand were transitioning from one

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.280 
other hand were transitioning from one
coast<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.100> another<00:02:43.750> kurama's<00:02:44.750> was<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.110> coach

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
coast to another kurama's was the coach

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.650 
coast to another kurama's was the coach
they<00:02:45.890> had<00:02:46.100> dennis<00:02:46.490> rodman<00:02:47.000> coming<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.570> out

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
they had dennis rodman coming in and out

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.100 
they had dennis rodman coming in and out
that<00:02:48.080> year<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.830> there<00:02:49.490> were<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.880> know<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:50.110> lot

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
that year so there were you know a lot

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.290 
that year so there were you know a lot
of<00:02:51.140> changes<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:51.860> lot<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.490> distraction<00:02:53.180> that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
of changes a lot of distraction that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.900 
of changes a lot of distraction that
season<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:55.040> know<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.220> Spurs<00:02:55.430> won<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
season and you know the Spurs won the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.410 
season and you know the Spurs won the
Lakers<00:02:56.210> didn't<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.900> think<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
Lakers didn't and I think that if the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.760 
Lakers didn't and I think that if the
continuity<00:02:59.420> was<00:02:59.600> one<00:02:59.930> of<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.080> most<00:03:00.290> important

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
continuity was one of the most important

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.680 
continuity was one of the most important
factors<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.580> this<00:03:01.850> year<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.210> want<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.480> look<00:03:02.570> at

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
factors so this year you want to look at

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.170 
factors so this year you want to look at
teams<00:03:02.990> who<00:03:03.200> have<00:03:03.230> continuity<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.850> Lakers

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
teams who have continuity and the Lakers

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.570 
teams who have continuity and the Lakers
coaching<00:03:05.900> changed<00:03:06.710> from<00:03:06.860> Phil<00:03:07.100> Jackson<00:03:07.490> to

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
coaching changed from Phil Jackson to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.710 
coaching changed from Phil Jackson to
Mike<00:03:07.700> ground<00:03:07.970> even<00:03:08.270> though<00:03:08.360> most<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
Mike ground even though most of the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.360 
Mike ground even though most of the
personnel<00:03:09.140> are<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.380> same<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.950> coaching

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
personnel are the same the coaching

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.500 
personnel are the same the coaching
change<00:03:10.580> is<00:03:10.730> scared<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.000> huge<00:03:11.240> for<00:03:11.420> them

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
change is scared of a huge for them

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.510 
change is scared of a huge for them

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
guard and some other things so I I think

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.990 
guard and some other things so I I think
that<00:03:39.620> they<00:03:40.250> have<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.490> window<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:40.880> opportunity

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
that they have a window of opportunity

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.330 
that they have a window of opportunity
here<00:03:41.630> in<00:03:41.810> Kobe<00:03:42.230> Bryant's<00:03:42.650> last<00:03:42.830> couple<00:03:43.310> of

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
years at his prime but that window is it

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.180 
years at his prime but that window is it
is<00:03:47.360> by<00:03:47.600> no<00:03:47.900> means<00:03:48.170> assured<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.890> going<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.130> be

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
a tough struggle even in the Easter

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.680 
a tough struggle even in the Easter
years<00:03:50.900> well<00:03:51.710> as<00:03:51.890> John<00:03:52.160> Lennon<00:03:52.520> did<00:03:52.700> say<00:03:52.970> happy

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
an ends in the lockout I think although

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.560 
an ends in the lockout I think although
it<00:03:57.560> apparently<00:03:58.070> could<00:03:58.280> still<00:03:58.520> go<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:59.540> other

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
it apparently could still go the other

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.200 
it apparently could still go the other
way<00:03:59.750> in<00:04:00.200> theory<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:01.490> did<00:04:01.700> feel<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:02.060> me<00:04:02.180> like

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
way in theory it did feel to me like

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.030 
way in theory it did feel to me like

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
they were playing chicken and they're

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.390 
they were playing chicken and they're

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
driving toward that cliff to me the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.760 
driving toward that cliff to me the
players<00:04:07.670> jumped<00:04:08.360> out<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.660> car<00:04:08.770> but

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
players jumped out of the car but

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.560 
players jumped out of the car but
perhaps<00:04:10.010> they<00:04:10.370> kept<00:04:10.640> rolling<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.120> fell<00:04:11.450> off

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
perhaps they kept rolling and fell off

the cliff anyway well let me give you a

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.229 
the cliff anyway well let me give you a
theory<00:04:15.800> here<00:04:16.070> because<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.760> was<00:04:16.940> one<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.150> my

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
theory here because that was one of my

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.129 
theory here because that was one of my
questions

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
questions

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.409 
questions
how<00:04:18.319> what<00:04:18.709> did<00:04:19.069> the<00:04:19.310> decertification<00:04:19.699> and<00:04:20.359> the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
how what did the decertification and the

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.360 
how what did the decertification and the
lawsuit<00:04:20.840> really<00:04:21.349> get<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.650> players<00:04:21.919> because

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
lawsuit really get the players because

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.730 
lawsuit really get the players because
they<00:04:22.550> ended<00:04:22.849> up<00:04:22.969> agreeing<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.659> pretty<00:04:24.560> much

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
they ended up agreeing to pretty much

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.559 
they ended up agreeing to pretty much
the<00:04:25.009> same<00:04:25.159> agreement<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.879> was<00:04:25.999> unacceptable

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:26.569 
the same agreement that was unacceptable

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.239 
the same agreement that was unacceptable
two<00:04:26.960> weeks<00:04:27.199> prior<00:04:27.409> they<00:04:27.650> got<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.830> couple<00:04:28.069> of

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:28.249 
two weeks prior they got a couple of

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.550 
two weeks prior they got a couple of
concessions<00:04:28.789> but<00:04:29.060> had<00:04:29.599> they<00:04:29.779> instead<00:04:30.199> just

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
concessions but had they instead just

concessions but had they instead just

for<00:05:40.039> the<00:05:40.069> season<00:05:40.460> now<00:05:40.580> it's<00:05:40.789> going<00:05:40.939> to<00:05:41.000> be<00:05:41.060> hard

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
for the season now it's going to be hard

for the season now it's going to be hard
to<00:05:41.360> break<00:05:41.509> I<00:05:41.689> think<00:05:41.870> it's<00:05:42.259> going<00:05:42.439> to<00:05:42.529> be<00:05:42.649> a<00:05:42.680> lot

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:42.939 
to break I think it's going to be a lot

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:45.610 
to break I think it's going to be a lot
harder<00:05:43.939> for<00:05:44.389> the<00:05:44.449> players<00:05:44.689> to<00:05:44.870> say<00:05:45.020> no<00:05:45.289> now

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
harder for the players to say no now

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.909 
harder for the players to say no now
than<00:05:45.889> it<00:05:46.009> was<00:05:46.039> a<00:05:46.189> couple<00:05:46.310> of<00:05:46.550> weeks<00:05:46.639> ago
