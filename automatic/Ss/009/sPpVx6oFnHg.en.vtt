with<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.140> uh<00:03:03.410> get<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.370> question<00:03:04.850> that's<00:03:05.120> okay

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
with that uh get a question that's okay

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.310 
with that uh get a question that's okay
no<00:03:06.920> seriously<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.790> citric<00:03:08.420> acid<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.140> like

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
no seriously so citric acid is that like

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:19.150 
no seriously so citric acid is that like
