00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.720
K-Con 2014 Dutyfree Shopping (2) HAUL

00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:15.214
Now, the reason we're gathered here...

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.354
Ooh... So tasty. Soudesuka('really' in Japanese)?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.340
Yummy yummy.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.140
Urgh... Will you keep it down?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.440
This is really really delicious!

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.220
Wanna bite?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.600
Cafe Sua~ Cafe Sua~

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.740
It's just seems really sweet.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.000
This is a time for reviewing the things from the duty free.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.980
Firstly, one by one.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.180
Argh... I swore by mistake.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.600
This is just something I bought from America. DUO eyelash adhesive.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.820
How much is it in America? It's about 12,000￦(Korean currency) in Korea.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.280
I forgot.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.380
Now, shall we begin one by one?

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:09.321
Who's the owner of this 'Beige Orange'?

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.240
Me and Yeon-ju, one for each of us.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.980
'Beige Beige' is mine.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.540
This is a Lunasol eye shadow.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.760
They only sell this at the duty free.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.093
There are so many it seems we've been sponsored... (no sponsorship, been bought by our own money.)

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.400
Let's open it. I'll show you one by one.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.840
Could you wait while I get this open?

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.700
Lunasol: 'Beige Biege'(steadyseller)

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.580
This is the Lunasol: 'Close of Night'(shimmer series)

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.940
This is the 'Neutral Beige'(low saturation series)

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.640
This is 'Beige Orange' (Lovely series)

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.900
It's like 7~80,000￦ cuz it can't be imported.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.480
I never new it'd be so cheap at the duty free. (about 40,000￦)

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.380
Reviewing matte lipsticks from M.A.C

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.400
By the way the case is so pretty.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.600
M.A.C lipstick: 'Enchanted One'

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:24.300
M.A.C lipstick: 'Relentlessly Red'

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.540
I bought this thinking I'll use it someday.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.720
Isn't it similar to your 'First of Love'?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.440
It's a bit more pink than that.

00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:41.902
Next, will be the opening of Tori's Dior 'Addict Mascara'.

00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:44.600
Ooh... Oh my gosh!

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.040
I've even got a pink one at home. (this one's purple)

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.380
Should we try it on? Greeting the light purple mascara...

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.700
Next up, Yves Sant Laurent #12.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.860
Put some on here.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.100
Yves Sant Laurent tint #12 (Bestseller)

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.400
It's a pity we can't convey this scent.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.120
Next, (Gabofgab) NARS concealer!

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.500
Excitement of the girls.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.800
We're getting a genuine reaction. (it's great)

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.600
Mine's NARS 'Radient Creamy Concealer Medium1'

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.120
Oh, but there's nothing much other than this colour.

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:02.934
She say's Koreans should just use this no matter what.

00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:07.434
This is a Laura Mercier lipstick. (MALT)

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.980
My favorite style.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.320
Granny colour.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.580
But I wanted one after Gong Hyo-jin recently wore it.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.620
Next is Chanel!

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:31.100
This is a Chanel 'LES 4 OMBRES #214' (slightly khaki beige)

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:40.720
It's a very desaturated beige sort of colour.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.820
It looks bad on screen but the colour+texture is super great.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.160
Next ones were bought on the plane. Cuz I had money to burn.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:03.500
I exchanged 500,000￦, but I had no time to spend it cuz of the schedule.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.700
It's a Kiel's product only sold on planes,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.480
A duty free limited edition.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.260
That's why you bought it? Yeah, I bought it.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.900
But hey why is it so teenie-weenie?

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:24.480
Kiel's nutrition cream : 'Rosa Artica' (high-nutrition, for winter)

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.400
Did you try it before buying? Nope.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.040
I'm a Kiel's-lover so I just bought it.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.500
I only got it for the case, not the contents.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.500
It actually has low performance compared to its price. (about 60,000￦)

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.200
The lavender scent is totally my style.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.520
I'm really content with the 'Neutral Beige' and 'Close of Night'.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.360
Okay, this is it for today's duty free shopping.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.613
Duty free or not it's just a day for wasting our money.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.900
Bye bye~

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:30.540
Trying to arrange it like a beauty blogger.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.180
