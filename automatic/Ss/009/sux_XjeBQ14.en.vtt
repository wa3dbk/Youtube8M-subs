could<00:00:05.730> say<00:00:05.879> sprats<00:00:06.270> nuclear<00:00:07.109> series<00:00:07.950> thingy

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
could say sprats nuclear series thingy

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.200 
could say sprats nuclear series thingy
and<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.540> don't<00:00:09.900> know<00:00:10.019> if<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.320> like<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:11.210> series

red gun or a sniper one maybe a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.349 
red gun or a sniper one maybe a
combination<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.920> don't<00:00:29.070> know<00:00:29.189> bow<00:00:29.460> down<00:00:29.490> this

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
combination I don't know bow down this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.620 
combination I don't know bow down this
is<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.529> whi<00:00:32.189> Yemen<00:00:32.640> which<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.420> quite

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
is the one on whi Yemen which if I quite

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.459 
is the one on whi Yemen which if I quite
a<00:00:33.660> while<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.480> nice<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
a while but it's a really nice one I to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.729 
a while but it's a really nice one I to
just<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.280> before<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.930> game<00:00:40.170> ends<00:00:40.410> pretty

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
just get it before the game ends pretty

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.110 
just get it before the game ends pretty
much<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> second<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> last<00:00:41.850> kill

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
much like it's a second to last kill

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.670 
much like it's a second to last kill
like<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> thing<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.140> actually<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
like a thing and I actually get the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
like a thing and I actually get the
nuclear<00:00:44.129> which<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.399> cool<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.510> see

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
nuclear which is cool so what you see

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.260 
nuclear which is cool so what you see
right<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.230> user<00:00:47.160> dsr<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.940> play<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
right now is a user dsr and play with a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.799 
right now is a user dsr and play with a
few<00:00:48.420> friends<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.940> regular<00:00:50.940> domination<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
few friends on a regular domination and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.010 
few friends on a regular domination and
I<00:00:52.050> actually<00:00:52.969> start<00:00:53.969> off<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.329> street<00:00:54.660> just

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
I actually start off the street just

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220 
I actually start off the street just
before<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.850> half<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.600> point<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
before the half way point and the you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
before the half way point and the you
know<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> round<00:00:58.859> suite<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.370> spawn<00:01:00.120> switch

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
know the round suite at the spawn switch

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
know the round suite at the spawn switch
or<00:01:00.570> whatever<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.770> second<00:01:02.100> round<00:01:02.129> anyway

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
or whatever is the second round anyway

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.160 
or whatever is the second round anyway
before<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.030> second<00:01:03.300> round<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:04.049> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
before the second round I think it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.800 
before the second round I think it's
about<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.320> minute<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> half<00:01:04.799> maybe<00:01:05.659> left<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
about a minute and a half maybe left in

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
about a minute and a half maybe left in
the<00:01:06.900> first<00:01:07.110> round<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.740> put<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.400> there

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the first round so I put a bit in there

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
the first round so I put a bit in there
that<00:01:09.210> I've<00:01:09.330> cut<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> middle<00:01:10.049> out

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that I've cut a bit in the middle out

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
that I've cut a bit in the middle out
and<00:01:10.619> caught<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.280> few<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> boring<00:01:12.090> bits<00:01:12.240> out

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
and caught a few of the boring bits out

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.530 
and caught a few of the boring bits out
just<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.049> enjoy<00:01:13.880> kind<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.090> constant

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
just so you enjoy kind of like constant

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.530 
just so you enjoy kind of like constant
actually<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> could<00:01:16.049> say<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:17.240> friend<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> she

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
actually you could say a friend and she

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
actually you could say a friend and she
gets<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> nice<00:01:18.869> dsr<00:01:19.320> quadfeed<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.040> so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
gets a nice dsr quadfeed in this so

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.490 
gets a nice dsr quadfeed in this so
you'll<00:01:20.340> probably<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.380> it's<00:01:22.380> actually

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you'll probably see that it's actually

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
you'll probably see that it's actually
really<00:01:22.799> nice<00:01:23.009> he<00:01:23.159> catches<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
really nice he catches one on the on the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.700 
really nice he catches one on the on the
spawn<00:01:25.520> next<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.470> can't<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.590> explain

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
spawn next of be I can't really explain

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100 
spawn next of be I can't really explain
where<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.640> there's<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.119> hard<00:01:30.329> point<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
where it is there's a hard point in the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.910 
where it is there's a hard point in the
building<00:01:32.009> next<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> spawn<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:34.560> you'll

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
building next to the spawn but you'll

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.679 
building next to the spawn but you'll
see<00:01:35.100> anyway<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:35.640> i'm<00:01:35.850> pretty<00:01:35.970> sure<00:01:36.210> i<00:01:36.240> run

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
see anyway because i'm pretty sure i run

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
see anyway because i'm pretty sure i run
behind<00:01:36.869> him<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.409> he<00:01:37.890> gets<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> collateral<00:01:38.729> for

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
behind him as he gets the collateral for

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
behind him as he gets the collateral for
the<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.270> coffee<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.810> anyway<00:01:40.500> that's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the for the coffee so anyway that's

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
the for the coffee so anyway that's
that's<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.970> i<00:01:42.600> guess<00:01:43.320> i'll<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:43.619> his

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that's in here so i guess i'll put his
