00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hello, now I will show you more 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.450
 One way to knit Asian spikelet 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.510
 for the sample I scored 3 4 loops and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.930
 knitted the first six rows by power row 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.570
 facial row purl knit further 7 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:30.919
 we take off the edge band and knit it 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:34.560
 six facial 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:38.699
 then we will need to close 18 loops 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.460
 how will we close them working thread 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.660
 at work we remove one loop from the left 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.769
 Knitting needles then throw the working thread 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.519
 on the left knitting needle we remove the second loop 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:56.219
 then return the working thread for work 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:01:00.019
 remove the third loop so that the thread does not 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:05.010
 slid throw the second loop 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:08.370
 through the first one so we closed 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.480
 then remove one loop from the left knitting needle 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:19.410
 loop on the right and the second throw 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:24.660
 through it, this is the second loop; 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.080
 following this we have closed the third 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.080
 noose 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:41.750
 we throw the second loop through the first 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:50.030
 4 5 remove and relocate 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:59.150
 6 7 remove the loop from the left needle and 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:07.910
 throwing a loop through it 8 9 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:14.720
 remove the loop throws 10 remove 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:28.400
 throwing 11 remove the loop 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 throwing 12 13 14 remove the loop 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:38.450
 throwing 15 16 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:50.540
 17 remove the loop and relocate 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:54.090
 18 then loop with the right knitting needle 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:59.310
 we throw on the left we overturn 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.000
 our knitting and since we have closed 18 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.700
 loops now we need to dial them 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.060
 right needle is inserted between the first and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.599
 the second loop captures the working thread and 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.650
 pulling on the left knitting needle 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:19.019
 the first loop is dialed then further between 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.340
 the first and second loop capture 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:29.250
 working thread and take out the loop this 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.209
 the second loop is further between the first and second 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.659
 loop 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.040
 we enter the needle we seize the worker thread and 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:41.569
 draw this third loop so 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.970
 way we need to dial 18 loops 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:48.319
 knitting needle between the first and second loop 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.319
 grab the thread pull out 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.940
 so I scored 18 loops we need 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.360
 dial one more dial 19 this 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.190
 knitwear principle between first and second 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.709
 we enter a needle we pull out a working thread and 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.630
 throwing on the left needle typing in 19 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:25.919
 loops turn over to our work 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:30.840
 then remove the loop from the left needle and 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.840
 throw the second one through it 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.440
 Here we secured our removed loop 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.889
 continue to knit further knit facial 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.889
 loops 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.120
 eighth row overturn work and 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.120
 knit all the purl loops 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.260
 dialed loops too 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
 purl 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.029
 dovyazyvaem series to the end of the purl 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.029
 loops 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:15.379
 here we are knit 8 row 9 row start with 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:19.309
 first knit stitch a series of facial row 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:23.139
 purl rapport pattern we have of eight 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:25.990
 rows and so knit to the desired length 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.029
 Here I got this strip 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.129
 here you can also do arbitrarily on 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:32.240
 I have your discretion around the edges 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:35.900
 eight loops 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.870
 I closed 18 further night weave 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.349
 strips in braids 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:47.110
 the first lane is transferred for the second 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:52.509
 take the second one up and loop 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:56.599
 then push the third through the loop and 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:57.229
 do the next loop and so weave 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:01.839
 Further 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:10.479
 pull the next strip through the loop 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:17.259
 then the next and so weave to the end 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:22.550
 our stripes loop through it 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:29.539
 push the next lane loop further 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:37.959
 again the next lane and this is the braid 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:37.959
 we are able to align below 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.810
 so you can still knit asian 

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.810
 spikelet
