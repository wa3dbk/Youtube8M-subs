00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.920
 we are going to bake sirloin steak 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.280
 one of the most beautiful pieces of meat 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.139
 the cow 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.299
 actually very recognizable by it 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.740
 fat edge and slightly marbled 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.000
 structure is the fat that actually in it 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.500
 in the meat 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.060
 prime rib means nothing but 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.590
 between ribs it is actually a piece 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.650
 what between the ribs is light and has a 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.060
 very full types make it so tasty 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.230
 prepare as possible and to make it as tasty 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.210
 ready to prepare is very bad 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.460
 wise that you have it about 1 or 2 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.839
 days in advance she brings them home 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.740
 can go a little further in the fridge 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.940
 ripe when steak is grilling over 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.100
 you can actually take the best moment 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.150
 rub both sides with that croma 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.250
 you can do the croma with the red one 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.780
 Using cap but was also very good 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.470
 with the green cap because it gives during 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.120
 the grilling 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.910
 beautiful the mild taste of olive oil 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.950
 Your meat is important to you 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.720
 meat quality no time out of the 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.100
 Fridge so put it up a bit 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.080
 temperature what come because that cold 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.610
 prime rib is not tasty to prepare 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.190
 you just need a little temperature 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.810
 come what we prepare the perfect 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.449
 always very important in advance 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.950
 season with a little salt on both 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.790
 sides and some pepper 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.240
 And then you can do it on your own 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:17.170
 taste some more using the fire 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.380
 to 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.940
 high heat paul with a little firm 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.940
 soil can, of course , become warm 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.310
 good dash of croma in the pan 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.700
 little divide croma is brown 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.700
 the meat rod 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.310
 to make a nice both sides to make an order 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 the heat is now also full 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.500
 in the pan 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.820
 that the fat own a bit off it 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.770
 meat and also the layer of fat around it 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.420
 starts caramelizing fashion 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.970
 naturally mixes again with the wire 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.960
 show that really that full taste look how 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.549
 you have to tackle that 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.439
 actually it's best just to put it on 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.090
 both sides equally to cream 2 minutes 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.659
 bake and then continue for 5 minutes 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.200
 yarn 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.799
 so that that beautiful rosÃ© does not shake 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.120
 the pan 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.410
 but gently move your meat one 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.360
 pan through the pan and let it set 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:24.680
 walk again so he really got it 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:26.120
 cut down brown layer you get as in one 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.040
 can bruines then you must of course 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.420
 just turn around 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.709
 play a bit with the fire and sit one 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.760
 slightly lower which can be a bit slower 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.349
 continue 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.420
 and turns race regularly with the 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.739
 meat rod and do not enter the front 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.060
 meat pokes you actually extinguish all 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.319
 juices and sin 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.500

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.840

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.170
 let it cook for a while 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.170
 little aluminum foil 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.070
 cover for two minutes and then 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.070
 we are going to cut pretty thin 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.400

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.400
 explain how it shelf 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.720
 can nicely carve the long knife 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.480
 that bit once the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.980
 Vola perfect prime rib not at all 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.300
 difficult it sounds very complicated 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.680

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.800
