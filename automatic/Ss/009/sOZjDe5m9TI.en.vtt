00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
of booms that have come from there oh my

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:54.000 
of booms that have come from there oh my
gosh<00:00:43.550> see<00:00:44.550> Nate<00:00:45.650> Tatum

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.669 

oh<00:00:54.070> yeah<00:00:54.730> I<00:00:54.969> think<00:00:55.149> what<00:00:55.629> it<00:00:55.780> is<00:00:55.929> I<00:00:56.170> think<00:00:56.500> that

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
oh yeah I think what it is I think that

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.759 
oh yeah I think what it is I think that
is<00:00:56.890> Norco<00:00:57.370> there's<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.699> like<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.059> gas<00:00:58.420> station<00:00:58.839> or

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
is Norco there's a like a gas station or

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.069 
is Norco there's a like a gas station or
something<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.460> has<00:01:00.820> compressed<00:01:01.359> gases<00:01:01.690> that

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
something that has compressed gases that

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.359 
something that has compressed gases that
we<00:01:02.859> buy<00:01:03.070> gases<00:01:03.640> from<00:01:04.140> yonder<00:01:05.280> given<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
we buy gases from yonder given the

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.620 
we buy gases from yonder given the
amount<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.729> explosions<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:07.390> have<00:01:07.540> been

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
amount of explosions that have been

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.090 
amount of explosions that have been
popping<00:01:07.869> from<00:01:08.110> there<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.350> bet<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.710> that's<00:01:08.890> what

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
popping from there I bet you that's what

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.830 
popping from there I bet you that's what
it<00:01:09.189> is<00:01:09.310> if<00:01:09.580> not<00:01:09.820> it's<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.090> gas<00:01:10.270> station<00:01:10.539> or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
it is if not it's a gas station or

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.260 
it is if not it's a gas station or
something<00:01:11.110> else<00:01:11.380> because<00:01:11.590> that's<00:01:11.799> no

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
something else because that's no

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.660 
something else because that's no
structure<00:01:13.270> collapsing<00:01:14.670> man<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:21.310> see<00:01:21.520> it's

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
structure collapsing man as you see it's

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.160

can't be sure I clean Center save marks

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.800 
can't be sure I clean Center save marks
gone<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.370> recycling<00:02:22.910> center<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:23.270> gone

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
gone the recycling center is gone

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.160 
gone the recycling center is gone
Norco<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.920> gas<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:26.030> compressed<00:02:26.390> gas<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:27.020> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
Norco that gas the compressed gas in the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.120 
Norco that gas the compressed gas in the
welding<00:02:27.530> supply<00:02:27.860> store<00:02:28.160> hopes<00:02:29.140> lost<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.410> right

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
welding supply store hopes lost it right

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.600 
welding supply store hopes lost it right
there<00:02:32.410> that's<00:02:33.410> what<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.710> think<00:02:34.010> all<00:02:34.160> them<00:02:34.310> booms

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
there that's what I think all them booms

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.000 
there that's what I think all them booms
are<00:02:37.030> those<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.510> back<00:02:38.780> down<00:02:38.990> that<00:02:39.440> Street

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
are those in this back down that Street

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.640 
are those in this back down that Street
there

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
there

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.000 
there
