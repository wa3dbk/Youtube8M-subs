 envelope 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.140

 this and it's only going to be two points away 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.440
 It's a happy face and we're going to give it 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.120
 install now once installed we will 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.910
 give an error and we will send a 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.060
 good page because I do not put much like 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:29.140
 that since there is no disk located in 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.140
 is in this good operating system 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.450
 ready if we believe us gave us the error in the 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.080
 command to the page we close the page and 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.080
 we give ok 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.700
 let's wait 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:47.130
 ok here if you want to put icon 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.530
 since it does not come with an icon, we are going to give it 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.780
 advanced and we will look for the icon that 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.669
 you have proust and download in 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.440
 the icon's image and they put it on 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.780
 hooks and ready 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.710

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.490
 very necessary good 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.069
 Now it means that it is already created 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.410
 the water with the contents of the install 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:12.110
 we are going to eliminate these two things that 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.050
 they remain on the desk and now very 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.080
 important let's go to our folder 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.030

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.270
 manuel gonzález applications 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.630
 wisekey and here is the forest we are going to 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.110
