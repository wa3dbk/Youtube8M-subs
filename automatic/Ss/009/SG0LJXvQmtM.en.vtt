00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
around 650 kilos and I must admit before

I<00:01:17.830> drove<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.310> car<00:01:18.550> I<00:01:18.610> was<00:01:18.790> expecting<00:01:19.270> all<00:01:19.480> of

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
I drove this car I was expecting all of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.810 
I drove this car I was expecting all of
that<00:01:19.750> mass<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.860> feel<00:01:21.070> like<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.490> was<00:01:21.610> going<00:01:21.760> to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
that mass to feel like it was going to

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.580 
that mass to feel like it was going to
overtake<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.390> front<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:22.870> move<00:01:22.990> around<00:01:23.290> but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
overtake the front and move around but

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.190 
overtake the front and move around but
it<00:01:23.710> contains<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.490> mass<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:24.970> well<00:01:25.240> but

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
it contains that mass so well but

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.750 
it contains that mass so well but
overall<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.950> really<00:01:26.979> well-balanced

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
overall this is a really well-balanced

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.950 
overall this is a really well-balanced
car<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:30.070> really<00:01:30.160> responsive<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:31.270> either

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
car it's really responsive to either

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.230 
car it's really responsive to either
more<00:01:32.260> gas<00:01:32.530> or<00:01:32.770> less<00:01:33.010> gas<00:01:33.310> or<00:01:33.550> more<00:01:33.729> steering<00:01:34.060> or

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
more gas or less gas or more steering or

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.359 
more gas or less gas or more steering or
less<00:01:34.420> doing

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.830 

and<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.789> need<00:01:37.939> that<00:01:38.119> on<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.299> car<00:01:38.539> like<00:01:38.719> this

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
and you need that on a car like this

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.620 
and you need that on a car like this
because<00:01:39.670> everything<00:01:40.670> just<00:01:40.820> happens<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:41.450> much

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
because everything just happens so much

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.929 
because everything just happens so much
faster<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.530> mean<00:01:42.979> here<00:01:43.130> we<00:01:43.250> go<00:01:43.399> on<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.549> XM

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
faster I mean here we go on the XM

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:51.819 
faster I mean here we go on the XM
corner<00:01:44.329> second<00:01:44.750> gear<00:01:44.899> I<00:01:50.259> mean<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.560> just

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
corner second gear I mean that that just

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.080 
corner second gear I mean that that just
felt<00:01:52.009> like<00:01:52.100> there<00:01:52.280> wasn't<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.579> straight<00:01:52.880> there

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
felt like there wasn't a straight there

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.539 
felt like there wasn't a straight there
it<00:01:53.179> felt<00:01:53.390> like<00:01:53.569> we<00:01:53.719> just<00:01:54.100> left<00:01:55.100> from<00:01:55.310> one

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
it felt like we just left from one

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.420 
it felt like we just left from one
corner<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.969> the<00:01:56.090> next

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
it's a cliche and I hate to say it but

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.399 
it's a cliche and I hate to say it but

of<00:05:30.530> Bamako<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:32.499> you<00:05:33.499> get<00:05:33.680> that<00:05:33.800> feeling<00:05:34.069> of

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
of Bamako and you get that feeling of

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.659 
of Bamako and you get that feeling of
hesitation<00:05:36.560> or<00:05:36.650> pause<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.189> then<00:05:37.310> you<00:05:37.460> drop

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
hesitation or pause and then you drop

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.780 
hesitation or pause and then you drop
over<00:05:37.999> the<00:05:38.090> edge

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
over the edge

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.500 
over the edge
