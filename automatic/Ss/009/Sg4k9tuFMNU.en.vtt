300 troops on the field it'll start to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.850 
300 troops on the field it'll start to
lag<00:00:44.030> quite<00:00:44.510> a<00:00:44.540> bit<00:00:44.900> so<00:00:45.170> we're<00:00:45.350> not<00:00:45.470> gonna<00:00:45.620> try

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
to place them all down all at once

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.200 
to place them all down all at once
because<00:00:47.930> each<00:00:48.380> witch<00:00:48.800> summoned<00:00:49.610> skeletons

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210

and<00:00:50.450> that's<00:00:50.630> just<00:00:50.810> gonna<00:00:51.020> create<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.410> big

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
and that's just gonna create a big

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.640 
and that's just gonna create a big
massive<00:00:52.460> lag<00:00:52.970> we<00:00:53.510> may<00:00:53.720> even<00:00:53.750> lag<00:00:54.170> out<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.530> the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
massive lag we may even lag out of the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.090 
massive lag we may even lag out of the
game<00:00:55.420> okay<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:56.480> let's<00:00:56.930> go<00:00:57.230> ahead<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:57.770> attack

they<00:01:07.999> could<00:01:08.060> do<00:01:08.329> and<00:01:08.509> like<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.719> said<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:08.990> don't

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
they could do and like I said I don't

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.050 
they could do and like I said I don't
want<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.469> place<00:01:09.710> too<00:01:10.039> many<00:01:10.249> because<00:01:10.939> the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
want to place too many because the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.520 
want to place too many because the
amount<00:01:11.359> of<00:01:11.420> skeletons<00:01:11.960> they<00:01:12.140> will<00:01:12.289> produce

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
amount of skeletons they will produce

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.830 
amount of skeletons they will produce
will<00:01:12.979> be<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.159> crazy<00:01:13.759> amount

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
will be a crazy amount

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.749 
will be a crazy amount
looks<00:01:15.289> like<00:01:15.409> godson<00:01:15.829> does<00:01:16.039> have<00:01:16.219> an<00:01:16.340> open

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
looks like godson does have an open

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.580 
looks like godson does have an open
space<00:01:17.030> there<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.479> center<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.409> might

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
space there in the center so I might

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.039 
space there in the center so I might
just<00:01:18.619> play<00:01:19.009> some<00:01:19.310> there<00:01:19.670> just<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.630> well<00:01:20.810> maybe

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
just play some there just to well maybe

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.899 
just play some there just to well maybe
throw<00:01:21.469> out<00:01:21.649> a<00:01:21.679> couple<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.219> witches<00:01:22.340> see<00:01:22.759> what

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
throw out a couple of witches see what

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.099 
throw out a couple of witches see what
they<00:01:23.060> could<00:01:23.119> do<00:01:23.420> in<00:01:23.600> there<00:01:23.749> I<00:01:23.780> don't<00:01:23.869> think

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
they could do in there I don't think

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.270 
they could do in there I don't think
they<00:01:24.229> could<00:01:24.289> do<00:01:24.560> anything

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
they could do anything

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.910 
they could do anything
those<00:01:25.850> crossbows<00:01:26.600> are<00:01:26.749> gonna<00:01:26.869> be<00:01:27.109> majorly

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
those crossbows are gonna be majorly

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.520 
those crossbows are gonna be majorly
exhausted<00:01:28.789> and<00:01:28.999> the<00:01:29.659> infernal<00:01:30.139> towers

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
exhausted and the infernal towers

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.410 
exhausted and the infernal towers
because<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.100> inferno<00:01:31.429> towers<00:01:31.700> can<00:01:32.060> only<00:01:32.149> lock

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
because the inferno towers can only lock

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.260 
because the inferno towers can only lock
onto<00:01:32.659> 5<00:01:33.139> targets<00:01:33.499> at<00:01:33.889> a<00:01:33.920> time<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.670> there<00:01:35.179> is

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
onto 5 targets at a time and there is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.410 
onto 5 targets at a time and there is
definitely<00:01:35.990> gonna<00:01:36.170> be<00:01:36.380> more<00:01:36.590> than<00:01:36.740> 5<00:01:36.920> targets

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
definitely gonna be more than 5 targets

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.249 
definitely gonna be more than 5 targets
but<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.539> looks<00:01:38.689> like<00:01:38.810> there's<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.049> couple

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
but it looks like there's a couple

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.200 
but it looks like there's a couple
witches<00:01:39.740> handling<00:01:40.310> themselves<00:01:40.490> over<00:01:41.060> there

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
witches handling themselves over there

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.090 
witches handling themselves over there
on<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.329> bottom-left<00:01:41.749> corner<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:42.859> is<00:01:42.950> a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
on the bottom-left corner this is a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.709 
on the bottom-left corner this is a
pretty<00:01:43.340> nice<00:01:43.549> school<00:01:43.909> base<00:01:44.179> that<00:01:44.420> he<00:01:44.539> has

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
pretty nice school base that he has

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.690 
pretty nice school base that he has
going<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.259> here<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:45.979> we<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:46.130> went<00:01:46.399> ahead<00:01:46.549> and

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
going on here so we just went ahead and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.999 
going on here so we just went ahead and
placed<00:01:46.999> about<00:01:47.329> 50<00:01:47.899> more<00:01:48.170> around<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.649> sides

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
placed about 50 more around the sides

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.010 
placed about 50 more around the sides
and<00:01:49.670> they're<00:01:49.850> gonna<00:01:49.939> see<00:01:50.329> if<00:01:50.450> they<00:01:50.659> could<00:01:50.719> get

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
and they're gonna see if they could get

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.260 
and they're gonna see if they could get
through<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.380> walls<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:52.340> walls<00:01:52.609> is<00:01:52.880> probably

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
through the walls the walls is probably

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.910 
through the walls the walls is probably
gonna<00:01:53.389> be<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.840> biggest<00:01:54.170> goal<00:01:54.560> for<00:01:54.829> these

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
gonna be the biggest goal for these

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.859 
gonna be the biggest goal for these
skeletons<00:01:55.549> just<00:01:56.179> because<00:01:56.420> there<00:01:56.569> are<00:01:56.659> higher

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
skeletons just because there are higher

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.559 
skeletons just because there are higher
level<00:01:57.319> walls<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:58.130> bomb<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.759> definitely

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
level walls that bomb is definitely

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.899 
level walls that bomb is definitely
gonna<00:01:59.749> blow<00:02:00.079> up<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.319> big<00:02:00.590> chunk<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:01.039> them<00:02:01.219> the

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
gonna blow up a big chunk of them the

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.370 
gonna blow up a big chunk of them the
thing<00:02:02.090> with<00:02:02.240> skeletons<00:02:02.779> is<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:03.049> they<00:02:03.200> die

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
thing with skeletons is that they die

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.039 
thing with skeletons is that they die
really<00:02:03.799> fast<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.819> could<00:02:04.969> see<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.299> big<00:02:05.539> large

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
really fast you could see the big large

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.690 
really fast you could see the big large
amount<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.499> skeletons<00:02:06.979> in<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.189> center<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.579> his

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
amount of skeletons in the center of his

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.639 
amount of skeletons in the center of his
base<00:02:07.880> right<00:02:08.119> now<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.049> like<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> white

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
base right now it just is like a white

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.960 
base right now it just is like a white
puddle<00:02:10.099> just<00:02:10.369> moving<00:02:10.789> around<00:02:11.060> his<00:02:11.330> base

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
puddle just moving around his base

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.730 
puddle just moving around his base
and<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.930> still<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:14.330> 368<00:02:15.330> witches<00:02:16.170> left<00:02:16.500> so

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and we still have 368 witches left so

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.020 
and we still have 368 witches left so
we're<00:02:16.890> gonna<00:02:16.980> go<00:02:17.190> ahead<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.460> see<00:02:17.790> where<00:02:17.940> we

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
we're gonna go ahead and see where we

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.340 
we're gonna go ahead and see where we
replace<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.540> we'll<00:02:18.630> play<00:02:18.780> some<00:02:19.020> more<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
replace and we'll play some more on the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.380 
replace and we'll play some more on the
top<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:20.190> looks<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.460> his<00:02:20.640> base<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:21.090> already

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
top it looks like his base is already

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.830 
top it looks like his base is already
about<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.050> get<00:02:22.170> 100<00:02:22.980> percentage<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.300> we're

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
about to get 100 percentage so we're

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.660 
about to get 100 percentage so we're
gonna<00:02:24.960> try<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.230> go<00:02:25.470> ahead<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.890> place<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.370> rest

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
gonna try to go ahead and place the rest

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.550 
gonna try to go ahead and place the rest

all and see how much lag let's just see
how<00:02:30.720> much<00:02:30.870> lag<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.320> could<00:02:31.590> create

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
how much lag we could create

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.130 
how much lag we could create
you<00:02:32.460> can<00:02:32.580> start<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.970> see<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> lag<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.810> starting

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
