description box comics that cost but I'm

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.510 
description box comics that cost but I'm
pretty<00:04:33.930> sure<00:04:34.020> they<00:04:34.650> each<00:04:34.830> cost<00:04:35.100> six<00:04:35.430> dollars

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
pretty sure they each cost six dollars

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.629 
pretty sure they each cost six dollars
all<00:04:36.090> their<00:04:36.360> products<00:04:36.780> usually<00:04:36.990> cost<00:04:37.440> $6<00:04:38.250> so

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
all their products usually cost $6 so

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.520 
all their products usually cost $6 so
$5.99<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.639> purchase<00:04:42.090> them<00:04:42.240> at<00:04:42.389> Walmart<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
$5.99 and I purchase them at Walmart and

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.370 
$5.99 and I purchase them at Walmart and
you<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.490> get<00:04:44.610> them<00:04:44.699> at<00:04:44.820> CVS<00:04:45.240> at<00:04:45.660> Walgreens<00:04:46.289> to

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
get them any drugstore and I think that

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.100 
get them any drugstore and I think that
Walgreens<00:04:49.410> are<00:04:50.180> more<00:04:51.180> expensive<00:04:51.630> they're

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.370 
Walgreens are more expensive they're
seven<00:04:52.650> dollars<00:04:53.070> rather<00:04:53.550> than<00:04:53.760> six<00:04:54.090> dollars<00:04:54.380> so

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
seven dollars rather than six dollars so

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.070 
seven dollars rather than six dollars so
