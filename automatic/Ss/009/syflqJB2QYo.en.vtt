00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello everyone I'm Alejandro Serrano from 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:07.970
 computer science more you can us 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.310
 find in dot dot fish 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.160
 We are the official distributors of the 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:19.830
 brand cradle for Spain and today I am here 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:24.500
 to present you the cradle ts 469 but and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.360
 The ts 4 69 m2 equipments 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.540
 with very good characteristics 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.060
 similar that will surely be a good 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.670
 solution as storage for your 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.770
 company either for storage or 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.579
 also as for storage of 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.159
 Virtual machines 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.089
 both fully certified equipment 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.220
 for an equal 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:50.710
 citrix hyper-v from microsoft 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.140
 this time he has taken two teams very 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.280
 similar but with a difference of 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 quite significant price 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.890
 of 20 percent between this team and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.769
 this team we are talking about about 100 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 euros of difference is the series but 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:13.350
 which incorporates the series front screen 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.149
 that does not incorporate a front screen 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.820
 series but that has a controller 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.420
 internal sata 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.990
 take out the series l that has a 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.370
 controller takes out 2 and another 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.070
 characteristic is that 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.670
 Pro series movie incorporates 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.940
 trays with security key and the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.220
 l series does not incorporate security key 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.700
 for the rest they are managers 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.680
 in the accessories 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.710
 both incorporate the cable 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.710
 feeding 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.759
 network cables 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.719
 cd of basic manual installation and 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.439
 screws for what is the subject of 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.439
 the hard drives 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.630
 the team itself let's take let's say the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.460
 pro 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.730
 to prove it better 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.160
 the equipment itself is a more range equipment 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.350
 high for four hard drives up to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.530
 four terabytes each with which 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.120
 we could have here 16 waxes of 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.330
 total storage 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.920
 with its screen that will indicate 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.580
 exactly the ip it has and the state 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.190
 of the team 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.790
 and on the back what we're going to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.140
 find are the following we see here 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:46.000
 the connection of the current a port 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.090
 vga for maintenance an hdmi port 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.640
 that at this time to date of today 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.130
 is already being tested in beta to be 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.710
 a video output now what 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.570
 will be a learn to commands to 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.810
 distance by which already 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.270
 we will control our videos in our 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.790
 music directly being reproduced 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.560
 on the television and then also 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.750
 It incorporates USB 3.0 ports for 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.610
 connection of external boxes or any 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.900
 another storage device investigate 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.270
 what we have ports usb 2.0 4 country and 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.620
 we want printers external houses 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.230
 any external device that 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.310
 we have because you see two esata ports 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.310
 for the same 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.970
 and two tour network cards 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.770
 these two network cards thanks to their 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.330
 by bowling we are talking about that we 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.730
 they will allow data transfers 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.480
 from around 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.659
 220 megs per second 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.260
 also on both teams both in the 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.260
 as in the pro 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.610
 we can expand memory memory and 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.069
 the equipment these bring from a giga 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.790
 of ddr3 and then in what is the 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.790
 processor brings an intel atom processor 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.750
 dual core dual processor 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.709
 of 2.13 gigahertz memory as 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.680
 he said bring a giga and that memory the 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.130
 we can expand with 2 more gigs to 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.360
 get a total of 3 gigs of memory 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.770
 ram ddr3 you just have to take them out 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.840
 the screws that had the pair in 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.840
 back that you already screamed before we removed 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.900
 and here we have 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.420
 space to insert the card d 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.260
 that memory card 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.260
 otherwise 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.820
 of internal will be pretty clear that we're going 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.190
 here is all this is a team of 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.260
 very high-end 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.310
 and with it we are going to be able not only 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.020
 store them 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.690
 our company data so 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.850
 I'm sure the windows active will 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.240
 directory is going to admit that we work 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.980
 with virtualization will admit everything 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.270
 what is going to be needed 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.270
 for some and much more 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.319
 I think that this is more or less 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.349
 seen what the initial presentation is 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:16.110
 of the kunar 469 teams I hope that 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.449
 you liked it and until next time 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.400
 so I'm Alejandro Serrano from 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:24.500
 computer serra no more you can us 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.500
 find in phase dotcom times
