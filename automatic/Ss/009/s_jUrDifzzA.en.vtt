00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.200 
right there the scarlet ibis was once
native<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.740> this<00:02:11.890> area<00:02:12.100> of<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.340> Caribbean<00:02:12.790> by

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
native to this area of the Caribbean by

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.970 
native to this area of the Caribbean by
the<00:02:13.270> time<00:02:13.510> Richard<00:02:13.750> moved<00:02:14.080> here<00:02:14.320> there<00:02:14.650> wasn't

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
the time Richard moved here there wasn't

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.340 
the time Richard moved here there wasn't
a<00:02:15.250> single<00:02:15.550> one<00:02:15.760> left<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.690> think<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.110> because

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
a single one left I think that because

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.020 
a single one left I think that because
they're<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.620> beautiful<00:02:18.220> they<00:02:18.490> maybe<00:02:18.790> were

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
they're so beautiful they maybe were

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.390 
they're so beautiful they maybe were
killed<00:02:19.330> for<00:02:19.600> their<00:02:19.660> feathers<00:02:20.400> they

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
killed for their feathers they

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.449 
killed for their feathers they
