00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
slipping at least I'm positive that's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.880 
slipping at least I'm positive that's
what<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:36.360> barrel<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
what it's for and the barrel now like I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
said I'd show you guys how the stock

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.149 
said I'd show you guys how the stock
works<00:01:39.390> now<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> call<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> pinless

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
works now it's what I call a pinless

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
works now it's what I call a pinless
stock<00:01:41.579> design<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.110> don't<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> pull

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
stock design so you don't have to pull

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.899 
stock design so you don't have to pull
out<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> pin<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.310> put<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.759> every

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
out the pin and put it back in every

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.280 
out the pin and put it back in every
time<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.420> kind<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:46.159> take<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> stock<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
time you just kind of take the stock and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.700 
time you just kind of take the stock and
you<00:01:49.290> push<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.829> or<00:01:50.790> extend<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.930> without<00:01:52.259> taking

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you push it or extend it without taking

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.740 
you push it or extend it without taking
a<00:01:52.770> pin<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.430> still<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.479> 30

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a pin out and it's still just this 30

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.990 
a pin out and it's still just this 30
and<00:01:54.990> i'll<00:01:55.140> show<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> guys<00:01:55.500> how<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.979> did<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> if

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
and i'll show you guys how I did it if

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.209 
and i'll show you guys how I did it if
you<00:01:57.119> look<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.750> basically<00:01:58.710> took<00:01:58.979> advantage

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you look here I basically took advantage

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.880 
you look here I basically took advantage
of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> flexibility<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.869> Lego<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.560> i<00:02:01.649> push

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of the flexibility of Lego so if i push

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370 
of the flexibility of Lego so if i push
on<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> stock<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:03.090> pops<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.659> site<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:03.930> is

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
on the stock it pops this site out is

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.319 
on the stock it pops this site out is
you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.590> see<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:04.920> where<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> pin<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
you can see that's where the pin is so

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.900 
you can see that's where the pin is so
basically<00:02:06.689> allows<00:02:07.039> movement<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.879> course

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
basically allows movement and of course

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
basically allows movement and of course
there's<00:02:09.330> these<00:02:09.450> holes<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.289> which<00:02:10.500> locks

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
there's these holes in here which locks

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.010 
there's these holes in here which locks
it<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.550> place<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> very<00:02:12.209> simple

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it in place so it's a very simple

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.750 
it in place so it's a very simple
