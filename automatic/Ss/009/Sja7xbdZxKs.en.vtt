00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:13.690
 all entry went dashboard 2 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.270
 pressure gauge diesel water temperature ambassador 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.070
 temperature box 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.480
 a voltmeter on some genera stands here 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.090
 this oil pressure sensor 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.460
 knew how not to and here for some 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.670
 there are digital watches I have here 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.330
 here 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.940
 the speedometer and she number arrow on 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.670
 older models learn t-shirt 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.920
 try to start 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.069
 all the ignition is on so he wound up 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.859
 us so this is the second expectation 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:53.379
 position dazzle shines it 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.479
 position 2 neighbor then we show what 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.429
 different well life far that is 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.780
 standard sections on the car 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:03.609
 not fed and capture the distant it glows 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.579
 these are two pilot lights they 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:11.259
 come on all days ago because 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:16.780
 bus stands handcuffed and because 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:20.530
 open middle door here we 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.850
 all of the warning light here she shows 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.640
 that the door is open milkmen is worth what 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.659
 antifreeze no light comes on if 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.119
 the system goes out shorter here 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.899
 these are all control bulbs further 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.369
 go through the experience button we have the main 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.870
 the panel of buttons is our control 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.030
 the stoves 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.570
 this penny extra me at 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.580
 the driver has 2 speeds this stoves in 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.340
 Salon turns one button 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.800
 This button turns on the forced 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.540
 cabin ventilation 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.240
 in other words, there are no vents but 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.090
 there are four powerful ceiling fans 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.330
 this heated mirrors even photogram 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.970
 to climb in principle 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.840
 the factory icons are saved in full 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.970
 volume is our cabin light too 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.070
 position in the passenger there is half 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.890
 first 1 then burn then 2 prime 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:27.710
 That's honest a bit but for the button I do not know 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.480
 she told me it is not working lamps 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.170
 Such are the passengers so they 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.570
 turn on this button here 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.300
 heated my family hell for the button 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.960
 some doctor pi on 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:46.140
 I have it too 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.860
 push the bus crouches 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.569
 and here I used to have this stub 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.040
 the button itself put it so here 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.550
 pictogram see it from the bulb here 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.230
 shorter here was such a twist 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.300
 electric port received heating 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.190
 Salon then keeps idle 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.880
 force the system to faster 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.540
 warm up 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.220
 I broke down shorter now I 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.670
 the speed is not regular that is constantly 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.700
 is on and for some reason you put the button 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:22.250
 this is our driverâ€™s lighting 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.700
 two buttons 1 this is this one 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.769
 the second button can pill on has too 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.320
 2 position in the middle, you have something in 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.750
 such a position down love he is not 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.700
 lit and turns on as much kassat twist 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.489
 the door here on the door opened, he can be seen 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:45.600
 fired up yes to the front well in the new 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.959
 the position it burns constantly well and the second 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.190
 this one 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.820
 included in the same way 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.510
 next is the door control myth here 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:01.290
 main door control lever 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.829
 william here he manages the middle in front 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.489
 two doors and opened 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:12.600
 here the door went further opens here 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.220
 this door miniguns finely stands the forest 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.829
 the second one pushes open 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.120
 half this way 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.520
 milk, respectively, open 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.540
 the average 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.320
 this is the back door button open 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:30.140
 close see see button 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.710
 opening the door see when on from this 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.030
 the ring is protected from accidentally pressing something 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.980
 there is already here you will not press access 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.320
 sunk 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.320
 closed further is the cabin ventilation 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.440
 heating fan turn on the first 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.510
 speed 2 3 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.590
 blowing usually glass from catch well well ordinary 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.970
 stove how else to call here it goes 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.720
 temporary growth chamomile air goes out 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.870
 upstairs 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.050
 itself and popping and someone 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.380
 to slow down 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.180
 and the valve is forced off 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.630
 the air from the door that is in this 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.390
 the position is audible no he hissed 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.560
 all our doors can calmly and boldly 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.330
 open that is everything without air 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.400
 there is no air in the doorway that is the door 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.310
 open with easy and easy here we are 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.370
 again filed in the world of air 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:34.820
 all here factory stickers on 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.450
 construction seats are well and all of you with this 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.570
 parties 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:44.230
 in principle, our interesting things there 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.230
 this button is a bizim controller 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:50.629
 Well, an hour flashes, this is a pedal error 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:53.539
 brakes all not pressed on mega rocky 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:56.749
 shorter press it counts how many times 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.849
 no light bulb gives this button 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:00.979
 includes 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:09.409
 is it turned on there is this rhetor given 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:11.960
 view gearbox the first case is very 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:17.770
 and porridge will remove all the different plump points 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:20.770
 the doors are closed and you can actually go 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.770
 before 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.599
 while turning off
