real<00:00:30.960> quick<00:00:31.170> go<00:00:31.349> over<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:31.650> outside<00:00:32.040> stuff

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
real quick go over some outside stuff

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.520 
real quick go over some outside stuff
here<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:33.300> we'll<00:00:33.510> get<00:00:33.870> inside<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530

here and then we'll get inside for the
meat<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> stuff<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.219> did<00:00:35.760> include<00:00:36.030> some<00:00:36.300> turrets

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

because<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.550> updates<00:00:38.969> allow<00:00:39.649> for<00:00:40.649> them<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
because the updates allow for them to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250 
because the updates allow for them to
target<00:00:41.100> meteors<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.180> objects<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.960> their<00:00:43.050> own

definitely<00:00:53.039> not<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> military<00:00:53.789> vessel<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
definitely not a military vessel this is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.479 
definitely not a military vessel this is
a<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.410> weak<00:00:55.649> ship<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.160> light<00:00:56.460> armor<00:00:57.410> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
bulkheads are not really crazy just just

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.600

could<00:02:19.350> see<00:02:19.560> some<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.860> conveyor<00:02:20.160> system

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
could see some of the conveyor system

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.570 
could see some of the conveyor system
overhead<00:02:21.500> plugging<00:02:22.500> into<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.890> containers<00:02:23.430> as

take<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> look<00:02:26.730> at<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.530> flight<00:02:28.530> deck<00:02:28.800> there<00:02:29.670> are

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
take a look at the flight deck there are

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.229 
take a look at the flight deck there are

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.600 
into the to the docking outside it's
pretty<00:02:39.630> much<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.959> industrial<00:02:40.500> area<00:02:41.069> here<00:02:41.459> I

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
pretty much the industrial area here I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.759 
pretty much the industrial area here I
did<00:02:42.330> try<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.540> make<00:02:42.720> everything<00:02:42.989> well<00:02:43.350> lit<00:02:43.590> but

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
did try to make everything well lit but

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.190 
did try to make everything well lit but
give<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.069> nice<00:02:44.220> good<00:02:44.430> spacey<00:02:44.910> feel<00:02:45.330> and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
give it a nice good spacey feel and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.740 
give it a nice good spacey feel and

bulldog class mining ships they take

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.920 
bulldog class mining ships they take

care of business hard to control takes a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.900 
care of business hard to control takes a
lot<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.079> skill<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.440> pilot<00:03:01.799> but<00:03:02.040> they<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.790> get

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
lot of skill to pilot but they can get

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.280 
lot of skill to pilot but they can get
into<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> lot<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.209> tight<00:03:03.450> areas<00:03:03.900> once<00:03:04.170> you're

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
into a lot of tight areas once you're

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.080 
into a lot of tight areas once you're
digging<00:03:04.620> really<00:03:05.040> dig<00:03:05.250> some<00:03:05.459> some<00:03:05.700> cool<00:03:05.880> ways

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090

quick show just how slow this sucker is
again<00:06:52.850> it's<00:06:52.970> not<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.180> biggest<00:06:53.480> ship<00:06:53.660> but<00:06:53.900> I

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
again it's not the biggest ship but I

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.960 
again it's not the biggest ship but I
intentionally<00:06:54.650> didn't<00:06:55.250> make<00:06:55.400> it<00:06:55.610> like<00:06:55.820> this

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
intentionally didn't make it like this

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.970 
intentionally didn't make it like this
super<00:06:56.480> maneuverable<00:06:58.150> thing<00:06:59.150> here<00:06:59.920> getting<00:07:00.920> up

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
super maneuverable thing here getting up

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.410

second squared acceleration ruffling

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.850 
second squared acceleration ruffling
something<00:07:04.670> like<00:07:04.790> that<00:07:05.000> about<00:07:05.540> three<00:07:06.350> thousand

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
something like that about three thousand

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.330 
something like that about three thousand
metric<00:07:06.980> tons<00:07:07.160> I<00:07:07.700> mean<00:07:07.820> it's<00:07:08.030> big<00:07:09.190> it's<00:07:10.190> about

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
metric tons I mean it's big it's about

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.700 
metric tons I mean it's big it's about
180<00:07:10.880> meters<00:07:11.240> long<00:07:11.450> and<00:07:11.690> believe<00:07:14.380> I've<00:07:15.380> named

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
180 meters long and believe I've named

180 meters long and believe I've named
it<00:07:15.890> the<00:07:16.040> the<00:07:16.400> opportunity<00:07:16.750> it<00:07:17.800> it's<00:07:18.800> a

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
it the the opportunity it it's a

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.640 
it the the opportunity it it's a
role-playing<00:07:19.220> vessel<00:07:20.000> but<00:07:20.210> also<00:07:20.630> I<00:07:20.840> I<00:07:21.230> sort<00:07:21.560> of

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
role-playing vessel but also I I sort of

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.790 
role-playing vessel but also I I sort of
anticipate<00:07:22.390> doing<00:07:23.390> something<00:07:24.020> with<00:07:24.200> survival

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
anticipate doing something with survival

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.510 
anticipate doing something with survival
in<00:07:24.950> it<00:07:25.990> which<00:07:26.990> is<00:07:27.169> best<00:07:27.410> for<00:07:27.530> roleplay<00:07:27.950> anyway

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 
and with that you know it could

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.690 
and with that you know it could
definitely<00:07:33.590> work<00:07:33.890> out<00:07:34.100> just<00:07:34.130> a<00:07:34.430> nice<00:07:34.580> little

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700
