rummy<00:01:13.930> covered<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:15.000> basically<00:01:16.000> now<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.299> use

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
rummy covered is basically now I use

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.749 
rummy covered is basically now I use
these<00:01:16.780> for<00:01:16.840> list<00:01:17.439> making<00:01:17.710> uh<00:01:17.920> sort<00:01:18.159> of<00:01:18.189> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
these for list making uh sort of the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.210 
these for list making uh sort of the
day-to-day<00:01:19.000> things<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:19.900> mean<00:01:20.049> for<00:01:20.200> example<00:01:20.229> in

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
day-to-day things I mean for example in

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.530 
day-to-day things I mean for example in
carrying<00:01:21.490> machine<00:01:21.700> your<00:01:22.030> answer<00:01:22.329> all<00:01:22.420> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
carrying machine your answer all the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.440 
carrying machine your answer all the
back<00:01:22.720> pages<00:01:23.020> are<00:01:23.320> perforated<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.820> obviously

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
back pages are perforated so obviously

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.069 
back pages are perforated so obviously
that<00:01:25.659> means<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:26.110> it's<00:01:26.799> much<00:01:27.009> easier<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.610> a

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
that means that it's much easier and a

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.600 
that means that it's much easier and a
clean<00:01:29.079> of<00:01:29.290> cuts<00:01:29.590> when<00:01:29.829> you<00:01:29.950> rip<00:01:30.100> them<00:01:30.250> out<00:01:30.369> as

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
clean of cuts when you rip them out as

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.399 
clean of cuts when you rip them out as
you<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.790> see<00:01:30.909> that<00:01:31.119> perfect<00:01:31.420> perforated<00:01:32.259> edge

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
you can see that perfect perforated edge

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.830 
you can see that perfect perforated edge
and<00:01:33.130> basically<00:01:33.700> they're<00:01:33.820> just<00:01:33.850> write<00:01:34.630> down

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
and basically they're just write down

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.539 
and basically they're just write down
whatever<00:01:35.079> I<00:01:35.229> want<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.530> do<00:01:35.619> this<00:01:35.829> week<00:01:36.070> or<00:01:36.310> in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
you they check those pipe see if it'll

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.499 
you they check those pipe see if it'll
still<00:01:41.799> reach<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.729> water<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.240> thank<00:01:43.420> a

still reach to the a water to thank a
lot<00:01:43.540> now<00:01:43.840> there's<00:01:44.049> more<00:01:44.200> boats<00:01:44.439> about<00:01:44.619> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
lot now there's more boats about a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.510 
lot now there's more boats about a
