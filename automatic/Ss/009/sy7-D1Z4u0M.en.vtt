this is the centenary of the world war
one<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.420> how<00:00:55.960> we<00:00:56.020> deal<00:00:56.500> with<00:00:56.800> that<00:00:57.039> historical

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
one and how we deal with that historical

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.760 
one and how we deal with that historical
backdrop<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.480> all<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.899> our<00:00:58.989> cities<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.469> the

changing landscapes of our cities
these<00:01:03.320> waterways<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.820> land<00:01:05.059> is

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
these waterways and the land is

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.880 
these waterways and the land is
connected<00:01:08.240> in<00:01:08.450> history<00:01:09.020> through<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.680> Great

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
connected in history through the Great

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.340 
connected in history through the Great
War<00:01:10.220> it's<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:10.970> test<00:01:11.240> it's<00:01:11.510> an<00:01:11.600> experiment<00:01:12.170> so

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
War it's a test it's an experiment so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.660 
War it's a test it's an experiment so
with<00:01:12.470> all<00:01:12.560> experiments<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.190> can't<00:01:13.430> really

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
with all experiments you can't really

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.820 
with all experiments you can't really
predict<00:01:13.910> what<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.120> outcome<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.450> my<00:01:15.380> instinct

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
predict what the outcome is my instinct

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.110 
predict what the outcome is my instinct
is<00:01:15.890> what<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.430> number<00:01:16.640> of<00:01:16.820> interesting

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
is what we have a number of interesting

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.150 
is what we have a number of interesting
ideas<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.900> then<00:01:18.500> we'll<00:01:18.620> have<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.830> figure<00:01:18.950> out

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
ideas and then we'll have to figure out

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.400 
ideas and then we'll have to figure out
which<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.580> one<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:20.000> fundraise<00:01:20.420> round<00:01:20.720> and

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
which is the one to fundraise round and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.040 
which is the one to fundraise round and
make<00:01:21.680> into<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.010> full<00:01:22.220> project<00:01:22.430> for<00:01:22.670> 2015<00:01:23.270> but<00:01:24.020> I

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
make into a full project for 2015 but I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.870 
make into a full project for 2015 but I
think<00:01:24.200> it's<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.440> experimentation<00:01:25.040> that<00:01:25.550> I'm

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
think it's the experimentation that I'm

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.859 
think it's the experimentation that I'm
most<00:01:26.030> excited<00:01:26.270> about<00:01:26.630> we<00:01:27.229> are<00:01:27.440> collaborating

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
most excited about we are collaborating

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.580 
most excited about we are collaborating
between<00:01:29.869> festivals<00:01:30.530> curators<00:01:31.540> artists

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
between festivals curators artists

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.040 
between festivals curators artists
scientists<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:35.060> outcome<00:01:35.540> is<00:01:35.570> uncertain

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
scientists and the outcome is uncertain

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.420 
scientists and the outcome is uncertain
I<00:01:36.680> just<00:01:37.460> think<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.850> marvelous<00:01:38.740> idea<00:01:39.740> to

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
I just think it's a marvelous idea to

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.070 
I just think it's a marvelous idea to
collaborate<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.360> be<00:01:41.509> creating<00:01:41.990> an

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
collaborate and to be creating an

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.920 
collaborate and to be creating an
artwork<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:43.369> has<00:01:43.610> meaning<00:01:43.880> for<00:01:44.090> people<00:01:44.810> in

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
artwork that has meaning for people in

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.900 
artwork that has meaning for people in
different<00:01:45.080> countries<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:48.700> we've<00:01:49.700> just

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
different countries so we've just

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.999 
different countries so we've just
arrived<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.270> abandon<00:01:50.690> on<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.020> our<00:01:51.530> artists

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
arrived to abandon on and our artists

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.550 
arrived to abandon on and our artists
serve<00:01:52.250> gone<00:01:52.910> into<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.360> studio<00:01:54.320> which<00:01:54.470> is

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
serve gone into the studio which is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.440 
serve gone into the studio which is
going<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.710> be<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.860> hothouse<00:01:55.460> lab<00:01:55.820> for<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.119> next

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
going to be a hothouse lab for the next

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.560 
going to be a hothouse lab for the next
nine<00:01:56.810> days

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.420 

it's<00:02:04.570> been<00:02:04.690> great<00:02:04.810> bringing<00:02:05.590> five<00:02:05.890> artists

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
it's been great bringing five artists

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.830 
it's been great bringing five artists
who<00:02:06.670> don't<00:02:06.910> know<00:02:07.090> each<00:02:07.210> other<00:02:07.390> have<00:02:07.600> very

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
who don't know each other have very

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.419 
who don't know each other have very
different<00:02:08.140> practices<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.890> creating<00:02:09.190> what<00:02:09.340> is

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
different practices and creating what is

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.220 
different practices and creating what is
quite<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.670> robust<00:02:10.060> but<00:02:10.390> also<00:02:10.509> quite<00:02:10.720> respectful

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
quite a robust but also quite respectful

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.210 
quite a robust but also quite respectful
environment<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.460> process<00:02:12.820> being<00:02:13.240> kind

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
environment so that process being kind

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.380 
environment so that process being kind
energizing<00:02:15.220> there<00:02:15.730> now<00:02:15.820> seems<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.270> be

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
energizing there now seems to be

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.460 
energizing there now seems to be
emerging<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.800> really<00:02:18.340> exciting<00:02:19.180> ideas<00:02:19.690> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
emerging to really exciting ideas the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.180 
emerging to really exciting ideas the
two<00:02:20.680> major<00:02:21.190> plans<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.209> have<00:02:22.240> come<00:02:22.450> forward

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
two major plans that have come forward

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.710 
two major plans that have come forward
involves<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> water<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.790> different<00:02:25.510> ways<00:02:25.660> so

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
involves the water in different ways so

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.430 
involves the water in different ways so
in<00:02:26.590> one<00:02:26.920> case<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.730> about<00:02:28.060> moving<00:02:28.390> across<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
in one case it's about moving across the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.640 
in one case it's about moving across the
water<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.220> vessel<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.660> arriving<00:02:32.260> at<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
water in a vessel and arriving at the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.740 
water in a vessel and arriving at the
