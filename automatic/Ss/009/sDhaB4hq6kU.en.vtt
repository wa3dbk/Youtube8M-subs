my news videos now on for today's video
researchers<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.080> developed<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.590> new

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
researchers have developed a new

researchers have developed a new
superconducting<00:00:14.549> wire<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.089> if<00:00:15.960> you're<00:00:16.139> on

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
superconducting wire and if you're on

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.700 
superconducting wire and if you're on
sprint<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.100> want<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.520> iphone<00:00:18.380> pretty<00:00:19.380> good

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
sprint and want the iphone pretty good

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:31.279 
sprint and want the iphone pretty good
news<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.950 

you<00:00:31.859> should<00:00:32.270> researchers<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.449> developed<00:00:33.629> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
you should researchers have developed a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.139 
you should researchers have developed a
wire<00:00:34.140> called<00:00:34.579> superconducting<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.699> Sapphire

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
wire called superconducting the Sapphire

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.020 
wire called superconducting the Sapphire
wires<00:00:36.449> and<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.559> these<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.100> they<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.579> 40

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
wires and what these do are they or 40

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.680 
wires and what these do are they or 40
times<00:00:39.270> more<00:00:39.600> conductive<00:00:40.410> than<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:41.879> copper<00:00:42.449> wire

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
times more conductive than a copper wire

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.549 
times more conductive than a copper wire
and<00:00:44.180> what<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> means<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.809> they're<00:00:46.079> much<00:00:46.290> more

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
and what that means is they're much more

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.500 
and what that means is they're much more
efficient<00:00:47.100> at<00:00:47.280> transferring<00:00:47.820> electricity

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

than<00:00:48.870> copper<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.269> that<00:00:51.269> allows

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
than copper would be and that allows

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.290 
than copper would be and that allows
them<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.190> like<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:53.790> agreeing

just<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.729> even<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> use<00:01:15.360> power<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
just don't even get the use power in

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.530 
just don't even get the use power in

what<00:01:18.689> these<00:01:18.840> wires<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> much<00:01:19.860> more

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
what these wires do it a much more

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
what these wires do it a much more
efficient<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:21.000> transferring<00:01:21.570> power<00:01:21.780> over

distance<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:24.030> allows<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.530> less<00:01:26.100> power

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
distance and that allows the less power

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.149 
distance and that allows the less power
loss<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:27.150> means<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.810> more<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
loss which means you get more use of the

loss which means you get more use of the
electricity<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.380> say<00:01:31.710> how<00:01:31.890> much

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
electricity you have it is say how much

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
electricity you have it is say how much
this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> cost<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.689> would<00:01:33.869> assume

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
this is going to cost but I would assume

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.080 
this is going to cost but I would assume
any<00:01:34.530> new<00:01:34.740> technology<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.550> it's<00:01:35.970> going

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
any new technology like this it's going

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.469 
any new technology like this it's going
to<00:01:36.180> cost<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.570> lot<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.850> sapphire<00:01:38.850> i<00:01:38.880> guess<00:01:39.210> i

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to cost a lot and sapphire i guess i

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
to cost a lot and sapphire i guess i
don't<00:01:39.690> know<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.080> it's<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.710> talking<00:01:41.010> about<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
don't know if it's you talking about the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.220 
don't know if it's you talking about the
stone

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
stone

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.070 
stone
mineral<00:01:42.920> whatever<00:01:43.370> but<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.180> couldn't<00:01:44.750> believe

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
mineral whatever but I couldn't believe

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.410 
mineral whatever but I couldn't believe
it<00:01:45.380> would<00:01:45.800> be<00:01:45.980> very<00:01:46.250> cheap<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.670> make<00:01:46.970> this<00:01:47.210> I

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
it would be very cheap to make this I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.390 
it would be very cheap to make this I
feel<00:01:47.600> like<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:47.930> maybe<00:01:48.680> it's<00:01:48.980> kind<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.280> like

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
feel like it's maybe it's kind of like

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.760 
feel like it's maybe it's kind of like
fiber<00:01:49.670> optics<00:01:50.180> spin<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.170> out<00:01:51.290> kind<00:01:51.650> of<00:01:51.680> like

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
fiber optics spin it out kind of like

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.760 
fiber optics spin it out kind of like
glass<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.130> that's<00:01:52.610> how<00:01:53.510> it<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:53.870> kinda<00:01:54.560> like<00:01:54.620> a

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
glass and that's how it is kinda like a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.980 
glass and that's how it is kinda like a
glass<00:01:55.130> fiber<00:01:55.580> optic<00:01:56.060> kind<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:56.360> wire<00:01:56.540> for<00:01:56.960> a

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
glass fiber optic kind of wire for a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.960 
glass fiber optic kind of wire for a
buck<00:01:57.140> for<00:01:57.350> electricity<00:01:57.770> instead<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.730> light

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
buck for electricity instead of light

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.140 
buck for electricity instead of light
but<00:02:00.070> they<00:02:01.070> have<00:02:01.280> already<00:02:01.550> put<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.730> price<00:02:01.970> on

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
but they have already put a price on

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.880 
but they have already put a price on
them<00:02:02.300> just<00:02:02.330> started<00:02:03.050> developing<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:03.650> but

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
them just started developing this but

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.670 
them just started developing this but
this<00:02:04.100> goes<00:02:04.250> through<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.760> I<00:02:04.850> can<00:02:05.030> Gately<00:02:05.810> make

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
this goes through it I can Gately make

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.880 
this goes through it I can Gately make
