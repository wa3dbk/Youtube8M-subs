trying to flare up and there is a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
trying to flare up and there is a
potential<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:38.010> convection<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.700> develop

southern Indian Ocean now the good news
is<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.070> if<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.489> storm<00:03:44.790> were<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.540> form<00:03:45.810> into

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
is that if that storm were to form into

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.350 
is that if that storm were to form into
a<00:03:46.079> minimal<00:03:46.470> tropical<00:03:46.890> cyclone<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.610> will<00:03:47.940> do<00:03:48.120> so

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
a minimal tropical cyclone it will do so

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.259 
a minimal tropical cyclone it will do so
far<00:03:48.810> away<00:03:48.989> from<00:03:49.170> any<00:03:49.560> coastal<00:03:50.040> communities<00:03:50.610> so

far away from any coastal communities so

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.000 
far away from any coastal communities so
it<00:03:51.390> does<00:03:51.540> not<00:03:51.570> appear<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.049> any<00:03:52.440> additional

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it does not appear that any additional

it does not appear that any additional

ocean<00:03:55.200> once<00:03:55.650> tropical<00:03:56.160> cyclone<00:03:56.579> 5a<00:03:57.209> begins<00:03:57.989> to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
ocean once tropical cyclone 5a begins to

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.650 
ocean once tropical cyclone 5a begins to
diminish<00:03:58.380> if<00:03:58.890> we<00:03:59.610> go<00:03:59.730> ahead<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.000> take<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.329> quick

diminish if we go ahead and take a quick
look<00:04:00.840> at<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.140> latest<00:04:01.320> 00<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.750> ECMWF<00:04:03.750> model

look at the latest 00 of the ECMWF model
we<00:04:04.709> can<00:04:04.860> see<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.130> tropical<00:04:05.700> cyclone<00:04:06.360> 5a<00:04:06.870> is

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
we can see that tropical cyclone 5a is

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.410 
we can see that tropical cyclone 5a is
located<00:04:07.530> in<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.860> Arabian<00:04:08.310> Sea<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.850> then<00:04:09.299> as

development in the South Pacific so the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
tropics are looking somewhat quiet as

tropics are looking somewhat quiet as

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.810 
dissipation within the next 48 to 72
hours<00:04:48.740> so<00:04:49.740> we're<00:04:49.950> going<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.220> go<00:04:50.250> ahead<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.550> use

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
hours so we're going to go ahead and use

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.030 
hours so we're going to go ahead and use
this<00:04:50.970> time<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.270> gear<00:04:51.780> up<00:04:51.840> for<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.590> southern

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
this time to gear up for the southern

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.700 
this time to gear up for the southern
hemisphere<00:04:53.190> cyclone<00:04:54.060> season<00:04:54.510> near<00:04:55.140> Australia

hemisphere cyclone season near Australia

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.710 
hemisphere cyclone season near Australia
again<00:04:55.980> it<00:04:56.310> looks<00:04:56.340> as<00:04:56.610> though<00:04:56.640> we<00:04:57.360> will<00:04:57.480> more

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
again it looks as though we will more

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.390 
again it looks as though we will more
than<00:04:57.840> likely<00:04:57.900> have<00:04:58.320> at<00:04:58.470> least<00:04:58.560> one<00:04:58.890> tropical

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
than likely have at least one tropical

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.000 
than likely have at least one tropical
cyclone<00:04:59.880> it<00:05:00.450> might<00:05:00.900> not<00:05:01.080> necessarily<00:05:01.230> be<00:05:01.650> near

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
cyclone it might not necessarily be near

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.770 
cyclone it might not necessarily be near
Australia<00:05:02.550> but<00:05:02.700> we<00:05:02.850> very<00:05:03.030> well<00:05:03.120> could<00:05:03.270> get<00:05:03.600> one

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
Australia but we very well could get one

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.080 
Australia but we very well could get one
in<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.170> region<00:05:04.560> or<00:05:04.830> somewhere<00:05:05.490> out<00:05:05.700> in<00:05:05.730> the

fairly confident that we will be seeing

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.320 
fairly confident that we will be seeing
