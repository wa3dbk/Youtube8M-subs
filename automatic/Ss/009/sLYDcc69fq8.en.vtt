for the remote start action which I am
going<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.660> hook<00:02:13.750> up<00:02:13.959> still<00:02:15.270> all<00:02:16.270> right<00:02:16.420> hit

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
going to hook up still all right hit

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.330 
going to hook up still all right hit
this<00:02:16.660> preheat<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.380> actually<00:02:17.560> circulates

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
this preheat and it actually circulates

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.510 
this preheat and it actually circulates
fuel<00:02:18.810> Prime's<00:02:19.810> itself<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.620> does<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.160> preheat

-<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:22.840> gonna<00:02:23.020> have<00:02:23.170> them<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.350> counting<00:02:23.680> but

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
- I'm gonna have them in counting but

- I'm gonna have them in counting but
we'll<00:02:23.950> see<00:02:24.100> if<00:02:24.250> it'll<00:02:24.430> fire<00:02:25.150> up<00:02:26.520> now<00:02:27.520> the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
we'll see if it'll fire up now the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:37.320 
we'll see if it'll fire up now the
exhaust<00:02:27.910> points<00:02:28.450> straight<00:02:28.959> down<00:02:35.340> hope<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.730> hit

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
exhaust points straight down hope I hit

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.210 
exhaust points straight down hope I hit

a month I don't know if there's any good
in<00:05:38.550> it<00:05:39.050> he<00:05:40.050> doesn't<00:05:40.350> have<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:40.520> rubber<00:05:41.520> thing

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
in it he doesn't have that rubber thing

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.520 
in it he doesn't have that rubber thing
on<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.000> knob<00:05:42.180> we've<00:05:42.720> got<00:05:42.870> around<00:05:42.960> here

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
on the knob we've got around here

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:51.950 
on the knob we've got around here
breaking<00:05:43.920> out<00:05:47.840> turn<00:05:48.840> now<00:05:50.510> voltage<00:05:51.510> is<00:05:51.660> looking

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
breaking out turn now voltage is looking

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.330 
breaking out turn now voltage is looking
kind<00:05:52.170> of<00:05:52.290> low<00:05:52.410> I<00:05:52.680> don't<00:05:52.830> know<00:05:52.920> if<00:05:52.980> this<00:05:53.100> one's

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
kind of low I don't know if this one's

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.270 
kind of low I don't know if this one's
gonna<00:05:53.460> go<00:05:53.700> or<00:05:53.820> that<00:05:54.620> voltage<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.830> over<00:05:56.130> there

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
gonna go or that voltage is over there

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.120 
gonna go or that voltage is over there
see<00:05:56.600> like<00:05:57.600> nine<00:05:57.840> and<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:58.110> half<00:05:58.140> that<00:05:58.590> thing<00:05:58.800> says

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
see like nine and a half that thing says

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:09.410 
see like nine and a half that thing says
oh<00:06:02.180> now<00:06:03.180> that<00:06:03.210> thing<00:06:03.540> pops<00:06:03.750> over<00:06:08.180> all<00:06:09.180> right

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
oh now that thing pops over all right

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:19.030 
oh now that thing pops over all right
here<00:06:09.690> goes

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.750 

we'll<00:06:20.040> try<00:06:20.250> that<00:06:20.280> again<00:06:25.310> yeah<00:06:26.310> if<00:06:26.370> you<00:06:26.460> go<00:06:26.580> the

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
we'll try that again yeah if you go the

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.700 
we'll try that again yeah if you go the
jumper<00:06:27.090> cables<00:06:27.450> of<00:06:27.570> this<00:06:27.690> thing

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.860 

I'm<00:06:32.280> not<00:06:32.400> liking<00:06:32.610> the<00:06:32.790> cold<00:06:33.000> weather<00:06:33.210> area

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.850 

probably<00:06:36.870> pissed<00:06:37.170> off<00:06:37.350> that's<00:06:37.590> being

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
probably pissed off that's being

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:46.520 
probably pissed off that's being
neglected<00:06:44.450> buh<00:06:45.450> yeah

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530

we have to jump this one yeah I'm

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.890 
we have to jump this one yeah I'm
getting<00:06:49.590> tired<00:06:49.770> of<00:06:49.950> doing<00:06:50.070> this<00:06:50.540> jumper<00:06:51.540> cable

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
getting tired of doing this jumper cable

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.570 
getting tired of doing this jumper cable
alright<00:06:52.110> jumper<00:06:52.530> cable<00:06:52.890> DUP<00:06:53.040> let's<00:06:53.310> see<00:06:53.460> what

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
alright jumper cable DUP let's see what

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
alright jumper cable DUP let's see what
this<00:06:53.670> thing<00:06:53.880> does

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.150 

I'm<00:07:00.600> not<00:07:00.870> really<00:07:01.020> reading<00:07:01.260> anymore<00:07:01.500> bolts

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
I'm not really reading anymore bolts

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:26.629 
I'm not really reading anymore bolts
maybe<00:07:02.880> a<00:07:02.910> little<00:07:03.090> more<00:07:15.110> all<00:07:16.110> right<00:07:16.260> try<00:07:16.530> that

oh<00:07:26.669> yeah<00:07:27.300> there's<00:07:27.539> the<00:07:27.840> run<00:07:28.050> machine<00:07:29.659> that's

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:30.659 
oh yeah there's the run machine that's
