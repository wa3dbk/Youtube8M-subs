x 16 to buy one so that's your key that

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:16.480 
x 16 to buy one so that's your key that
goes<00:05:05.970> in<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.930> little<00:05:10.230> plot<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:12.200> that<00:05:13.200> is<00:05:13.350> that

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.600 

these<00:05:17.630> are<00:05:18.630> going<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:19.020> go<00:05:19.200> down<00:05:20.100> on<00:05:20.280> us<00:05:20.520> like

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
these are going to go down on us like

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.080 
these are going to go down on us like
this<00:05:22.250> seven<00:05:23.250> by<00:05:23.400> one<00:05:23.430> thing<00:05:24.590> can<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:25.620> put<00:05:26.090> next

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
this seven by one thing can you put next

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.250 
this seven by one thing can you put next
to<00:05:27.300> this<00:05:27.650> unique<00:05:28.650> slant<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.850> some<00:05:30.090> tiles<00:05:30.360> this

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
to this unique slant and some tiles this

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.670 
to this unique slant and some tiles this
is<00:05:31.440> a<00:05:31.470> slant<00:05:31.860> piece<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:33.300> goes<00:05:33.630> down<00:05:34.140> so<00:05:34.530> it

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
is a slant piece it goes down so it

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.530 
is a slant piece it goes down so it
shoots<00:05:34.860> you<00:05:35.040> candy<00:05:35.370> out<00:05:35.400> through<00:05:35.700> there<00:05:35.850> need

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
shoots you candy out through there need

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.020 
shoots you candy out through there need
some<00:05:36.750> flat<00:05:37.020> pieces<00:05:37.230> I<00:05:37.590> want<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.250> do<00:05:38.340> is<00:05:38.370> take<00:05:38.730> a

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
some flat pieces I want to do is take a

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.010 
some flat pieces I want to do is take a
three<00:05:40.020> by<00:05:40.170> one<00:05:40.850> appeared<00:05:41.850> and<00:05:42.390> you<00:05:42.510> put<00:05:42.780> that

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
three by one appeared and you put that

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.740 
three by one appeared and you put that
and<00:05:43.670> so<00:05:44.670> it'll<00:05:44.880> look<00:05:44.910> like<00:05:45.560> that<00:05:47.030> you<00:05:48.030> do<00:05:48.510> that

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
what I use is going for everyone so it

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.790 
what I use is going for everyone so it
should<00:06:05.610> look<00:06:05.700> like<00:06:07.130> that<00:06:08.840> so<00:06:09.840> see<00:06:10.260> those<00:06:10.440> Reds

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
should look like that so see those Reds

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.150 
should look like that so see those Reds
those<00:06:11.370> are<00:06:11.580> all<00:06:11.670> lined<00:06:11.940> up<00:06:12.260> so<00:06:13.260> the<00:06:13.770> candy

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
those are all lined up so the candy

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.790 
those are all lined up so the candy
doesn't<00:06:14.370> like<00:06:14.790> go<00:06:15.030> to<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.210> side<00:06:15.650> so<00:06:16.650> that

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
doesn't like go to the side so that

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.110 
doesn't like go to the side so that
keeps<00:06:16.980> the<00:06:17.160> candy<00:06:17.430> from<00:06:17.550> falling<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.090> side

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
keeps the candy from falling to the side

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.760 
keeps the candy from falling to the side
and<00:06:19.460> that<00:06:20.460> is<00:06:20.910> how<00:06:21.900> all<00:06:21.930> the<00:06:22.320> pieces<00:06:22.470> are

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
and that is how all the pieces are

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.600 
and that is how all the pieces are
together<00:06:22.980> show<00:06:23.430> you<00:06:23.490> need<00:06:23.880> is<00:06:24.480> key<00:06:25.340> this<00:06:26.340> piece

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
together show you need is key this piece

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.260 
together show you need is key this piece
this<00:06:27.480> mechanism<00:06:28.130> and<00:06:29.130> you'll<00:06:29.580> need<00:06:29.730> this<00:06:29.970> like

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
this mechanism and you'll need this like

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.930 
this mechanism and you'll need this like
this<00:06:30.480> you<00:06:30.660> just<00:06:30.690> have<00:06:31.020> to<00:06:31.140> make<00:06:31.320> it

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
this you just have to make it

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.110 
this you just have to make it
hole<00:06:32.930> right<00:06:33.170> there<00:06:33.230> pull<00:06:34.130> there<00:06:34.340> and<00:06:34.700> hold

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
hole right there pull there and hold

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.380 
hole right there pull there and hold
there<00:06:35.330> just<00:06:36.200> like<00:06:36.350> that<00:06:36.560> this<00:06:37.310> part<00:06:37.730> takes<00:06:38.180> the

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
there just like that this part takes the

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.290 
there just like that this part takes the
longest<00:06:38.750> but<00:06:39.710> it's<00:06:40.520> still<00:06:40.760> pretty<00:06:40.820> easy<00:06:41.150> you

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
longest but it's still pretty easy you

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.620 
longest but it's still pretty easy you
just<00:06:41.330> gotta<00:06:41.660> make<00:06:41.840> it<00:06:41.900> block<00:06:42.820> so<00:06:44.950> okay<00:06:46.630> that's

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
just gotta make it block so okay that's

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.510 
just gotta make it block so okay that's
