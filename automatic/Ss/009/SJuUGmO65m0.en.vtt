select<00:02:18.780> spies<00:02:18.960> because<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.470> guys<00:02:19.650> know

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
select spies because as you guys know

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.170

this<00:02:19.950> weapon<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.340> actually<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.700> burst<00:02:20.970> fire

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
this weapon is actually a burst fire

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.030 
this weapon is actually a burst fire
weapon<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:22.290> me<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.530> don't<00:02:22.740> really<00:02:22.890> think

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
weapon and for me I don't really think

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.550 
weapon and for me I don't really think
buzz<00:02:23.400> fire<00:02:23.610> weapons<00:02:23.970> are<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.210> best<00:02:24.560> mainly

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
buzz fire weapons are the best mainly

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.140 
buzz fire weapons are the best mainly
just<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:25.770> my<00:02:26.100> accuracy<00:02:26.490> isn't<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:26.970> good

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
just because my accuracy isn't as good

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.120 
just because my accuracy isn't as good
as<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.330> want<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.660> be<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:28.410> depending<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.010> your

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
as I want it to be but depending on your

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.500 
as I want it to be but depending on your
trigger<00:02:29.400> finger<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.910> might<00:02:30.090> actually<00:02:30.180> be

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
trigger finger you might actually be

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.000 
trigger finger you might actually be
able<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.750> use<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.020> weapon<00:02:31.200> inverse<00:02:31.680> Fourier

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
able to use this weapon inverse Fourier

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.040 
able to use this weapon inverse Fourier
but<00:02:32.670> personally<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.210> always<00:02:33.510> switch<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
but personally I always switch is the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.650 
but personally I always switch is the
full<00:02:34.650> auto<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.520> therefore<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.240> just<00:02:36.390> spray

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
full auto and therefore I can just spray

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.230 
full auto and therefore I can just spray
enemy<00:02:36.990> down<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.380> get<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.560> kill<00:02:38.010> now<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> lot

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
enemy down and get that kill now a lot

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.030 
enemy down and get that kill now a lot
of<00:02:39.270> people<00:02:39.360> might<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:40.020> worried<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.380> this

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
of people might be worried that this

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.650 
of people might be worried that this
weapon<00:02:41.370> might<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:41.700> more<00:02:41.940> repo<00:02:42.300> one<00:02:42.480> issue

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
weapon might have more repo one issue

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.140 
weapon might have more repo one issue
with<00:02:43.170> full<00:02:43.440> auto<00:02:43.710> but<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.700> assure<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.940> guys

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
with full auto but I can assure you guys

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.880 
with full auto but I can assure you guys
that<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.450> recall<00:02:45.810> doesn't<00:02:46.230> change<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.680> all

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
that the recall doesn't change at all

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.770 
that the recall doesn't change at all
and<00:02:47.250> even<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.760> does<00:02:47.940> changes<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.540> bare

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
and even if it does changes the bare

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.330 
and even if it does changes the bare
minimum<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.260> you'll<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.620> able<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.770> notice<00:02:50.160> it

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
minimum and you'll be able to notice it

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.190 
minimum and you'll be able to notice it
but<00:02:50.940> if<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.210> that<00:02:51.360> laser<00:02:51.630> sight<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
but if you have that laser sight on the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.660 
but if you have that laser sight on the
record<00:02:52.560> will<00:02:52.680> be<00:02:52.800> reduced<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.250> little<00:02:53.430> bit

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
record will be reduced a little bit

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.800 
record will be reduced a little bit
because<00:02:53.820> you'll<00:02:54.060> be<00:02:54.090> shooting<00:02:54.420> from<00:02:54.600> hip<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
because you'll be shooting from hip a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.660 
because you'll be shooting from hip a
lot<00:02:55.050> more<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.500> therefore<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.340> accuracy

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
lot more and therefore your accuracy

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.600 
lot more and therefore your accuracy
will<00:02:56.940> increase<00:02:57.330> as<00:02:57.570> well<00:02:57.980> next<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.100> fast<00:02:59.400> man

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
will increase as well next is fast man

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.400 
will increase as well next is fast man
now<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.210> merry<00:03:00.480> enough<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.840> snuggie<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.320> you

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
now the merry enough a snuggie so you

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.020

really do need tactical mask and that's
the<00:04:56.760> main<00:04:56.940> reason<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.330> use<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.780> because<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.410> just

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
the main reason I use it because it just

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.260 
the main reason I use it because it just
it's<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.890> big<00:04:59.100> lifesaver<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.850> you<00:04:59.970> can<00:05:00.090> get

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
it's a big lifesaver and you can get

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.060 
it's a big lifesaver and you can get
your<00:05:00.450> digis<00:05:00.900> situations<00:05:01.350> video<00:05:01.680> too<00:05:01.830> quickly

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
your digis situations video too quickly

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.070 
your digis situations video too quickly
and<00:05:02.370> therefore<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.150> helps<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:03.450> win<00:05:03.600> gun<00:05:03.840> fires
