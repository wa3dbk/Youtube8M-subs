 there is some truth in this joke 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.390
 manned space really 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.509
 started like a dog 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.879
 the public back the whole world learned the daily

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.370
 Khrushchev 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.840
 but for them their dog 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.240
 the naturalness of the place is a genuine scarecrow 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.620
 these animals the way to the stars man 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.750
 the position today of living beings 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.260
 special place in the history of astronautics 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.000
 Further ordinary classes Kabule unpretentious

 primary requirements 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.100
 and more than six kilos just not 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.890
 above 35 centimeters due to the size of the ship 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.950
 satellite is best seen in 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.280
 lens 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.500
 when preparing the flight of dogs for the whole day 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 collected in cramped cells meet 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.780
 confined space 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.979
 future spacecraft 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.829
 strapped on belts drew on 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.530
 the centrifuge was tested by our 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.719
 resistance was subjected to various 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.369
 medical facility the same rate was 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.690
 justified 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.690
 practically no one can be proud 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.799
 knowledge level 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.100
 man's first flight was 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.250
 to be medically able 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.380
 view guarantees freedom 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.320

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.619
 suggested founder 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.460
 space medicine academician oleg 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.130
 Kosenkov 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.850
 unlike the Americans who 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.110
 prepared to do the main flight 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.030
 argument of Soviet scientists physiology 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.640
 Dog studied still academician Pavlova 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.009
 and most importantly, even less if the person 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.240
 and easier to train 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.150
 in the last days of his life among them 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.390
 one suffered one of his favorites 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.430
 insofar as 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.219
 but sometimes unwittingly 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.229
 but as inconvenient with errors 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.840
 the only thing that is unpleasant is she is very 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.849
 cautious due to both precursors 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.950
 they say here will be paid 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.919
 is engaged 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.120
 Here is an opinion So here they are gone cat 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.209
 it's good 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.849
 twenty second of december 1962 only 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.959
 together with colleagues what we went 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:28.849
 into orbit 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.299
 as a result of carrier rocket east 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.829
 an accident happened the descent vehicle 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.159
 officials completed an emergency landing they 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.479
 covered up Russia completely 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.239
 sniffer dogs 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.889
 Oleg Kosenkov gathered hundreds of people the rest 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.329
 there is no life for laying 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.959
 Today, space dogs do not fly 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.280
 making recess use insects 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.780
 birds came out and brandies however many 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.029
 astronauts keeping watch in orbit 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.659
 do not mind to be near him in Moscow 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.579
 total 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.639
 no flow writes so four-legged friend
