00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.670 
is not fully fit as I said maybe stop
the<00:05:26.210> game<00:05:26.389> because<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:26.990> do<00:05:27.050> think<00:05:27.409> he<00:05:27.500> looks

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
the game because I do think he looks

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.100 
the game because I do think he looks
like<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.830> play<00:05:28.099> that's<00:05:28.219> motivated<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.479> maybe

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
like a play that's motivated and maybe

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.360 
like a play that's motivated and maybe
we<00:05:30.229> could<00:05:30.380> see<00:05:30.500> two<00:05:30.650> up<00:05:30.770> front<00:05:30.919> I<00:05:31.130> mean<00:05:31.280> that's

we could see two up front I mean that's

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.159 
we could see two up front I mean that's
time<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:31.639> think<00:05:31.909> people<00:05:32.030> keep<00:05:32.389> asking<00:05:32.570> me<00:05:32.840> and
