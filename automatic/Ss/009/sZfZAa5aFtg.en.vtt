00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
it's it's a good engine but it just

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
which is a turbo engine from the factory

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.009 
which is a turbo engine from the factory
will<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:07.740> fun<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.479> right<00:02:09.630> now<00:02:09.660> it's

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
will be a lot more fun so right now it's

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.449 
will be a lot more fun so right now it's
just<00:02:10.170> pretty<00:02:10.739> much<00:02:10.920> stuck<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:11.519> still<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:14.250> car

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
just pretty much stuck but still the car

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:23.860 
just pretty much stuck but still the car
still<00:02:14.700> fun<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.880> drive<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:18.799> then<00:02:19.799> a<00:02:19.860> side<00:02:20.130> shot

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.559 

this<00:02:25.190> trunk<00:02:26.190> lock<00:02:26.370> actually<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.030> pretty<00:02:27.120> rare

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
this trunk lock actually is pretty rare

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.809 
this trunk lock actually is pretty rare
and<00:02:29.510> it's<00:02:30.510> pretty<00:02:30.630> hard<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.580> it's<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
and it's pretty hard to get it's the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.729 
and it's pretty hard to get it's the
square<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:34.190> but<00:02:35.190> usually<00:02:35.549> sees<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:37.410> oval

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
square one but usually sees the the oval

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.720 
square one but usually sees the the oval
one<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.310> think<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:38.790> much<00:02:38.850> better

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.699 

I'm<00:02:42.209> gonna<00:02:42.360> go<00:02:42.420> ahead<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.599> finish<00:02:42.870> off<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
I'm gonna go ahead and finish off the

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.320 
I'm gonna go ahead and finish off the
video<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:45.049> little<00:02:46.049> engine<00:02:46.409> revs<00:02:46.879> and<00:02:47.879> then

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
