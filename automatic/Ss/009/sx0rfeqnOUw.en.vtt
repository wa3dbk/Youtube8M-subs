00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.300
 I hope by means of this small image of this tiny animations 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.369
 allow you to understand 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.960
 the differences that exist between them 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.369
 different perspectives 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.279
 in any case those that interest the designer 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 the fine art draftsman 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.949
 I also hope that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.240
 this animation will definitely clarify 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.620
 the question of vertical lines that sometimes remain vertical to the quine the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.750
 stays apart 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.900
 you noticed that when you look 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.429
 a building by far 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.879
 the verticals are vertical and that when you stand at the foot of this 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.300
 crowd building look from below 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.210
 the lines the partner of bié 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 and seem to meet in the sky 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.200
 there are other kinds of perspective for example the action perspective 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.170
 metric 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.950
 but it does not interest us in fine arts or not 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.980
 directly 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.370
 and I'm going to focus only on troyes form the most 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.140
 widespread 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.120
 so what may seem a little bit curious in this picture is 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.500
 that light assembly 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.800
 in reality 3by hippie head who but can not you appear 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.380
 exactly like that in reality since 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.750
 they come from many different points of view 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.270
 I gathered them in one image to certify and you see that 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.870
 on the street the current angle of view 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.010
 lévy 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.800
 glaringly 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.660
 parte glass a point on a skyline that one can easily 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.679
 imagine it's pretty much 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.749
 below the upper cube 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.650
 everything indicates that it is vertical tell stably on this image remains 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.270
 vertical 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 we are in the classic because of the frontal perspective of the most 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.210
 front 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420
 it is frontal because the stops 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.509
 the same who farted her or strait by pipettes 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.320
 its all parallel amount 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.840
 perpendicular to our visual ray 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.810
 but never 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.979
 they have an angle 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.979
 than 2 0 or 90 degrees 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.549
 here the two similar pipette left 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.579
 he was turned souza our angle 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.119
 things would be completely different and that's what we're going 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.949
 watch 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.929
 but we see right away that 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.669
 the edges that 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:28.699
 pt 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.019
 be perpendicular evening 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.979
 parallel to our visual ray 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.390
 felt an angle 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.789
 now 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:36.829
 eyi 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.059
 suddenly 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.219
 instead of having a single vanishing point on the horizon 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.589
 two points away 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.769
 if you are still on the same horizon 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.799
 placed the two different places right then left of the object that 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.239
 we are looking at 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.079
 hilarious one is entering the so-called angular perspective because the 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.089
 stopped 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.819
 me of the object that we look at either 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.649
 of parallelism or perpendicularity with our gaze 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.299
 however 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.949
 and vertical 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:14.099
 continuous master perpendicular to our official arrival that's why 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.529
 in the present case 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.809
 it's worship 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.439
 stay with verticals draw vertically 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.540
 notice that heavier horse betting 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.099
 from left auckland and many more 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.859
 strong compared to our look that the angle of the horse betting head 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.309
 always left 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.309
 that's why the mergers that come together in that batch 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.919
 at points away we can guess by following the arrows visually 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.710
 one of the points relatively close to the foot 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.500
 while on the bottom one the vanishing point faces finding extremely 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.110
 remote vehicles arrows are almost parallel Thursday almost are not 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.289
 not necessarily since an angle 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:59.209
 they will join when with this angle 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.409
 they will be affected by an author that we right for the arrows as of 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.220
 right 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.660
 meet, that is to say relatively to the screen where they are 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.449
 currently 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.589
 which means very far 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:13.589
 we can still have a third scenario 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.379
 first look at the butter cube 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:22.750
 he continues his rotation so as to have like the kuduro previously a 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.300
 angle is marked 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.240
 look at the cube desk 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.050
 change of rotation angle 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.400
 again look at the ass above 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 he switches 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.639
 and that's the answer to your question 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.949
 Cuba 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.669
 a guard a vertical ridge 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.610
 while veal worship 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.860
 it's not having counted vertical leaking also that is to say that 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.029
 in the cube 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:59.270
 there is only but fleeting you have no parallel and no 

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.620
 perpendicular 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.130
 your greatest visionary 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.419
 and suddenly you only have one parallel to the edge of your sheet 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.259
 micro vertical edge nico horizontal edge 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.879
 this is called a perspective 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.849
 three points in a row 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.400
 we often call a henriette perspective because it's often 

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:21.150
 when you are on a plane 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.990
 or when looking at objects of very good convoy 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.990
 this kind of things 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.830
 to var to capitulate all that quietly 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.210
 keeping the cubes 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.419
 the first 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.699
 is in frontal perspective there are full on the point of flight 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.249
 the lines fleeing rente its parallel 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.650
 to our visual radius 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.349
 the verticals of the shot 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.160
 rest 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.539
 vertical 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.779
 the second is from the popular perspective 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.789
 they have an angle to our visual radius 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.899
 and these mergers of funds in the direction of the arrows that I you 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.169
 shows on this drawing 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.500
 the verticals remains vertical because 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.330
 the verticals antoine angles 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.330
 perpendicular our visual ray 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.349
 third cubes 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.199
 this time it is tipped in the es3 direction 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.100
 and suddenly 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.689
 there are three points in a row 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:23.749
 these three points away is heading in they are arrows that the present 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:24.860
 on this dessert 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.719
 this perspective is called perspective 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.719
 wrote m 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.770
 if you do not understand this explanation we know you're at 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.819
 almost normally constituted 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.059
 however 6 by listening to this video two or three times you do understand 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:43.639
 still not there then there is only one solution 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.689
 these follow the course follows more complete or all that will be detailed 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:49.649
 shelled 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.789
 I believe in 16 modules 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.580
 so you can understand all that without any difficulty 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.849
 by the gentle method 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:58.550
 see you soon
