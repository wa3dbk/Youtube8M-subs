yes<00:02:13.810> incredible<00:02:14.110> but<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.650> wonder<00:02:15.070> if<00:02:15.100> he<00:02:15.340> signed

we<00:02:20.620> care<00:02:20.860> who<00:02:21.160> cares<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:21.820> what<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.510> what<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.080> want

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
we care who cares but what I what I want

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.960 
we care who cares but what I what I want
to<00:02:23.500> do<00:02:23.710> real<00:02:23.950> quickly<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.370> just<00:02:24.400> differentiate

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
to do real quickly is just differentiate

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.670 
to do real quickly is just differentiate
between<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.630> use<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.810> things<00:02:26.140> like<00:02:26.290> drones

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
between the use of things like drones

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.500 
between the use of things like drones
and<00:02:27.160> autonomous<00:02:27.730> weaponry<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.360> with

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
and autonomous weaponry so with

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.170 
and autonomous weaponry so with
autonomous<00:02:29.080> weaponry<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:30.130> not<00:02:30.400> attached<00:02:30.940> to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
autonomous weaponry it's not attached to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.450 
autonomous weaponry it's not attached to
a<00:02:31.210> human<00:02:31.540> being<00:02:31.690> at<00:02:31.930> all<00:02:31.960> okay<00:02:32.770> its<00:02:32.920> autonomous

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
a human being at all okay its autonomous

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.610 
a human being at all okay its autonomous
so<00:02:33.910> with<00:02:34.150> drones<00:02:34.600> we<00:02:34.930> already<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.350> an<00:02:35.470> issue

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
so with drones we already have an issue

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.310 
so with drones we already have an issue
with<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.880> know<00:02:37.000> killing<00:02:37.330> people<00:02:37.780> being<00:02:37.990> less

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
with you know killing people being less

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.980 
with you know killing people being less
personal<00:02:38.860> you're<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.910> remote<00:02:40.180> location<00:02:40.360> use

personal you're in a remote location use

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.930 
personal you're in a remote location use
a<00:02:41.020> drone<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.680> boom<00:02:42.010> they're<00:02:42.280> being<00:02:42.430> overly

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
a drone and boom they're being overly

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.120 
a drone and boom they're being overly
utilized<00:02:43.870> innocent<00:02:44.380> people<00:02:44.590> are<00:02:44.680> dying<00:02:44.830> as<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
utilized innocent people are dying as a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.860 
utilized innocent people are dying as a
result<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.270> autonomous

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
result of that if you have autonomous

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.570 
result of that if you have autonomous
weaponry<00:02:47.350> there<00:02:47.590> are<00:02:47.680> no<00:02:47.770> people<00:02:48.100> attached<00:02:48.340> to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
weaponry there are no people attached to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.500 
weaponry there are no people attached to
it<00:02:48.700> at<00:02:48.850> all

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
it at all

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.780 
it at all
which<00:02:49.840> takes<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.350> morality<00:02:51.310> out<00:02:51.520> of

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
which takes the morality out of

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.060 
which takes the morality out of
something<00:02:52.300> as<00:02:52.480> serious<00:02:52.900> as<00:02:53.230> killing<00:02:53.560> someone

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
something as serious as killing someone

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.790 
something as serious as killing someone
yeah<00:02:54.880> no<00:02:55.150> we<00:02:55.300> can't<00:02:55.570> have<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.990> it's<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:56.530> there

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
yeah no we can't have it it's it's there

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.500 
yeah no we can't have it it's it's there
absolutely<00:02:57.100> right<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.670> part<00:02:58.270> of<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.450> is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
absolutely right that part of it is

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.240

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
and they show you how the robot can go

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.270 
and they show you how the robot can go

the secret portion we'll take the
Defense<00:03:22.900> Secretary<00:03:23.459> back<00:03:24.459> where<00:03:24.700> there<00:03:24.820> are

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
Defense Secretary back where there are

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.520 
Defense Secretary back where there are
no<00:03:25.090> reporters<00:03:25.510> then<00:03:25.959> they<00:03:26.110> show<00:03:26.290> him<00:03:26.410> how<00:03:26.470> the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
no reporters then they show him how the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.570 
no reporters then they show him how the
robots<00:03:26.890> can<00:03:27.040> kill<00:03:27.220> people<00:03:27.580> hey<00:03:28.360> so<00:03:29.010> look<00:03:30.010> it's

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
robots can kill people hey so look it's

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.190 
robots can kill people hey so look it's
behind<00:03:30.970> closed<00:03:31.209> doors<00:03:31.450> there<00:03:31.630> was<00:03:31.720> some

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
behind closed doors there was some

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.900 
behind closed doors there was some
assumptions<00:03:32.740> made<00:03:32.890> in<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.130> earlier<00:03:33.459> report

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
assumptions made in that earlier report

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.790 
assumptions made in that earlier report
but<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.570> think<00:03:34.810> they're<00:03:34.900> wholly<00:03:35.140> merited<00:03:35.650> and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
but I think they're wholly merited and

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.170 
but I think they're wholly merited and
these<00:03:35.980> guys<00:03:36.160> think<00:03:36.430> they<00:03:36.520> are<00:03:36.610> only<00:03:36.760> merited

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
these guys think they are only merited

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.870 
these guys think they are only merited
so<00:03:37.630> separate<00:03:38.140> out<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.650> non<00:03:38.950> killing<00:03:39.459> robots

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
so separate out the non killing robots

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.180 
so separate out the non killing robots
from<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.390> killing<00:03:40.750> robots<00:03:41.050> that<00:03:41.860> are<00:03:41.920> not

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
from the killing robots that are not

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.580 
from the killing robots that are not
attached<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.580> human<00:03:43.000> beings<00:03:43.330> you've<00:03:44.140> got<00:03:44.410> to

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
attached to human beings you've got to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.199 
attached to human beings you've got to
be<00:03:44.709> against<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.250> you've<00:03:45.580> got<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.180> mean

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
be against that you've got to be I mean

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.199 
be against that you've got to be I mean
so<00:03:47.110> we're<00:03:47.320> saying<00:03:47.650> now<00:03:48.459> right<00:03:48.760> now<00:03:48.940> there's<00:03:49.150> a

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
so we're saying now right now there's a

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.530 
so we're saying now right now there's a
guy<00:03:49.360> in<00:03:49.510> Tampa<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.050> operates<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.560> drone<00:03:50.860> and

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
guy in Tampa that operates the drone and

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.699 
guy in Tampa that operates the drone and
oftentimes<00:03:52.540> they<00:03:53.140> have<00:03:53.170> sketchy

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
oftentimes they have sketchy

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.050 
oftentimes they have sketchy
intelligence<00:03:54.340> they<00:03:54.430> call<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.730> signal

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
intelligence they call it signal

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.360 
intelligence they call it signal
intelligence<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.350> there's<00:03:56.770> not<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:56.950> guy<00:03:57.160> on<00:03:57.280> the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
intelligence so there's not a guy on the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.510 
intelligence so there's not a guy on the
ground<00:03:57.459> saying<00:03:57.820> oh<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.060> see<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:59.260> know<00:03:59.520> mullah

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520

omar<00:04:01.060> okay<00:04:01.750> go<00:04:02.620> ahead<00:04:02.740> and<00:04:03.010> drop<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.430> bomb

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
omar okay go ahead and drop the bomb

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.000 
omar okay go ahead and drop the bomb
they<00:04:04.240> say<00:04:04.450> oh<00:04:04.690> there's<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.020> cell<00:04:05.380> phone<00:04:05.680> that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
they say oh there's a cell phone that

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.610 
they say oh there's a cell phone that
mullah<00:04:06.640> omar<00:04:06.970> once<00:04:07.240> used<00:04:07.660> we've<00:04:08.230> detected

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
mullah omar once used we've detected

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.590 
mullah omar once used we've detected
that<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.220> ground<00:04:09.459> who's<00:04:10.090> holding<00:04:10.360> cell

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
phone now I don't know but at least

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.530 
phone now I don't know but at least
there's<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.340> human<00:04:12.610> being<00:04:12.820> who<00:04:13.030> presses<00:04:13.300> the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
robots that are literally in that case

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.060 
robots that are literally in that case
would<00:04:18.790> be<00:04:18.850> killing<00:04:19.270> machines

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
would be killing machines

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.920 
would be killing machines
there's<00:04:21.070> no<00:04:21.280> as<00:04:22.240> an<00:04:22.479> Asst<00:04:22.600> there's<00:04:22.840> no

just<00:04:24.490> go<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.850> have<00:04:25.240> located<00:04:25.510> this<00:04:25.900> piece<00:04:26.169> of

just go I have located this piece of

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.020 
just go I have located this piece of
hardware<00:04:26.680> or

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
hardware or

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.190

I've located X or Y or Z in whatever

I've located X or Y or Z in whatever
mechanical<00:04:31.200> computation<00:04:31.889> that<00:04:32.280> they<00:04:32.370> made

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
mechanical computation that they made

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.730

they<00:04:33.270> press<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.630> button<00:04:33.870> on<00:04:33.900> their<00:04:34.080> own<00:04:34.200> yes

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
they press the button on their own yes

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.480 
they press the button on their own yes
that's<00:04:37.740> crazy

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
that's crazy

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.340 
that's crazy
I<00:04:38.520> think<00:04:38.850> with<00:04:38.970> all<00:04:39.000> technology<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.020> have<00:04:40.200> to

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
I think with all technology you have to

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.190 
I think with all technology you have to
do<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.610> cost-benefit<00:04:41.610> analysis<00:04:41.639> right<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:42.540> with

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
do a cost-benefit analysis right so with

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.659 
do a cost-benefit analysis right so with
all<00:04:43.530> technology<00:04:43.860> that's<00:04:44.490> been<00:04:44.610> developed

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
all technology that's been developed

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.020 
all technology that's been developed
thus<00:04:45.210> far<00:04:45.510> there<00:04:46.260> has<00:04:46.470> been<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:47.130> lot<00:04:47.700> of<00:04:47.730> great

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
thus far there has been a lot of great

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.610 
thus far there has been a lot of great
things<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.480> came<00:04:48.660> out<00:04:48.840> of<00:04:48.870> it<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.320> also<00:04:49.470> a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
things that came out of it and also a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.990 
things that came out of it and also a
lot<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.919> abuse<00:04:50.160> so<00:04:50.430> something<00:04:50.760> like<00:04:50.790> the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
lot of abuse so something like the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.640 
lot of abuse so something like the
internet<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.570> instance<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.050> lot<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.380> great

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
internet for instance a lot of great

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.350 
internet for instance a lot of great
things<00:04:52.680> came<00:04:53.100> out<00:04:53.190> of<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.370> internet<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.970> lot<00:04:54.270> of

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
things came out of the internet a lot of

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.960 
things came out of the internet a lot of
abuse<00:04:54.660> as<00:04:54.810> well<00:04:54.840> but<00:04:55.320> I<00:04:55.350> think<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.400> costs

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
abuse as well but I think the the costs

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.070 
abuse as well but I think the the costs
are<00:04:57.090> not<00:04:57.720> as<00:04:57.780> bad<00:04:58.500> as<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.860> benefits<00:04:59.370> right<00:05:00.080> but

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
are not as bad as the benefits right but

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.360 
are not as bad as the benefits right but
at<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.290> same<00:05:01.470> time<00:05:01.680> with<00:05:01.830> something<00:05:02.040> like

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
at the same time with something like

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.400 
at the same time with something like
autonomous<00:05:03.120> weaponry<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:03.660> artificial

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
autonomous weaponry and artificial

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.530 
autonomous weaponry and artificial
intelligence<00:05:04.980> I<00:05:05.190> feel<00:05:05.550> like<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:05.910> downsides

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
intelligence I feel like the downsides

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.900 
intelligence I feel like the downsides
are<00:05:06.900> more<00:05:07.740> significant<00:05:08.370> than<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.490> upsides

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
are more significant than the upsides

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.670 
are more significant than the upsides
right<00:05:09.630> because<00:05:09.870> let's<00:05:10.080> say<00:05:10.140> you<00:05:10.200> even<00:05:10.500> take

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
right because let's say you even take

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.260 
right because let's say you even take
the<00:05:10.800> killing<00:05:11.190> part<00:05:11.370> out<00:05:11.550> of<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.790> and<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.060> look

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
the killing part out of it and you look

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.510 
the killing part out of it and you look
at<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.630> more<00:05:12.840> benign<00:05:13.380> part<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:13.980> I<00:05:14.040> guess<00:05:14.280> I

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
at the more benign part of it I guess I

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.460 
at the more benign part of it I guess I
mean<00:05:15.090> artificial<00:05:15.570> intelligence<00:05:16.080> what<00:05:16.380> we're

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
mean artificial intelligence what we're

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.080 
mean artificial intelligence what we're
gonna<00:05:16.560> have<00:05:16.740> robots<00:05:17.070> taking<00:05:17.310> our<00:05:17.490> jobs<00:05:17.730> too

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
gonna have robots taking our jobs too

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.300 
gonna have robots taking our jobs too
like<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:19.050> would<00:05:19.200> be<00:05:19.320> disastrous<00:05:19.860> as<00:05:20.070> well

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
like that would be disastrous as well

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.100 
like that would be disastrous as well
well<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.850> some<00:05:21.060> degree<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.300> already<00:05:21.720> happens

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
well to some degree that already happens

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.050 
well to some degree that already happens
right<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.590> and<00:05:22.830> certainly<00:05:23.400> will<00:05:23.580> happen<00:05:23.850> more

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
right and and certainly will happen more

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.370 
right and and certainly will happen more
there's<00:05:24.270> no<00:05:24.419> question<00:05:24.810> about<00:05:24.870> that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
there's no question about that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.240 
there's no question about that
but<00:05:25.889> look<00:05:26.430> if<00:05:26.669> you<00:05:27.090> program<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:27.720> robot<00:05:28.500> to

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
but look if you program the robot to

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.340 
but look if you program the robot to
eliminate<00:05:29.729> threats<00:05:30.060> what<00:05:30.810> if<00:05:30.930> we<00:05:31.020> decide<00:05:31.320> to

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
eliminate threats what if we decide to

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.380 
eliminate threats what if we decide to
shut<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.710> robot<00:05:32.070> down<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.610> it<00:05:32.820> detects<00:05:33.240> a

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
shut the robot down and it detects a

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.740 
shut the robot down and it detects a
threat<00:05:34.130> well<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:36.060> would<00:05:36.210> be<00:05:36.240> threatening

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
threat well you you would be threatening

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.240 
threat well you you would be threatening
it<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:37.050> mean<00:05:37.260> I<00:05:37.410> hope<00:05:37.650> that<00:05:37.860> you<00:05:37.950> wrote<00:05:38.130> the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
it I mean I hope that you wrote the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.920 
it I mean I hope that you wrote the
program<00:05:38.430> in<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.910> way<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.419> it<00:05:39.540> doesn't<00:05:39.720> view

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
program in a way that it doesn't view

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.930 
program in a way that it doesn't view
you<00:05:40.140> as<00:05:40.169> a<00:05:40.320> threat<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.919> know<00:05:41.340> now<00:05:41.610> we're<00:05:41.760> getting

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
you as a threat I know now we're getting

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.340 
you as a threat I know now we're getting
a<00:05:42.090> little<00:05:42.210> bit<00:05:42.479> of<00:05:42.570> science<00:05:42.750> fiction<00:05:42.990> but

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
a little bit of science fiction but

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.050 
a little bit of science fiction but
again<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.160> smartest<00:05:44.550> people<00:05:44.700> on<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:44.970> planet

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
again the smartest people on the planet

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.880 
again the smartest people on the planet
are<00:05:45.479> telling<00:05:45.780> you<00:05:45.870> it's<00:05:46.050> not<00:05:46.200> really<00:05:46.470> science

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
are telling you it's not really science

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.580 
are telling you it's not really science
fiction<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.520> once<00:05:48.330> they<00:05:48.570> have<00:05:48.870> actual

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
fiction I once they have actual

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.890 
fiction I once they have actual
artificial<00:05:50.130> intelligence<00:05:50.729> we<00:05:51.479> don't<00:05:51.690> really

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
artificial intelligence we don't really

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.270 
artificial intelligence we don't really
know<00:05:52.110> what's<00:05:52.289> gonna<00:05:52.440> happen<00:05:52.650> next

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
know what's gonna happen next

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.779 
know what's gonna happen next
and<00:05:54.030> that's<00:05:54.180> pretty<00:05:54.450> scary<00:05:55.340> so<00:05:56.340> let's<00:05:56.490> end<00:05:56.669> on

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
and that's pretty scary so let's end on

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.870 
and that's pretty scary so let's end on
that<00:05:56.940> note<00:05:57.260> okay<00:05:58.260> if<00:05:58.740> you<00:05:58.830> thought<00:05:59.010> our<00:05:59.220> human

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
that note okay if you thought our human

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.060 
that note okay if you thought our human
cops<00:06:00.120> were<00:06:00.360> bad<00:06:00.570> way<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.560> get<00:06:01.860> a<00:06:01.890> load<00:06:02.039> of

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
cops were bad way to get a load of

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.669 
cops were bad way to get a load of
Robocop
