00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the show was a very complete show it had

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.089 
the show was a very complete show it had
a<00:02:35.800> series<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.580> elements<00:02:36.959> which<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.920> guests

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
a series of elements which the guests

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.410 
a series of elements which the guests
really<00:02:39.310> wasn't<00:02:39.580> aware<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:40.239> these

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
really wasn't aware of all these

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.030 
really wasn't aware of all these
individual<00:02:41.050> elements<00:02:41.500> because<00:02:41.769> they<00:02:41.890> all

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
individual elements because they all

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.490 
individual elements because they all
blended<00:02:42.489> together<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:43.060> about<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> four<00:02:44.319> minute

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
blended together in about a four minute

blended together in about a four minute
show<00:02:44.920> in<00:02:45.220> which<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.750> many<00:02:46.840> things<00:02:47.170> happen<00:02:47.560> so

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
show in which so many things happen so

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.979 
show in which so many things happen so
fast<00:02:47.800> they<00:02:48.340> never<00:02:48.519> were<00:02:48.730> sure<00:02:49.120> quite<00:02:49.810> what

fast they never were sure quite what
they<00:02:50.140> saw<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:51.430> know<00:02:51.519> that's<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.910> clue<00:02:52.090> of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
they saw and you know that's the clue of

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.170 
they saw and you know that's the clue of
how<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.840> tell<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> dramatic<00:02:53.680> story<00:02:54.310> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
how you you tell a dramatic story a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.910 
how you you tell a dramatic story a
couple<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.870> seconds<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> couple<00:02:56.860> of

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
couple of seconds to this a couple of

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.589 
couple of seconds to this a couple of
seconds<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.880> while<00:02:58.180> you're<00:02:58.360> trying

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
seconds to that and while you're trying

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.210 
seconds to that and while you're trying
to<00:02:58.690> figure<00:02:58.870> out<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.260> first<00:02:59.470> thing<00:02:59.739> the<00:03:00.069> next

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
to figure out the first thing the next

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.740 
to figure out the first thing the next
thing<00:03:00.340> happens<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.060> never<00:03:01.269> get<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.510> chance

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
thing happens and you never get a chance

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.900 
thing happens and you never get a chance
to<00:03:01.930> go<00:03:02.049> back<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.379> figure<00:03:02.650> out<00:03:02.680> how<00:03:03.519> did<00:03:03.790> they

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
to go back and figure out how did they

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.080 
to go back and figure out how did they
do<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.120> well<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:04.720> know<00:03:04.900> how<00:03:05.080> we<00:03:05.140> do<00:03:05.530> it

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
do that well we know how we do it

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.910 
do that well we know how we do it
actually<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.120> 30-foot<00:03:07.660> tall<00:03:08.170> King<00:03:08.650> Kong

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
actually a 30-foot tall King Kong

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.860 
actually a 30-foot tall King Kong
gorilla<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.489> actually<00:03:09.940> very<00:03:10.120> easy<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.720> design

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
gorilla is actually very easy to design

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.559 
gorilla is actually very easy to design
if<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.319> stop<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.709> think<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.610> one<00:03:13.209> inch

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
if you stop and think this is a one inch

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.470 
if you stop and think this is a one inch
to<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.840> foot<00:03:14.110> scale<00:03:14.470> model<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.209> 30

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
to the foot scale model so this is 30

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.080 
to the foot scale model so this is 30
inches<00:03:16.870> from<00:03:17.349> top<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.680> bottom<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.880> that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
inches from top to bottom and that

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.720 
inches from top to bottom and that
represents<00:03:19.690> 30<00:03:20.079> feet<00:03:20.410> now<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.280> first<00:03:21.549> thing

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
represents 30 feet now the first thing

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.339 
represents 30 feet now the first thing
that<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.060> worry<00:03:22.239> about<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.870> figure<00:03:23.170> which

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
that you worry about in a figure which

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.360 
that you worry about in a figure which
might<00:03:23.590> weigh<00:03:24.150> 13,000<00:03:25.150> pounds<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:26.260> what<00:03:26.370> holds

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
might weigh 13,000 pounds is what holds

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.120 
might weigh 13,000 pounds is what holds
it<00:03:27.430> right-side<00:03:27.760> up<00:03:28.239> if<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.690> power<00:03:28.900> fails<00:03:29.230> well

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
it right-side up if the power fails well

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.100 
it right-side up if the power fails well
if<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.459> counterweight<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.810> body

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
if you counterweight it so that the body

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.039 
if you counterweight it so that the body
is<00:03:32.319> pivot<00:03:32.709> at<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:33.010> point<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:34.450> much

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
is pivot at this point and it's much

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.379 
is pivot at this point and it's much
heavier<00:03:35.470> down<00:03:35.709> at<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:35.980> bottom<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:37.060> means

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
heavier down at the bottom this means

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.150 
heavier down at the bottom this means
that<00:03:37.660> any<00:03:37.870> time<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.410> figure<00:03:38.709> went<00:03:38.889> out<00:03:39.010> of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
that any time this figure went out of

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.370 
that any time this figure went out of
control<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.940> simply<00:03:40.150> let<00:03:40.480> gold<00:03:40.750> it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
control and you simply let gold it

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.650 
control and you simply let gold it
simply<00:03:41.829> returns<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.549> its<00:03:42.700> static<00:03:43.060> position<00:03:43.540> in

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
simply returns to its static position in

00:03:43.660 --> 00:04:09.410 
simply returns to its static position in
a<00:03:43.750> very<00:03:43.930> safe<00:03:44.170> manner

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.770 

after<00:04:10.420> we<00:04:10.510> installed<00:04:10.930> King<00:04:11.620> Kong<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.220> the
