of<00:01:47.960> course<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.290> menus<00:01:48.620> are<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:49.010> lot<00:01:49.220> slower

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
than that of pc so it takes maybe 30-40

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.740 
than that of pc so it takes maybe 30-40
seconds<00:01:52.640> before<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.060> can<00:01:53.210> actually<00:01:53.360> leave

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100
