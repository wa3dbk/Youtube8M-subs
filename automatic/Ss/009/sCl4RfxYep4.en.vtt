00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.490 
around but let's do smite really high so
if<00:04:04.100> I<00:04:04.190> see<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.430> zombie<00:04:04.490> and<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:05.150> if<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:05.690> hit<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.020> that

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
if I see a zombie and I if I hit it that

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.190 
if I see a zombie and I if I hit it that
thing's<00:04:06.710> going<00:04:07.070> down<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:08.080> can't<00:04:09.080> really

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
thing's going down I can't really

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.510 
thing's going down I can't really
increase<00:04:09.530> anything<00:04:09.920> else<00:04:10.070> because<00:04:10.220> they're

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
increase anything else because they're

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.330 
increase anything else because they're
too<00:04:10.730> high<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.030> levels<00:04:11.390> looting<00:04:11.810> no<00:04:12.050> too<00:04:12.710> hot<00:04:12.890> so

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
too high of levels looting no too hot so

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.930 
too high of levels looting no too hot so
I'll<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.490> enchant<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.920> let's<00:04:15.920> spawn<00:04:16.489> us<00:04:16.910> a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
I'll just enchant this let's spawn us a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:26.800 
I'll just enchant this let's spawn us a
zombie<00:04:18.820> huh<00:04:19.820> spawn<00:04:20.750> zombie<00:04:21.590> one<00:04:23.560> hello

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.659 

so<00:04:27.810> practically<00:04:28.349> on<00:04:28.650> each<00:04:28.889> level<00:04:29.160> with<00:04:29.370> slight

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
so practically on each level with slight

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.379 
so practically on each level with slight
increases<00:04:30.120> attacked<00:04:31.819> against<00:04:32.819> zombies<00:04:33.240> and

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
increases attacked against zombies and

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.740 
increases attacked against zombies and
skeletons<00:04:33.599> on<00:04:34.110> zero<00:04:34.620> point<00:04:35.280> 75<00:04:35.819> two<00:04:36.030> point<00:04:36.539> one

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
skeletons on zero point 75 two point one

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.210 
skeletons on zero point 75 two point one
point<00:04:36.990> five<00:04:37.349> so<00:04:37.919> that's<00:04:38.160> like<00:04:38.400> that's<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.270> a

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
point five so that's like that's like a

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.620 
point five so that's like that's like a
few<00:04:41.220> more<00:04:41.370> extra<00:04:41.759> hearts<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.120> damage<00:04:42.419> that

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
few more extra hearts of damage that

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.719 
few more extra hearts of damage that
would<00:04:42.750> be<00:04:42.870> an<00:04:42.960> overkill<00:04:43.349> way<00:04:43.560> on<00:04:43.740> this<00:04:44.009> one<00:04:44.250> is

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
would be an overkill way on this one is

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.460 
would be an overkill way on this one is
on<00:04:45.000> me<00:04:45.410> again<00:04:46.410> oh<00:04:46.740> no<00:04:47.460> don't<00:04:48.240> know<00:04:48.539> spawn

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
on me again oh no don't know spawn

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.330 
on me again oh no don't know spawn
zombie<00:04:49.979> oh<00:04:51.139> it's<00:04:52.139> terrible<00:04:52.440> they're<00:04:52.830> dying<00:04:53.069> oh

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
zombie oh it's terrible they're dying oh

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.370 
zombie oh it's terrible they're dying oh
oh<00:04:53.759> okay<00:04:54.240> there<00:04:54.569> we<00:04:54.630> go<00:04:54.690> let's<00:04:55.110> see<00:04:55.229> if<00:04:55.319> I

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
oh okay there we go let's see if I

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.520 
oh okay there we go let's see if I
instantly<00:04:55.710> killing<00:04:56.539> well<00:04:57.539> it<00:04:57.780> works<00:04:57.990> on<00:04:58.199> but

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
instantly killing well it works on but

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.860 
instantly killing well it works on but
it<00:04:58.800> works<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.460> works<00:04:59.490> so<00:04:59.909> it's<00:05:00.030> it's<00:05:00.449> great<00:05:00.750> you

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
it works it works so it's it's great you

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.600 
it works it works so it's it's great you
can<00:05:01.020> do<00:05:01.169> whatever<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.740> can<00:05:01.919> make<00:05:02.490> whatever

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
can do whatever you can make whatever

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.309 
can do whatever you can make whatever
type<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.060> thing<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.389> want<00:05:03.599> like<00:05:03.810> on<00:05:03.990> let's

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
type of thing you want like on let's

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.020 
type of thing you want like on let's
make<00:05:05.090> aqua<00:05:06.090> affinity<00:05:06.509> and<00:05:06.680> respiration<00:05:07.680> I

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
make aqua affinity and respiration I

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.089 
make aqua affinity and respiration I
think<00:05:09.030> respiration<00:05:09.659> just<00:05:09.690> some<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.680> recent

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
think respiration just some that recent

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.980 
think respiration just some that recent
that<00:05:11.340> does<00:05:11.490> I<00:05:11.729> think<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.389> makes<00:05:12.509> you<00:05:12.599> breathe

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
that does I think it makes you breathe

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.749 
that does I think it makes you breathe
