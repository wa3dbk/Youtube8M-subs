00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
let me know if they should be on all the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.939 
let me know if they should be on all the
cars<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.110> certain<00:00:55.469> colors<00:00:55.739> such<00:00:55.920> as

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

think they should be on all the cars
because<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.910> think<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.660> cool<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
because I think it would be so cool to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
because I think it would be so cool to
be<00:01:01.109> driving<00:01:01.590> down<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.920> road<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
be driving down the road and like a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.240 
be driving down the road and like a
cheetah<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.270> an<00:01:03.660> adder<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.470> Turismo<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
cheetah or an adder or a Turismo and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
cheetah or an adder or a Turismo and
just<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:06.080> hydraulics<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.260> they

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
just have like hydraulics but they

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.719 
just have like hydraulics but they
should<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> couple<00:01:08.070> different<00:01:08.220> ones<00:01:08.490> like

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
should have a couple different ones like

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
should have a couple different ones like
four<00:01:09.000> different<00:01:09.119> stages<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.720> hydraulics<00:01:10.260> like

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
four different stages of hydraulics like

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
four different stages of hydraulics like
the<00:01:10.560> first<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.280> people<00:01:11.939> who<00:01:11.970> don't

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the first one is for people who don't

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.149 
the first one is for people who don't
have<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> lot<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> money<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.010> that<00:01:14.010> could

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
have a lot of money and that could

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.260 
have a lot of money and that could
really<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.460> know<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> could<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.060> kind

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
really you know that could just be kind

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.670 
really you know that could just be kind
of<00:01:15.390> simple<00:01:15.720> hydraulics<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
of simple hydraulics not really like a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
of simple hydraulics not really like a
lot<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.950> bobbing<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.610> stuff<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
lot of bobbing and stuff and then the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170 
lot of bobbing and stuff and then the
fourth<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.140> crazy<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
fourth one be like crazy and go on and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.600 
fourth one be like crazy and go on and
so<00:01:21.509> forth<00:01:21.780> from<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:23.340> that'd<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
so forth from there I think that'd be a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.859 
so forth from there I think that'd be a
really<00:01:23.790> cool<00:01:24.000> idea<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.630> because

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
really cool idea of just because

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
really cool idea of just because
everyone<00:01:25.439> even<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.189> everyone<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.700> their

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
everyone even know everyone in their

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
everyone even know everyone in their
mother<00:01:27.119> wants<00:01:27.509> hydraulics<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.290> game<00:01:28.500> if

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
mother wants hydraulics in this game if

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.350 
mother wants hydraulics in this game if
you<00:01:29.070> guys<00:01:29.220> remember<00:01:29.400> back<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.759> before<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you guys remember back to before the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.429 
you guys remember back to before the
game<00:01:30.570> came<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> people<00:01:31.110> were<00:01:31.290> talking

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
game came out and people were talking

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
game came out and people were talking
about<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.770> theories<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> stuff<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.880> one

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
about like theories and stuff that one

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.069 
about like theories and stuff that one
was<00:01:33.180> gonna<00:01:33.270> say<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.689> everyone<00:01:33.990> was

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
was gonna say you know everyone was

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.810 
was gonna say you know everyone was
saying<00:01:34.229> how<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.590> there's<00:01:35.549> gonna<00:01:35.670> be

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
saying how like there's gonna be

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.310 
saying how like there's gonna be
hydraulic<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.140> san

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
hydraulic just because it was in san

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.950 
hydraulic just because it was in san
andreas<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.829> they<00:01:37.950> never<00:01:38.040> brought<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.369> back

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
andreas but they never brought it back

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
andreas but they never brought it back
to<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.140> know<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> game<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.430> know

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to you know the game so I think you know

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.740 
to you know the game so I think you know
they're<00:01:41.880> definitely<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> probably

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
they're definitely going to probably

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.899 
they're definitely going to probably
bring<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.500> point<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.759> need

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
bring it in at some point they just need

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.819 
bring it in at some point they just need
you<00:01:45.210> know<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.540> time<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.619> want<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you know the right time and they want to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.870 
you know the right time and they want to
put<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.040> probably<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.369> heist<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
put out probably like heist and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.120 
put out probably like heist and
highlights<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.390> stuff<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.689> first

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
highlights and stuff like that first

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.200 
highlights and stuff like that first
also<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> think<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.460> should<00:01:50.610> add<00:01:50.759> more<00:01:51.000> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
also I think they should add more you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
also I think they should add more you
know<00:01:51.299> stuff<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.570> exhausts<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.470> stuff<00:01:52.710> that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
know stuff like exhausts and stuff that

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.310 
know stuff like exhausts and stuff that
would<00:01:52.979> make<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.250> car<00:01:53.520> look<00:01:53.549> more<00:01:54.060> unique<00:01:54.810> but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
would make your car look more unique but

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.209 
would make your car look more unique but
it<00:01:55.409> can't<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.710> unique<00:01:56.009> because

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
it can't really be unique because

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
it can't really be unique because
there's<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.329> there's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
there's you know that would be there's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.819 
there's you know that would be there's
so<00:01:57.899> many<00:01:57.960> people<00:01:58.200> playing<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> game<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:58.799> I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so many people playing the game but I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.370 
so many people playing the game but I
mean<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.369> way<00:01:59.659> to<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:01.079> things

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
mean like in a way to have more things

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350 
mean like in a way to have more things
for<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> car<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.210> make<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
for you to put on the car to make it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.910 
for you to put on the car to make it
look<00:02:03.570> even<00:02:03.750> more<00:02:03.930> cooler<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.829> know

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
look even more cooler because you know

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.109 
look even more cooler because you know
there's<00:02:05.100> still<00:02:05.189> there's<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> decent<00:02:05.670> honest<00:02:06.000> up

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
there's still there's a decent honest up

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.719 
there's still there's a decent honest up
now<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.540> there's<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.810> enough<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
now but there's not enough to have you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.400 
now but there's not enough to have you
know<00:02:08.819> maybe<00:02:09.060> more<00:02:09.300> engines<00:02:09.840> which<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.229> can't

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
know maybe more engines which you can't

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.750 
know maybe more engines which you can't
really<00:02:10.470> see<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.890> engines<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.640> could

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
really see the engines but you could

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.820 
really see the engines but you could
have<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.300> faster<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.959> obviously<00:02:13.290> that's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
have it be faster so obviously that's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.240 
have it be faster so obviously that's
seeing<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.340> faster<00:02:14.600> having<00:02:15.600> more<00:02:16.250> exhausts

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
seeing it be faster having more exhausts

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.510 
seeing it be faster having more exhausts
having<00:02:17.640> more<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:19.410> know<00:02:19.500> horns<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.220> that's

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
having more you know horns that that's

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.770 
having more you know horns that that's
kind<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.730> cool<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.120> could<00:02:21.270> always<00:02:21.480> add<00:02:21.630> some

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
kind of cool they could always add some

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.690 
kind of cool they could always add some
more<00:02:21.870> stuff<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.260> maybe<00:02:23.190> adding

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
more stuff like that maybe adding

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.130 
more stuff like that maybe adding
different<00:02:23.820> color<00:02:24.180> lights<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.810> your<00:02:24.930> car

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
different color lights to your car

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.020 
different color lights to your car
instead<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.710> just<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.070> regular<00:02:26.460> ones<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.880> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
instead of just the regular ones and the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.250 
instead of just the regular ones and the
other<00:02:27.150> because<00:02:27.840> there's<00:02:27.990> two<00:02:28.110> different

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
other because there's two different

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.720 
other because there's two different
types<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.860> stock<00:02:29.130> ones<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
types like the stock ones and then the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.630 
types like the stock ones and then the
other<00:02:29.760> ones<00:02:30.090> um<00:02:30.330> also<00:02:31.110> they<00:02:31.530> could<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.860> you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
other ones um also they could have you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.060 
other ones um also they could have you
add<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.210> decals<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.930> your<00:02:34.050> car<00:02:34.260> now<00:02:34.890> that'd

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
add like decals to your car now that'd

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.340 
add like decals to your car now that'd
be<00:02:35.100> kind<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.400> cool<00:02:35.550> maybe<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.970> could<00:02:36.150> um<00:02:36.350> you

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
be kind of cool maybe you could um you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.040 
be kind of cool maybe you could um you
know<00:02:37.440> download<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> decal<00:02:38.430> pack<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.990> a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
know download a decal pack now I think a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.320 
know download a decal pack now I think a
cool<00:02:40.230> would<00:02:40.440> be<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.680> flames<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.370> stuff<00:02:42.240> like

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
cool would be like flames and stuff like

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.120 
cool would be like flames and stuff like
that<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.930> that'd<00:02:43.080> be<00:02:43.290> really<00:02:43.530> interesting<00:02:44.040> if

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
that so that'd be really interesting if

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.610 
that so that'd be really interesting if
they<00:02:44.250> did<00:02:44.430> having<00:02:45.330> better<00:02:45.510> spoilers<00:02:46.320> cuz<00:02:46.560> you

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
they did having better spoilers cuz you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.960 
they did having better spoilers cuz you
know<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.830> spoilers<00:02:47.160> are<00:02:47.340> kind<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:47.790> like

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
know the spoilers are kind of just like

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.570 
know the spoilers are kind of just like
you<00:02:48.270> know<00:02:49.080> there's<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.650> two<00:02:49.860> or<00:02:50.010> three<00:02:50.040> maybe

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
you know there's like two or three maybe

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.980 
you know there's like two or three maybe
four<00:02:50.970> I'm<00:02:51.180> not<00:02:51.330> quite<00:02:51.510> sure<00:02:51.540> how<00:02:51.690> many<00:02:51.870> there

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
four I'm not quite sure how many there

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.660 
four I'm not quite sure how many there
are<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:52.170> they're<00:02:52.890> usually<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.370> all<00:02:53.520> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
are but they're usually like all the
