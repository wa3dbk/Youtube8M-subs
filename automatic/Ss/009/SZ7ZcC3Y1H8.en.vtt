00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
bit more on the Metro but I think this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.000 
bit more on the Metro but I think this
one's<00:02:20.599> got<00:02:20.720> actually<00:02:20.989> gonna<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.230> easier<00:02:21.890> to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
one's got actually gonna be easier to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.740 
one's got actually gonna be easier to
pedal<00:02:22.220> it's<00:02:22.580> kind<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.849> narrower<00:02:23.209> right<00:02:23.510> here

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
pedal it's kind of narrower right here

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.320 
pedal it's kind of narrower right here

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
hydraulic disc brakes standard size but

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.199 
hydraulic disc brakes standard size but
it's<00:02:37.280> important<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.060> you're

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
it's important to have that if you're

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.960 
it's important to have that if you're
you're<00:02:38.480> riding<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.780> heavier<00:02:39.080> bike<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.459> using

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
you're riding a heavier bike and using

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.759 
you're riding a heavier bike and using
throttle<00:02:41.390> mode<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.840> as<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.319> squeeze<00:02:42.560> those

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
throttle mode and as you squeeze those

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.800 
throttle mode and as you squeeze those
brakes<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.220> cuts<00:02:43.370> out<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.640> throttle<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.239> it's

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
brakes and cuts out the throttle so it's

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.720 
brakes and cuts out the throttle so it's
a<00:02:44.840> good<00:02:45.019> safety<00:02:45.319> feature<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.980> think<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
a good safety feature I think the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.979 
a good safety feature I think the
coolest<00:02:46.970> thing<00:02:47.239> about<00:02:47.299> this<00:02:47.569> bike<00:02:47.750> is

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
coolest thing about this bike is

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.740 
coolest thing about this bike is
actually<00:02:48.140> how<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.620> start<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.360> got<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> cute

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
one of the questionable features about

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.349 
one of the questionable features about
these<00:03:17.540> bikes<00:03:17.720> is<00:03:18.019> is<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.709> tires<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.850> like<00:03:20.209> that

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
these bikes is is the tires I like that

these bikes is is the tires I like that
these<00:03:20.480> ones<00:03:20.720> are<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> little<00:03:20.989> bit<00:03:21.200> more<00:03:21.230> narrow

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
these ones are a little bit more narrow

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.430 
these ones are a little bit more narrow
than<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.299> metro<00:03:23.299> or<00:03:23.600> rather<00:03:23.840> now<00:03:24.230> they've

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
than the metro or rather now they've

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.949 
than the metro or rather now they've
they've<00:03:25.099> renamed<00:03:25.519> it<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:25.670> octave<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.750> will

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
they've renamed it the octave this will

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.470 
they've renamed it the octave this will
fit<00:03:27.170> in<00:03:27.410> more<00:03:27.769> standard<00:03:28.250> bike<00:03:28.459> racks<00:03:28.760> alright

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
fit in more standard bike racks alright

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
doesn't have to be so large there's

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.539 
doesn't have to be so large there's
still<00:03:33.410> extra<00:03:33.829> thick<00:03:34.099> though<00:03:34.280> they're<00:03:34.459> gonna

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
still extra thick though they're gonna

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.920 
still extra thick though they're gonna
offer<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.880> little<00:03:35.090> bit<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.299> a<00:03:35.450> little<00:03:35.810> bit<00:03:35.900> of

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
offer a little bit of a little bit of

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.620 
offer a little bit of a little bit of
padding<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.760> maybe<00:03:37.760> make<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.060> harder<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.389> get

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
padding and maybe make it harder to get

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.819 
padding and maybe make it harder to get
a<00:03:38.810> flat<00:03:39.079> tire<00:03:39.109> while<00:03:39.980> you're<00:03:40.130> riding<00:03:40.370> around

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
a flat tire while you're riding around

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.400 
a flat tire while you're riding around
okay<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.609> I'm<00:03:43.669> just<00:03:43.730> gonna<00:03:43.910> pedal<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:44.660> just

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
okay so I'm just gonna pedal and just

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.650 
okay so I'm just gonna pedal and just
takes<00:03:46.040> right<00:03:46.280> off

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.360 

it's<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.410> other<00:03:52.530> thing<00:03:52.740> I<00:03:52.830> wanted<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.130> call

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
it's the other thing I wanted to call

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.280 
it's the other thing I wanted to call
out<00:03:54.980> using<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.190> TM<00:03:56.580> m4<00:03:57.240> sensor<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.110> there's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
out using the TM m4 sensor so there's

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.770 
out using the TM m4 sensor so there's
different<00:03:58.740> levels<00:03:59.040> different<00:03:59.880> quality<00:04:00.600> I

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
different levels different quality I

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.110 
different levels different quality I
guess<00:04:01.080> in<00:04:01.320> terms<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.710> torque<00:04:02.460> sensors<00:04:02.910> for

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
guess in terms of torque sensors for

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.430 
guess in terms of torque sensors for
pedal<00:04:03.420> assist<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.020> is<00:04:04.140> one<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
pedal assist and this is one of the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:13.280 
pedal assist and this is one of the
higher<00:04:04.620> ones<00:04:05.930> helicopter<00:04:10.220> okay<00:04:11.630> anyway<00:04:12.660> let's

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
higher ones helicopter okay anyway let's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.070 
higher ones helicopter okay anyway let's
let's<00:04:13.620> go<00:04:13.680> let's<00:04:14.070> do<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:14.280> again<00:04:14.630> okay<00:04:15.630> so<00:04:15.840> I

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
let's go let's do this again okay so I

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.550 
let's go let's do this again okay so I
start<00:04:16.410> off<00:04:16.530> pedaling<00:04:17.070> kicks<00:04:17.880> ride<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.600> nice

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
start off pedaling kicks ride in a nice

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.920 
start off pedaling kicks ride in a nice
little<00:04:19.770> bash<00:04:20.070> up<00:04:20.340> there

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
little bash up there

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.830 
little bash up there
Abell<00:04:22.010> very<00:04:23.010> sweet<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:24.240> then<00:04:24.390> go<00:04:24.510> ahead<00:04:24.630> and

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
Abell very sweet and then go ahead and

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:41.660 
Abell very sweet and then go ahead and
twist<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.930> just<00:04:28.110> takes<00:04:28.350> right<00:04:28.620> off

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.860 

it's<00:04:42.670> definitely<00:04:43.060> one<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.390> smoother

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
it's definitely one of the smoother

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.900 
it's definitely one of the smoother
