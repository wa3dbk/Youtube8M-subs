companies<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:33.929> over<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.440> galaxy<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.369> been

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
companies all over the galaxy have been

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.779

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
switching to a walk labour if we want to

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.850 
switching to a walk labour if we want to
terminate<00:01:39.030> our<00:01:39.390> current<00:01:39.750> health<00:01:39.960> workforce

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
terminate our current health workforce

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.820 
terminate our current health workforce
and<00:01:41.130> replace<00:01:41.940> them<00:01:42.179> all<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.810> walks<00:01:43.050> we

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
and replace them all with a walks we

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.649 
and replace them all with a walks we
would<00:01:43.979> cut<00:01:44.220> our<00:01:44.399> entire<00:01:44.759> labour<00:01:45.030> costs<00:01:45.509> by

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
would cut our entire labour costs by

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.410 
would cut our entire labour costs by
over<00:01:45.960> 40%<00:01:47.149> 40%<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.009> number<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:51.149> can

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
over 40% 40% I like that number but can

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.740 
over 40% 40% I like that number but can
it<00:01:51.539> work<00:01:51.690> for<00:01:51.899> us<00:01:52.550> operations<00:01:53.550> could<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.600> do

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it work for us operations could we do

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.399 
it work for us operations could we do
this<00:01:55.310> yes<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.549> think<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.880> could<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.899> Ewoks<00:01:58.290> are

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
this yes I think we could the Ewoks are

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.530 
this yes I think we could the Ewoks are
intelligent<00:01:59.009> good<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.820> their<00:02:00.000> hands<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
intelligent good with their hands and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
intelligent good with their hands and
most<00:02:01.140> importantly<00:02:01.619> they<00:02:02.369> are<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.670> same<00:02:02.909> size

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
most importantly they are the same size

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240 
most importantly they are the same size
as<00:02:03.390> our<00:02:03.509> elves<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.619> wouldn't<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.130> make

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
as our elves we wouldn't have to make

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.219 
as our elves we wouldn't have to make
changes<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> our<00:02:05.880> workstations<00:02:06.600> tools<00:02:06.899> or

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
changes to our workstations tools or

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.229 
changes to our workstations tools or
living<00:02:07.409> quarters<00:02:07.799> they<00:02:08.579> could<00:02:08.820> move<00:02:09.000> right<00:02:09.030> in

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
living quarters they could move right in

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.550 
living quarters they could move right in
and<00:02:09.390> start<00:02:09.750> working<00:02:10.700> sounds<00:02:11.700> good<00:02:12.350> but<00:02:13.350> there

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and start working sounds good but there

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.890 
and start working sounds good but there
would<00:02:13.769> be<00:02:13.799> some<00:02:13.950> startup<00:02:14.579> issues<00:02:14.900> production

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
would be some startup issues production

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.460 
would be some startup issues production
what<00:02:16.380> do<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> think<00:02:17.959> actually<00:02:18.959> since<00:02:19.320> it's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
what do you think actually since it's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.810 
what do you think actually since it's
late<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.799> year<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.340> are<00:02:20.370> pretty<00:02:20.610> much<00:02:20.700> done

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
late in a year we are pretty much done

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.370 
late in a year we are pretty much done
with<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> more<00:02:21.329> difficult<00:02:21.720> manufacturing

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
process at this point we only have some

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.270 
process at this point we only have some
light<00:02:24.630> assembly<00:02:25.079> packing<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.590> data<00:02:25.799> entry<00:02:26.190> and
