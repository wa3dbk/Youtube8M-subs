 I hope you have already popped yourself like me 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.270
 I promised you showed here how to make 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.270
 such here 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.820
 charming skeleton other issues 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.350
 This is such a cool skeleton 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.580
 let's say when you decide these things 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.060
 parts of you for example you will have 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.450
 such 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.440
 about 2 of them need to do so 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.370
 stronger was and again another layer 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.459
 to impose 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.200
 here these backs support them right here 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:44.410
 here right here on the line then thats 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.980
 do you have such a torso 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.700
 approximately here approximately here inside 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.580
 it is necessary to attach and so here it is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.050
 me already fixed model all this 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:04.709
 it's okay like that too much 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:09.850
 I bend spoons whether a department of cardboard 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.260
 it just covered the other layer and here it is 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.280

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.459
 glue and you have such here 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.269
 here are these pips on them 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.780
 spikes you 'll stick your head itself 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.510

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.380
