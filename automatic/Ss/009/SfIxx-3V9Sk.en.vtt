 today I'm going to show you how to put it 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.439
 luxury vehicles inside the garage 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.029
 you can put in race period on 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.919
 taste and do not disappear income account 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.380
 inside garages such as gods 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.599
 you or your friends have imported them 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.460
 from the os from the history of the online 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.710
 if you don't know wi fi you can find it in 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.540
 description the link of my video that you 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 he explains just how he does it 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.890
 bring you history and online 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.579
 this clip where you do everything a lot 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.710
 quickly and you have to make sure e 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.350
 none however is a pale boxes while 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.850
 do this clichÃ© you fear will not work 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.910
 so he should be a councilor 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.329
 public and there are no other methods 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:00.069
 unfortunately then you will have to go a little 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:03.120
 so maybe wait until it is there 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:07.150
 no one around your garage because 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.770
 if not precisely will break the boxes 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.300
 surely it will kill you year-round 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 something because people don't know what 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.420
 take trips then today other people 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.940

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.890
 where to place your vehicle 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.890

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:47.240
 I hope I can do it then 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:49.250
 quickly enter the vehicle 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.170

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:04.849
 come in if those two out there don't 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.420
 move the vehicle and vice should 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.640
 work 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:15.620
 I hope you entered the garage 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.450

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.769
 in the head this passage serves for 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.129

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.090
 you don't know when you're done trading 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.420
 buildable revenue I put the audio 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.690
 now because you have to listen well 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.690
 take the vehicle 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.090
 sell the phone 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.670
 now quick game participates in a 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.060
 lts you'll have to be quick now you have to 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.850
 press xr2 very quickly and you should 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.680
 hear the noise of the galaxy opens up if 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.390
 feel this but it is working 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.660
 let's try the glitch and it's working 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.770
 now you have to be even faster 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.130
 when you are about to enter the lobby 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.910
 you have to wait for the screen to appear 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.760
 everything or the passage of the sculpture 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.470
 of the screen we say inside the lobby 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.160
 it must end and be completely 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.269
 the landscape behind the lobby is visible 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:42.160
 done just because you leave the lobby 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:46.300
 pierce 123 visible landscape wait 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.709

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.890
 here now you have to want a lot 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.870
 quickly enter workers and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.380
 very very much inside the vehicle 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.380
 quickly 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.500
 now you have to do nothing e 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.810
 automatically exit you will exit e 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.380
 next to the car you left with 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.930
 you will find your car which will now be 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.610
 really yours with which you can enter 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.470
 in the garage which is the one you have 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.340
 imported now jerk killed me 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.620
 as I said before you have to be careful 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.000
 I think they live anyway, you see it 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.570
 the same even if something happens 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.770
 similar 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.770
 I hope for you 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.919
 let's go get it 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.350
 hoping for the number of struga because 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.350
 they also dress 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.690
 bronze 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.140
 as I said, take the entrance lane 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.140
 inside the garage 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.250
 now the vehicle will be yours 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.469
 upgrade it as much as you can 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:20.889
 boosted as much as you want you can do them 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:22.689
 all you want and thanks having seen 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.139
 the video I recommend public session 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:28.090
 and a lot of speed 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.490
 you must be very fast in the case not 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.490
 it worked the first so maybe 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.560
 you can't get to the car and to 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.840
 get into it don't worry 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.719
 enter the same inside side move it 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.849
 a little and run all the 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.529
 passage from the beginning and now had 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.840
 very lucky because usually not 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.669
 do it at first sight do this a 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.159
 sometimes he has lost an hour or not 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.439
 I'm kidding 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:59.879
 so I recommend a lot of speed and 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:59.879
 much luck to the next video
