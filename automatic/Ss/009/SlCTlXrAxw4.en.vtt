about<00:00:14.920> consuming<00:00:15.670> network<00:00:15.940> services<00:00:16.359> which

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
about consuming network services which

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.540 
about consuming network services which
I'm<00:00:16.689> psyched<00:00:16.930> about<00:00:17.050> I<00:00:17.470> think<00:00:17.710> that<00:00:18.039> a<00:00:18.220> lot<00:00:18.490> of

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
I'm psyched about I think that a lot of

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.009 
I'm psyched about I think that a lot of
us<00:00:18.760> think<00:00:18.789> about<00:00:19.029> iphone<00:00:19.449> apps<00:00:19.659> as<00:00:19.839> these

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
us think about iphone apps as these

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.470 
us think about iphone apps as these
standalone<00:00:20.499> things<00:00:20.890> that<00:00:21.730> run<00:00:21.970> on<00:00:21.999> network

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
standalone things that run on network

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.909 
standalone things that run on network
devices<00:00:22.810> but<00:00:23.140> we're<00:00:23.259> actually<00:00:23.409> looking<00:00:23.679> at

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
devices but we're actually looking at

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.710 
devices but we're actually looking at
going<00:00:24.130> out<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:24.460> getting<00:00:24.820> information<00:00:25.089> over

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
going out and getting information over

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.019 
going out and getting information over
the<00:00:25.810> network<00:00:25.989> from<00:00:26.499> a<00:00:26.800> server<00:00:27.519> and<00:00:27.759> even<00:00:27.909> from

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
the network from a server and even from

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.239 
the network from a server and even from
other<00:00:28.210> servers<00:00:28.689> right<00:00:28.869> right<00:00:29.439> right<00:00:29.739> because

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:30.249 
other servers right right right because

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.290 
other servers right right right because
you<00:00:30.310> know<00:00:30.399> they<00:00:30.489> are<00:00:30.609> networked<00:00:30.970> devices

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
you know they are networked devices

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.720 
you know they are networked devices
right<00:00:31.659> and<00:00:31.989> most<00:00:32.259> apps<00:00:32.529> do<00:00:33.010> need<00:00:33.190> our<00:00:33.370> network

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
right and most apps do need our network

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.190 
right and most apps do need our network
aware<00:00:34.030> or<00:00:34.180> benefit<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.600> lot<00:00:34.690> from<00:00:34.870> being

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200

aware or benefit a lot from being
Network<00:00:35.769> aware<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:36.969> this<00:00:37.090> is<00:00:37.269> not<00:00:37.390> just

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
Network aware so and this is not just

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.770 
Network aware so and this is not just

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
web page and we're actually going to

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.520 
web page and we're actually going to
parse<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.820> use<00:00:42.969> data<00:00:43.300> remotely<00:00:44.170> right

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
parse and use data remotely right

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.720 
parse and use data remotely right
exactly<00:00:44.920> we're<00:00:45.070> going<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.250> pull<00:00:45.429> we're<00:00:45.609> going

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
exactly we're going to pull we're going

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.189 
exactly we're going to pull we're going

to pull data straight down from a

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.079 
to pull data straight down from a
podcast<00:00:47.620> in<00:00:47.829> this<00:00:47.949> case<00:00:48.190> okay<00:00:48.609> it's<00:00:48.940> going<00:00:49.059> to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
podcast in this case okay it's going to

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.910 
podcast in this case okay it's going to
it's<00:00:49.239> going<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.449> arrive<00:00:49.539> to<00:00:49.870> us<00:00:49.960> as<00:00:50.109> XML

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
it's going to arrive to us as XML

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.220 
it's going to arrive to us as XML
parsing<00:00:51.339> it<00:00:51.550> out<00:00:51.670> stick<00:00:52.570> it<00:00:52.690> in<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:52.839> table<00:00:53.140> and

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
parsing it out stick it in a table and

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.660 
parsing it out stick it in a table and
do<00:00:53.350> some<00:00:53.530> cool<00:00:53.679> stuff<00:00:53.769> with<00:00:54.039> it<00:00:54.070> very<00:00:54.519> nice

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
do some cool stuff with it very nice

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:09.360 
do some cool stuff with it very nice
let's<00:00:54.940> get<00:00:55.030> going<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.100> is<00:01:09.130> really

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
let's get going so this is really

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.960 
let's get going so this is really
similar<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.060> RSS<00:01:10.720> feed<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:12.400> formatted<00:01:12.820> a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
similar to the RSS feed it's formatted a

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.160 
similar to the RSS feed it's formatted a
little<00:01:13.120> bit<00:01:13.210> differently<00:01:13.510> Riley<00:01:13.900> this<00:01:13.990> isn't

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
little bit differently Riley this isn't

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.830 
little bit differently Riley this isn't
process<00:01:14.740> obviously<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.310> why<00:01:15.460> not<00:01:15.640> use<00:01:15.910> touch

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
process obviously so why not use touch

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.560 
process obviously so why not use touch
XML<00:01:17.350> p<00:01:17.890> lists<00:01:18.190> or<00:01:18.280> what's<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.790> standard<00:01:19.210> part<00:01:19.420> of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
XML p lists or what's a standard part of

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.840 
XML p lists or what's a standard part of
objective-c<00:01:20.080> right<00:01:20.470> right<00:01:20.980> p<00:01:21.220> lessness<00:01:21.400> is<00:01:21.700> an

objective-c right right p lessness is an

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.030 
objective-c right right p lessness is an
apple<00:01:22.150> thing<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.690> it's<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.050> standard<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.920> is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
apple thing and it's a standard it is

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.570 
apple thing and it's a standard it is
supported<00:01:24.370> by<00:01:25.650> default<00:01:26.650> in<00:01:26.920> objective<00:01:27.310> c<00:01:27.340> sy

supported by default in objective c sy

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.160 
supported by default in objective c sy
the<00:01:27.940> reason<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.210> don't<00:01:28.300> need<00:01:28.480> touch<00:01:28.660> XML<00:01:29.140> is

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
the reason you don't need touch XML is

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.400 
the reason you don't need touch XML is
because<00:01:29.650> p<00:01:30.640> list<00:01:30.880> can<00:01:31.120> be<00:01:31.150> parsed<00:01:31.630> directly

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
because p list can be parsed directly

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.350 
because p list can be parsed directly
into<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.740> raise<00:01:32.980> and<00:01:33.190> dictionary<00:01:33.580> my<00:01:34.030> objective

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
through that bundle correct and then we

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.860 
through that bundle correct and then we
say<00:01:57.220> path<00:01:57.430> for<00:01:57.670> resource<00:01:58.030> which<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.330> documents

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
say path for resource which is documents

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.240 
say path for resource which is documents
and<00:01:58.960> if<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.110> look<00:01:59.260> over<00:01:59.380> here<00:01:59.500> document

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
and if you look over here document

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.010 
and if you look over here document
stylist<00:02:00.910> is<00:02:01.060> what<00:02:01.240> we<00:02:01.330> were<00:02:01.420> referring<00:02:01.870> to

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
stylist is what we were referring to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.070 
stylist is what we were referring to
right<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.620> we<00:02:03.610> say<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.240> d2<00:02:04.480> p<00:02:04.660> list<00:02:04.840> cuz

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
right and we say it is in d2 p list cuz

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.420 
right and we say it is in d2 p list cuz
i<00:02:05.170> could<00:02:05.350> load<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.710> resource<00:02:06.040> right<00:02:06.310> and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
i could load of the resource right and

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.100 
i could load of the resource right and
then<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.580> retain<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.420> we're<00:02:07.510> tallaght

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
then you retain that and we're tallaght

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.690 
then you retain that and we're tallaght
or<00:02:08.259> anything<00:02:08.560> right<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.769> that<00:02:09.099> documents

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
or anything right and that documents

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.460 
or anything right and that documents
array<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.090> what<00:02:10.269> we<00:02:10.390> were<00:02:10.780> used<00:02:11.050> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
array is what we were used to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.120 
array is what we were used to
populating<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.520> drive<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.570> table<00:02:13.840> okay<00:02:14.320> okay

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
populating and drive the table okay okay

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.850 
populating and drive the table okay okay
and<00:02:15.490> imagine<00:02:15.850> that's<00:02:16.000> very<00:02:16.150> similar<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.860> grab

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and imagine that's very similar is grab

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.280 
and imagine that's very similar is grab
the<00:02:18.010> title<00:02:18.190> grab<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.670> subtitle<00:02:19.290> correct

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
the title grab the subtitle correct

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.780 
the title grab the subtitle correct
correct<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.070> let's<00:02:21.190> go<00:02:21.280> ahead<00:02:21.310> look<00:02:21.550> at<00:02:21.640> that

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
correct so let's go ahead look at that

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.560 
correct so let's go ahead look at that
real<00:02:21.970> fast<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.510> table<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:24.340> do<00:02:24.670> have<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> section

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
real fast in table we do have a section

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.180 
real fast in table we do have a section
in<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.840> case<00:02:26.080> called<00:02:26.410> documents<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.040> gives

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
in this case called documents that gives

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.840 
in this case called documents that gives
us<00:02:27.280> our<00:02:27.400> little<00:02:27.550> title<00:02:27.970> up<00:02:28.060> there<00:02:28.270> table<00:02:29.080> and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
us our little title up there table and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.640 
us our little title up there table and
and<00:02:30.850> then<00:02:30.970> we<00:02:31.060> return<00:02:31.210> documents<00:02:31.840> count<00:02:32.110> yeah

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
and then we return documents count yeah

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.590 
and then we return documents count yeah
to<00:02:32.920> get<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> number<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.430> rows<00:02:33.640> or<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.330> then<00:02:34.510> we

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
to get the number of rows or and then we

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.470 
to get the number of rows or and then we
set<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.050> text<00:02:35.380> label<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:35.980> detail<00:02:36.820> text<00:02:37.150> label

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
set the text label and detail text label

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.390 
set the text label and detail text label
which<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.720> time<00:02:37.900> subtitle<00:02:38.560> right<00:02:39.010> next<00:02:39.310> time

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
which is time subtitle right next time

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.890 
which is time subtitle right next time
there<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.610> no<00:02:39.700> Chevron<00:02:40.090> there's<00:02:40.390> no<00:02:40.480> action

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
there is no Chevron there's no action

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.060 
there is no Chevron there's no action
for<00:02:40.930> clicking<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.680> have<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.860> click<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
for clicking it you have to click the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.830 
for clicking it you have to click the
button<00:02:42.400> day<00:02:42.520> exactly<00:02:43.210> so<00:02:43.360> we<00:02:43.480> don't<00:02:43.510> bother

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
button day exactly so we don't bother

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.090 
button day exactly so we don't bother
setting<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.350> cell<00:02:44.620> accessory<00:02:45.490> type<00:02:45.670> yep<00:02:47.100> one

setting the cell accessory type yep one

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.670 
setting the cell accessory type yep one
other<00:02:48.280> thing<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.209> worth<00:02:49.570> noting<00:02:49.870> here's

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
other thing that is worth noting here's

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.770 
other thing that is worth noting here's
our<00:02:50.830> data<00:02:51.040> loading<00:02:51.490> guy<00:02:51.640> again<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.180> remove<00:02:52.390> it

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
our data loading guy again I remove it

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.530 
our data loading guy again I remove it
to<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.770> other<00:02:53.890> example<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:55.090> we've<00:02:55.240> used<00:02:55.390> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
to the other example so we've used a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.270 
to the other example so we've used a
similar<00:02:55.750> pattern<00:02:56.140> here<00:02:56.560> in<00:02:56.680> terms<00:02:56.890> of

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
similar pattern here in terms of

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.510 
similar pattern here in terms of
download<00:02:58.030> button<00:02:58.720> tapped<00:02:58.990> is<00:02:59.350> wired<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.310> get

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
download button tapped is wired to get

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.220 
download button tapped is wired to get
called<00:03:00.790> when<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.209> hit<00:03:01.330> that<00:03:01.360> download<00:03:01.900> button

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
called when we hit that download button

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.530 
called when we hit that download button
and<00:03:02.350> we<00:03:03.340> can<00:03:03.459> go<00:03:03.610> over<00:03:03.640> an<00:03:03.910> interface<00:03:04.270> builder

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
and we can go over an interface builder

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.330 
and we can go over an interface builder
and<00:03:04.810> see<00:03:04.990> that<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:06.100> we<00:03:06.250> open<00:03:07.830> view<00:03:08.830> controller

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
and see that if we open view controller

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.480 
and see that if we open view controller
over<00:03:09.700> here<00:03:10.090> here's<00:03:11.080> our<00:03:11.230> view<00:03:11.530> right<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.370> our

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
over here here's our view right to our

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.620 
over here here's our view right to our
table<00:03:12.870> here's<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.050> download<00:03:14.410> button<00:03:14.770> and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
table here's that download button and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.090 
table here's that download button and
that's<00:03:16.630> wired<00:03:16.840> up<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.050> call<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.410> method<00:03:17.620> okay

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
that's wired up to call this method okay

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.570 
that's wired up to call this method okay
which<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.350> equivalent<00:03:20.350> in<00:03:20.739> many<00:03:20.980> ways<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.459> our

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
which is equivalent in many ways to our

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.910 
which is equivalent in many ways to our
load<00:03:21.790> items<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:22.930> saw<00:03:23.140> earlier<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.800> it

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
load items that we saw earlier so it

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.470 
load items that we saw earlier so it
checks<00:03:24.070> day<00:03:24.280> look<00:03:24.519> at<00:03:24.670> triggers<00:03:25.090> whichever

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
checks day look at triggers whichever

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.380 
checks day look at triggers whichever
row<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.959> selected<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.620> table<00:03:27.040> right<00:03:27.459> link

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
row is selected in the table right link

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.640 
row is selected in the table right link
that<00:03:28.510> up<00:03:28.540> at<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.840> array<00:03:29.050> go<00:03:29.290> get<00:03:29.470> that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
that up at the array go get that

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.800 
that up at the array go get that
particular<00:03:30.250> yeah<00:03:30.700> we're<00:03:30.880> actually<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:31.690> a

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
particular yeah we're actually it's a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.270 
particular yeah we're actually it's a
little<00:03:32.050> before<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.470> actually<00:03:32.590> just<00:03:32.860> kicks<00:03:33.130> off

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
little before it actually just kicks off

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.850 
little before it actually just kicks off
the<00:03:33.400> URL<00:03:33.760> connection<00:03:34.000> loading<00:03:34.840> okay<00:03:35.140> yep<00:03:35.650> yep

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
the URL connection loading okay yep yep

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.820 
the URL connection loading okay yep yep
and<00:03:36.519> then<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.910> then<00:03:37.750> when<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.110> in<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:38.590> time

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
and then and then when that in this time

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.830 
and then and then when that in this time
we<00:03:38.980> don't<00:03:39.160> have<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.670> deal<00:03:39.850> with<00:03:40.120> remember

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
we don't have to deal with remember

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.630 
we don't have to deal with remember
we're<00:03:41.140> not<00:03:41.260> dealing<00:03:41.470> with<00:03:41.739> XML<00:03:42.160> data<00:03:42.280> anymore

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
we're not dealing with XML data anymore

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.009 
we're not dealing with XML data anymore
right<00:03:43.090> remember<00:03:43.420> how<00:03:43.480> we<00:03:43.540> had<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.780> set<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
right remember how we had to set the

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.170 
right remember how we had to set the
HTTP<00:03:44.590> at<00:03:44.680> right<00:03:44.980> except<00:03:45.400> rice<00:03:45.700> no<00:03:45.880> longer

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
HTTP at right except rice no longer

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.420 
HTTP at right except rice no longer
necessary<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.470> now<00:03:47.620> we<00:03:47.680> can<00:03:47.890> just<00:03:48.070> create<00:03:48.310> the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
necessary so now we can just create the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.280 
necessary so now we can just create the
request<00:03:48.760> URL<00:03:49.120> stick<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.750> right<00:03:49.780> in<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.080> URL

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
request URL stick it right in the URL

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.930 
request URL stick it right in the URL
connection<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.890> we're<00:03:50.980> done<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.340> say<00:03:51.580> so

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
connection and we're done I say so

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.449 
connection and we're done I say so
that's<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:52.570> loading<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.070> normal<00:03:54.070> file<00:03:54.280> it's

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
that's so so loading a normal file it's

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.470 
that's so so loading a normal file it's
actually<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:54.730> little<00:03:54.790> simpler<00:03:55.180> than<00:03:55.299> loading

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
actually a little simpler than loading

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.590 
actually a little simpler than loading
XML<00:03:55.959> or<00:03:55.989> JSON<00:03:56.260> or<00:03:56.470> something<00:03:56.920> okay<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:58.120> then

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
XML or JSON or something okay and then

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.449 
XML or JSON or something okay and then
finally<00:03:59.230> down<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.500> our<00:03:59.620> connection<00:04:00.130> are<00:04:00.310> you

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
finally down in our connection are you

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.610
