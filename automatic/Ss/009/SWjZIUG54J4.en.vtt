00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
lot of solid nutrition because now's the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.759 
lot of solid nutrition because now's the
time<00:00:38.969> when<00:00:39.179> I<00:00:39.269> start<00:00:39.600> forming<00:00:40.170> all<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.530> eggs

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
time when I start forming all the eggs

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.250 
time when I start forming all the eggs
when<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.730> spawn<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.390> they're<00:00:43.019> now<00:00:43.199> trying

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

get through the winter develop their

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.349 
get through the winter develop their
spawn<00:00:48.179> and<00:00:49.159> repair<00:00:50.159> any<00:00:50.309> tissue<00:00:50.670> damage<00:00:50.999> it's

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359

a<00:00:51.420> time<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.019> to<00:00:52.170> sort<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.589> fed<00:00:52.829> up

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
a time for them to sort of get fed up

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.489 
a time for them to sort of get fed up
chill<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> prepare<00:00:54.749> themselves<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
chill out and prepare themselves for the

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.649 
chill out and prepare themselves for the
next<00:00:55.829> sort<00:00:56.729> of<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:56.969> phase<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.539> their

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
next sort of like phase of their

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.119 
next sort of like phase of their
lifecycle<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.620> through<00:00:58.649> every

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
lifecycle that they go through every

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.819 
lifecycle that they go through every
year<00:00:59.309> okay<00:00:59.729> so<00:00:59.909> it<00:01:00.449> needs<00:01:00.659> solid<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.379> quality

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
year okay so it needs solid good quality

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.700 
year okay so it needs solid good quality
nutrition<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.899> if<00:01:03.899> you've<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> steady

that colder than that is that 4 degrees

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
that colder than that is that 4 degrees
it<00:01:35.159> gets<00:01:35.189> colder<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.759> starts<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> rise<00:01:36.509> through

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it gets colder it starts to rise through

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.149 
it gets colder it starts to rise through
the<00:01:36.899> water<00:01:37.140> column<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> water<00:01:37.829> starts<00:01:38.130> to

the water column the water starts to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.420 
the water column the water starts to
rise<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.609> turns<00:01:38.820> into<00:01:39.030> ice<00:01:39.240> okay<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.469> they

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
rise and turns into ice okay so they

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.020 
rise and turns into ice okay so they
work<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.880> all<00:01:42.000> temperatures<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.310> if<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
work in all temperatures but if you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.569 
work in all temperatures but if you
can't<00:01:45.780> maintain<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.380> baiting<00:01:46.829> campaign<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.429> any
