they do grow attached to plants they are
oftentimes<00:00:35.750> under<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.140> canopy<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.760> tree

and they are as easy as can be to take
care<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.930> first<00:00:46.170> thing<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
care of and the first thing I'm going to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
care of and the first thing I'm going to
talk<00:00:47.219> about<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.390> light<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
talk about is the light they like a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.330 
talk about is the light they like a
bright<00:00:50.629> indirect<00:00:51.629> light<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> best

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
bright indirect light that is the best

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
bright indirect light that is the best
for<00:00:53.579> them<00:00:53.760> sort<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> similar<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> Apollo's<00:00:55.770> or

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
for them sort of similar to Apollo's or

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340 
for them sort of similar to Apollo's or
a<00:00:56.129> Dracaena<00:00:56.550> or<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> bamboo<00:00:57.300> palm<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.230> have

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
a Dracaena or a bamboo palm if you have

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
a Dracaena or a bamboo palm if you have
other<00:00:58.500> houseplants<00:00:59.129> that's<00:00:59.340> them

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
other houseplants that's them

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.940 
other houseplants that's them
kind<00:01:00.360> of<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.600> light<00:01:01.020> condition<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:01.740> like

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
kind of a light condition that they like

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.630 
kind of a light condition that they like
these<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> finer<00:01:03.480> leaves<00:01:04.370> will<00:01:05.370> burn

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
these with the finer leaves will burn

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.170 
these with the finer leaves will burn
more<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.440> don't<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.160> in<00:01:08.190> any<00:01:08.640> kind

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
more so you don't want them in any kind

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.060 
more so you don't want them in any kind
of<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.540> direct<00:01:10.380> light<00:01:11.220> these<00:01:12.740> with<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> thicker

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
of a direct light these with the thicker

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.160 
of a direct light these with the thicker
leaves<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.700> take<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:15.120> little<00:01:15.480> bit<00:01:15.660> more<00:01:15.930> light

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
leaves can take a little bit more light

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
leaves can take a little bit more light
and<00:01:18.350> next<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.610> temperature<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.760> is<00:01:20.820> really

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
and next is temperature this is really

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.860 
and next is temperature this is really
simple

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
simple

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.980 
simple
they<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.400> above<00:01:23.670> 85<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.420> 90<00:01:24.780> or

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
they don't like it above 85 or 90 or

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.840 
they don't like it above 85 or 90 or
they<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.920> below<00:01:26.190> freezing<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
they don't like it below freezing so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.360 
they don't like it below freezing so
that's<00:01:27.450> probably<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.770> house<00:01:29.010> if<00:01:29.310> you're

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
that's probably not your house if you're

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.520 
that's probably not your house if you're
going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.760> them<00:01:30.000> inside<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:31.380> are

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
going to have them inside so they are

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
going to have them inside so they are
very<00:01:31.890> well<00:01:32.250> suited<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.850> temperature

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
very well suited to temperature

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.990 
very well suited to temperature
conditions<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.860> interior<00:01:35.130> environment

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.180 

next<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.630> watering<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.750> spray<00:01:42.750> them

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
next up is watering you can spray them

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.930 
next up is watering you can spray them
if<00:01:44.190> you<00:01:44.790> choose<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> give<00:01:45.240> them<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> bit<00:01:45.600> spray

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
if you choose to give them a bit spray

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.900 
if you choose to give them a bit spray
or<00:01:47.940> or<00:01:48.690> what<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.080> actually<00:01:49.530> prefer<00:01:50.010> is<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.760> be

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
or or what they actually prefer is to be

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.350 
or or what they actually prefer is to be
soaked<00:01:52.010> probably<00:01:53.010> two<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> three<00:01:53.820> times<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
soaked probably two to three times a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.650 
soaked probably two to three times a
week<00:01:54.410> these<00:01:55.490> with<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> thinner<00:01:56.850> leaves<00:01:57.120> will

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
week these with the thinner leaves will

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.690 
week these with the thinner leaves will
dry<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.050> more<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.860> you'll<00:01:59.040> probably<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.580> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
dry out more so you'll probably have to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.590 
dry out more so you'll probably have to
do<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.970> more<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.950> live<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.310> close<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:03.300> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
do it more I live very close to the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
do it more I live very close to the
beach<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.380> about<00:02:04.560> seven<00:02:04.890> blocks<00:02:05.130> away<00:02:05.310> in

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
beach just about seven blocks away in

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.420 
beach just about seven blocks away in
Southern<00:02:06.510> California<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:07.260> mine<00:02:07.470> live<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:08.070> the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
Southern California and mine live on the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.390 
Southern California and mine live on the
porch<00:02:08.810> outside<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> covered<00:02:10.890> porch<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.370> I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
porch outside on a covered porch and I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.060 
porch outside on a covered porch and I
probably<00:02:11.850> only<00:02:12.000> soak<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.780> about<00:02:13.500> about<00:02:13.890> once

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
probably only soak them about about once

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.950 
probably only soak them about about once
a<00:02:14.190> month<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:14.760> they<00:02:14.910> get<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.360> lot<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.780> moisture

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
a month but they get a lot of moisture

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.620 
a month but they get a lot of moisture
in<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.410> air<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:17.970> really<00:02:18.330> dry

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
in the air so if you are really dry

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.570 
in the air so if you are really dry
you're<00:02:19.050> going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.320> have<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.710> soak<00:02:20.100> them<00:02:20.310> more

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you're going to have to soak them more

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.840 
you're going to have to soak them more
if<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.630> have<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> really<00:02:22.440> humid<00:02:23.190> environment

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
if you have a really humid environment

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.310 
if you have a really humid environment
you're<00:02:24.000> not<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.630> soak<00:02:24.840> them<00:02:25.110> as

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
you're not going to have to soak them as

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.220 
you're not going to have to soak them as
much<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.210> just<00:02:27.360> put<00:02:27.750> them<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.050> pail

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
much and you just put them in the pail

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.920 
much and you just put them in the pail
and<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:29.370> submerge<00:02:29.880> them<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.600> let<00:02:30.780> them

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
and you submerge them and you let them

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.360 
and you submerge them and you let them
soak<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.800> about<00:02:32.090> 15<00:02:33.090> minutes<00:02:33.510> or<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.680> you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
soak for about 15 minutes or so and you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.830 
soak for about 15 minutes or so and you
want<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.670> make<00:02:35.790> sure<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.210> really<00:02:36.390> shake

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
want to make sure that you really shake

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.840 
want to make sure that you really shake
all<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.170> water<00:02:37.530> off<00:02:37.800> because<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.310> don't<00:02:38.580> want

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
all the water off because you don't want

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.700 
all the water off because you don't want
it<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> sit<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.390> there<00:02:39.540> especially<00:02:40.050> with<00:02:40.590> these

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
it to sit in there especially with these

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.790 
it to sit in there especially with these
bulbous<00:02:41.640> types

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
bulbous types

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.970 
bulbous types
it<00:02:43.250> may<00:02:43.700> sit<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.000> water<00:02:44.210> they<00:02:44.450> really<00:02:44.780> will<00:02:45.470> rot

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
it may sit in water they really will rot

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.620 
it may sit in water they really will rot
out<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.550> these<00:02:47.270> as<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.810> said<00:02:48.020> will<00:02:48.200> take

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
out and these as I said will take

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.530 
out and these as I said will take
a little<00:02:49.900> bit<00:02:49.990> more<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.530> soaking<00:02:50.890> up

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.630 

and<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.230> other<00:02:55.349> thing<00:02:55.590> about<00:02:55.680> watering<00:02:56.220> into

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
and the other thing about watering into

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.759 
and the other thing about watering into
is<00:02:56.849> that<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.120> do<00:02:57.360> not<00:02:57.540> want<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.989> soak<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.440> plant

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
is that you do not want to soak a plant

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.119 
is that you do not want to soak a plant
that's<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.459> flower<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.720> say<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.830> one<00:03:01.980> is

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
that's in flower so say if this one is

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.130 
that's in flower so say if this one is
flowering<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.330> don't<00:03:03.599> want<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.780> dunk<00:03:03.989> it

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
flowering and you don't want to dunk it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.440 
flowering and you don't want to dunk it
under<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:04.500> can<00:03:04.650> put<00:03:05.159> it<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.879> about<00:03:06.090> here<00:03:06.390> and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
under you can put it to about here and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.970 
under you can put it to about here and
give<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.870> good<00:03:07.019> soak<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.560> don't<00:03:07.799> want

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
give it a good soak but you don't want

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.610 
give it a good soak but you don't want
to<00:03:08.040> soak<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.760> whole<00:03:08.940> thing<00:03:09.209> actually<00:03:09.620> when

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
to soak the whole thing actually when

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.530 
to soak the whole thing actually when
it's<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:10.890> flower<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.610> best<00:03:11.849> thing<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.330> is

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
it's in flower the best thing to do is

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.100 
it's in flower the best thing to do is
to<00:03:12.720> spray<00:03:13.049> it

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.350 

we're<00:03:16.530> going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.740> talk<00:03:16.920> about<00:03:17.070> fertilizing<00:03:17.880> I

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
we're going to talk about fertilizing I

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.260 
we're going to talk about fertilizing I
do<00:03:18.870> not<00:03:19.470> fertilize<00:03:19.890> mine<00:03:20.520> but<00:03:20.880> they<00:03:21.030> grow

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
do not fertilize mine but they grow

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.330 
do not fertilize mine but they grow
outdoors<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.110> they<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.620> nutrients<00:03:23.190> from

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
outdoors so they get the nutrients from

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.820 
outdoors so they get the nutrients from
the<00:03:23.520> air<00:03:23.900> but<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.230> want<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.530> fertilize

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
the air but if you want to fertilize

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.000 
the air but if you want to fertilize
yours<00:03:26.460> they're<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.630> best<00:03:27.810> thing<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.080> use<00:03:28.200> is<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
yours they're the best thing to use is a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.000 
yours they're the best thing to use is a
fertilizer<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.270> specific<00:03:30.870> to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
fertilizer that is specific to

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.210 
fertilizer that is specific to
bromeliads<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.370> epiphytes<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.660> soak<00:03:33.900> it

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
bromeliads and epiphytes and you soak it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.590 
bromeliads and epiphytes and you soak it
probably<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.460> panel<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.940> can<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.360> soak<00:03:36.510> it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
probably in a panel you can you soak it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.140 
probably in a panel you can you soak it
in<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.780> pail<00:03:36.990> with<00:03:37.320> them<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:38.340> fertilizer

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
in a pail with them the fertilizer

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.390 
in a pail with them the fertilizer
probably<00:03:39.810> every<00:03:40.230> other<00:03:40.410> month<00:03:40.770> would<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.010> fine

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
probably every other month would be fine

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.910 
probably every other month would be fine
and<00:03:41.730> what's<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.270> is<00:03:42.690> going<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.050> do<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.440> it's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
and what's that is going to do is it's

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.160 
and what's that is going to do is it's
going<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.130> help<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.520> grow<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.300> little<00:03:45.930> bit

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
going to help it to grow a little bit

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.680 
going to help it to grow a little bit
faster<00:03:46.830> they<00:03:46.980> are<00:03:47.010> slow<00:03:47.490> growing<00:03:47.760> though<00:03:48.060> it's

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
faster they are slow growing though it's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.150 
faster they are slow growing though it's
going<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.870> help<00:03:49.020> them<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.350> pop<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> little<00:03:49.890> more

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
going to help them to pop a little more

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.720 
going to help them to pop a little more
and<00:03:50.490> it's<00:03:50.640> going<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:51.150> encourage<00:03:51.870> flowering

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
and it's going to encourage flowering

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.980 
and it's going to encourage flowering
and<00:03:54.710> air<00:03:55.710> circulation<00:03:56.250> air<00:03:57.030> circulation<00:03:57.660> is

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
and air circulation air circulation is

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.730 
and air circulation air circulation is
very<00:03:58.610> important<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.790> tell<00:04:00.000> anthias<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.900> all

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
very important to tell anthias and all

I'm going to say is just make sure that
your<00:04:04.380> your<00:04:05.130> air<00:04:05.400> plant<00:04:05.730> gets<00:04:06.090> good<00:04:06.360> your

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
your your air plant gets good your

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.690

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
circulation and you don't have to worry

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.000 
circulation and you don't have to worry
about<00:04:11.730> them<00:04:12.270> with<00:04:12.420> pets<00:04:12.780> because<00:04:13.500> these<00:04:13.830> are
