it and I traced it on this paper put it
on<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.350> computer<00:01:26.500> screen<00:01:26.800> traced<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:28.050> then<00:01:29.050> I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
on the computer screen traced it then I

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.450 
on the computer screen traced it then I
measured<00:01:29.500> everything<00:01:29.619> out<00:01:29.979> got<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
measured everything out got the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.300 
measured everything out got the
dimensions<00:01:31.330> so<00:01:31.420> we<00:01:31.570> got<00:01:31.750> like<00:01:31.929> ten<00:01:32.830> point<00:01:33.130> to

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
dimensions so we got like ten point to

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.279 
dimensions so we got like ten point to
five<00:01:33.580> inches<00:01:34.119> 3.5<00:01:35.020> inches<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:37.080> radius<00:01:38.080> on

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
five inches 3.5 inches the radius on

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.380 
five inches 3.5 inches the radius on
this<00:01:38.440> curve<00:01:39.660> 8.5<00:01:40.660> inches<00:01:40.690> right<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.179> go

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
this curve 8.5 inches right then I go

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.669 
this curve 8.5 inches right then I go
and<00:01:43.509> I<00:01:43.630> go<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:44.110> large<00:01:47.940> extent<00:01:48.940> this<00:01:49.119> giant

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
and I go to a large extent this giant

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:57.350 
and I go to a large extent this giant
protractor<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.929> got<00:01:55.929> this<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.319> six<00:01:56.770> mil

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
protractor so I got this a six mil

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.740 
protractor so I got this a six mil
plastic<00:01:58.710> sheeting<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:01.180> got<00:02:01.329> this<00:02:01.450> giant
