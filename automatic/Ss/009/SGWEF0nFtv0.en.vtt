00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.060
 calculated in the year that the supermarket chain is in existence with 9 to 3 years 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.890
 it all over and out for the oath 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.890
 the organization had to officially exist this week 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.739
 there are still a few supermarkets that defeat the name but they will become the 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:17.140
 coming time to built up and take off plus supermarket 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.560
 like here in Brabant for boys over 250 last year 

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:23.480
 gone once 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.079
 with a number of members as a different name 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.349
 and that's right for Brabant arrow I think this is now the 91 year existed 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.940
 That hurts even as a miner became after so many years 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.860
 that much 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.510
 I have thousands and thousands of people involved with that 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 now completely different 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.550
 the grocery store the ladies also is a hot matter so aisha 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.540
 they were friezes, but they came in the wake of many workers 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.530
 brabant when industrialization started there, they inquired 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.300
 together 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.880
 cheap groceries for the working class, breda stood for that is still 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.580
 on display in the c da muzeeum in helmond that is run by former director 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.580
 jeroen de wit 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.840
 two Dutchmen who like the simple two-color advertisements 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 the new owner vendex not that low prices image nos early nineties 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.930
 then this is no longer a year 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.190
 then the picture is complete 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.150
 went in the wrong direction 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.830
 because you can still shout so loudly that you come across but if you radiate this 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.340
 though it will not be easy to make that happen 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.350
 and according to experts, the new management responded too late to changes 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.729
 the prices did go up to pay for the beautiful plans of the parent company 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.729
 that are now called runners 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.200
 in here 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.020
 no no no 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.800
 because two ladies are merging into the new square where for murder h 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.210
 But Albert Heijn did not go to hell with a single one 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.960
 burglary wave 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.050
 runners almost went bankrupt, they tried to give the eta a new life 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.310
 to blow 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 if new ones fed a nice low then don't get enough time 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.850
 consumers of van der need where it needs to be adjusted that 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.479
 country the time and opportunity for is yes 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.389
 then you know it does not know more than is not driven properly 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.369
 because it had a solid base 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.569
 with others' lead time successful 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.790
 the signs are hung on the old and ida trainer as well as the museum itself 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.690
 the flagship of yesteryear is now the albert heijn
