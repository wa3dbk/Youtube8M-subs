00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
certain extent the build as in z3 got

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350 
certain extent the build as in z3 got
more<00:00:51.720> refined<00:00:52.199> than<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.769> z2<00:00:53.159> well<00:00:53.909> this<00:00:54.150> year

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
more refined than the z2 well this year

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.960 
more refined than the z2 well this year
it's<00:00:54.720> probably<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.409> same<00:00:55.650> thing<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
it's probably the same thing not that

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.780 
it's probably the same thing not that
big<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.540> processing<00:00:58.170> bump<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.610> have

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
big of a processing bump but we do have

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.119 
big of a processing bump but we do have
some<00:01:00.119> quite<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:00.989> significant<00:01:01.589> changes<00:01:01.769> in

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
some quite some significant changes in

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.329 
some quite some significant changes in
terms<00:01:02.729> of<00:01:02.940> building<00:01:03.150> z3<00:01:03.869> plus<00:01:03.900> so<00:01:04.890> first<00:01:05.100> off

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
terms of building z3 plus so first off

terms of building z3 plus so first off
let's<00:01:05.850> start<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.600> bill<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.140> terms<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
let's start with the bill in terms of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.910 
let's start with the bill in terms of
the<00:01:07.799> build<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.820> there's<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.330> something

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
the build this there's not something

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.320 
the build this there's not something
drastic<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.159> changed<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> new<00:01:12.030> phone

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
drastic that's changed in the new phone

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.350 
drastic that's changed in the new phone
what<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.530> essentially<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.850> more

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
what you see essentially is just more

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
what you see essentially is just more
refined<00:01:15.869> when<00:01:16.110> something<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> makes<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
refined when something that makes the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.030 
refined when something that makes the
phone<00:01:17.400> easier<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.939> handle<00:01:18.170> first<00:01:19.170> off<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.830> can

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
phone easier to handle first off you can

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
flap so that is a really big improvement

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.959 
flap so that is a really big improvement
and<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.569> also<00:01:42.749> see<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.409> thinner<00:01:43.920> phone<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.520> well

and you also see a thinner phone as well

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.419 
and you also see a thinner phone as well
as<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> less<00:01:45.390> wide<00:01:45.659> phone<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.289> it<00:01:46.859> is<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.219> a<00:01:47.280> big

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
as a less wide phone and it is not a big

as a less wide phone and it is not a big
mystery<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.600> xperia<00:01:49.259> phones<00:01:49.530> aren't<00:01:49.829> the

mystery that xperia phones aren't the

seeing only put forward some changes

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
seeing only put forward some changes

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.150 
we do retain the high res audio output
but<00:02:09.240> we<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> small<00:02:10.350> change<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
but we do see a small change in the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.180 
but we do see a small change in the
placement<00:02:11.850> of<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.300> front<00:02:12.780> firing<00:02:12.930> speakers

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
placement of the front firing speakers

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.010 
placement of the front firing speakers
it's<00:02:14.190> moved<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.910> little<00:02:15.270> closer<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> screen

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
it's moved a little closer to the screen

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.140 
it's moved a little closer to the screen
and<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
and the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.020 
and the
a<00:02:17.180> bit<00:02:17.599> wider<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.590> hoping<00:02:19.099> that<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.819> get

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
a bit wider so hoping that you get

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.839 
a bit wider so hoping that you get
better<00:02:20.180> sound<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:21.260> these<00:02:21.700> enhanced<00:02:22.700> or

better sound with these enhanced or

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.770 
better sound with these enhanced or
wired<00:02:23.060> speakers<00:02:23.470> now<00:02:24.470> let's<00:02:24.769> come<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
problem with the Snapdragon 810 was that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.979 
problem with the Snapdragon 810 was that
they<00:02:51.500> had<00:02:51.530> an<00:02:51.879> overheating<00:02:52.879> issue<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.840> was

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
they had an overheating issue it was

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.690 
they had an overheating issue it was
actually<00:02:54.200> really<00:02:54.530> pressed<00:02:54.889> it<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.099> present<00:02:55.489> in

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
actually really pressed it is present in

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.869 
actually really pressed it is present in
the<00:02:55.849> HTC<00:02:56.389> One<00:02:56.540> m9<00:02:56.690> as<00:02:57.079> well<00:02:57.920> as<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.340> G<00:02:58.489> flex<00:02:58.639> 2

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
the HTC One m9 as well as the G flex 2

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.420 
the HTC One m9 as well as the G flex 2
so<00:02:59.569> it's<00:02:59.750> kind<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.019> odd<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.440> see<00:03:00.590> Sony<00:03:01.010> going

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
so it's kind of odd to see Sony going

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.460 
so it's kind of odd to see Sony going
with<00:03:01.609> something<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.060> heats<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.810> saying<00:03:03.349> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
with something that heats and saying the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.800 
with something that heats and saying the
fact<00:03:03.739> that<00:03:03.920> glass<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.849> material<00:03:05.239> used<00:03:05.510> on<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
fact that glass the material used on the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.170 
fact that glass the material used on the
phone<00:03:06.019> has<00:03:06.560> this<00:03:06.769> sort<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.129> has<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.879> property

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
phone has this sort of has this property

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.140 
phone has this sort of has this property
to<00:03:08.689> heat<00:03:09.170> unevenly<00:03:09.799> it's<00:03:10.220> definitely<00:03:10.730> going

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
to heat unevenly it's definitely going

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.470 
to heat unevenly it's definitely going
to<00:03:11.239> be<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.389> big<00:03:11.780> problem<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.889> future<00:03:13.480> coming

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
to be a big problem in the future coming

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.179 
to be a big problem in the future coming
to<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.720> display<00:03:15.079> you<00:03:15.319> still<00:03:15.560> retain<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.040> same

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
to the display you still retain the same

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.280 
to the display you still retain the same
1080p<00:03:16.760> panel<00:03:17.150> which<00:03:17.389> I'm<00:03:17.569> actually<00:03:17.750> okay<00:03:18.019> with

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
1080p panel which I'm actually okay with

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.679 
1080p panel which I'm actually okay with
seeing<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.189> fact<00:03:19.430> that<00:03:19.579> most<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.299> time<00:03:20.480> in

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
seeing the fact that most of the time in

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.229 
seeing the fact that most of the time in
manufactures<00:03:21.379> move<00:03:21.769> to<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> 4k<00:03:22.430> IPS<00:03:22.849> panel

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
manufactures move to a 4k IPS panel

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.729 
manufactures move to a 4k IPS panel
you're<00:03:23.389> losing<00:03:23.780> out<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:23.989> your<00:03:24.290> battery<00:03:24.709> life

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
you're losing out on your battery life

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.550 
you're losing out on your battery life
so<00:03:25.370> it's<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.489> good<00:03:25.639> robe<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:26.030> Sony<00:03:26.419> to<00:03:26.660> stick<00:03:27.379> with

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
so it's a good robe a Sony to stick with

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.650 
so it's a good robe a Sony to stick with
the<00:03:27.650> 1080p<00:03:28.040> display<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.819> I<00:03:29.239> really<00:03:29.540> don't

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
the 1080p display and I really don't

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.720 
the 1080p display and I really don't
mind<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.139> being<00:03:30.319> a<00:03:30.410> 1080p<00:03:30.799> display<00:03:31.220> because<00:03:31.459> it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
mind it being a 1080p display because it

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.729 
mind it being a 1080p display because it
has<00:03:31.910> really<00:03:32.239> good<00:03:32.540> really<00:03:32.840> Chris<00:03:33.139> quality<00:03:33.620> and

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
has really good really Chris quality and

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.589 
has really good really Chris quality and
really<00:03:33.949> great<00:03:34.549> colors<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.180> doesn't<00:03:35.449> make<00:03:35.540> a

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
really great colors so it doesn't make a

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.020 
really great colors so it doesn't make a
big<00:03:35.810> difference<00:03:36.019> for<00:03:36.470> me<00:03:36.650> well<00:03:37.519> in<00:03:37.909> the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
big difference for me well in the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.699 
big difference for me well in the
battery<00:03:38.389> department<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.230> have<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.409> slight

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
battery department you have a slight

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.860 
battery department you have a slight
decrease<00:03:40.190> in<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.370> battery<00:03:40.790> size<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.269> told<00:03:41.720> you

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
decrease in the battery size I told you

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.050 
decrease in the battery size I told you
earlier<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.709> phone<00:03:42.949> is<00:03:42.980> less<00:03:43.370> wider<00:03:43.669> and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
earlier that the phone is less wider and

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.469 
earlier that the phone is less wider and
less<00:03:44.449> taller<00:03:44.780> so<00:03:45.349> that<00:03:45.650> definitely<00:03:46.400> led<00:03:47.180> to

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
less taller so that definitely led to

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.689 
less taller so that definitely led to
the<00:03:47.629> battery<00:03:47.989> becoming<00:03:48.379> smaller<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.310> 29

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
the battery becoming smaller it's a 29

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.460 
the battery becoming smaller it's a 29
30<00:03:49.970> million<00:03:50.239> per<00:03:50.510> badly<00:03:50.989> that's<00:03:51.229> on<00:03:51.379> the

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
30 million per badly that's on the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.430 
30 million per badly that's on the
device<00:03:51.739> now<00:03:51.979> and<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.519> do<00:03:52.579> not<00:03:52.760> expect<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.629> to<00:03:54.260> be

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
device now and I do not expect it to be

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.369 
device now and I do not expect it to be
a<00:03:54.470> big<00:03:55.159> change<00:03:55.540> because<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.989> fact<00:03:57.199> that

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
a big change because of the fact that

that most phones are heading towards
that<00:04:38.550> direction<00:04:38.669> I<00:04:39.240> know<00:04:39.569> Sony<00:04:40.050> makes<00:04:40.289> really

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
that direction I know Sony makes really

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.559 
that direction I know Sony makes really
good<00:04:40.740> cameras<00:04:41.250> but<00:04:41.639> it<00:04:41.759> is<00:04:41.969> really<00:04:42.240> time<00:04:42.509> for

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 
good cameras but it is really time for

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.689 
good cameras but it is really time for
them<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:42.960> upgrade<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.680> sensor<00:04:44.099> to<00:04:44.430> upgrade

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
them to upgrade the sensor to upgrade

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.490 
them to upgrade the sensor to upgrade
the<00:04:44.819> camera<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.389> to<00:04:45.689> make<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.110> bit<00:04:46.259> better

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
the camera and to make it a bit better

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.080 
the camera and to make it a bit better
seeing<00:04:47.189> the<00:04:47.280> fact<00:04:47.520> that<00:04:47.639> you're<00:04:47.849> still

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
seeing the fact that you're still

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.689 
seeing the fact that you're still
talking<00:04:48.360> about<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.919> 2012<00:04:49.919> camera<00:04:50.340> are<00:04:50.430> still

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
talking about the 2012 camera are still

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.480 
talking about the 2012 camera are still
on<00:04:51.169> 2015<00:04:52.169> phone<00:04:52.469> and<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.949> really<00:04:53.099> needs<00:04:53.370> to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
on 2015 phone and that really needs to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.459 
on 2015 phone and that really needs to
be<00:04:53.580> changed<00:04:53.789> in<00:04:54.389> terms<00:04:54.629> of<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.930> front<00:04:55.259> camera

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
be changed in terms of the front camera

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.439 
be changed in terms of the front camera
you<00:04:55.800> have<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.069> five<00:04:56.250> megapixel<00:04:56.909> camera<00:04:57.210> I

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
you have the five megapixel camera I

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.110 
you have the five megapixel camera I
guess<00:04:58.199> that's<00:04:58.530> good<00:04:58.830> because<00:04:59.340> I'm<00:04:59.849> not<00:05:00.060> a

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
guess that's good because I'm not a

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.969 
guess that's good because I'm not a
really<00:05:00.389> big<00:05:00.539> selfie<00:05:00.960> taker<00:05:01.199> but<00:05:01.590> that's<00:05:01.889> a

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
really big selfie taker but that's a

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.439 
really big selfie taker but that's a
good<00:05:02.129> upgrade<00:05:02.280> over<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.699> two<00:05:03.090> point<00:05:03.360> three

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
good upgrade over the two point three
