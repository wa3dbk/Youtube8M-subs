we're doing a review on a dual external
hard<00:00:16.230> drive<00:00:16.410> enclosure<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.610> hard<00:00:17.849> drive

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
hard drive enclosure so this hard drive

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.170 
hard drive enclosure so this hard drive
enclosure<00:00:18.150> allows<00:00:19.110> you<00:00:19.349> to<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.710> two<00:00:20.400> two

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
enclosure allows you to have two two

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.540 
enclosure allows you to have two two
terabyte<00:00:21.720> hard<00:00:21.960> drives<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.529> example<00:00:23.039> two

SATA<00:00:23.820> drives<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.509> raid<00:00:25.110> so<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.739> way<00:00:25.829> you<00:00:25.890> can

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
SATA drives in raid so that way you can

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.700 
SATA drives in raid so that way you can
have<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.550> back<00:00:26.759> up<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.590> have

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
have them back up right so you can have

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.499 
have them back up right so you can have
one<00:00:28.859> drive<00:00:29.070> back<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.279> each<00:00:29.580> other<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> that

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
one drive back up each other and that

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.009 
one drive back up each other and that
way<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:31.140> safety<00:00:31.410> redundancy<00:00:32.099> fail-safe

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
way you have safety redundancy fail-safe

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.920 
way you have safety redundancy fail-safe

all<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.420> need<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:56.030> looking<00:00:57.030> at<00:00:57.150> the

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
all you need for this and looking at the

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.179 
all you need for this and looking at the
back<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.689> have<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:58.019> fan<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.559> switches<00:00:58.979> if

00:00:59.179 --> 00:00:59.189 
back we have the fan and the switches if

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:01.490 
back we have the fan and the switches if
you<00:00:59.850> look<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.659> little<00:01:00.900> legend<00:01:01.350> there

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you look at the little legend there

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.820 
you look at the little legend there
there's<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.040> raid<00:01:03.110> switch<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> can

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
there's a a raid switch that you can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.399 
there's a a raid switch that you can
have<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> raid<00:01:05.430> 0<00:01:06.000> raid<00:01:06.090> 1<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:06.840> Naughton

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
have it to raid 0 raid 1 or Naughton

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.690 
have it to raid 0 raid 1 or Naughton
rate<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.369> two<00:01:08.520> regular

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
rate so you can have just two regular

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.090 
rate so you can have just two regular
drives<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.509> backing<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:10.080> each<00:01:10.229> other<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.920> can

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
drives not backing up each other you can

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.429 
drives not backing up each other you can
just<00:01:11.280> unlatch<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.360> at<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> bottom<00:01:12.900> open

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
just unlatch it here at the bottom open

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.680 
just unlatch it here at the bottom open
up<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> front<00:01:14.159> panel<00:01:14.790> lid<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> guess<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.660> just

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
up the front panel lid I guess and just

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.960 
up the front panel lid I guess and just
slide<00:01:16.230> in<00:01:16.440> your<00:01:16.710> favorite<00:01:17.190> drives<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.790> there

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
slide in your favorite drives in there

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.790 
slide in your favorite drives in there
like<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.510> said<00:01:18.690> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.900> put<00:01:19.080> two<00:01:19.290> identical

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
like I said you can put two identical

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.950 
like I said you can put two identical
drives<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.550> them<00:01:20.760> in<00:01:20.880> raid<00:01:21.120> so<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> one

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
drives have them in raid so that one

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
drives have them in raid so that one
Drive<00:01:22.230> will<00:01:22.530> always<00:01:23.040> backup<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> other

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
Drive will always backup the other

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.960 
Drive will always backup the other
basically<00:01:24.810> okay<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.830> redundancy<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.550> backup

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
basically okay for redundancy for backup

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
basically okay for redundancy for backup
for<00:01:27.180> failsafe<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.190> two

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
for failsafe or you can have two

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.610 
for failsafe or you can have two
separate<00:01:29.730> drives<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.570> identical<00:01:31.230> it<00:01:31.350> doesn't

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
separate drives not identical it doesn't

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.200 
separate drives not identical it doesn't
matter<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.010> then<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.850> work<00:01:33.030> as

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
matter and then they just work as

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
matter and then they just work as
separate<00:01:33.840> drives<00:01:34.080> that's<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.500> bottom<00:01:34.980> line<00:01:35.010> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
separate drives that's it bottom line so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640 
separate drives that's it bottom line so
put<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> cover<00:01:36.420> back<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.870> after<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.350> insert

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
put the cover back on after you insert

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.760 
put the cover back on after you insert
it<00:01:37.800> properly<00:01:38.330> put<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.479> latch<00:01:39.690> into<00:01:40.440> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it properly put the latch into the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.060 
it properly put the latch into the
locked<00:01:40.979> position<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.580> course<00:01:41.940> plug<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
locked position of course plug it in and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
locked position of course plug it in and
format<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.100> drives<00:01:44.430> away<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.760> go<00:01:45.000> basically

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
format your drives away you go basically

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.850 
format your drives away you go basically
that's<00:01:45.780> uh<00:01:45.990> pretty<00:01:46.229> much<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that's uh pretty much it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.010 
that's uh pretty much it
here<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.280> turned<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.120> the<00:01:48.240> led<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:48.900> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
