nice<00:04:11.260> group<00:04:11.620> at<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.370> moment<00:04:12.550> with<00:04:13.510> them<00:04:14.010> so

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
nice group at the moment with them so

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.860 
nice group at the moment with them so
that<00:04:15.040> should<00:04:15.519> be<00:04:15.730> when<00:04:16.299> they<00:04:16.450> roll<00:04:16.660> home

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
that should be when they roll home

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.479 
that should be when they roll home
together<00:04:17.079> we<00:04:17.560> should<00:04:17.620> have<00:04:17.889> a<00:04:17.919> nice<00:04:18.130> group

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
together we should have a nice group

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.860 
together we should have a nice group
that<00:04:18.729> we<00:04:18.850> can<00:04:19.030> then<00:04:19.209> look<00:04:19.389> at<00:04:19.510> releasing

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
that we can then look at releasing

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.740 
that we can then look at releasing
around<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.889> area<00:04:21.130> we've<00:04:21.880> seen<00:04:22.150> wild<00:04:22.540> woolly

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
around this area we've seen wild woolly

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.540 
around this area we've seen wild woolly
monkeys<00:04:23.169> around<00:04:23.320> here<00:04:23.680> we<00:04:23.800> know<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.130> exists

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
monkeys around here we know the exists

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.150 
monkeys around here we know the exists
we<00:04:24.790> know<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.090> area<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.630> hold<00:04:25.840> them<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.950> it's

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
we know the area to hold them so it's

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.870 
we know the area to hold them so it's
nice<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.700> see<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:28.120> one<00:04:28.690> day<00:04:28.720> she<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:30.460> gonna<00:04:30.729> be

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
nice to see that one day she is gonna be

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.969 
nice to see that one day she is gonna be
up<00:04:30.970> there<00:04:31.210> swinging<00:04:31.479> through<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.840> trees<00:04:31.979> with

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
up there swinging through the trees with

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:40.629 
up there swinging through the trees with
a<00:04:33.010> group

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.510 

so<00:04:41.270> being<00:04:41.539> a<00:04:41.629> vet<00:04:41.840> here<00:04:42.349> at<00:04:42.500> Mara<00:04:42.740> Sonia's<00:04:43.280> it's

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
so being a vet here at Mara Sonia's it's

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.959 
so being a vet here at Mara Sonia's it's
very<00:04:43.789> different<00:04:44.180> from<00:04:44.270> being<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.599> vet<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:45.050> a

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
very different from being a vet in a

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.059 
very different from being a vet in a
clinic<00:04:46.969> for<00:04:47.000> pets<00:04:47.389> in<00:04:47.719> the<00:04:47.870> UK<00:04:48.229> or<00:04:48.560> in<00:04:48.680> Europe

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
clinic for pets in the UK or in Europe

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.179 
clinic for pets in the UK or in Europe
or<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.310> states<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:51.199> animals<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.800> we<00:04:51.949> deal

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:52.189 
or the states the animals that we deal

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.029 
or the states the animals that we deal
with<00:04:52.250> they're<00:04:52.669> often<00:04:53.090> wild<00:04:54.050> they're

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
with they're often wild they're

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.830 
with they're often wild they're
generally<00:04:55.759> scared<00:04:57.310> some<00:04:58.310> of<00:04:58.430> them<00:04:58.639> are<00:04:58.840> not

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
generally scared some of them are not

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.830 
generally scared some of them are not
used<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.110> any<00:05:00.289> human<00:05:00.530> contact<00:05:00.860> at<00:05:01.310> all<00:05:01.569> so<00:05:02.569> for

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
used to any human contact at all so for

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.409 
used to any human contact at all so for
those<00:05:02.990> animals<00:05:03.590> we<00:05:04.310> have<00:05:04.340> to<00:05:04.669> balance<00:05:04.819> out<00:05:05.240> the

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
those animals we have to balance out the

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.480 
those animals we have to balance out the
need<00:05:05.599> to<00:05:05.629> examine<00:05:06.620> them<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.919> check<00:05:07.129> them<00:05:07.280> over

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
need to examine them to check them over

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.240 
need to examine them to check them over
to<00:05:07.610> handle<00:05:08.030> them<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.360> treat<00:05:08.629> them<00:05:08.840> with<00:05:09.650> the

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
to handle them to treat them with the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.610 
to handle them to treat them with the
stress<00:05:10.879> that<00:05:10.909> that<00:05:11.389> will<00:05:11.599> produce<00:05:12.020> with<00:05:12.439> them

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
stress that that will produce with them

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.879 
stress that that will produce with them
so<00:05:12.889> it's<00:05:13.009> a<00:05:13.099> very<00:05:13.279> different<00:05:13.669> way<00:05:13.819> of<00:05:14.889> treating

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
so it's a very different way of treating

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.709 
so it's a very different way of treating
the<00:05:16.159> animals<00:05:16.189> you<00:05:16.639> have<00:05:16.789> to<00:05:16.969> think<00:05:17.569> of

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
the animals you have to think of

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.480 
the animals you have to think of
different<00:05:17.840> ways<00:05:18.050> of<00:05:18.319> medicating<00:05:19.069> them<00:05:19.099> of

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
different ways of medicating them of

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.510 
different ways of medicating them of
treating<00:05:19.909> wounds<00:05:20.330> that<00:05:20.870> causes<00:05:21.370> the<00:05:22.370> least

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
treating wounds that causes the least

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.320 
treating wounds that causes the least
amount<00:05:22.849> of<00:05:23.000> been<00:05:23.120> hurt<00:05:23.479> as<00:05:23.689> possible<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:26.150> the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
amount of been hurt as possible but the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.059 
amount of been hurt as possible but the
whole<00:05:26.509> facilities<00:05:27.110> that<00:05:27.289> you<00:05:27.439> would<00:05:27.560> find<00:05:27.770> in

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
whole facilities that you would find in

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.250 
whole facilities that you would find in
a<00:05:28.159> clinic<00:05:28.490> in

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
a clinic in

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.010 
a clinic in
you're<00:05:30.890> for<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.310> States<00:05:31.670> or<00:05:32.000> Australia<00:05:32.390> New

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
you're for the States or Australia New

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.310 
you're for the States or Australia New
Zealand<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:34.220> just<00:05:34.490> don't<00:05:34.700> have<00:05:34.850> them<00:05:35.090> here<00:05:35.320> so

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
Zealand you just don't have them here so

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.750 
Zealand you just don't have them here so
if<00:05:36.440> we<00:05:36.560> need<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.740> do<00:05:36.890> an<00:05:36.980> x-ray<00:05:37.310> when<00:05:37.610> I<00:05:37.700> know

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
if we need to do an x-ray when I know

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.660 
if we need to do an x-ray when I know
what<00:05:37.970> we<00:05:38.120> take<00:05:38.390> a<00:05:38.630> 40-minute<00:05:39.440> journey<00:05:39.710> taking

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
what we take a 40-minute journey taking

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.820 
what we take a 40-minute journey taking
an<00:05:40.730> animal<00:05:41.000> in<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.180> car

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
the nearest ultrasound machine is about

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.969 
the nearest ultrasound machine is about
two<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:46.370> a<00:05:46.400> half<00:05:46.520> hours<00:05:46.909> away<00:05:47.620> so<00:05:48.620> you<00:05:48.680> just

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
two and a half hours away so you just

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.890 
two and a half hours away so you just
have<00:05:49.190> done<00:05:49.460> it's<00:05:50.000> a<00:05:50.120> challenge<00:05:50.509> you<00:05:50.659> have<00:05:50.750> to

have done it's a challenge you have to
think<00:05:51.080> of<00:05:51.169> different<00:05:51.440> ways<00:05:51.800> of<00:05:52.009> treating<00:05:52.479> the
