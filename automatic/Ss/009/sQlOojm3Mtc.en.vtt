00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:10.587
 Who did not play or had seen the first Sonic game at SEGA. 

00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:12.881
 But do you think you've seen everything already? 

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:16.726
 Well, today I bring a mystery about the Sonic rom The Hedgehog. 

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:18.859
 What we are going to do is use the program 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.119
 Esrael Sonic Editor I left in my video 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.497
 "How to edit Sonic games? (Loquendo)" 

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:26.237
 so that you yourselves can verify. 

00:00:26.238 --> 00:00:29.347
 Well, we open the program and then we go to "File", 

00:00:29.348 --> 00:00:33.711
 "Open rom" and from there we chose the rom of "Sonic The Hedgehog". 

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:40.823
 Now click on "Tools", 

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.835
 and then "Palette Editor". 

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:45.251
 Let's highlight the line that says "Sonic" 

00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:47.028
 by clicking on it. 

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:51.027
 Now we go to the second color, which is black, and click on it. 

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:53.359
 And we took the red color up. 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.658
 Now the second color is red. 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.024
 We hit "Save" and closed the window, 

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.524
 Finally we go in "Tools / Mixed", 

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:02.213
 And we marked the box that says: 

00:01:02.214 --> 00:01:04.219
 "Disable Checksum (red screen)" 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.170
 And we give in "Okey" 

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:11.221
 Now comes the mystery, 

00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:15.508
 We open the rom we have edited with the emulator Kega Fusion. 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.061
 Did you see those red letters? 

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:28.078
 They were camouflaged with the black background, but, 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.064
 when changing the letter palette, were exposed. 

00:01:32.065 --> 00:01:35.984
 Unfortunately, I do not understand what these scribbles say XD, 

00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:40.449
 but if it says that in reality they are the credits and nothing else.
