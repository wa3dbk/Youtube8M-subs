pounds one one day I'm 185 the next day
I'm<00:01:48.299> 190<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.619> crazy<00:01:49.799> how<00:01:50.430> much<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
I'm 190 it's really crazy how much I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.819 
I'm 190 it's really crazy how much I
fluctuate<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.750> definitely<00:01:51.960> notice<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.590> so

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
fluctuate and I definitely notice it so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.219 
fluctuate and I definitely notice it so
that's<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> affect<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.750> tightness<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that's going to affect the tightness of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
that's going to affect the tightness of
the<00:01:55.290> belt<00:01:55.530> especially<00:01:55.799> for<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> lever<00:01:57.030> belt

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the belt especially for the lever belt

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.999 
the belt especially for the lever belt
you're<00:01:57.840> gonna<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> undo<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you're gonna have to undo that all the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.260 
you're gonna have to undo that all the
time<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.369> me<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> would<00:01:59.729> just<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.030> such<00:02:00.240> a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
time for me it would just be such a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.950 
time for me it would just be such a
hassle<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.790> number<00:02:02.790> three<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.570> great

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
hassle and number three it's a great

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.630 
hassle and number three it's a great
learning<00:02:04.740> tool<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.820> order<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:07.069> not<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.520> as

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
learning tool in order to not have it as

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.040 
learning tool in order to not have it as
tight<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> Liebherr<00:02:09.629> boat

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
tight because with the Liebherr boat

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.160 
tight because with the Liebherr boat
you<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.470> make<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
you can make it

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.540 
you can make it
especially<00:02:11.470> tight<00:02:11.650> some<00:02:11.920> people<00:02:12.160> like<00:02:12.310> that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
especially tight some people like that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.390 
especially tight some people like that
but<00:02:13.090> what<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.599> felt<00:02:13.870> with<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.500> get<00:02:14.770> my<00:02:14.890> belt<00:02:15.130> to

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
but what I felt with I get my belt to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220 
but what I felt with I get my belt to
super<00:02:15.819> tight<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.690> can't<00:02:17.020> really

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
super tight is that I can't really

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.500 
super tight is that I can't really
expand<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.160> really<00:02:18.819> get<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.000> done<00:02:19.360> more

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
expand and really get that done more

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.910 
expand and really get that done more
pressure<00:02:19.750> as<00:02:19.930> much<00:02:20.170> because<00:02:20.410> I'm<00:02:20.530> not<00:02:20.680> really

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
pressure as much because I'm not really

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.790 
pressure as much because I'm not really
having<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.849> Eric<00:02:22.630> Cressey<00:02:22.780> kind<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.319> has<00:02:23.770> a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
having that Eric Cressey kind of has a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.070 
having that Eric Cressey kind of has a
nice<00:02:24.400> analogy<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.360> want<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.599> make<00:02:25.720> sure<00:02:25.750> your

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
nice analogy you want to make sure your

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.080 
nice analogy you want to make sure your
trunk<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.709> tree<00:02:26.950> trunk<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:27.640> huge

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
trunk is like a tree trunk really huge

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.780 
trunk is like a tree trunk really huge
and<00:02:28.300> really<00:02:28.870> able<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.560> withstand<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.250> lot<00:02:30.489> of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
and really able to withstand a lot of

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.420 
and really able to withstand a lot of
weight<00:02:31.120> rather<00:02:31.900> than<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.560> skinny<00:02:33.130> and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
weight rather than have it skinny and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.340 
weight rather than have it skinny and
cinched<00:02:33.850> up<00:02:33.970> all<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.360> way<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:35.110> really

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
cinched up all the way so you really

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.170 
cinched up all the way so you really
want<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.590> expand<00:02:35.950> through<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.970> great

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
want to expand through and the great

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.370 
want to expand through and the great
thing<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.810> when<00:02:38.080> you're<00:02:38.230> teaching

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
thing about that is when you're teaching

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.770 
thing about that is when you're teaching
someone<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.489> really<00:02:39.760> push<00:02:40.150> through<00:02:40.450> and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
someone you can really push through and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.530 
someone you can really push through and
tell<00:02:41.530> them<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.890> crush<00:02:42.459> through<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.120> it's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
tell them to crush through and and it's

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.120 
tell them to crush through and and it's
not<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.870> be<00:02:43.930> too<00:02:44.140> tight<00:02:44.410> for<00:02:44.440> them<00:02:44.800> to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
not going to be too tight for them to

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.130 
not going to be too tight for them to
push<00:02:45.790> through<00:02:45.940> because<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.330> adjust<00:02:46.450> and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
push through because you can adjust and

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.110 
push through because you can adjust and
you<00:02:47.170> can<00:02:47.350> see<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.340> different<00:02:48.640> holes<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:48.970> mean

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
you can see the different holes I mean

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.539 
you can see the different holes I mean
you<00:02:49.480> everyone<00:02:50.290> says<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.920> lever<00:02:51.100> belt<00:02:51.340> is

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
you everyone says that the lever belt is

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.600 
you everyone says that the lever belt is
very<00:02:51.900> consistent<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:54.280> know<00:02:54.370> use

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
very consistent but if you you know use

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.039 
very consistent but if you you know use
the<00:02:54.790> belt<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.209> count<00:02:55.450> down<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.840> holes

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
the belt and you count down the holes

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.140 
the belt and you count down the holes
like<00:02:56.290> for<00:02:56.440> me<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.890> size<00:02:57.130> medium<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.790> I

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
like for me this is a size medium and I

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.720 
like for me this is a size medium and I
go<00:02:58.330> down<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.810> sixth<00:02:59.140> hole<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.830> every<00:03:00.519> time

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
go down to the sixth hole so every time

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.840 
go down to the sixth hole so every time
I<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.480> consistent<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.170> that's<00:03:02.980> pretty

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
I can be consistent and that's pretty

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.570 
I can be consistent and that's pretty
much<00:03:04.330> really<00:03:05.319> good<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:06.190> want<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.459> be

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
much really good you want to be

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.820 
much really good you want to be
consistent<00:03:06.970> unless<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.989> want<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.350> play

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
consistent unless you want to play

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.250 
consistent unless you want to play
around<00:03:08.980> with<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.610> that's<00:03:10.480> probably<00:03:10.810> number

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
around with it so that's probably number

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.250 
around with it so that's probably number
two<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.980> reason<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.299> can<00:03:13.510> kind<00:03:14.200> of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
two to reason is that you can kind of

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.900 
two to reason is that you can kind of
play<00:03:14.470> around<00:03:14.500> with<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.010> tightness<00:03:15.220> if<00:03:15.760> you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
play around with the tightness if you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.140 
play around with the tightness if you
don't<00:03:16.090> want<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.420> particularly<00:03:17.200> tight<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.620> this

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
don't want it particularly tight in this

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.569 
don't want it particularly tight in this
specific<00:03:19.150> lift<00:03:19.660> like<00:03:19.870> for<00:03:20.049> me<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.380> tend<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.400> like

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
specific lift like for me I tend to like

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.180 
specific lift like for me I tend to like
it<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.850> little<00:03:22.239> bit<00:03:22.540> looser<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.590> squad

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
it a little bit looser in the squad

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.960 
it a little bit looser in the squad
compared<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.810> deadlifting<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.220> deadlift

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
compared to deadlifting so and deadlift

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.000 
compared to deadlifting so and deadlift
I<00:03:28.090> tend<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.359> make<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.170> little<00:03:29.290> tight<00:03:29.739> so

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
I tend to make it like a little tight so

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.069 
I tend to make it like a little tight so
