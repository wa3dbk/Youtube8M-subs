can<00:02:22.530> go<00:02:22.650> into<00:02:22.830> an<00:02:23.040> assignment<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.379> this<00:02:25.379> time

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
can go into an assignment and this time

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.650 
can go into an assignment and this time
you<00:02:25.799> could<00:02:25.980> say<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.370> assignment<00:02:26.970> 1<00:02:27.480> and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
you could say this is assignment 1 and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.569 
you could say this is assignment 1 and
you<00:02:30.660> could<00:02:30.930> give<00:02:31.170> some<00:02:31.290> instructions<00:02:31.980> for

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
you could give some instructions for

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.080 
you could give some instructions for
instance<00:02:33.079> submit<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.530> questions<00:02:34.799> at<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.819> end

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
instance submit the questions at the end

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.680
