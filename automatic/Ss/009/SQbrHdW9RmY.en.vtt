00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
force and then you can actually measure

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.929 
force and then you can actually measure
how<00:01:30.689> many<00:01:30.869> eighths<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.430> has<00:01:32.700> been

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
a sixteenth of an inch so if you go with
