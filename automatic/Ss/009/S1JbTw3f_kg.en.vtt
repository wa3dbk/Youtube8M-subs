hello

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
hello

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.060 
hello
I<00:00:08.700> just<00:00:09.510> watched<00:00:09.950> Discovery<00:00:10.950> Health

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
I just watched Discovery Health

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.459 
I just watched Discovery Health
Channel's<00:00:11.490> medical<00:00:11.910> mysteries<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.320> was

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
Channel's medical mysteries and it was

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.680 
Channel's medical mysteries and it was
the<00:00:14.250> one<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.670> covered<00:00:15.030> hours<00:00:15.299> down<00:00:15.480> lost

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
the one that covered hours down lost

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.970 
the one that covered hours down lost
syndrome<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.949> naturally<00:00:18.680> I'm<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:19.830> sure<00:00:19.949> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
syndrome so naturally I'm not sure I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.980 
syndrome so naturally I'm not sure I
watched<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:23.400> woman<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.359> covered

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
watched and the woman that they covered

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.349 
watched and the woman that they covered
I<00:00:26.420> heard<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.750> information

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
I heard a lot of information

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.840 
I heard a lot of information
she<00:00:30.359> went<00:00:30.720> over<00:00:30.840> they<00:00:31.289> covered<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:32.430> everyone

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
she went over they covered that everyone

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.430 
she went over they covered that everyone
thought<00:00:32.969> she<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> klutz<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.079> covered

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
thought she was a klutz and they covered

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.389 
thought she was a klutz and they covered
that<00:00:35.329> she<00:00:36.329> dropped<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.620> she<00:00:38.040> felt<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that she dropped things that she felt a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.360 
that she dropped things that she felt a
lot<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.640> weird<00:00:38.850> pain<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:40.020> doctors<00:00:40.980> told<00:00:41.219> her

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
lot of weird pain that doctors told her

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
lot of weird pain that doctors told her
to<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.520> splint<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.170> move<00:00:43.350> on

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to just splint it and move on

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.100 
to just splint it and move on
so<00:00:44.640> she<00:00:44.730> definitely<00:00:45.180> went<00:00:45.690> through<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so she definitely went through all the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
so she definitely went through all the
motions<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:47.059> having<00:00:48.059> EDS<00:00:48.510> undiagnosed<00:00:50.239> when

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
motions of having EDS undiagnosed when

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.850 
motions of having EDS undiagnosed when
she<00:00:51.390> finally<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.870> her<00:00:52.020> diagnosis<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.800> they

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
she finally got her diagnosis and they

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
she finally got her diagnosis and they
started<00:00:53.129> explaining<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.910> think<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.239> went

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
started explaining and I think they went

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
started explaining and I think they went
through<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> rather<00:00:54.870> quickly<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.620> their

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
through it rather quickly and their

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.139 
through it rather quickly and their
focus<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:57.870> surgery<00:00:58.800> rather<00:00:59.609> than

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
focus was on surgery rather than

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.939 
focus was on surgery rather than
splinting<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.960> pain<00:01:01.140> management<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
splinting and pain management which is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.219 
splinting and pain management which is
the<00:01:02.070> general<00:01:02.370> prognosis<00:01:02.789> surgery<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.989> an

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the general prognosis surgery is an

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.859 
the general prognosis surgery is an
option<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.820> feel<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> need<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> clear

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
option but I feel like you need to clear

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.830 
option but I feel like you need to clear
a<00:01:06.900> couple<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.320> things<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:08.450> first<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.630> all<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
a couple of things up first of all the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
a couple of things up first of all the
woman<00:01:10.080> had<00:01:10.200> had<00:01:10.380> over<00:01:10.650> 40<00:01:11.070> surgeries<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
woman had had over 40 surgeries to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
woman had had over 40 surgeries to
stabilize<00:01:12.540> her<00:01:12.750> joints

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
stabilize her joints

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.429 
stabilize her joints
it's<00:01:14.850> rather<00:01:15.090> impractical<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.810> stabilize<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
it's rather impractical to stabilize a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.640 
it's rather impractical to stabilize a
joint<00:01:17.030> every<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> joint<00:01:18.990> goes<00:01:19.170> loose<00:01:19.409> with

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

and<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:44.110> know<00:04:44.199> that<00:04:44.380> can<00:04:44.530> give<00:04:44.650> hope<00:04:44.800> to

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
everybody so you know the Bankart

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.520 
everybody so you know the Bankart
procedure<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:49.030> Schroeder<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.169> LaValley

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
procedure that Schroeder and LaValley

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.020 
procedure that Schroeder and LaValley
mentioned<00:04:51.009> seems<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.460> have<00:04:51.669> some<00:04:51.880> good
