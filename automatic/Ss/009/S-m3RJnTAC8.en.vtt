 hello with you my name is Irina and 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.550
 we are Moscow State 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.720
 University named Lomonosov at the bottom 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.210
 nvidia technology 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.760
 today where more than 200 have gathered 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.970
 undergraduate and graduate students from leading 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.689
 technical universities of Moscow, mission gurus 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.210
 mp3 world bauman and many many others 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.150
 already day technology nvidia 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.070
 This is a unique opportunity to talk about 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.220
 What is our company doing? 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.470
 what innovations do we bring to the world 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.900
 computer games in the world of mobile 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.870
 computing to the world of professional 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.330
 visualization and for us this is another 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.989
 opportunity to tell how our 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.250
 technologies may allow young 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.100
 researchers speed up their calculations 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.720
 or make it possible to solve those problems 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.839
 which used to be easy 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.220
 impossibility hub and nvidia ingu 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.670
 longtime friends are here 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 research Center 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.399
 where the octave centers 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.119
 next to me is a legendary man 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.130
 Vladimir Valentinovich 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.079
 voivode deputy director 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.600
 research 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.750
 sensitive center lives here 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.860
 main super tablet or country mom 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.780
 built in 1 tell for solution 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.079
 these tasks 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.759
 used task a huge amount 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.560
 for what is used clematis and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.929
 designing new materials so that they 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.880
 were light and durable we all love 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.369
 watch beautiful movies and cartoons 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.079
 on not many suspect that in fact 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.149
 Deal these technologies by which 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.189
 they are created is worked out in systems 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.049
 scientific institutions of commercial companies 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.360
 for this is just as used in 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.340
 super computer wormworms we are used to 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.079
 the fact that the car and reliable vegetable 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.879
 beautiful safe but in order to 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.770
 it happened almost all the elements 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.840
 problems having worked with 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.220
 supercomputer technology parts behind 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.690
 this again is done based on 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.480
 Today we told not only the company 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.109
 in general, about how the Moscow office lives 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.910
 one 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.100
 this is one of the largest offices 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.810
 companies in europe more than a hundred 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.930
 high-class engineers 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.069
 they take part in all the important 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:33.510
 projects such as driver updates 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.030
 shield creation game for developers and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.280
 many many others it is here with us 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.220
 Moscow is an engineer who 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.019
 worked on effects in batman games 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.459

 are interested in 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.069
 graphics technology and software 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.159
 engineering 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.159
