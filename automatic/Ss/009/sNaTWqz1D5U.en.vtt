00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.300
 hi onis today they are going to learn how to make two 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.180
 super easy nail designs for 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.150
 bring in this summer in the first 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.449
 design we are going to use green enamel 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.999
 yellow coffee and white 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.529
 first paint your index finger and pinky 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.529
 Green color 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.509
 and the rest of your nails in white 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.489
 then I took yellow enamel with a 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.489
 pointer and draw an oval 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.940
 and half of another one in the corners of 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 each nail you painted in white 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.000
 let it dry and then grabbed a brush 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 with fine tip and mark the entire contour 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.640
 of the ovals that you drew before 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.559
 the kitty sign inside the pineapple and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.559
 draw the outline of the others 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.820
 and do the crown on the top 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.480
 with the green color that you painted at 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.480
 other nails 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.090
 and at the end apply a layer of enamel 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.780
 transparent and our nails pineapple is 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 for analysts 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.690
 for the design of cherries we are going to 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.700
 use enamel red green rosita 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.280
 cake and white 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.250
 first paint your middle and ring finger 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.700
 Rosita then the rest of your nails 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.310
 Red 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.500
 in fact the order does not matter so much one 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.470
 is because they can also do the design 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 in all the nails this already depends on 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.350
 everyone then make three lines of 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.860
 white color on each nail that you painted 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.860
 rosita 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.520
 for the cherries the two circles almost 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.000
 together with the pointer and others in 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.000
 corners 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.680
 Take a toothpick with green enamel and 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.140
 draw the stem of each 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.570
 You can do this on the side or below 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.060
 to make the design more creative and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.570
 to finish two points of color 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.570
 White 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.049
 and your cherry fingernails will be ready 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.239

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.360

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.150
