00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
you have to use it now right here this

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.660 
you have to use it now right here this
this<00:02:27.780> border<00:02:28.260> here<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.680> laying<00:02:29.100> or<00:02:29.430> lazy

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
this border here is laying or lazy

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.080 
this border here is laying or lazy
stitch<00:02:30.180> beadwork<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.980> called<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.610> lane

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
stitch beadwork this is called a lane

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.000 
stitch beadwork this is called a lane
right<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.440> these<00:02:35.310> little<00:02:36.200> units<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.860> are

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
right here these little units here are

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.880 
right here these little units here are
called<00:02:38.430> rows<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.660> lane<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.290> made<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.680> of

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
called rows so the lane is made up of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.510 
called rows so the lane is made up of
rows<00:02:41.190> if<00:02:41.550> you're<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> change<00:02:42.840> color

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
rows if you're not going to change color

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.890 
rows if you're not going to change color
within<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:45.500> row<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.030> up<00:02:48.240> these

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
within the row you can but up these

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.090 
within the row you can but up these
beads<00:02:49.230> are<00:02:49.410> much<00:02:49.620> bigger

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
beads are much bigger

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.670 
beads are much bigger
for<00:02:50.459> instance<00:02:50.820> than<00:02:51.060> these<00:02:51.330> beads<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.260> you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
for instance than these beads and you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.800 
for instance than these beads and you
can<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.730> they're<00:02:54.150> bigger

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
can you can just see it they're bigger

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.750 
can you can just see it they're bigger
than<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.200> than<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.650> blues<00:02:56.100> these<00:02:56.400> yellows

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
than the than the blues these yellows

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.970 
than the than the blues these yellows
are<00:02:56.910> bigger<00:02:57.090> than<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.420> dark<00:02:57.630> blue<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.200> it

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
are bigger than the dark blue and it

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.270 
are bigger than the dark blue and it
doesn't<00:02:59.310> really<00:02:59.430> matter<00:03:00.410> because<00:03:01.410> there's

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
doesn't really matter because there's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.150 
doesn't really matter because there's
not<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.850> change<00:03:03.510> within<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.260> row<00:03:04.440> if<00:03:04.680> you're

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
not a change within the row if you're

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.670 
not a change within the row if you're
going<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.370> change<00:03:05.670> patterns<00:03:06.030> or<00:03:06.900> colors<00:03:07.050> to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
going to change patterns or colors to

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.729 
going to change patterns or colors to
make<00:03:07.800> tab<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.840> make<00:03:09.840> your<00:03:10.019> pattern<00:03:10.230> within

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
make tab to make your pattern within

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.890 
make tab to make your pattern within
this<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.130> row<00:03:11.459> then<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.870> a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
this little row then you have to be a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.660 
this little row then you have to be a
little<00:03:13.019> more<00:03:13.290> concerned<00:03:13.680> about<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.220> size<00:03:14.489> of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
little more concerned about the size of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.970 
little more concerned about the size of
your<00:03:14.730> beads<00:03:15.769> but<00:03:16.769> if<00:03:16.890> not<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.850> really<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:19.019> kind

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
your beads but if not it really is kind

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.289 
your beads but if not it really is kind
of<00:03:20.160> what<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:20.910> work<00:03:21.239> with<00:03:22.820> if<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:23.880> makes

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
of what you can work with if that makes

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.980 
of what you can work with if that makes
sense

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.310 

right<00:03:28.470> here<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.570> think<00:03:30.570> there's<00:03:30.810> some<00:03:31.050> there's

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
right here I think there's some there's

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.440 
right here I think there's some there's
some<00:03:31.380> size<00:03:31.770> difference<00:03:32.340> here<00:03:32.730> on<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.060> strap

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
some size difference here on the strap

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.800 
some size difference here on the strap
and<00:03:33.900> certainly<00:03:34.770> on<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.250> edge<00:03:35.370> beating<00:03:35.880> I'm

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and certainly on the edge beating I'm

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.180 
and certainly on the edge beating I'm
going<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.110> show<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.320> edge<00:03:37.590> beating<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.070> little

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
going to show you edge beating a little

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.110 
going to show you edge beating a little
bit<00:03:38.400> later<00:03:38.640> here<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.740> these<00:03:40.740> are<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.820> to

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
bit later here and these are just to

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.650 
bit later here and these are just to
save<00:03:42.360> time<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.720> kind<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.440> acro<00:03:44.660> technique

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
save time and kind of a acro technique

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.740 
save time and kind of a acro technique
was<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:45.990> use<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.830> bit<00:03:47.430> larger<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.180> pony<00:03:48.420> beads

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
was to use a bit larger like pony beads

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.300 
was to use a bit larger like pony beads
because<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.770> kind<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.100> time-consuming

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
because this is kind of time-consuming

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.060 
because this is kind of time-consuming
and<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.660> took<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.050> little<00:03:52.320> bit<00:03:52.440> less<00:03:52.620> time<00:03:52.830> and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
and this took a little bit less time and

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.610 
and this took a little bit less time and
adds<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.850> little<00:03:54.000> bit<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.330> kind<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.110> textural

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
adds a little bit of kind of textural

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.720 
adds a little bit of kind of textural
interest<00:03:55.770> I<00:03:56.160> guess<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.730> might<00:03:56.850> call<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:59.720> okay
