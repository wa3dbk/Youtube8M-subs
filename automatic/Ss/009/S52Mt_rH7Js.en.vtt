probably give it a seven or eight maybe

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:26.909 
probably give it a seven or eight maybe
because<00:07:23.849> the<00:07:24.849> soft<00:07:25.089> ears<00:07:25.509> that's<00:07:25.989> why<00:07:26.259> I<00:07:26.289> would

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 
because the soft ears that's why I would

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:31.439 
because the soft ears that's why I would
recommend<00:07:27.869> the<00:07:28.869> events<00:07:29.649> so<00:07:30.519> the<00:07:30.669> avatars<00:07:31.089> but

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:31.449 
recommend the events so the avatars but

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:33.329 
recommend the events so the avatars but
you<00:07:31.599> know<00:07:31.740> events<00:07:32.740> are<00:07:32.829> pretty<00:07:33.099> expensive

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:33.339 
you know events are pretty expensive

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:35.249 
you know events are pretty expensive
they<00:07:33.789> are<00:07:33.819> I<00:07:34.300> think<00:07:34.659> they're<00:07:34.779> running<00:07:35.019> about
