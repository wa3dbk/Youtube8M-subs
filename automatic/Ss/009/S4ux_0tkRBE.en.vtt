games very smoothly without any lags it
warmed<00:07:11.010> up<00:07:11.160> a<00:07:11.310> little<00:07:11.340> which<00:07:12.150> is<00:07:12.270> pretty

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
warmed up a little which is pretty

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.780 
warmed up a little which is pretty
normal<00:07:12.660> for<00:07:12.900> any<00:07:13.290> smartphone<00:07:13.680> to<00:07:14.460> be<00:07:14.580> more

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.790 
normal for any smartphone to be more

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.640 
normal for any smartphone to be more
precise<00:07:15.180> it<00:07:15.450> did<00:07:15.690> not<00:07:15.810> have<00:07:16.110> any<00:07:16.290> heating

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
precise it did not have any heating

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.510

issues<00:07:17.010> at<00:07:17.190> all

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 
issues at all

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.320 
issues at all
so<00:07:18.300> gaming<00:07:18.750> for<00:07:18.930> 20<00:07:19.200> minutes<00:07:19.470> consumed<00:07:19.980> about

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
so gaming for 20 minutes consumed about

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.940 
so gaming for 20 minutes consumed about
13%<00:07:21.330> of<00:07:21.390> battery<00:07:21.810> which<00:07:22.380> is<00:07:22.410> pretty<00:07:22.740> great

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 
13% of battery which is pretty great

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.890 
13% of battery which is pretty great
considering<00:07:23.490> that<00:07:23.820> the<00:07:24.240> games<00:07:24.450> were<00:07:24.630> played

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
considering that the games were played

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.720 
considering that the games were played
on<00:07:25.110> full<00:07:25.380> brightness<00:07:25.500> and<00:07:26.010> we're<00:07:26.550> high

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
on full brightness and we're high

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.000 
on full brightness and we're high
graphics<00:07:27.150> as<00:07:27.330> well<00:07:27.410> so<00:07:28.410> I<00:07:28.440> was<00:07:28.740> really

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
graphics as well so I was really

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.800 
graphics as well so I was really
impressed<00:07:29.370> by<00:07:29.580> the<00:07:29.730> battery<00:07:30.150> consumption<00:07:30.510> as

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
impressed by the battery consumption as

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.200 
impressed by the battery consumption as
well<00:07:30.870> as<00:07:31.200> the<00:07:31.320> performance<00:07:31.500> of<00:07:32.070> the<00:07:32.220> note<00:07:32.370> 4<00:07:32.610> so

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.210 
well as the performance of the note 4 so

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.370
