00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199

 dreyer with the pure strike of julien sanded 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.300
 watch as its benefits from 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.960
 sabella who hits first 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.550
 intention he 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.079
 gorgeous sent behind his briefcase 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.239
 confident because that's where he got 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.240
 shown very explosive focus well on his 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.610
 supports springs well do not know seen 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.380
 with this first period and rhythmic 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.380
 with ideye maiga 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.289
 it's perfectly played the shift 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.289
 i love martin 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.720
 the parade of david ospina this 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.360
 meet in every sense of the game 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.570
 speed and great gestures 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.730
 commission goes fast with Martin little 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.240
 shifted sogecap continue this g with some 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.000
 solutions 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.000
 maiga maiga that shifts idem 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.410
 the typical Sochalian action the pellet 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.090
 before speed and finally day that 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.420
 find the way to the nets it's 1-0 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.350
 it's well deserved for this jump 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.880
 it's a beautiful left she me 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.550
 look and that's their double no to face 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.240
 with here this solution which is to 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.010
 interior 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.960
 and then turn it over we see the 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.190
 Mayan complicity idea this time 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.020
 frames put the ball out of reach 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.760
 but it is at the end it must be pointed out 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.190
 a collective movement of great beauty 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.480
 which is significant of the mito 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.440
 of Australians who could have scored 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.430
 the other one with a marvin martin is 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.200
 outdated 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.310
 marvin martin is a little offbeat is 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.819
 cursed water 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.220
 guy who saw there lebron brand civelli 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.700
 it's over he sends this balloon on the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.849
 huge ospina pole opportunity for 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.849
 Sochaux 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.480
 Nicolas Maurice belay yet it 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.489
 Sochaux 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.489
 with the speed the center of sauget 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.099
 he is exceptional mute ryad 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.379
 many play they have the wind 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.330
 are young but what talent is it 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.420
 extraordinary and it's 3 0 for 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.220
 sochaux who regales strong you have what 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.260
 creates one- way attraction move this 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.730
 center then resume the tension goes up 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.830
 but the equity that tries to overflow 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.200
 after here it's good because we feel 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.150
 immediately and there he is really 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.430
 hyper well balanced look at this 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.440
 Super fly is magic because 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.230
 the idea he takes the ball from the blow of 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:15.609
 foot and then who crucifies stage ospina 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:17.790
 of the jump of the wolf as well to his thrust these 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.790
 standards 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:26.999
 in martin they are made no but no 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.709
 these Sochaux look on this balloon of 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.120
 back or leave a little control l 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.769
 attacker who is alone one gave martin 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.480
 what intelligence what 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.950
 subtlety he had seen that it was 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.469
 advanced he lob it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.969
 it is absolutely beautiful the youth 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.980
 Sochaux to power a loan you from 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.129
 you and his volley is martin and this lob 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.629
 and it's really fantastic 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.400
 look how well done in the end 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.069
 nor plurial relies on evene of the ja 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.500
 all the intelligence of martin a body 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.290
 is difficult for Eric Roy who 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.780
 still remained 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.900
 it is extracted from salt in you 11 matches 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.939
 without defeat and 21 games played since 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.069
 his taking office a single defeat 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.980
 in front of the olympique de marseille 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.519
 last season it was a stunt 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.519
 for the history 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.769
 above is past modibo maiga or almost 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.049
 faced with petkovic 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.500
 this is again modibo maiga in 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.500
 the area of â€‹â€‹repair 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.700
 two nuggets on modibo maiga intake 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.380
 it's 4 to 0 still a bit of a 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.960
 goal from elsewhere to look at himself but he 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.760
 is here that physically imposes itself by 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.650
 report to his opponent who is going to have a 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.970
 little success of the mission of 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.050
 I spent the night there I think he 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.610
 was drinking goblins because you had the 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.320
 little glance that he actually chooses 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.550
 to come back inside place them the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.420
 ball out of reach of the guardian his 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.420
 great shapes
