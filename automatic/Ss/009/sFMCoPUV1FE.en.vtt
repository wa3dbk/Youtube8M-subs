00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.360
Well we've still got some boxes lying around...

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.920
- So what's in those boxes?
-Uh actually, I'm not too sure myself

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.500
Well I was cleaning up, and I just got a lot
of stuff in.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.360
Oh so... There was a lot of stuff, but
now these are left over?

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.960
Right, right, so it's kinda scary isn't it?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.020
- I'm a bit afraid of opening them...
- Should we just leave them?

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.960
- Leave them?
- I know, let's open them in half a year!

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.580
Uh, why?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.460
- What you sayin'?
- Yes! There we go!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.740
I guess I have to say it here!

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.180
Right dawg!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.500
- "Right dawg"? Really?
- I guess you wouldn't say that.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.640
But Yoko, that, you know, "natural"-ness...
Where did you pick that up?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.620
Well you know, I go shopping every day...
I've been listening.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.800
- Ah so learning by ear?
- I have good ears.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.620
- I'm learning by ear.
- You're learning by ear.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.800
You know how they have those learn-by-listening
English learning tools?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.480
Where you just listen?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.320
Actually who cares about that.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.380
Anyway, don't you think we've bought too 
many electronics since coming here?

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.140
You know... Like... That automated vacuum cleaner?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.880
- I thought you said you wanted that?
- Well it was more like, it would be NICE to have one...

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.980
I didn't think we'd get all this so soon.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.300
We have bills to pay, and this stuff will cost us...

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.400
You're charging everything all the time,
have you been unplugging those at all?

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.680
- This move cost us a lot too, you know.
- Right, I'll do that. 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.000
But Yoko, you've got this plugged in too.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.900
- It's probably charged by now.
- No no, this is different.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.160
- There's something I was going to try.
- Like what?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.500
Since we moved, I took this opportunity to
start using one of these.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.820
We can actually... Meter our electricity bill
on a smartphone!

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.680
Say what? What do you mean?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.120
So this is our bill from last month, and for this month...

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.480
What!? See look, we've been using way too much!

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.480
- You're right.
- Way too much, I knew it

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.960
It's your, uh, weird camera charger thing.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.680
- No wait, then it's my fault?
- Of course.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.620
So now we can see it. We can see it coming.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.100
Ok. So let's think of ways to save electricity.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.780
Yeah.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.200
- So...
- What do we do?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.380
So Yoko, you tend to leave the light on
around the sink...

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.120
- ...so let's turn that off.
- Got it, I'll be careful.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.480
And then... You can be a new Yoko.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.480
- Nice.
- A new you.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.240
- "A new Yoko... Begins here."
- Exactly.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.600
So the amount that we save...

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.460
The amount we save on our bills...
With that money...

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.860
...we go to NYC.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.420
"The new Yoko, goes to New York."

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.960
You're good!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960
- Right dawg!
- You're good, real good.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.200
But really though, I think we should
have fun doing it.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
You're right.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.400
- What else?
- What else...

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.460
They say that if when you open your refrigerator
to get something...

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.780
...if you leave it open too long, it hikes up the electricity bill.
- Yeah it does.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.600
So...

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.720
Ok so how about this. How about we...
Do it together?

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.180
- I like that!
- So I take out the milk...

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.580
- Milk's kinda tough, isn't it?
- Then what?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.720
- Let's start with something easier...
- Like cod roe?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.720
Cod roe? Cod... roe?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.440
Yeah. So... I got it.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.620
Open!

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.880
Ready...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.260
Can you do it faster? Ok so, so...

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.220
- So check to see if it's really cod roe.
- Hey the roe's gonna... Go splat.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.520
Check to see if it's roe.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.120
- It is.
- What a relief! We did it!

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.240
But if we hurry we might squash the roe...

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.960
- It won't get THAT fast. 
- What??

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.540
- So you mean, like... It'll run up against containers 
when we take it out?
- Right right.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.340
- And the specks will get squashed?
- Well no, I mean we might squeeze it in our hands.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.700
- Since we're in such a hurry.
- Oh I see. Then...

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.340
I got it. Let's do it more gently.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.660
Oh but... I got it. I'll do it fast.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.800
- Right. The opening and closing, you mean.
- Exactly.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.940
Why? What do you mean?

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.320
Cuz how else would you do it??

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.320
- I get it.
- What is there besides open-close?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.080
- Should we give calls?
- Calls? What calls?

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080
- Should we?
- Like "YOISA!"

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.600
Like that?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.560
Sure. So here we go.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560
- Ready...

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.440
SEIRA!

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.820
- Egg!
- Bride!

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.120
- SOIYA!
- Mayonnaise!

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120
Whatyousay!?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.360
- SOIYA!
-Milk!

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.780
-SOIYA!
-Mayonnaise!

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.320
-Saywha!?
- Milk!

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.020
Damn straight!

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.020
What is this?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.440
Butter!
