00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.230
 hi guys okay this video is well 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.260
 quickie just to show how I do 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.400
 to sleep with my braids and a 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.650
 option is to have a cap like this 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:24.689
 here is the all famous of 6 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.609
 It's very simple to make you take a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.060
 pantyhose 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.260
 op would be the legs, then I cut 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.480
 a piece and I will use this part that is the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.350
 part of butt nÃ© 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.980
 we then use that much and I cut 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.980
 I'll make a knot 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.489
 our Prossegur ada you can cut 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.780
 A little tips and it stays that way then 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.920
 this is up to one method that I most use 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.939
 huh 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 is to sleep I quite like it and I 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.759
 I do so I put my shield on 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.759
 low 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.880
 leaving the door firmly that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.100
 bring it there and take it to make a coke 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.530
 also the top of the head putting everything 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.130
 well inside so the braids in 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.130
 all hair 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.399
 This is all right up everything. 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.399
 behind I pick up the stump here 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.180
 bye 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.569
 there is not a very beautiful thing there 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.500
 look but anyway that's how I do to 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.140
 to sleep 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.409
 It 's very practical. It holds very well. 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:27.140
 with her help clear not undo 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.310
 both braids do not loose much does not give 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.760
 very frizz 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.480
 so this is very good, it 's not pretty 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.379
 but it is very good and also has 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.970
 the satin caps have the pillowcases of this 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.220
 It's also very good, I'm not 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:50.319
 I have none of this I use this team more 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.319
 and now another thing that I use is this 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:59.180
 it is very small but you can Teo 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:03.439
 have a larger light that is square 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.090
 so also you can have're going out and 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.599
 there also the same thing to her for all 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.599
 low 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.319
 the IACC one right rinha 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:32.370
 a little just to tie the 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:35.389
 scarf that the house is here to take first 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.389
 ahead 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:49.280
 I tied up here and I'm done right. 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:08.390
 now I have to brain your mind 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:08.390
 so came pulling me I arrived like this 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:31.710
 I can see that 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:34.710
 I'll do it, but only later if I 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.140
 I wish I could take this one, said the senator. 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:44.820
 Then I'll go rolling deck and then there. 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:48.860
 comes with a touch on the amateur 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.860
 big just to affirm a touch 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.500
 and it's okay to stay like this 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.210
 Ezequiel, I do it more like this when I 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.139
 I take my braids shops in 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.560
 so to a use so in the first month I 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.500
 I use this team to why this 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.180
 last time I did it was very hot with the 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.819
 I felt a little warm in the 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.970
 This head supported me so I used it 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.810
 this silence that I thought was not 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.360
 so hot 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.410
 but this one also holds very well the 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:33.479
 do not leave too much dust and 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:35.280
 too much of the blanket and then 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.500
 This is also very good here . 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:45.720
 put it there and be a little more beautiful 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:48.180
 Who plays my dog here and there? 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.669
 Jet, that's what I do to sleep, it's okay. 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.220
 practical and easy and helps a lot not to 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:57.000
 as much as I spoke so much the fluff 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.819
 so much the other hair is good for 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.860
 you stay with the braids more ground 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.570
 That's it, I'll be right back with another video and 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:09.620
 Cutting me down as soon as I'm down. 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.620
 Beautiful, is not it, see you later, Shaw?
