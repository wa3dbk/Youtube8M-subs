00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 so that you can see how to configure 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.220
 Welcome back to our channel 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.250
 Today we are going to teach you how to improve 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.740
 sign of my cell phone at rest and huawei 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.269
 610 very easy very simple procedure 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.460
 but before you invite them 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.080
 subscribe to our channel and click 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.420
 there are endorsements and subscribe to your charges 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 subscription is completely free and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.689
 that way they can be aware of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.539
 all our new videos and leave the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.369
 questions comments or suggestions 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.050
 so if we want to improve the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.910
 our cell signal is because 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.329
 obviously we have a very low signal 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.489
 or soon the data is very slow or 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.469
 we have no connection to any of the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.820
 options that we have previously 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.670
 mentioned you can go well the next 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 procedure normally when you 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.020
 we love what for now that leave us 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.969
 because we have no signal and usually what 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.940
 we stick we will say no then turn off the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.559
 cell remove the battery momentarily and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.449
 I'll wear it again to learn 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.699
 your cell phone and this basically is with the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.489
 so that the phone disconnects from 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.219
 the network and then reconnect to a 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.320
 to the network and in this way it gets 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.510
 a better very probably better 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 get a better exception 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.560
 connects an antenna with more power but 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.150
 to avoid having to remove the stack of 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.980
 do this procedure we can do 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.180
 the following we enter here by 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.030
 configuration we go to the class more then 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.710
 we enter mobile networks and what 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.770
 we do is enter here where it says 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.200
 network operator in network operators what 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.640
 what we are going to do is choose 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.650
 automatically when you give this option what 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.840
 we do is the phone 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.480
 disconnect and again go back to 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.370
 connect to the network operator 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.590
 we can also re-enter here 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.780
 by network operators tell 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.970
 select manually and this process 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.150
 a little bit longer since it will make a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.030
 new network search and while we 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.790
 will remove the option to select the network to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.310
 which we belong in the case 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 that does not leave our network that is by 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.060
 example that if we are movistar and 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.340
 movistar does not appear on this list is 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.040
 because we are definitely very 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.080
 away from networks or antennas 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.510
 then it is impossible for us to have a signal 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.000
 then we would have basically is that 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.650
 relocate them but if in this case the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.470
 operator of us here is a 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.110
 movistar 3g we select them and so 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.600
 again we register in the network by 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.850
 here below said to register in the network and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.370
 that 's another way to improve the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.060
 signal reception another way that 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.459
 we can do 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.670
 is to do the following for example if 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.849
 we are in a stadium or we are in a 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.310
 concert or we're in a caravan or in 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.420
 a place where there are many people these 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.870
 places where there are many people 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.060
 normally they make the network 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.519
 saturates and it's because everyone is 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.340
 connected to a particular antenna or to 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.870
 several antennas of the sector but by the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.720
 number of people there 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.830
 the system is saturated for us 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.660
 avoid this we should do the following 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.580
 normally everyone has those 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.090
 smartphones that connect 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.459
 using the 3g network as you can see 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.069
 if they do not connect in the long 13 it 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.140
 connect to the 4g network but most of 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.540
 have connected to 13 and what we should 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.480
 do us is to get down to a 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.450
 lower than what is the network 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.640
 12 if we passed 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.849
 momentarily at that moment in the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.560
 the line 12 therefore saturates Asaja 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.049
 we are going to be in a network that our 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.810
 saturates leaving everyone in 13 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.640
 where already on the internet with the data or 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.650
 the phone is saturated then for 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.209
 that where we have here where it 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.660
 network preferences and we select only 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:53.170
 psm this single gsm option is the option 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:55.030
 well 12 ready as you will see it does not say 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.420
 here after him but only says 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.239
 which is a network that is slower but 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.140
 alan but it's a network that has higher 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.079
 coverage by the width size of 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.000
 band has more cancer and out of that 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.010
 everyone is mounted in your mind 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.020
 in another network and how to attract is 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.360
 saturated 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.470
 a lower grip of the technology 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.470
 previous and I can navigate momentarily 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.520
 while it is something from that point of 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.350
 saturation and when I go back to my house or 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.450
 When the concert is over, the fair 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.550
 that it be then I go back and set my 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.810
 phone and I give you the first option that 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.070
 He says 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.230
 in automatic mode 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.760
 basically that was it for this video 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.090
