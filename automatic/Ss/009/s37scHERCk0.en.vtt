00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.920 
before it even came in to where Mars is
it<00:03:22.040> passed<00:03:22.310> through<00:03:22.730> our<00:03:22.970> solar<00:03:23.420> system's

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
it passed through our solar system's

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
already hit the earth they've already

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.710 
already hit the earth they've already
gone<00:03:43.130> down<00:03:43.190> through<00:03:43.700> our<00:03:43.820> atmosphere<00:03:44.060> and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
gone down through our atmosphere and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.020 
gone down through our atmosphere and
burned<00:03:45.380> up<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.950> whatnot<00:03:46.280> some<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.760> them<00:03:46.850> have

hit<00:03:47.180> terra<00:03:47.450> firma<00:03:47.709> we<00:03:48.709> just<00:03:48.980> had<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.610> really

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
hit terra firma we just had a really

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.960 
hit terra firma we just had a really
spectacular<00:03:50.360> view<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.440> one<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.670> came

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
spectacular view of one that came

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.880 
spectacular view of one that came
through<00:03:53.209> our<00:03:53.329> atmosphere<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:54.079> lit<00:03:54.380> up<00:03:54.560> nearly

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
through our atmosphere and lit up nearly

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.520 
through our atmosphere and lit up nearly
a<00:03:55.010> third<00:03:55.549> of<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:56.329> atmosphere<00:03:56.510> was<00:03:57.019> really

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
a third of the atmosphere was really

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.699 
a third of the atmosphere was really
really<00:03:57.739> spectacular<00:03:58.010> from<00:03:58.579> space<00:03:59.530> so<00:04:00.530> we've

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
really spectacular from space so we've

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.890 
really spectacular from space so we've
got<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:00.920> debris<00:04:01.519> coming<00:04:01.880> at<00:04:02.269> us<00:04:02.299> already

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
got that debris coming at us already

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.800 
got that debris coming at us already
from<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> asteroid<00:04:04.040> belt<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.700> this<00:04:05.570> thing

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
from the asteroid belt and this thing

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.390 
from the asteroid belt and this thing
that<00:04:05.959> just<00:04:06.230> went<00:04:06.530> through<00:04:06.799> our<00:04:07.570> atmosphere<00:04:09.400> it

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
that just went through our atmosphere it

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.240 
that just went through our atmosphere it
was<00:04:10.670> an<00:04:10.820> asteroid<00:04:11.420> it<00:04:11.600> was<00:04:11.750> not<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.959> meteor<00:04:12.590> we

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
was an asteroid it was not a meteor we

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.789 
was an asteroid it was not a meteor we
people<00:04:13.970> think<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.600> meteorite<00:04:15.140> is<00:04:15.440> just

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
people think that the meteorite is just

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.830 
people think that the meteorite is just
you<00:04:16.010> know<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.160> smaller<00:04:16.549> asteroid<00:04:17.209> no<00:04:17.660> they're

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
you know a smaller asteroid no they're

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.409 
you know a smaller asteroid no they're

different animals an asteroid is has a

different animals an asteroid is has a
different<00:04:20.930> makeup<00:04:21.290> and<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.560> was<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.769> small

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
different makeup and it was a small
