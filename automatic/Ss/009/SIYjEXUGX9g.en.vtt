should be thinking about if they have an
idea<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.280> hardware<00:00:45.910> idea<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:46.539> they're

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
idea a hardware idea and they're

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.660 
idea a hardware idea and they're
thinking<00:00:47.079> about<00:00:47.170> crowdfunding<00:00:47.670> definitely

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
thinking about crowdfunding definitely

so as you're starting to think about I
want<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.120> bring<00:00:52.359> this<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.719> life<00:00:52.749> and<00:00:53.109> I<00:00:53.199> want<00:00:53.530> to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
want to bring this to life and I want to

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.549 
want to bring this to life and I want to
crowd<00:00:53.829> fund<00:00:53.890> for<00:00:54.309> it<00:00:54.429> um<00:00:54.809> figuring<00:00:55.809> out<00:00:55.960> how

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
crowd fund for it um figuring out how

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.739 
crowd fund for it um figuring out how
how<00:00:57.249> are<00:00:57.429> you<00:00:57.550> going<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.820> engage<00:00:57.999> to<00:00:58.449> make<00:00:58.600> sure

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:58.749 
how are you going to engage to make sure

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.360 
how are you going to engage to make sure
that<00:00:58.899> you<00:00:58.989> get<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.260> at<00:00:59.440> least<00:00:59.649> first<00:01:00.010> thirty

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
that you get that at least first thirty

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.639 
that you get that at least first thirty
percent<00:01:00.820> traction<00:01:01.449> so<00:01:01.929> with<00:01:02.109> IndieGoGo<00:01:02.559> it

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
percent traction so with IndieGoGo it

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.500 
percent traction so with IndieGoGo it
works<00:01:02.859> that<00:01:03.159> typically<00:01:03.999> the<00:01:04.089> first<00:01:04.300> thirty

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
works that typically the first thirty

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.210 
works that typically the first thirty
percent<00:01:04.870> comes<00:01:05.199> for<00:01:05.350> friends<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:05.740> family

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
percent comes for friends and family

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.910 
percent comes for friends and family
second<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.090> Go<00:01:07.240> Go<00:01:07.390> factor<00:01:07.780> once<00:01:08.170> you've<00:01:08.439> you

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
second the Go Go factor once you've you

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.800 
second the Go Go factor once you've you
found<00:01:09.189> that<00:01:09.520> activity<00:01:09.970> both<00:01:10.240> from<00:01:10.450> your<00:01:10.600> side

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
found that activity both from your side

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.080 
found that activity both from your side
their<00:01:11.049> side<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.530> starts<00:01:12.159> moving<00:01:12.399> your<00:01:12.729> Boulder

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
their side it starts moving your Boulder

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.630 
their side it starts moving your Boulder
down<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.450> hill<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.079> then<00:01:14.470> then<00:01:15.130> that's<00:01:15.369> when

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
down a hill and then then that's when

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.130 
down a hill and then then that's when
pressed<00:01:16.000> hits<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.479> everything<00:01:16.750> else<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.020> it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
pressed hits and everything else and it

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.230 
pressed hits and everything else and it
just<00:01:17.380> helps<00:01:17.619> take<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.220> catapult<00:01:18.939> you<00:01:19.090> to

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
just helps take you to catapult you to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.319 
just helps take you to catapult you to
success<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:20.259> start<00:01:21.070> find<00:01:21.640> where<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:21.850> initial

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
success so start find where that initial

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.230 
success so start find where that initial
audiences<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.320> engage<00:01:23.890> them<00:01:24.159> early<00:01:24.579> so<00:01:25.090> then

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
audiences and engage them early so then

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.330 
audiences and engage them early so then
they<00:01:25.630> can<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:25.990> continuous<00:01:26.649> evangelist<00:01:27.189> as

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
they can be continuous evangelist as

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.219 
they can be continuous evangelist as
you're<00:01:27.549> going<00:01:27.759> forward<00:01:28.060> that's<00:01:28.869> great<00:01:29.110> now

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
you're going forward that's great now

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.899 
you're going forward that's great now
what<00:01:29.439> kind<00:01:29.649> of<00:01:29.710> resources<00:01:30.009> are<00:01:30.340> available<00:01:30.460> to

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
what kind of resources are available to

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.999 
what kind of resources are available to
someone<00:01:31.210> who<00:01:31.329> wants<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.810> put<00:01:32.500> something<00:01:32.860> up

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
someone who wants to put something up

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.880 
someone who wants to put something up
that<00:01:33.640> they've<00:01:33.789> made<00:01:33.960> definitely<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.350> we

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
that they've made definitely so we

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.469 
that they've made definitely so we
actually<00:01:36.100> just<00:01:36.340> developed<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.090> hardware

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
actually just developed a hardware

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.300 
actually just developed a hardware
handbook<00:01:37.960> especially<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:38.799> people<00:01:38.920> who<00:01:39.100> are

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
handbook especially for people who are

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.819 
handbook especially for people who are
making<00:01:39.549> things<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:40.990> I<00:01:41.020> would<00:01:41.320> say<00:01:41.500> look<00:01:41.680> at

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
making things and so I would say look at

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.279 
making things and so I would say look at
that<00:01:42.039> and<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.640> will<00:01:42.700> give<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.000> like<00:01:43.840> rules<00:01:44.110> of

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
that and it will give you like rules of

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.340
