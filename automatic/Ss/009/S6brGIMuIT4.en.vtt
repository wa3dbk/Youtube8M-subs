00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.970
 hello that such welcome to a new 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.400
 video on this occasion we are going to see a 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.130
 very easy and very simple way to power 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.050
 make a paper plane okay first that 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.530
 nothing, I recommend that you use what 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.630
 are recycled sheets this to be 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.150
 friendly to the environment if it is 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.010
 good as I comment on this occasion 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.410
 in this video we are going to see a very 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.570
 easy and very simple to make a 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.020
 paper plane first of all we're going to 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 fold what is the leaf in half 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.560
 A) Yes 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.180
 in half after here we return to 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.690
 do another doubles in half like what 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.360
 I show in this video 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.840
 A) Yes 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.270
 well we unfold half and we're going to 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.930
 make two small folds in what 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.830
 it would be coming in 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.830
 double is like that 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.460
 and the other fold on this side 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.020
 very well we have been one more figure or 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.670
 less so now we are going to bend them towards 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.670
 in like this 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.370
 this tab inwards 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.150
 also this other 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.150
 inward 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.570
 As you can see we have left a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.020
 figure more or less 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.899
 A) Yes 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.899
 well now we only fold in half 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.979
 and we squeeze 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.979
 that is tight 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.040
 and now it's enough to double the two 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.710
 lashes out these will be the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.710
 wings of what is our paper airplane 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.640
 and the same thing on the other side to it 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.510
 height we make the same fold 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.510
 outward 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.650
 very good because we already have it there what 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.320
 it's our little paper airplane there what 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.759
 they have good because that has been all for the 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.130
 At the moment I hope you liked the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.920
 video if you liked it please like it 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.100
 and see you in a next video up 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.100
 then
