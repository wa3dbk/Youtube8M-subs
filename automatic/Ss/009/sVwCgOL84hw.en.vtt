00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
do we have inside don't mind the cat if

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
do we have inside don't mind the cat if
she<00:01:08.159> jumps<00:01:08.369> into<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> shot<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.869> are<00:01:10.140> doing

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
she jumps into the shot we are doing

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.920 
she jumps into the shot we are doing
this<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:10.950> take<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:14.540> rip<00:01:15.540> box

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
this in one take so we have a rip box

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.050 
this in one take so we have a rip box
first<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:19.430> all<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.820> looks<00:01:21.000> like

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
first of all all right so it looks like

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570 
first of all all right so it looks like
each<00:01:21.390> box<00:01:21.720> has<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.080> couple<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.710> dims<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.340> there

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
each box has a couple of dims in there

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.819 
each box has a couple of dims in there
and<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:25.430> huge<00:01:26.900> corsair<00:01:27.900> vengeance<00:01:28.409> cooling

and this huge corsair vengeance cooling
fan<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> memory<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.290> was

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
fan for the memory so we know what was

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.140 
fan for the memory so we know what was
in<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.590> box<00:01:32.009> let<00:01:32.280> me<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.729> out<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
in that box let me get this out of the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.940 
in that box let me get this out of the
way<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.990> else<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.470> let's<00:01:37.979> see

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
way and what else is in here let's see

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.109 
way and what else is in here let's see
there's<00:01:40.950> something<00:01:41.400> much<00:01:41.520> bigger<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
there's something much bigger on the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.639 
there's something much bigger on the
bottom<00:01:43.159> try<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> make<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> mess<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.619> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
bottom try not to make a mess so this is
