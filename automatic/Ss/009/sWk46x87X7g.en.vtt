00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
so yeah if you go on fanfiction it's

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.770 
so yeah if you go on fanfiction it's
under<00:05:53.070> books<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:53.760> it's<00:05:54.000> under<00:05:54.300> darkest

to say um my fanfictions are rated M so

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.920 
to say um my fanfictions are rated M so
there's<00:06:29.610> one<00:06:29.820> that<00:06:29.970> has<00:06:30.090> a<00:06:30.120> pretty<00:06:30.450> graphic

rape scene in it so it's probably not

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.630 
rape scene in it so it's probably not
the<00:06:35.550> best<00:06:35.670> thing<00:06:35.910> to<00:06:36.030> say<00:06:36.330> right<00:06:36.570> now<00:06:37.400> but<00:06:38.400> um
