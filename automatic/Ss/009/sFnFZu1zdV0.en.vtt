00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.470
 appeals to what you are just footing what 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.059
 For example, you also recommend many 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.070
 live coaching and berlin coatings 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.380

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.430
 only possible expels no matter what it is 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 she will not even be legs for example 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.460
 if you're on a date and you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.960
 something happens totally impossible 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.550
 no idea which protects the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.039
 resource surface a shirt or something 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.599
 is something in the moment you say 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.670
 you if you just the woman to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.500
 shoots and says oh my god i believe 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.270
 that's the best thing that ever happened to me 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.950
 first world happened and then let 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.870
 At the moment it's just not over 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.180

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.670
 First of all, that was fun and eating 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.379
 So I am rather little on ice so the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.809
 only where i where i where i all 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.260
 breaking barriers and criticism helps because yes 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.699
 is called and I consider that was as that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 was much worse as a teenager 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.690
 and I was on the first date and he leaves 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 in single or yes and I'm there 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.460
 this one in this delicious dips and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:14.520

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.659
 and did so really where can properly 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.479

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.189

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.869
 that's what happened to me as well 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.790
 made about it and I was like in the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.240
 language one and a half years together so 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.920
 That was a nice time now let yourself 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.390
 that you have to say we have that e 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.189
 mails a bit at a date but it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.610
 happened to me but my world so 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.079
 the woman 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 and then she had to continue 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.640
 expand and the country has at 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.320
 ice cream and she is as or and the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.299
 and the hall ball is so hot 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.369
 shipped and the hemispheres are noticeable 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.040
 once down and jackets neckline on 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.490

 important this is then just 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.910
