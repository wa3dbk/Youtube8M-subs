00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.510
 not everyone who takes pictures makes sense 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.790
 to spend hundreds of euros on one 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.700
 camera the choice is therefore often limited 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.090
 but also once thought of these people 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.980
 samsung puts one with this wb30f 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.540
 very affordable device to market for 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.390
 anyone with a tight stock market 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.169
 Well you don't have to expect much 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.559
 the device 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:33.100
 16.6 megapixels make their house a simple hd 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:35.110
 film oh so that is 720p and in addition 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.760
 some is then options such as one 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.269
 possibility to set the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.500
 iso or the white balance is more interesting 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.269
 the zoom range 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.640
 with ten times optical zoom, the 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.989
 wb30f despite the fierce moderate 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.629
 Specifications 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.089
 interesting means such a thing 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.530
 that brings your subject even closer 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.989
 without you having to be closer 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.069
 to come up with something else funny is the 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.649
 built - in wi-fi 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:01.449
 well imagine you are on your way and you 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.699
 want to send a photo to a home front 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.090
 then you just have to connect 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.800
 with a wireless wireless network or 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.380
 with your smartphone 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.220
 if you use this as a hotspot please ask 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.440
 Is however 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.600
 who will use that and send from 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.430
 is a photo or video with a smartphone 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.440
 maybe a bit simple 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.680
 The disadvantage is that you probably 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.330
 what compromises on image quality and it 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.920
 also funny filters and creative 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.080
 possibilities on the device 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.300
 so that you yourself with split frame two 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.220
 take a picture or put your own head 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.140
 on the front page of, for example, a 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.960
 Newspaper from Samsung also has to 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.980
 economize to make the wb30f and affordable 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.450
 to hold 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.500
 and that can be seen in, for example, the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.760
 display screen this is made up of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.350
 230,000 pixels 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.450
 and alongside that causes a bad one 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.240
 viewing angle but also in the field of 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.010
 image quality is skimped 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.650
 fortunately the wb30f offers enough 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.600
 image quality in most situations 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.340
 such as during the day or at 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.200
 sufficient sunlight 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.200
 the device sometimes has difficulty 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.910
 to focus correctly sometimes he just counts the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.800
 wrong things sharp or you need one 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.590
 keep a good distance from your subject 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.480
 uberhaupt you get pictures screen 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.069
 set higher demands on your photos and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 photograph in low light 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.569
 pan unfortunately does not let the device go 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.150
 and little remains of the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.920
 image quality without flash is it in 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.530
 dark environments even quite a challenge 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.510
 to take sharp photos 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.190
 the higher ISO values â€‹â€‹ensure a lot 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.190
 rice and long detailed image 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.629
 photos but also colors become gray and gray 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.319
 gray 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:41.709
 so this is a movie shot with the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:47.069
 samsung wb30f 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.069
 and low budget camera from samsung 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.550
 and this is the image quality in the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.550
 evening hours 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.590
 make that the wb30f 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.900
 settled device well that certainly not because 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.120
 for 125 euros we also do not have to 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.010
 expect a lot for the simple work 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.680
 meets the device and sit and even 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.410
 some interesting features such as 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.269
 for example, the substantial zoom range 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.160
 do n't think your wifi is important and wants 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.819
 you have some more image quality 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.799
 consider the sony dsc rx100 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.260
 the bill offers image quality anyway 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.260
 just a little more than this competitor 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.790
 wb30f unfortunately gets the device 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.180
 therefore no buying tip 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.420
 but we can and still blowde with 3 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.420
 stars
