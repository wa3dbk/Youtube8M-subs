00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.640
 like to turn the view on and off 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.710
 the engine is also where he likes 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.190
 Now first transfer include the first 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.380
 transfer as you see the designation 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.450
 put the shift lever 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:31.130
 returning the same neutral position 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.130
 the second and the third 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:42.000

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.000
 4 5 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.720
 here is the bridge lever 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.989
 leave in position 5 gears and drive 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.730
 further written to the form written 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:03.360
 neutral transfer that we had 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:06.069
 need to do in the window where 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.079
 written to hold the transmission while pressed 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:14.560
 the button put a tick double click 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:19.599
 click there where necessary is neutral 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:23.579
 transfer and return the lever from the position 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.579

 installed though 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:40.049
 designation does not register reverse 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:54.310
 so the parking lights each puts there 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:04:01.239
 where he needs his turn signal from me 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.819
 it's on the steering wheel everything is at hand so you can not 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.180
 forget to put the seat belt 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.180

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:22.590

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.650
 I switch speeds 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:32.960
 everything works even the turn signal rotates 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.960
 steering wheel 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:47.450

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:47.450
 position lever speed back forward 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.870

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.190
