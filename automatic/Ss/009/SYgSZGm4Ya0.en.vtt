about<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.310> face<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.880> also<00:02:30.300> with<00:02:30.420> that

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
about that face you also with that

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.330 
about that face you also with that
person<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.200> all<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.590> sudden<00:02:32.010> are<00:02:32.160> more

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
person you all of a sudden are more

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.780 
person you all of a sudden are more
receptive<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.990> you<00:02:33.990> see<00:02:34.230> them<00:02:34.440> more<00:02:34.650> clearly

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
receptive to you see them more clearly

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.510

so<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.030> other<00:02:36.540> state<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.319> quite<00:02:37.770> powerful

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
so this other state is quite powerful

00:02:38.520 --> 00:03:08.450 
so this other state is quite powerful
and<00:02:38.730> magical<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:40.020> real

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.490 

in<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.700> world<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.090> dance<00:03:10.360> we<00:03:11.080> use<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.470> term

lead and follow as a tradition but

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.370 
lead and follow as a tradition but
personally<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.700> don't<00:03:16.300> think<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.930> word<00:03:17.080> follow

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380

and that requires intelligence and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.330 
and that requires intelligence and
experience<00:03:43.480> like<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.410> interpreter<00:03:44.950> let's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
experience like the interpreter let's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.740 
experience like the interpreter let's
say<00:03:45.490> for<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.760> United<00:03:46.210> Nations<00:03:46.330> for<00:03:46.720> a

you're<00:03:51.940> alive<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.450> you're<00:03:52.720> active<00:03:53.380> your<00:03:53.530> mind

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
you're alive and you're active your mind

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.460 
you're alive and you're active your mind
is<00:03:54.010> active<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.870> traditional

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
women's role in dancing it's harder they

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.580 
women's role in dancing it's harder they

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.700 
function let's see in a radio
transmission<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.720> lot<00:04:04.960> easier<00:04:04.990> than<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
transmission is a lot easier than the

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.350 
transmission is a lot easier than the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
more and that's her role it's not easy

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.820 
more and that's her role it's not easy

she might have I made a mistake so the

she might have I made a mistake so the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
dynamic is much more fun than those

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.380 
dynamic is much more fun than those
