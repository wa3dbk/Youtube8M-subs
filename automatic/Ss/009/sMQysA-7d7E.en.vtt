00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.150
 alexander hello that as I said is mine 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.080
 favorite is the whole country had to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:15.240
 is from the show the good of tesa 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.850
 imported bremer vahr storm with ex 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 storm so cocky hours exactly that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.600
 the courage I have now the courage from the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.490
 brought the sea but is just then 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.800
 exactly the same color 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 is also after than the jacket so too 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.340
 with plenty of space for projectors in it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.800
 up here for the little ones 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.750
 can enter strife stretches 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.350
 you also feel good about it 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.809
 Internet has nothing to say the head 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.670
 to hide bottles and of the paint 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.360
 Color is the classic good we learn 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.300
 that since 1980 to 2005 about 2005 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.309
 been scarce 80-2001 bit of fancy 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 So have good land introduced in 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.960
 Vietnamese times are more like the Elbe 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 have been bigger so country high 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 bit larger not even know 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.750
 the trousers themselves also classic 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.030
 also focus and cut 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.240
 in the lower area as well 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.310
 cut as the default of the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.070
 all marazzi good metalfest that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.939
 personally the coolest more best after 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.630
 from the fabia 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.570
 I personally can stain this 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.009
 seeing this pea print as bad 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.950
 So I find it unpleasant for the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.640
 just look like that and the finish will have 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.590
 cool for outdoor activities 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.780
 you have to like what urban 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.820
 but that's why it's good 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 Enough, I am just accepting to see and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.360
 I make such a compromise I do not think so 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.820
 that it's like that when I'm multi 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.250
 cam gawk and ex glee that it is so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.979
 the extremely effective japanese yet 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.680
 but nowadays it is certainly better 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.480
 as the universal planning the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.540
 something is cool with the army 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.149
 the market of regimes and canadians 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.890
 One of them has become very cool 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.090
 Effectiveness when it comes to something 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 then read it is pretty interesting 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.340
 the theme of what the colors can do there 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.410
 One must meat for that exactly 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.110
 after what one gets that right is 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.970
 Made from 100 percent cotton rebstock 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.430
 I also very comfortable to wear and 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.930
 just the cause is just me you have to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.490
 maybe I have the jacket I show it 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:37.890
 So you get the jacket in rs 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.890
 then very well cut 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.860
 but can say that 's just like that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.310
 is wanted or that says okay so 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.920
 actually seen good as I have 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.770
 really cool freedom of movement and wide 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.600
 that is really great so the cost is 30 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.320
 euro cans 30 euros because it does not 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.080
 wrong 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.800
 the real area I am that good 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.970
 Freedom of movement is cool too 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.370
 I can do everything with a balancing act 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.370
 do what she has so there is one 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.989
 outdoor car history or commuter 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.750
 story if he is not in flecktarn 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:16.480
 wanted to believe rum why not cool 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.070
 this could also look great 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:26.280
 did you find these these questions I think 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:33.360
 has quite good others say it's good on the job 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.360
 but I have gotten from
