00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.410 
think about this with a skeptical mind
but<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.790> we're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> talk<00:01:36.299> about

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
but that's not we're going to talk about

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.910 
but that's not we're going to talk about
because<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> doesn't<00:01:37.320> matter<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.590> commander

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
because it doesn't matter if commander

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.319

is going to be in battlefield 4 or not

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.219 
is going to be in battlefield 4 or not
because<00:01:39.570> we're<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> talk<00:01:40.110> about

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because we're going to talk about

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.660 
because we're going to talk about
whether<00:01:40.590> or<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.009> should<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.549> in

forever<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.450> put<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> lot<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.079> battlefield<00:01:46.649> 2<00:01:46.799> in

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
forever I put a lot of battlefield 2 in

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.700 
forever I put a lot of battlefield 2 in
2142<00:01:47.640> those<00:01:48.000> were<00:01:48.149> my<00:01:48.299> burden<00:01:48.659> butters<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.229> did

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
2142 those were my burden butters I did

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.800 
2142 those were my burden butters I did
play<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.159> bit<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.460> 1942<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.689> as

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
play a little bit of 1942 but not as

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.149 
play a little bit of 1942 but not as
much<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.500> ones<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:52.920> mentioned

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
much as the ones I just mentioned

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.310 
much as the ones I just mentioned
because<00:01:53.640> those<00:01:53.939> were<00:01:54.119> mostly<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
because those were mostly when I was in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.069 
because those were mostly when I was in
my<00:01:55.470> gaming<00:01:55.710> prime<00:01:56.479> but<00:01:57.479> commander<00:01:57.780> was

something that was big to battlefield 2
and<00:02:00.030> 2142<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.619> thing<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.890> basically

and 2142 it was the thing that basically

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
and 2142 it was the thing that basically
was<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> RTS<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> sky<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.200> basically

annoying<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.660> know<00:03:30.720> trolling<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.470> really

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
annoying I know trolling is really

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.830 
annoying I know trolling is really
really<00:03:32.160> popular<00:03:32.400> on<00:03:32.760> YouTube<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.329> think

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
really popular on YouTube I think

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.630 
really popular on YouTube I think
commander<00:03:34.290> would<00:03:34.440> probably<00:03:34.980> take<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.610> a

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
commander would probably take that to a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.270 
commander would probably take that to a
whole<00:03:36.209> new<00:03:36.660> level<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.829> may<00:03:38.040> be<00:03:38.070> an

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
whole new level and that may be an

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.370 
whole new level and that may be an
understatement<00:03:38.489> i<00:03:38.850> think<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.630> know<00:03:40.200> the

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
understatement i think that you know the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.110 
understatement i think that you know the
commander<00:03:40.739> mode<00:03:40.920> could<00:03:41.220> open<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.670> lot<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:42.030> new

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
commander mode could open a lot of new

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.819 
commander mode could open a lot of new
avenues<00:03:42.510> for<00:03:42.540> people<00:03:42.989> who<00:03:43.079> like<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.350> do<00:03:43.650> those

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
avenues for people who like to do those

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.170 
avenues for people who like to do those

i'm guessing the people that fall victim
to<00:03:51.180> stuff<00:03:51.390> like<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.600> aren't<00:03:52.290> really<00:03:52.590> having

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
to stuff like that aren't really having

to stuff like that aren't really having
that<00:03:53.190> good<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.850> time<00:03:54.060> that's<00:03:54.840> just<00:03:55.079> me

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that good of a time that's just me

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.800 
that good of a time that's just me
guessing<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:56.549> i<00:03:56.579> could<00:03:56.820> imagine<00:03:56.910> if<00:03:57.329> commander

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
guessing so i could imagine if commander

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.350 
guessing so i could imagine if commander
was<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.019> big<00:03:58.410> portion<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:59.040> battlefield<00:03:59.549> 4<00:03:59.790> that

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
perhaps you know some outlets would have

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.509

there was a sniper that was just camping
in<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.959> back<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.769> commander<00:04:14.130> could<00:04:14.250> call<00:04:14.489> in

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
in the back the commander could call in

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.310 
in the back the commander could call in
some<00:04:14.820> artillery<00:04:15.120> on<00:04:15.480> him<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.810> grief<00:04:16.109> that

you wouldn't be laughing very hard and

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.230 
you wouldn't be laughing very hard and
that's<00:04:23.010> one<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.340> concerns<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.820> have<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.120> mean

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
that's one of the concerns I have I mean

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.839 
that's one of the concerns I have I mean
even<00:04:24.390> back<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:24.720> battlefield<00:04:25.320> 2<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.590> 2142<00:04:26.190> you

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
even back in battlefield 2 in 2142 you

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.710 
even back in battlefield 2 in 2142 you
know<00:04:26.970> griefing<00:04:27.479> you

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
know griefing you

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.690 
know griefing you
team<00:04:27.960> was<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.260> big<00:04:28.500> deal<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:29.190> lot<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.400> servers

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
team was a big deal and a lot of servers

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.880 
team was a big deal and a lot of servers
had<00:04:30.030> protection<00:04:30.480> for<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:30.930> but<00:04:31.230> if<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.830> were

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
had protection for that but if you were

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.290 
had protection for that but if you were
just<00:04:32.070> playing<00:04:32.250> on<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.370> default<00:04:32.790> server<00:04:33.060> there's

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
just playing on a default server there's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.940 
just playing on a default server there's
not<00:04:33.540> a<00:04:33.570> lot<00:04:33.810> of<00:04:33.840> things<00:04:34.140> that<00:04:34.260> can<00:04:34.440> protect<00:04:34.650> you

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
not a lot of things that can protect you

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.350 
not a lot of things that can protect you
for<00:04:35.130> something<00:04:35.340> like<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.580> for<00:04:35.910> happening

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
for something like that for happening

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.420 
for something like that for happening
and<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:36.840> have<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.080> feeling<00:04:37.470> that<00:04:37.500> in<00:04:37.830> battlefield

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
and I have a feeling that in battlefield

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.160 
and I have a feeling that in battlefield
3<00:04:38.490> if<00:04:38.880> they<00:04:39.090> would<00:04:39.270> have<00:04:39.300> included<00:04:39.600> commander

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
3 if they would have included commander

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.750 
3 if they would have included commander
there<00:04:40.590> would<00:04:40.740> have<00:04:40.800> been<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.950> lot<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.310> griefing

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
there would have been a lot of griefing

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.280 
there would have been a lot of griefing
like<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.120> think<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.390> lot<00:04:42.420> of<00:04:42.690> people<00:04:42.840> would

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
like that I think a lot of people would

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.640 
like that I think a lot of people would
have<00:04:43.380> been<00:04:43.410> upset<00:04:44.480> but<00:04:45.480> that's<00:04:45.750> one<00:04:46.470> of<00:04:46.560> the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
have been upset but that's one of the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.770 
have been upset but that's one of the
challenges<00:04:46.680> too<00:04:47.460> including<00:04:47.760> this<00:04:48.120> disk<00:04:48.540> mode

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
challenges too including this disk mode

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.170 
challenges too including this disk mode
into<00:04:49.140> battle<00:04:49.620> thud<00:04:49.800> for<00:04:50.040> and<00:04:50.280> of<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.820> rumors

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
into battle thud for and of the rumors

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.940 
into battle thud for and of the rumors
you<00:04:51.570> know<00:04:51.660> turn<00:04:51.840> out<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.110> be<00:04:52.200> true<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.680> looks

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
you know turn out to be true it looks

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.560 
you know turn out to be true it looks
like<00:04:53.100> we<00:04:53.220> may<00:04:53.430> be<00:04:53.460> getting<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:54.000> back<00:04:54.150> in<00:04:54.360> some

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
like we may be getting it back in some

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.020 
like we may be getting it back in some
capacity<00:04:54.950> if<00:04:55.950> I<00:04:56.100> was<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.250> guessing<00:04:56.490> man<00:04:56.760> i<00:04:56.790> would

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
capacity if I was a guessing man i would

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.850 
capacity if I was a guessing man i would
say<00:04:57.180> it'd<00:04:57.270> be<00:04:57.420> much<00:04:57.630> more<00:04:57.870> limited<00:04:58.140> than<00:04:58.350> the

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
say it'd be much more limited than the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.340 
say it'd be much more limited than the
battlefield<00:04:59.340> 2<00:04:59.460> or<00:04:59.580> 2142<00:05:00.180> commander<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.780> just

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
battlefield 2 or 2142 commander I just

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.810 
battlefield 2 or 2142 commander I just
do<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.680> fact<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.100> lot<00:05:02.310> of<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.430> things<00:05:02.670> the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
do the fact that a lot of the things the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.340 
do the fact that a lot of the things the
commander<00:05:03.210> used<00:05:03.390> to<00:05:03.510> do<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.870> can<00:05:04.020> already<00:05:04.140> do

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
commander used to do you can already do

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.660 
commander used to do you can already do
as<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.530> player<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.830> know<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.100> can<00:05:05.220> put<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.400> mow

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
as a player you know you can put a mow

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.810 
as a player you know you can put a mow
down<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:06.150> can<00:05:06.650> let's<00:05:07.650> say<00:05:07.800> with<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.250> nav<00:05:08.610> you

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
down you can let's say with the nav you

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.250 
down you can let's say with the nav you
can<00:05:08.940> basically<00:05:09.120> do<00:05:09.450> reconnaissance<00:05:09.780> which

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
can basically do reconnaissance which

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.220 
can basically do reconnaissance which
was<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.500> big<00:05:10.740> portion<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:12.330> UAV<00:05:12.720> sweeps<00:05:13.050> and

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
was a big portion the UAV sweeps and

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.540 
was a big portion the UAV sweeps and
battlefield<00:05:13.620> two<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.890> was<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.040> big<00:05:14.280> portion

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
battlefield two that was a big portion

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.710 
battlefield two that was a big portion
of<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.790> commander<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.240> now<00:05:15.420> you've<00:05:15.570> got<00:05:15.690> the

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
of the commander and now you've got the

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.330 
of the commander and now you've got the
ma<00:05:16.050> vie<00:05:16.230> which<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.650> little<00:05:17.070> bit<00:05:17.250> more

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
ma vie which is a little bit more

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.220 
ma vie which is a little bit more
effective<00:05:17.820> just<00:05:18.660> because<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.020> basically

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
effective just because you basically

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.860 
effective just because you basically
have<00:05:19.620> unlimited<00:05:20.190> reconnaissance<00:05:20.790> so<00:05:21.000> there's

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
have unlimited reconnaissance so there's

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.909 
have unlimited reconnaissance so there's
a<00:05:21.930> lot<00:05:22.080> of<00:05:22.110> things<00:05:22.350> that<00:05:22.440> are<00:05:22.590> kind<00:05:22.740> of

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
a lot of things that are kind of

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.010 
a lot of things that are kind of
outdated<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.669> commander<00:05:24.030> did<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.960> I

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
outdated that the commander did and I

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.760 
outdated that the commander did and I
think<00:05:25.169> there's<00:05:25.290> going<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.470> be<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.560> lot<00:05:25.740> of

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
think there's going to be a lot of

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.500 
think there's going to be a lot of
challenges<00:05:26.040> and<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.640> including<00:05:27.180> it<00:05:27.270> in<00:05:27.360> the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
challenges and to including it in the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.940 
challenges and to including it in the
game<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:27.870> I'm<00:05:28.020> actually<00:05:28.200> kind<00:05:28.470> of<00:05:28.530> excited

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
game and I'm actually kind of excited

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.250 
game and I'm actually kind of excited
for<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.340> know<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:30.120> like<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.020> play<00:05:31.110> the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
for it and you know I like to play the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.810 
for it and you know I like to play the
devil's<00:05:31.560> advocate<00:05:31.650> I<00:05:32.010> like<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.370> look<00:05:32.520> at<00:05:32.669> some

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
devil's advocate I like to look at some

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.580 
devil's advocate I like to look at some
of<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:33.000> strengths<00:05:33.480> of<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.900> commander<00:05:34.380> in<00:05:34.530> the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
of the strengths of a commander in the

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.870 
of the strengths of a commander in the
modern<00:05:35.040> setting<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.520> some<00:05:35.730> of<00:05:35.820> the

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
weaknesses we might face hopefully maybe

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.409 
weaknesses we might face hopefully maybe
someone<00:05:38.370> from<00:05:38.460> dice<00:05:38.700> here's<00:05:38.910> this<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.330> kind

game<00:05:42.930> but<00:05:43.740> I'm<00:05:43.830> actually<00:05:44.070> very<00:05:44.280> hopeful<00:05:44.850> that

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
game but I'm actually very hopeful that

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.250 
game but I'm actually very hopeful that
it<00:05:45.090> does<00:05:45.210> make<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.390> return<00:05:45.690> so<00:05:45.870> let<00:05:45.990> me<00:05:46.050> know<00:05:46.140> in

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
it does make a return so let me know in

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.390 
it does make a return so let me know in
the<00:05:46.290> comments<00:05:46.650> what<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.830> guys<00:05:46.950> think<00:05:47.190> would

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
the comments what you guys think would

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.580 
the comments what you guys think would
you<00:05:47.430> be<00:05:47.669> excited<00:05:47.820> to<00:05:48.330> see<00:05:48.570> Commander<00:05:49.229> make<00:05:49.560> a

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
you be excited to see Commander make a

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.870 
you be excited to see Commander make a
return<00:05:49.979> and<00:05:50.310> this<00:05:50.430> was<00:05:50.550> a<00:05:50.580> pretty<00:05:50.790> good

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
return and this was a pretty good

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.120 
return and this was a pretty good
defensive<00:05:51.570> round<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:52.050> pretty<00:05:52.590> action-packed

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
defensive round a pretty action-packed

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.740 
defensive round a pretty action-packed
for<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.430> most<00:05:53.610> part<00:05:53.790> for<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.030> defense<00:05:54.360> usually

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
for the most part for a defense usually

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.870 
for the most part for a defense usually
defense<00:05:55.080> can<00:05:55.290> get<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.470> little<00:05:55.680> bit<00:05:55.919> slow<00:05:56.160> but

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
defense can get a little bit slow but

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.010 
defense can get a little bit slow but
like<00:05:57.000> I<00:05:57.090> said<00:05:57.150> I<00:05:57.270> had<00:05:57.390> a<00:05:57.419> pretty<00:05:57.600> good<00:05:57.660> squad

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
like I said I had a pretty good squad

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.969 
like I said I had a pretty good squad
but<00:05:58.200> if<00:05:58.290> you<00:05:58.350> missed<00:05:58.500> in<00:05:58.620> my<00:05:58.680> past<00:05:58.890> videos
