00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.540 
multitasking because the way it actually
works<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.869> read<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.560> engadget<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.400> that

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
works is I read it on engadget and that

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.580 
works is I read it on engadget and that
was<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.819> if<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.599> run<00:02:12.720> two<00:02:12.930> apps<00:02:12.959> let's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
was that if you run two apps let's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.720 
was that if you run two apps let's
you<00:02:13.650> wanna<00:02:13.860> watch<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.160> movie<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:14.580> you

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
you wanna watch a movie and then you

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.000 
you wanna watch a movie and then you
want<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> reach<00:02:15.150> want<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> read<00:02:16.379> your<00:02:16.560> email<00:02:16.890> at

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
want to reach want to read your email at

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.580 
want to reach want to read your email at
the<00:02:17.160> same<00:02:17.340> time<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.930> other<00:02:19.019> screen<00:02:19.140> then

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the same time on the other screen then

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.070 
the same time on the other screen then
you<00:02:19.860> can't<00:02:20.069> do<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.459> because<00:02:20.599> this<00:02:21.599> they're

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you can't do that because this they're

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.290 
you can't do that because this they're
operating<00:02:22.530> system<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.099> device<00:02:23.580> it's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
operating system in this device it's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.210 
operating system in this device it's
basically<00:02:24.660> really<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.290> know<00:02:25.379> free<00:02:25.709> stuff<00:02:26.069> at

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
basically really you know free stuff at

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.670 
basically really you know free stuff at
that<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.640> don't<00:02:26.970> use<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:28.200> kind<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.440> weird

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that you don't use so it's kind of weird

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.850 
that you don't use so it's kind of weird
that<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:29.760> really<00:02:30.090> call<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.860> multitasking

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
that they really call it multitasking

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.930 
that they really call it multitasking
because<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:33.120> mean<00:02:33.599> if<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.739> can't<00:02:34.920> do<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:35.819> know

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
because I mean if you can't do you know

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.660 
because I mean if you can't do you know
work<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.420> both<00:02:36.629> apps<00:02:36.870> at<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> same<00:02:37.410> time<00:02:37.769> then

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
work in both apps at the same time then

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.539 
work in both apps at the same time then
it's<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.180> multitasking<00:02:39.830> hmm<00:02:40.830> I'm<00:02:41.099> not<00:02:41.310> quite

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549
