so<00:04:12.069> how<00:04:13.069> most<00:04:13.370> important<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.690> fingers<00:04:15.019> are

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
so how most important the fingers are

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.740 
so how most important the fingers are
halfway<00:04:15.380> clean<00:04:15.860> I<00:04:16.160> try<00:04:17.000> not<00:04:17.120> gather<00:04:17.450> my

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
halfway clean I try not gather my

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.050 
halfway clean I try not gather my
ingredients<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.799> won't<00:04:18.979> incorporate<00:04:19.850> them

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
ingredients and I won't incorporate them

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.010 
ingredients and I won't incorporate them
all<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:21.650> I<00:04:21.680> take<00:04:22.070> everything<00:04:22.490> in<00:04:23.320> see<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.530> and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
all so I take everything in see that and

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.450 
all so I take everything in see that and
what<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.050> do<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.560> will<00:04:27.680> show<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.220> in

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
what I do and I will show it to you in

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.469 
what I do and I will show it to you in
slow<00:04:29.180> motion<00:04:29.479> I<00:04:30.139> just<00:04:30.919> stretch<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.300> little

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
slow motion I just stretch this a little

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.930 
slow motion I just stretch this a little
bit<00:04:32.660> fold<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.139> over<00:04:33.289> hold<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.639> give<00:04:34.729> it<00:04:34.850> a

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
bit fold it over hold it and give it a

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.390 
bit fold it over hold it and give it a
turn<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.960> by<00:04:36.080> this<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.470> incorporate<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.130> lot<00:04:37.340> of

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
turn so by this I incorporate a lot of

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.360 
turn so by this I incorporate a lot of
air<00:04:37.639> in<00:04:38.090> there<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:39.050> stretch<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.860> gluten

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
air in there and I stretch the gluten

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.300 
air in there and I stretch the gluten
which<00:04:40.820> needs<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.150> be<00:04:41.210> exercised<00:04:44.200> it's<00:04:45.200> not<00:04:45.500> by

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
which needs to be exercised it's not by

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.600 
which needs to be exercised it's not by
far<00:04:46.610> not<00:04:47.240> done<00:04:47.660> that

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
far not done that

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.810 
far not done that
so<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.910> needs<00:04:50.180> more<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.110> more<00:04:51.320> work<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.919> if<00:04:52.669> it

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
so it needs more and more work and if it

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.360 
so it needs more and more work and if it
gets<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.300> little<00:04:53.330> bit<00:04:53.660> too<00:04:53.810> sticky<00:04:54.080> what<00:04:55.039> you<00:04:55.190> do

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
gets a little bit too sticky what you do

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.140 
gets a little bit too sticky what you do
tiny<00:04:56.330> bit<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:56.750> flour<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.260> then<00:04:58.000> take<00:04:59.000> your

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
tiny bit of flour and then take your

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.740 
tiny bit of flour and then take your
bowl<00:04:59.800> put<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:00.950> over<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.700> let<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.419> sit<00:05:02.720> for

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
bowl put it over it and let it sit for

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.060 
bowl put it over it and let it sit for
about<00:05:03.500> 10-15<00:05:04.160> minutes<00:05:04.760> just<00:05:05.470> so<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.500> water<00:05:06.830> is

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
about 10-15 minutes just so the water is

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.950 
about 10-15 minutes just so the water is
absorbed<00:05:07.280> in<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.700> flour<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.840> will

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
absorbed in the flour and it will

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.140 
absorbed in the flour and it will
actually<00:05:09.349> make<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.979> dough<00:05:10.580> much<00:05:10.849> more

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
actually make the dough much more

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.210 
actually make the dough much more
tactile<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:12.110> easier<00:05:12.410> to<00:05:12.440> work<00:05:12.710> with

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
tactile and easier to work with

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.200 
tactile and easier to work with

ready<00:05:45.890> to<00:05:46.070> get<00:05:46.220> it<00:05:46.340> into<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.640> oven<00:05:46.760> we<00:05:47.390> have<00:05:47.599> a

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
ready to get it into the oven we have a

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.080 
ready to get it into the oven we have a
commercial<00:05:48.110> of<00:05:48.470> who<00:05:48.590> actually<00:05:48.950> can<00:05:49.280> steam<00:05:50.060> it

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
commercial of who actually can steam it

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.510 
commercial of who actually can steam it
so<00:05:50.870> you<00:05:50.930> can<00:05:51.200> achieve<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.950> same<00:05:51.979> thing<00:05:52.400> by

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
so you can achieve the same thing by

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.040 
so you can achieve the same thing by
getting<00:05:52.640> maybe<00:05:53.000> a<00:05:53.090> flower<00:05:53.330> miss<00:05:53.659> to<00:05:53.810> spray

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
getting maybe a flower miss to spray

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.170 
getting maybe a flower miss to spray
some<00:05:54.289> water<00:05:54.320> in<00:05:54.800> there<00:05:54.979> or<00:05:55.159> just<00:05:55.220> Chuck<00:05:56.150> a

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
some water in there or just Chuck a

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.300 
some water in there or just Chuck a
little<00:05:56.360> bit<00:05:56.599> water<00:05:56.840> which<00:05:57.380> helps<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.979> door<00:05:58.159> to

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
little bit water which helps the door to

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.640 
little bit water which helps the door to
expand<00:05:58.700> on<00:05:59.030> this<00:05:59.570> one<00:05:59.810> because<00:06:00.169> it<00:06:00.440> has

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
expand on this one because it has

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.860 
expand on this one because it has
actually<00:06:00.979> flowed<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:01.760> little<00:06:02.030> bit<00:06:02.180> it's<00:06:02.539> very

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
actually flowed a little bit it's very

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.360 
actually flowed a little bit it's very
very<00:06:04.210> soft<00:06:05.210> dough<00:06:05.630> I<00:06:05.960> don't<00:06:06.289> use<00:06:06.409> any<00:06:06.620> steam<00:06:07.070> at

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370
