 next part of clothes that I've 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.420
 collaborated I am also very close 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.890
 previously once I bought it with a 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.650
 Own bank money is an equation 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.410
 I discovered if by chance totally 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.690

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.470

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.620

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.300
 sent a few things that I chose from his 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.730
 I find it very difficult to choose the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.030
 things because they have is that it has so many 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.840
 things and things so cool and so divine and 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.850
 so happy with the clothes that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.190
 I chose to have sent me many 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.650

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.940
 voley similar prices the sizes that 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.050
 are you interested you already know the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.900
 first thing 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.510
 are these shows which print is 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.750
 super fun super monkey super 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.189
 I did not find them in different and as 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.500
 I 'm already with the chip that already 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.019
 I start thinking about summer I've already 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.670
 bought some little things when 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.580
 make more heat are not too loose 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.520
 very summery and collected in size xs 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.920
 then I chose this crop top that I 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.840
 he fell in love very much he was among 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.560
 but few will say 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.840
 This is the one I like the most 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.390
 super nice lace is not color 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.099
 white if it looks super nice is very 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.780
 nice I thought that in summer you can 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.239
 look great when you 're there with city 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.910
 and it is and that I took it in size s 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.910
 Then he chose a good little dress I chose 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.920
 altogether two dresses and one of them is 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.920
 this is pink 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.370
 well cortito sleeveless and in this 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.280
 little detail 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 that is very good I did not catch in the size 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.060
 xs 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.329
 and nothing too I'm very steamy very 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:24.030
 cool and the other little dress 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:29.870
 this one with blue sequins 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.870
 more than three quarters and with the back 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.560
 great to my taste I have a little long 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.710
 I picked it up in the size is to get out of 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.630
 party and that's 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.610
 ideal 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:49.120
 and the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.770
 I'm in love, it 's a closed monkey 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.900
 connection with the monkeys that I do not know about 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.160
 where did it come from but well, the monkey 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.950
 in question is this is in color 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.110
 its beige cream color if you can 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.130
 appreciate on camera is a beige color with 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.190
 these details here on the top 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.820
 the back is all exposed that 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.710
 remains 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.260
 this seems super nice 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.689
 and well the bottom part of the 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.330
 pants is long this long sleeve 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.520
 by legs and here is 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.710
 chapeau would create 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.919
 it's a super monkey different from the ones I've 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.560
 seen I did not choose it in the same size xs 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.800
 or girls this was all about anklets 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.620
 a look because it's very 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.270
 and the truth is that I take very little less 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.789
 of a week or the week and I thought that I 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.470
 it would take longer as this has been all but 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.940
 those interested and you have any 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.979
 doubt you already know you can always put it 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.720
 in the comments I will answer 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:54.450
 enchanted and nothing more 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.450
 soon the next chao
