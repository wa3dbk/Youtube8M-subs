sometime<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> future<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> thought<00:00:29.070> what

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
sometime in the future so I thought what

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.919 
sometime in the future so I thought what
the<00:00:29.429> hell<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> might<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.029> well<00:00:30.210> show<00:00:30.570> them<00:00:30.750> all

so you can expect more videos in the
future<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:35.160> number<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:35.820> it
