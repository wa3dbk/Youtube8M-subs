him a shot we went for the two-point
conversion<00:05:26.670> there<00:05:26.820> so<00:05:27.000> that<00:05:27.030> if<00:05:27.210> he<00:05:27.330> had<00:05:27.480> to

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
conversion there so that if he had to

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.970 
conversion there so that if he had to
kick<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.780> field<00:05:28.020> goal<00:05:28.140> it<00:05:28.380> would<00:05:28.500> only<00:05:28.590> tie<00:05:28.920> the

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
picking up for all my rookie mistakes

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.720 
picking up for all my rookie mistakes
but<00:06:09.180> he<00:06:09.900> gets<00:06:10.170> a<00:06:10.350> nice<00:06:10.560> play<00:06:10.890> off<00:06:10.920> in<00:06:11.340> just<00:06:11.580> a

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
but he gets a nice play off in just a

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.030 
but he gets a nice play off in just a

playing him injured he was still a
better<00:06:31.830> choice<00:06:32.190> than<00:06:32.520> my<00:06:33.120> backup<00:06:33.660> so<00:06:33.810> I<00:06:33.840> left

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
gone for it on fourth down but I I

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.970 
gone for it on fourth down but I I
already<00:06:59.180> did<00:06:59.420> it<00:06:59.540> once<00:06:59.570> and<00:07:00.020> felt<00:07:00.650> like<00:07:00.800> I

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
already did it once and felt like I

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.740 
already did it once and felt like I
cheated<00:07:01.640> the<00:07:01.880> system<00:07:01.910> by<00:07:02.360> doing<00:07:02.630> that<00:07:02.690> I

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
cheated the system by doing that I

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.270 
cheated the system by doing that I
always<00:07:02.900> feel<00:07:03.080> like<00:07:03.110> a<00:07:03.260> jerk<00:07:03.470> on<00:07:03.680> for<00:07:04.160> two

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
always feel like a jerk on for two

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.950 
always feel like a jerk on for two
fourth-down<00:07:04.580> I<00:07:04.940> know<00:07:05.030> everybody<00:07:05.450> does<00:07:05.690> pretty

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
fourth-down I know everybody does pretty

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.630 
fourth-down I know everybody does pretty
much<00:07:06.050> but<00:07:06.980> it<00:07:07.070> was<00:07:07.160> still<00:07:07.370> kind<00:07:07.580> of

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640 
much but it was still kind of

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.150 
much but it was still kind of
frustrating<00:07:08.350> because<00:07:09.350> I<00:07:09.530> knew<00:07:09.800> that<00:07:09.830> if<00:07:10.040> I

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
frustrating because I knew that if I

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.770 
frustrating because I knew that if I
didn't<00:07:10.490> get<00:07:10.610> it<00:07:10.760> that<00:07:10.940> was<00:07:11.060> basically<00:07:11.270> game

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
didn't get it that was basically game

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.930 
didn't get it that was basically game
over<00:07:12.140> so<00:07:12.320> I<00:07:12.350> figured<00:07:12.800> I'd<00:07:12.920> give<00:07:13.190> it<00:07:13.220> to<00:07:13.790> my

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
over so I figured I'd give it to my

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.960 
over so I figured I'd give it to my
defense<00:07:14.150> give<00:07:15.110> the<00:07:15.470> trust<00:07:15.830> to<00:07:16.190> my<00:07:16.340> defense<00:07:16.550> to

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:16.970 
defense give the trust to my defense to

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.180 
defense give the trust to my defense to
try<00:07:17.270> to<00:07:17.330> stop<00:07:17.690> the<00:07:17.930> run<00:07:18.140> like<00:07:18.680> they<00:07:18.830> have<00:07:19.010> been

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
try to stop the run like they have been

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.040
