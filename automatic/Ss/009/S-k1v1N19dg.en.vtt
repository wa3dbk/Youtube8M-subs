00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
now if I'm correct I already do have a

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.620 
now if I'm correct I already do have a
expect<00:03:18.370> loaded<00:03:18.700> or<00:03:18.819> a<00:03:18.850> shader<00:03:19.090> pack<00:03:19.269> there<00:03:19.540> it

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
expect loaded or a shader pack there it

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.809 
expect loaded or a shader pack there it
is<00:03:19.720> as<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.709> can<00:03:20.829> see<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.130> little<00:03:21.250> taste<00:03:21.549> of

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
is as you can see it's little taste of

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.960 
is as you can see it's little taste of
what's<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.840> come<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:23.319> you

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and doesn't that look amazing these are

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.310 
and doesn't that look amazing these are
our<00:03:26.370> shader<00:03:26.640> packs<00:03:27.030> bar<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.630> best<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.200> my

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
our shader packs bar the best in my

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.170 
our shader packs bar the best in my
opinion<00:03:28.580> possibly<00:03:29.580> better<00:03:29.730> than<00:03:29.820> resource

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
opinion possibly better than resource

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.810 
opinion possibly better than resource

you should have an option of all these

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.620 
you should have an option of all these
shaders<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.820> one<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.090> I'm<00:03:48.180> using<00:03:48.210> right<00:03:48.450> now

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
shaders the one that I'm using right now

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.020 
shaders the one that I'm using right now
is<00:03:49.070> hexagons<00:03:50.070> hot<00:03:50.280> shader<00:03:50.550> it's<00:03:50.760> one<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.970> my

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
is hexagons hot shader it's one of my

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.240 
is hexagons hot shader it's one of my
favorites<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.440> my<00:03:52.500> new<00:03:52.650> favorites<00:03:53.100> is

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
favorites and one of my new favorites is

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.220 
favorites and one of my new favorites is
also<00:03:53.640> Rudo<00:03:54.090> Flav's<00:03:54.450> I'm<00:03:54.660> gonna<00:03:54.840> go<00:03:54.990> ahead<00:03:55.080> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
also Rudo Flav's I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.910 
also Rudo Flav's I'm gonna go ahead and
click<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:55.980> right<00:03:56.130> now

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
click on that right now

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.500 
click on that right now
now<00:03:58.920> everything<00:03:59.400> does<00:03:59.550> reload<00:03:59.880> again<00:03:59.910> because

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
now everything does reload again because

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.199 
now everything does reload again because
it's<00:04:00.690> like<00:04:00.870> using<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.410> resource<00:04:01.680> pack<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.850> you

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
it's like using a resource pack and you

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.300 
it's like using a resource pack and you
can<00:04:03.240> see<00:04:03.480> where<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.660> like<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.110> second<00:04:04.470> it

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
can see where I like this in a second it

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.670 
can see where I like this in a second it
has<00:04:05.490> lens<00:04:05.760> flares<00:04:06.380> everything<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.500> better

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
has lens flares everything is better

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.090 
has lens flares everything is better
with<00:04:07.830> lens<00:04:08.040> flares<00:04:09.680> anyways<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.770> just<00:04:10.800> think

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
with lens flares anyways I just think

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.470 
with lens flares anyways I just think
everything<00:04:11.490> looks<00:04:11.670> nice<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:12.030> mean<00:04:12.150> look<00:04:12.300> at<00:04:12.390> the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
everything looks nice I mean look at the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.910 
everything looks nice I mean look at the
water

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
water

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.470 
water
also<00:04:13.920> with<00:04:14.070> Optifine<00:04:14.550> this<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.910> one<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
also with Optifine this is one of the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.030 
also with Optifine this is one of the
features<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.810> was<00:04:16.320> added<00:04:16.620> on<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
features that was added on the

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
features that was added on the
handy-dandy<00:04:17.430> zoom<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:19.609> everything<00:04:20.609> looks<00:04:20.820> so

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
handy-dandy zoom and everything looks so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.710 
handy-dandy zoom and everything looks so
nice<00:04:21.359> now<00:04:22.109> but<00:04:22.260> also<00:04:23.090> if<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.240> go<00:04:24.419> here<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
nice now but also if I go here in the

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.860 
nice now but also if I go here in the
video<00:04:24.930> settings<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.350> does<00:04:25.530> add<00:04:26.370> more<00:04:26.790> this<00:04:27.720> is

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
video settings it does add more this is

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.900 
video settings it does add more this is
from<00:04:28.020> Optifine<00:04:28.500> not<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.919> shaders<00:04:29.190> pack<00:04:29.400> but<00:04:29.850> I

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
from Optifine not the shaders pack but I

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.460 
from Optifine not the shaders pack but I
can<00:04:30.060> go<00:04:30.150> more<00:04:30.660> into<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:31.050> another<00:04:31.080> video

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
can go more into that in another video

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.580 

what<00:04:41.580> looks<00:04:41.790> interesting<00:04:44.690> let's<00:04:45.690> go<00:04:45.900> with<00:04:46.110> you

what looks interesting let's go with you

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.800 
what looks interesting let's go with you
know<00:04:47.390> type<00:04:48.390> RoMac<00:04:48.870> shader

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
know type RoMac shader

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.659 
know type RoMac shader
now<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.870> looks<00:04:51.930> alright<00:04:52.379> I<00:04:52.650> guess<00:04:53.400> it's<00:04:53.550> on

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
now it looks alright I guess it's on

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.939 
now it looks alright I guess it's on
your<00:04:53.819> opinion<00:04:53.970> so<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:54.990> guys<00:04:55.139> have<00:04:55.349> to<00:04:55.530> check

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
your opinion so you guys have to check

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.320 
your opinion so you guys have to check
out<00:04:56.099> the<00:04:56.370> backs<00:04:56.610> for<00:04:56.729> yourself<00:04:57.060> and

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
out the backs for yourself and
