00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
cookie dough so what we got in this bar

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900 
cookie dough so what we got in this bar
I've<00:00:28.380> never<00:00:28.590> had<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.160> before<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.789> was

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
I've never had this one before so I was

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
I've never had this one before so I was
gonna<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> taste<00:00:30.510> test<00:00:30.859> kind<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.920> thing<00:00:32.130> too

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
gonna be a taste test kind of thing too

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.549 
gonna be a taste test kind of thing too
so<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:34.320> bar<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.770> got<00:00:35.149> 370<00:00:36.149> calories<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so in one bar we got 370 calories so it

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.869 
so in one bar we got 370 calories so it
definitely<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.520> know<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> meal

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
definitely is you know a meal

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.869 
definitely is you know a meal
replacement<00:00:39.469> if<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.530> need<00:00:40.800> six<00:00:41.489> small<00:00:41.850> meals

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
replacement if you need six small meals

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
replacement if you need six small meals
a<00:00:42.300> day<00:00:42.329> that's<00:00:42.450> gonna<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.440> whole<00:00:43.739> meal<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a day that's gonna be one whole meal I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.590 
a day that's gonna be one whole meal I
was<00:00:45.059> kind<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> calories<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:47.600> total

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
was kind of a lot of calories so total

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.500 
was kind of a lot of calories so total
fat<00:00:48.840> six<00:00:49.230> grams<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:50.039> too<00:00:50.250> bad

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
fat six grams that's not too bad

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
fat six grams that's not too bad
considering<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.930> 28<00:00:52.469> grams<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.920> protein

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
considering we got 28 grams of protein

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.900 
considering we got 28 grams of protein
it's<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> pretty<00:00:54.510> good<00:00:54.719> ratio<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.730> one<00:00:56.730> thing

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it's a pretty good ratio there one thing

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.209 
it's a pretty good ratio there one thing
that's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.210> concerning<00:00:57.840> got<00:00:58.350> 25<00:00:58.920> grams

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that's a little concerning got 25 grams

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.779 
that's a little concerning got 25 grams
of<00:00:59.399> sugars<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.410> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.829> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> high

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
of sugars so it's kind of kind of high

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.440 
of sugars so it's kind of kind of high
but<00:01:03.979> these<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.430> kind<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.790> protein<00:01:06.150> bar<00:01:06.330> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
but these just kind of protein bar you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
but these just kind of protein bar you
find<00:01:06.900> any<00:01:07.080> gas<00:01:07.290> station<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.920> somewhere<00:01:08.189> like

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
find any gas station or somewhere like

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.539 
find any gas station or somewhere like
that<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.299> you're<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> bind<00:01:10.189> maybe<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that so if you're in a bind maybe not a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:24.230 
that so if you're in a bind maybe not a
bad<00:01:11.760> bad<00:01:12.479> option<00:01:15.619> see<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.770> else<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:23.240> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
bad bad option see what else we got the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.219 
bad bad option see what else we got the
motive<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.250> nutrition<00:01:26.689> information<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
motive for the nutrition information the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
motive for the nutrition information the
bunch<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> vitamin<00:01:29.250> A<00:01:29.369> C<00:01:29.700> calcium<00:01:30.650> a<00:01:32.150> couple<00:01:33.150> B

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
bunch of vitamin A C calcium a couple B

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.160 
bunch of vitamin A C calcium a couple B
vitamins<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:35.030> 20<00:01:36.030> grams<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.390> protein<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.960> 6

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
vitamins so 20 grams of protein with 6

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.179 
vitamins so 20 grams of protein with 6

dough<00:01:46.829> we'll<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.490> how<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> tastes

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.380 

I<00:01:53.160> could<00:01:54.160> feel<00:01:54.370> them<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.640> package<00:01:54.910> is<00:01:55.360> pretty

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
I could feel them the package is pretty

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:24.680 
I could feel them the package is pretty
soft

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.120 

that's<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.470> bad<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:27.500> yet<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> protein

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
that's not bad it is yet the protein

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.790 
that's not bad it is yet the protein
kinase<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.030> you're<00:02:30.620> if<00:02:31.620> you're

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
kinase but if you're if you're

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.650

like a protein that infuse chocolate
chip<00:02:38.340> cookie<00:02:38.700> dough<00:02:39.350> texture<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.410> not<00:02:40.560> bad

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.440 

it's<00:02:43.860> kind<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.160> about<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.520> same<00:02:44.730> texture<00:02:45.300> as

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
it's kind of about the same texture as

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.540 
it's kind of about the same texture as
