00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello spectator repair gear 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.519
 screwdriver 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.580
 Of course, I have already made it and collected it. 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.250
 but then I suggest you look at what 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.770
 I somehow broke up 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.000
 the cartridge itself has not traveled 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.210
 the teeth I decided to change the cartridge itself and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.039
 to change the cartridge of this axis tea well 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:34.170
 how would have then learned in the middle 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:36.989
 here there is a reverse thread bolt i 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.440
 I did not know that he is with reverse thread and his 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.420
 tried to unscrew as the floor as it should be 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.219
 we have clockwise nothing 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.590
 I did not work as it took all this here 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.850
 part and got to 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.420
 shafts where gears are sitting on the main 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.500
 shaft and tried them clamped them rather in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.689
 vice and tried to unwind the cartridge itself 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.880
 what did I get? I licked 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.979
 under the figure screwdriver this bolt 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.390
 which is there in the middle with the reverse 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:19.970
 carving and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:23.610
 and broke one gear shaft 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.430
 now to drill now to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.500
 unscrew this bolt with reverse thread 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:36.780
 I had to drill all and want 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.380
 make this gear shaft 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.040
 Well, look further month gear 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.700
 screwdriver unscrew the chuck I already 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:54.869
 just sort it all out so faster 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:57.649
 It was so unscrew here two screwdriver 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.560
 here they are 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.869
 take off 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.409
 3 brush itself 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:15.240
 so here is the spring here in the very 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:20.120
 the shaft could see a pass here 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.120
 retaining ring, I took it so he 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:39.180
 just took off the shaft itself with one hand not 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:44.450
 convenient of course well I want to show here 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.570
 sambal problem i have in which and i 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.540
 broke 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:03:01.019
 Here is a shaft where there are such 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:03:03.660
 the gears are small 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:11.060
 get one of the shafts 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:16.380
 one of well yes from the gear shaft broke off 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:20.579
 here's a little bit of it i'm his 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.950
 knocked out such a thing I donâ€™t know how 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:29.489
 she's exactly called he came out pretty 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:34.260
 well and his regular place and on his 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.590
 place i will put the same diameter from 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.590
 drill 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:51.390
 here threesome drill threesomes she clearly 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:56.630
 Comes here Well, how to beat him to his 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.230
 place cut off turbines kai is all show 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.130
 so scored 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.130
 drill bit like that the gears have become 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:12.340
 everything turns the same absolutely that is 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.190
 Three-point drill bit fits very well 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.889
 hammered the drill from this side to 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:25.169
 good to put the gear level 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:30.540
 Well, with these two who are native 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:36.910
 so gonna cut off a drill bit 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:40.229
 This part turned out like this, of course. 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.250
 perhaps not very beautiful as a factory 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:49.380
 but nevertheless , that's how it happened 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.380
 Now I will collect everything in stages 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:05.580
 I insert the shaft in its place as 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.580
 here we have such shaybochka 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.180
 and even wanted to say that you can drill 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.430
 In principle, further use by 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:25.520
 purpose 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:31.670
 so here as if the bearing is such 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.550
 All balls will type here took another ceases 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:39.140
 such a shaybochka 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:47.320
 top to close them and here in 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:50.480
 groove now here is this groove where where 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:56.060
 snap ring was in place 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:06:04.690
 the retaining ring will continue to collect all 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.690
 step by step how to understand show already assembled 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:13.820
 gearbox assembly these gears 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:18.880
 spinning uncomfortable of course with one hand but 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:22.250
 nevertheless, nothing klinit everything is very very 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.560
 it turned out great cumshot completely 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:35.690
 repair screwdriver gear 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:46.430
 everything gathered perfectly everything works our 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:48.190
 the battery is still plugged in so that's it 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.020
 works fine 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.770
 ask questions about who was 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.360
 incomprehensible subscribe to channel finger 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.040
 up who put the information 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.040
 useful thanks
