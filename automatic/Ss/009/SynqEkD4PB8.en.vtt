00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello to all here we are for a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.379
 part of assassin's creed iv 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.110
 so this time it's a video a bit 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.590
 special because loire face a act 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.360
 legendary level 75 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.360
 the peculiarity of this vessel 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.099
 to the worry part this ship is 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.449
 that he's really super strong and that's at 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.269
 to say legendary there are only two in 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.759
 the amap is the most 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.089
 strong of the game and the party the 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.159
 particularity of that one is that it 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.170
 would power shots 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.440
 practically invincible I swear to you 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.210
 it is projected little puff the level of 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.620
 maximum defense 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.870
 I already lost a whole bar in 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.850
 taking these projectiles 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.340
 I really spent 500 woods for 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.469
 to have the project and to have the defense 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.050
 in full and even like that I got 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.140
 really kills veil and there we 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.559
 is in a defensive position and yet 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.360
 we really get the hang of it 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.710
 with the little trick to fight him 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.200
 because if air and I managed to put it 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.429
 in defense position it's really 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 not how he has he has a side 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.330
 invulnerable zac but the east coast where he 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.659
 is very very where he has and louis suddenly 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.240
 not bad it's the back of the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.020
 ship and that's where we can do the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.030
 triangle key 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.500
 that's why we got it here 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.810
 it's for a particular reason 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.880
 this is the only side we can do 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.140
 a cat with the triangle button know 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.270
 it's when it's like piercing defense 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:48.850
 so that's the vulnerable side 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.740
 invulnerable and there the side well so we 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.040
 still waiting a bit we expect so much 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.040
 time to wait 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.120
 no no no stop we do not move on 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.460
 leave like this for now we turn 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.289
 not bad the problem is that these 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.149
 ships can be very very fast 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.550
 eva of the distance to send us some 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.230
 mortar projectiles so that's 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.459
 project we received at the beginning we 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.330
 have released two more 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.330
 power of attac 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.550
 here 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.930
 the advantage is that they are a little very 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.550
 easy to counter and we see them from afar 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.710
 here they are, they will still swing us 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.820
 his sales and you'll see we're going 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.820
 turn some art and wax 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.680
 so as you see the problem of 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.100
 these mortars for example is that they 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.360
 never stop and can then if we 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.020
 not move and she gets fucked by 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.910
 these projectiles 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.920
 we can practically powerful server 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.920
 his name we can do better 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.300
 on the other hand they do not have a very good 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.849
 coop 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.349
 there we slowed down my door and I 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.349
 noticed up 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.690
 aulas when we are here we have great 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.390
 weakened I loved Russia al ala did 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.610
 well as fast with two too 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.110
 power of attac 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.660
 it's really very very sweet signing so 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.130
 You want to know 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.280
 these holidays that does not have an enemy ship 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:28.080
 because he is the Spanish fleet and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.410
 I thought if he had a little point 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.330
 weak but ultimately not too much 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.770
 because normally if you then for 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.680
 all assassin's fans creed and who 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.310
 have already played a long time at this place I 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.150
 many leaders of heaven the nadirs 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.780
 can meet and his way and by this 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.580
 text read that for example that floats 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.260
 Spanish cross a crazy Portuguese 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.580
 they will happen gamer is not necessarily 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.370
 French also meadows of the coasts 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.370
 French can compete and 7.8 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.050
 so we accelerate 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.280
 wave or more too much to swing me 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.520
 projectiles because we are too 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.520
 near 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.000
 and there he will start again with the 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.080
 projective of good Thursday ways of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.530
 shit because I'm very bad 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.530
 day I do not really know if no years 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.890
 here it is in a little side dreaming mihrab 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:40.250
 from the ship to our side for latency 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:46.790
 that hop hop hop expected Brest is Brest 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:50.060
 is here then we never succeeded 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.380
 to weaken him as much as dignan 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.000
 because I'm really motivated to 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.000
 the fight before you do 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.670
 gives me the strength to continue I have 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.170
 really want to prove to those who 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.660
 are in desperation because 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.200
 really an ounce of hope this 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.200
 meet 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.940
 I really did not think they were 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.220
 as powerful as that I actually 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.690
 am ok said he's powerful but that's 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.690
 did not confess even 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.160
 this is going to happen in the area then 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.090
 there frankly is not far from the 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.090
 final success 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.530
 ad we now know the direction 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:44.100
 projective of mans t it is clear that 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.100
 touched behind 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.670
 we russia 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:05.790
 we managed we beat the ship 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:07.710
 legendary that's so that's it we've 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.440
 finally managed to beat the ship 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.740

 we could not go because we had 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.300
 destroyed my captured a legendary ship 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.250
 we have 8 2 me it's good there we managed 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.250
