 my bubble life is beautiful under 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.109

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.330
 what is it to take in circles 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.920
 get into debt for the sound like a lot 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.360

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.420
 piece of paper that makes her cry 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.280
 pen something tells me that despite 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.110
 the bitterness must persist at no talent 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.150
 hidden at night I meditated my 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.160
 imagination and my thoughts 100 volt is 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.080
 the white dove in freedom I'm leaving 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.950
 to lands still unexplored 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.660
 in the shadow 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.070
 well set jem one of the texts and then 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.960
 I fear to forget this day 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.150
 who lasted 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.040
 what do I say an eternity the seasons the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.479
 years pass but I have not changed 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040
 the night I am this intro who dreamed 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.900
 to make the world since we've aged to 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.310
 withdrawal to find that we will get there 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.140
 maybe never but if only I 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.240

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.740
 which gnaws at us all I will do without 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.390
 hesitate even you know then I 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.040
 will continue my merry way 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.869

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.750
 appreciated these few words by way of 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.280
 confident I propose without violence nor 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.960
 arrogance my part announced by that 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.060
 wish the trend that I thought that 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.990
 ignore it will be another gallows at night 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.399
 I handle the words 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.869
