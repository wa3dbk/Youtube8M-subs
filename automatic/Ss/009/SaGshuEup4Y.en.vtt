00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.649
 hello to all and I will present you the support I have 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.200
 created for mail not speak 3g 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.860
 % and in fact I searched for a long time on the internet is a support that can use 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.499
 the original cover sold by apple 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.699
 in fact I did not want to go out do not go to the latter at the risk of the 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.570
 strike or drop in the offender 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.580
 so decided to manufacture myself is a support actually with 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.160
 sucker he was making 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.530
 wooden you will tell me that in wood stay and a little heavier than a 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.789
 plastic stand 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.980
 but as long as it's betting, it's the main thing 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.080
 on the other hand in terms of cost must be around 5 hours at the big 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.800
 maximum and I used in everything I used more 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.810
 percent and that I adapted to the back of the support 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.050
 for the wood I was in a DIY big field made and I 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.210
 purchased scrap wood for a total cost of approximately 3 hours 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 so here is the support years 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.610
 % is simply raised adapted so that it fits well in the goal 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.090
 in the vehicle 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.700
 % and therefore does not figure here who read the flap of the cover 1 pactole 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.220
 and insert it like this on the support 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.350
 here 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.820
 then just plug the two cases so one to recharge it and 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.960
 aids 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.780
 and then of course the second 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 to connect to the car radio so if I had a car stereo with a USB port 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.560
 and it would have been a little easier 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.430
 luckily today I only have one post broke so the day at the exchange 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.280
 necessarily it will be for a lot easier 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.290
 so here is once the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.980
 is that everything was set up to take views at two or three 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.720
 seconds 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.660
 well the advantage is that the gpu that could cost music 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.040
 at a simply 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.620
 30% and not for example just now I listened I listened 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.450
 besides I can be a complete time according to two angles of 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.910
 audience 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.920
 it is all the more sensitive that the only advantage is to return to m 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 via the intimate of music 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.290
 use navigation in contact with plants 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.730
 the advantage is that with the traffic today in the normal order when 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.069
 you see that never in the region - 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.380
 a Marseillaise what I prefer the calm and without problem m 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.119
 little used different different ages supports me i use 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:21.219
 organ trafficking at least one each to use which means 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 we can of course see in the video 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.329
 that's nice when you have children here for example with the 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.509
 techno chain cabista pothooks 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.139
 a little see different videos 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.509
 so the hours 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.579
 the throws 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.139
 quite simply 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.749
 so yes I use a support acacias so that's a little point 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.479
 negative it's just a little bit fed 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:48.969
 we would have liked it makes things easier which is not the case for example these 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.799
 food containers 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.159
 after 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.729
 it is complicated 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.789
 it can also be used in europe 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.559
 not for example job one can go on the internet of course 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.879
 so here is the recent I was on the site of Canal + in the elections here 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.530
 but I may have an ipad 3g so I can I can cut the wifi a sense 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.359
 no problem comes back I'm sure the orange site 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.809
 e 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.959
 here we can read the current account test cmls 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.109
 check his calendar 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.639
 check these areas these flows rss eventual mention below 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.739
 who still has some small improvements definitely bring 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.149
 it is true that I get more simple level of the wings of the connector so 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.379
 tomorrow down there will be a post with a USB port it will be even easier 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.260
 % and then after that plug it in directly for it to happen 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.329
 happens we take the step in the branch and then was able to finish 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.379
 oh well listen% and I hope this presentation supports you 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.869
 do not hesitate cd comment a good end of day to all alas 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:50.759
 all sides see
