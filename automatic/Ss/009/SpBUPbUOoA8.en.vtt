00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.070
 the truck handles the entire road a 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.990
 I can not see anything I think over 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.990
 would like to drive 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.140
 and right now the truck was straight 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.270
 completely on the other side of the street 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.789
 and over there is a curve which one 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.560
 can not see 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.560
 if now the curve come around 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.640
 it is incredible 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.210
 the next expert will find 30 470 here 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.660
 So hello friends experience 30 so how 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.720
 can definitely hear 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.640
 I just have such a neck because it 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.230
 again all sorts of riff-raff on 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.710
 the streets and what drives there simply 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.350
 has lost nothing 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.780
 The truck on the road where every two lane 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.970
 meter wide, he just has nothing 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.440
 this is absolutely dangerous if lost 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.550
 he gets someone the cow you all 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.920
 can not see 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.630
 then you sit there with 100 km h in this 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.159
 fucking truck in it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.009
 because he thinks he can somehow 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.630
 two minutes spain the place you go 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.070
 the outside to take the outside 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.299
 maybe two kilometers longer 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.310
 because such people are just where 70 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.170
 is allowed 30 questions 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.580
 I can not have it when people are too 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.080
 not really driving slowly 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.440
 so I'm really of the opinion if 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.310
 you are not able to 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.290
 his vehicle 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.030
 with the speed to move the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.180
 in the red chrysler on the shield 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.399
 then stands with the traffic 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.189
 just lost nothing and I was yes 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.230
 Every day on the highway and there you see 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.320
 actually only such people 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.670
 where 70 is always driven 60 and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.890
 if you drive on a street where 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.690
 100 is allowed and then one especially 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.700
 is not necessarily no idea bmw 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.590
 or so you can actually drive 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.420
 already forget any chance that one 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.270
 really then on this street 100 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.340
 most of them drive around 80 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.080
 or better still just drive on 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.520
 this sign over where the 70 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.310
 crossed out and just drive 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.530
 70 continue 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.860
 how do you get on something like driving 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.020
 again 60 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.780
 The 14 can be slower than here 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.870
 Anyone can please me 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.430
 explain why it's on a sunny day 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.069
 at 18 degrees outside perfect view 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.360
 why it is needed is 60 too 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.490
 drive where 70 are allowed 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.340
 Do you really know yourself to 100 ? 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.769
 that people generally too slow 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.879
 driving in traffic 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.159
 a hundred thousand times more dangerous than 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.290
 people maybe ten to 20 km / h too 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.269
 to drive fast 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.280
 here with our experts all the time 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.909
 drive so slowly are on which 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.130
 The reaction time is from 200 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.200
 billion seconds 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.210
 and in general everyone always the right of way 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.500
 take because he great with her 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.000
 Road traffic experience always 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.670
 can estimate when you still have 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.950
 can extend and when not 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.709
 look again 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.220
 the 100 allowed you see I think something 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.950
 I mean 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.180
 are better at those people I would 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.799
 now here for example on the street 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.280
 and here on the right somewhere on the 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.860
 junction 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.900
 the women's involvement with 50 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.390
 km / h 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.069
 about ten milliseconds to the left 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.550
 see if anyone comes and then 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.350
 take off directly 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.880
 may then ekz may with 60 behind 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.710
 to drive here because after the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.760
 have taken vorfahrt they dare 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.250
 suddenly not anymore 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.510
 to drive the specified speed 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.090
 that's really the worst 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.560
 Behaviorally I know at all 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.360
 when driving when the at the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.400
 Rendezvous ran where pay attention 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.959
 is 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.970
 then just a little to the left 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.480
 watch 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.220
 and pull out immediately 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.780
 you can just in the short time 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.670
 Do not judge if then for example 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.420
 motorcyclist is experienced fast 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.040
 how further is still away 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.209
 you just can not judge it 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.400
 if you are not at least one 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.560
 second takes time to slowly 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.480
 involvement and want to be tidy 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.100
 to watch 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.320
 i will be in the car 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.910
 Motorcycle really on the tap of 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.440
 such people the right of way taken 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.150
 the easiest speed is not 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.100
 either assess what is not cologne 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.030
 or simply because they are not 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.310
 take time for it 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.570
 Jau the return was a bit more 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.770
 on the trowel interview 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.770
 here is still 50 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.590
 and goodbye 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.460
 a bad time 20 minutes or so 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.070
 and he probably just drove the 70 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.009
 is surprised is now was the fifth 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.169
 or so they are all too slow 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.310
 So maybe we will become the people 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.380
 against someone down in the comments 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.689
 could explain why people in general 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.969
 drive too slowly 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.390
 why never 100 is driven when 100 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.490
 allowed is 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.200
 it will not interest you burning 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.450
 why that is so and you can me too 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.150
 like your experiences describe the 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.770
 somehow with the whole topic right 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.660
 and speed have to do 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.090
 I apologize today that I am 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.740
 had a little worse when driving 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.560
 but I can not be true or 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.740
 I'm really fed up with it 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.170
 Well, we liked anyway you can 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.070
 Of course I like to thumb up 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.050
 let there 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.310
 if you want to see more of me 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.700
 you also like to complain 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.950
 and if you did that then see 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.500
 we 'll be back in the next video 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.890
 and bye bye and until then 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.890
 next time
