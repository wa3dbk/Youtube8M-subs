00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.850
 Well first 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 It is because the body is made 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.570

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
 I do not decide to win 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.050
 The second round is 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.290
 Also 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.280
 It was physical 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.540

 Accidents have also made corresponding losses securitized 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.320

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.459
 Professor of the city Shimodai 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.739
