00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.239
 the inspiration is fast by the mouth wide open 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.310
 it 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.740
 seen the mark a stopping time at the thighs so it will be more difficult to 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 get out of the water goes well 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.530
 the names of the associated members of the cifq 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 and the weight 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.830
 you perform aron with your hands 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.830
 located round with hands and I just touched 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.550
 this approach 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.000
 lorient all the bells 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.520
 chest with hands 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.020
 which allows to have the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.900
 well folded 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 already oriented 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.780
 the shot was a pillar 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.410
 on a crazy crazy line the agreement and not behind 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.750
 the shots well bend the hand oriented 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.090
 I inspire 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.660
 and right after 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.110
 I lay down 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.510
 by entering the head the jurists 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.050
 the action takes the movement as a whole 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.480
 I am starting 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.780
 the little circle I touch him and immediately 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.600
 I live while returning the head 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.730
 for this phase 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.820
 this phase with the arms it allows to raise well the head 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.459
 to be able to have a good inspiration 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.489
 I aspire chips 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.489
 and juvisy blowing 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.459
 Let's go 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:17.289
 when you master the exercise 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:21.049
 continue but this time we do not touch the chest anymore with the world 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:33.009
 we gather above the head 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.839
 looking for nice 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.529
 seek continuity of movement 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:42.239
 will bring our arms back as fast as possible in order not to slow down 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.669
 3 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.179
 m 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.729
 verisign is already a good strength training 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:12.119
 it will unbalance your analysis 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:21.400
 the legs are very very very important in breaststroke 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.879
 it's thanks to the legs 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.110
 we can move forward effectively 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.110
 symmetrical leg movement 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.050
 he finishes at the same time 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.240
 all at the same time 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.370
 and we bring back the legs at the same time 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.699
 it's with the party 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.699
 inside the calf 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.669
 and I bring them 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.669
 Let's go 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.759
 is 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.660
 feet turned out to ask us if you have any 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.660
 inside the legs 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:33.909
 in any case 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.009
 for 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.009
 your head 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.189
 since august 1 in london 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:51.210
 you orient your feet to the outside 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.280
 the human contact I am on the hands louis guaranteeing a good positioning of 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.280
 legs or objects 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.949
 you can perform exercises on your stomach 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.019
 all these lots to do so energetically with the inside of the leg
