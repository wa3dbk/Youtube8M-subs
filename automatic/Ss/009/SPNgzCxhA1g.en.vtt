00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
time we call it dragon time and this is

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.150 
time we call it dragon time and this is
something<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.320> he<00:01:51.440> learns<00:01:51.650> early<00:01:51.830> in<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
something that he learns early in the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.670 
something that he learns early in the
game<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:52.640> it's<00:01:53.090> very<00:01:53.240> useful<00:01:53.479> not<00:01:54.290> only<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
game so it's very useful not only in the
