 to accept and in this way we are going to 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.980
 check that the installation has 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.980
 effected in a satisfactory manner 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.870
 now you can check 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.070
 that has already been installed perfectly 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.860
 recovery that we have sent from the 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.810
 yahoo application 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.970

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.920
 work mode and this is simply with the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.420
 phone keys 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.090

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.640
 has been able to provide san sim the only thing 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.340
 what we have to do is once 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.280
 we have connected the phone from the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.120
 computer introduced in the sd card 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.709
 the dechanzi recovery is worth and then 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.090
 to install it from this own 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.319
 recovery the only thing we have to do 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.129
 is to go 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.950
 to the option that urges the zip that is the 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.250

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.090
 we give the power button and we access 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.580
 the following options in this case we 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.660
 appear so we can choose from 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.670
 the internal sd or the external sd 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.090
 I in my case have it placed in the sd 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.800
 external that is the second option 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.540

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.370
 we have in our external headquarters and in my 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.220
 I have a folder that I call it 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.620
 rooms that is where I have all the 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.990

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.310

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.060
 power and warns us if we want 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.680
 continue with the installation in this 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.680
 case we give to each other 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.509
 will start an installation process 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.760

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.100
 check that we're done with this 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.820
 installation now the only thing that we have 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:13.160
 what to do is go downstairs where they put 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.560
 code back and we press and now the only thing 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.930
 what we have to do is go down below the 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.110
 everything where it puts power menu and we go back to 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.150
 hit the power key 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:28.960

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.600
 if we want to know root access what 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.090
 only thing we have to do is not 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.020
 and will automatically start the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.020
 restart of the mobile 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:57.149

00:05:53.969 --> 00:06:00.379
 recovery that has created sanz in you can 

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:00.379
 see the abbreviations of dual sim 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.919
 and now as you can see we have the 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.200
 but this time in recovery mode touch 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.050
 this way is much simpler than not 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.680
 have to be touching the keys of the 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.080
 mobile and we have everything in Spanish to 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.960
 for a better situation than it is 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.400
 the thing and so that we have everything in 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.300
 our dear language 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.300
 a greeting
