00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.759
 where they have installed the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.849
 Mexican 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.240
 there it is considered vegetarian what does it tell us 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.309
 the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.880
 that you have your own head, so to speak 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.970
 The question I want to turn 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.730
 has long made is whether one 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 100% raw food in Germany 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.529
 two his German-speaking 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.130
 is possible 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.850
 I came to the conclusion that is 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.500
 possible but damn difficult i 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.219
 Just want to introduce the reasons 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.930
 maybe you can understand that 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.410
 and it may take you the pressure 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.110
 something 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.570
 nothing is worse than I said 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 100 percent roses you so bitter 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.399
 so far mentioned on it and are 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.750
 social problems now gets to the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.300
 why this is difficult 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.899
 could be foliage in ours, so to speak 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.070
 the first time the fruit 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 and quality 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.559
 because the basis of calories is the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.900
 amount of energy where we catch so full 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.520
 will come from fruits and fruits 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.970
 should be my opinion it is the best 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 source 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.750
 I know it should be the best source 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.640
 they mature to nature as possible 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.070
 the best possible fruits get that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 Of course, it's georgi jannik, of course 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.979
 He grows the best when I grow 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.590
 so to speak, green discounter train s and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 only bananas it then I need no 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.140
 to expect miracles 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.850
 then that can be quite backwards 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.100
 and of course I should 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.890
 not just a source, so to speak 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.970
 Fruits attract a main source 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 Currently , bananas are apples and kgs are great 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.159
 cheap and you always have to 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.290
 eighth that their mature fruits is their 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.030
 You have to eat ripe fruits because if I am 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.640
 enough ripe fruits can get that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.200
 The next one is really difficult 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.259
 point is such a small financial 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.170
 Aspect one can do a small thing 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.610
 spend when you are, so to speak 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.009
 tropical fruits 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.410
 can deliver there is the possibility 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.690
 about all kinds of shipping houses and stuff 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.960
 Really tropical fruits 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.400
 like dorian jackpot or other time 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.220
 to be delivered 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.220
 also a really good quality that 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.090
 then it costs a bit of coal 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.130
 we should also bring in variety 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.840
 that we maybe a little bit 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.870
 always look what's up there and rotate 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.810
 Also, as it were, Germany has beautiful 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.880
 fruits beautiful vegetables that I like you 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.690
 can recommend it then too 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.959
 are favorable 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.610
 no, this clearly such a papaya of 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.100
 elsewhere in organic quality 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.310
 that's expensive that's really expensive that 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.840
 I already know and grad on land in 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.070
 Germany at least so I do not know 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.000
 as it is in a switzerland but me 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.630
 believe that is not better or 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.840
 Austria it is damn hard to 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.459
 such things to come 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.840
 the next point why so to say 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.920
 why it is difficult one 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.120
 one hundred percent high what 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.970
 It's easy to do that 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.130
 not only tropical climate tropical 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.900
 Climate We have to look at the tropical climate 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.880
 get on, unfortunately, to us in the form of 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.450
 Clothes and cheese are eaten 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.459
 living in such a tropical environment 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.380
 not only the sun really shines 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.080
 super important is the people one 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.030
 Chronic fear of full sun around and 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.739
 skin cancer and such and then lubricate themselves 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.230
 so to speak with these petroleum aluminum 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:37.010
 preparations and of course we are from 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.690
 the third point daily in addition to the 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.290
 lack of clean tropical climate 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.739
 stress free environment and the sun and 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.810
 the fruits of fund quality in itself 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.980
 is the modest quality, so to speak 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.180
 of the green stuff mails 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.349
 I'm definitely a fan of 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.080
 wild herbs 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.959
 but let's say in all honesty who has 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.010
 just day time and ever 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:11.660
 possibility would be 100 grams and collects 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.640
 market 3 400 grams green each one 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.920
 to pick up day and eating out for 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.780
 to juices next or or or or 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.850
 and especially in winter it is one 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.669
 catastrophe clearly there is the possibility 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.000
 to get mose or roamware leaves 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.490
 a lot of green is not wild in winter 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.370
 Krenzer otherwise humble that's easy 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.340
 and I think the wild herbs are green 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.080
 for that to be essential 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.240
 One hundred percent rovers successful 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.660
 bed and if we do not speak 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.130
 halligalli lie lead or somehow 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.740
 simply have the luck, so to speak 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.550
 possibility to have time every day 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.669
 to get land 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.169
 How do you want to say that then 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.270
 just because I'm in the summer, so to speak 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.080
 me the wild herbs is a narrow one 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.750
 I do not need to think 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.840
 I can do this in the winter of about this 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.450
 error I do not personally times the 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.270
 that means, in my opinion, the three 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.510
 main reasons unfortunately climatic conditions 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.410
 and because of the two transport routes the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.380
 a one hundred percent raw food damned 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.470
 can be made difficult 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.270
 it is theoretically possible eventual 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.560
 provided financial means because 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.720
 as I said you can do small 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.490
 spend for really good tropical 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.410
 fruits and you would have to partially 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.650
 really much much time and 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.320
 have to have each day the fresh 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.789
 to get green and that's why I am 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.910
 also doing that, so to speak, with 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.330
 a 90 percent or even 80 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.440
 percent or less 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.180
 achieved fantastic results 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.030
 I think these are the ones 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.130
 optimal results because of this 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.660
 condition presented you live 4000 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.580
 5000 kilometers further south 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.070
 that looks quite different from you have 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.600
 gave her certain problems and that is 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.060
 The point does not look so bitter 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.570
 so shortened that takes your own 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.310
 pressure and you will see 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.920
 drive fantastic results if it 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.440
 so to speak the basic rules was the 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.240
 curve means the low-fat diet 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.850
 Actually, that's not all 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.020
 wait little endurance sports nicely 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:23.560
 sleep recovery so easy so easy 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.420
 that's exactly what my thoughts are 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.900
 how does that look with 100% ingo cost 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.360
 Are you there stringent, so to speak? 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.240
 her 100 that must be everything else is 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.800
 Mist you have a few more tips and 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.730
 to handle certain things better then 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.460
 just write under it 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.450
 I'll just keep coming back 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.310
 what to hear 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.250
 so you see it sort of like one 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.380
 average type of raw food and 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.400
 that's why you act and you sort of 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.830
 relatively easy, they are super comfortable 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.000
 achieve results 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.300
 thanks for watching until next 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.300
 times 

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:11.349
 after six bondar but 30 kilograms
