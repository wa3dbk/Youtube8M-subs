that<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.590> over<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:59.040> you'll<00:01:59.159> see

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that and then over here you'll see

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.819 
that and then over here you'll see
duration<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:01.369> let's<00:02:02.369> try<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.540> half<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.229> second<00:02:04.619> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
duration so let's try a half a second so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.119 
duration so let's try a half a second so
I'll<00:02:05.610> whoops<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.780> once<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.469> get<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.770> these

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
I'll whoops so once you get you these

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.979 
I'll whoops so once you get you these
have<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.729> highlighted<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.390> order<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.899> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
have to be highlighted in order for you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.080 
have to be highlighted in order for you
to<00:02:10.020> edit<00:02:10.349> them<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.009> go<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.430> here

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
to edit them so you have to go up here

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.670 
to edit them so you have to go up here
once<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.420> highlight<00:02:12.629> them

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
once you highlight them

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.250 
once you highlight them
set<00:02:13.980> when<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.609> try<00:02:14.819> 0.5<00:02:15.719> and<00:02:16.019> see<00:02:16.140> how<00:02:16.200> that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
set when I try 0.5 and see how that

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.380 
set when I try 0.5 and see how that
comes<00:02:16.500> out<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.519> as<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.879> see<00:02:17.939> right<00:02:18.239> up

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
comes out so as you can see right up

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.380 
comes out so as you can see right up
here<00:02:18.719> they<00:02:19.200> are<00:02:19.319> 5<00:02:19.590> seconds<00:02:20.040> each<00:02:20.189> so<00:02:21.030> now<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:21.299> I

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
here they are 5 seconds each so now if I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.099 
here they are 5 seconds each so now if I
hit<00:02:21.540> play<00:02:21.739> it's<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.890> little<00:02:23.250> bit<00:02:23.400> smoother<00:02:24.109> but

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
hit play it's a little bit smoother but

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.440 
hit play it's a little bit smoother but
it's<00:02:25.290> still<00:02:25.530> kind<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.799> choppy<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.939> let's<00:02:27.180> try

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
it's still kind of choppy so let's try

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.470 
it's still kind of choppy so let's try
to<00:02:27.510> speed<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.829> little<00:02:29.040> bit<00:02:29.250> more<00:02:29.480> let's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
to speed it up a little bit more let's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.530 
to speed it up a little bit more let's
try<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.079> 0.3<00:02:32.120> do<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:35.150> that's<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.269> little<00:02:36.389> bit

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
try like 0.3 do that that's a little bit

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.140 
try like 0.3 do that that's a little bit
better<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:36.959> it's<00:02:37.109> still<00:02:37.260> kind<00:02:37.469> of<00:02:37.500> choppy<00:02:38.150> we

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
better but it's still kind of choppy we

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.789 
better but it's still kind of choppy we
kind<00:02:39.389> of<00:02:39.480> get<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.629> idea<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:40.260> how<00:02:40.439> to<00:02:40.469> do<00:02:40.680> this

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
kind of get the idea on how to do this

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.390 
kind of get the idea on how to do this
time<00:02:41.040> lapse<00:02:41.280> with<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.269> new<00:02:42.389> Mavericks

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
time lapse with the new Mavericks

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.670 
time lapse with the new Mavericks
so<00:02:44.400> here's<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.090> plan<00:02:45.389> through<00:02:47.629> but<00:02:48.629> now<00:02:48.930> I'm

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
so here's a plan through but now I'm

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.470 
so here's a plan through but now I'm
gonna<00:02:49.829> try<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.129> get<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.340> little<00:02:50.819> bit<00:02:50.970> smoother

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
gonna try to get a little bit smoother

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.500 
gonna try to get a little bit smoother
and<00:02:52.409> try<00:02:52.819> 0.1<00:02:53.819> see<00:02:54.569> how<00:02:54.659> that<00:02:54.840> comes<00:02:55.079> out<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:56.510> as

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and try 0.1 see how that comes out so as

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.860 
and try 0.1 see how that comes out so as
you<00:02:57.629> can<00:02:57.750> see<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.319> is<00:02:58.469> a<00:02:58.500> little<00:02:58.769> bit<00:02:58.889> better

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
you can see that is a little bit better

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.319 
you can see that is a little bit better
get<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> little<00:03:01.109> bit<00:03:01.379> better<00:03:01.889> effect<00:03:02.459> but<00:03:03.120> I'm

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
get a little bit better effect but I'm

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.520 
get a little bit better effect but I'm
sure<00:03:03.540> there's<00:03:03.719> some<00:03:03.840> other<00:03:03.930> ways<00:03:04.169> on<00:03:04.379> how<00:03:04.409> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
sure there's some other ways on how to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.860 
sure there's some other ways on how to
do<00:03:04.799> time<00:03:05.400> lapses<00:03:05.969> there's<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.389> bunch<00:03:06.629> of<00:03:06.719> other

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
do time lapses there's a bunch of other

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.440 
do time lapses there's a bunch of other
tutorials<00:03:07.409> but<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.650> found<00:03:07.859> out<00:03:08.099> there<00:03:08.790> really

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
tutorials but I found out there really

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.149 
tutorials but I found out there really
isn't<00:03:09.689> any<00:03:09.930> tutorials<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.650> how<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.799> do<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.099> on

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
isn't any tutorials on how to do it on

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.890 
isn't any tutorials on how to do it on
Mavericks<00:03:11.669> so<00:03:11.909> I<00:03:11.939> figured<00:03:12.299> I'd<00:03:12.419> make<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.599> video

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
Mavericks so I figured I'd make a video

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.530 
Mavericks so I figured I'd make a video
on<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.109> but<00:03:13.889> normally<00:03:14.430> what<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.180> would<00:03:15.389> be<00:03:15.510> able

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
on it but normally what I would be able

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.719 
on it but normally what I would be able
to<00:03:15.719> do<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.769> would<00:03:16.829> be<00:03:17.010> able<00:03:17.099> to<00:03:17.219> go<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.459> my<00:03:17.579> new

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
to do is I would be able to go to my new

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.020 
to do is I would be able to go to my new
event<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.769> I<00:03:19.769> would<00:03:19.919> be<00:03:20.010> able<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.370> bring<00:03:20.639> up<00:03:20.819> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
event and I would be able to bring up a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.839 
event and I would be able to bring up a
little<00:03:21.690> sidebar<00:03:22.079> up<00:03:22.470> here<00:03:22.919> so<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.459> could<00:03:23.609> edit

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
little sidebar up here so you could edit

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.309 
little sidebar up here so you could edit
the<00:03:24.470> clips<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.769> way<00:03:26.389> but<00:03:27.389> then<00:03:27.720> what<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.169> can

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
the clips that way but then what you can

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.839 
the clips that way but then what you can
do<00:03:28.440> once<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.739> get<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:28.979> all<00:03:29.069> set<00:03:29.400> up<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.549> can

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
do once you get it all set up you can

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.030 
do once you get it all set up you can
enhance<00:03:30.419> the<00:03:30.659> photos<00:03:31.019> make<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.470> tweak<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:31.949> a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
enhance the photos make it tweak it a

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.780 
enhance the photos make it tweak it a
little<00:03:32.069> bit<00:03:32.459> make<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.120> look<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:35.370> little<00:03:35.549> bit
