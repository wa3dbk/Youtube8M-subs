00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
outline of it so here it is the p90 I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.549 
outline of it so here it is the p90 I
really<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.300> gun<00:00:57.510> accessory<00:00:57.899> high<00:00:58.260> clip

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
really like this gun accessory high clip

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.760 
really like this gun accessory high clip
size<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.190> has<00:00:59.219> a<00:01:00.030> high<00:01:00.359> rate<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> fire<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.170> not

as<00:01:01.920> much<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.219> call<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> vector<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.149> i<00:01:03.390> write

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
as much we call as a vector so i write

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.390 
as much we call as a vector so i write
this<00:01:04.140> gun<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> little<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:04.949> better<00:01:05.070> than<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the high rate of fire so we can and a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
the high rate of fire so we can and a
high<00:01:25.320> clip<00:01:25.560> size<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.460> save<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.820> on

high clip size so we can save you in on
some<00:01:27.450> situations<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.409> good<00:01:28.560> at<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:29.009> lot

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
some situations and it's good at a lot

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
some situations and it's good at a lot
of<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> ranges<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> i'll<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.320> put<00:01:31.470> in

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
of the ranges and i'll probably put in

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
of the ranges and i'll probably put in
the<00:01:31.619> comments<00:01:32.040> how<00:01:32.400> good<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> bullets<00:01:32.970> are

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
little building over there where I just

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.250 
little building over there where I just
shot<00:02:59.639> at<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.060> when<00:03:00.540> he<00:03:00.599> blew<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> barrels

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
shot at and when he blew up the barrels

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
shot at and when he blew up the barrels
I<00:03:01.380> felt<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.739> was<00:03:01.829> going<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.130> there
