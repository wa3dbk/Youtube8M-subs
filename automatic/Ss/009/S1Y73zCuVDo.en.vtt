would<00:01:00.060> be<00:01:00.090> something<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:02.000> for<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
would be something like this for the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.770 
would be something like this for the
front<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.640> looking<00:01:06.300> for<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> top<00:01:06.750> view

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
front and you looking for a top view

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.580 
front and you looking for a top view
what<00:01:07.650> I'll<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:09.000> would<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.390> quick<00:01:09.690> if<00:01:10.440> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
what I'll get is it would be quick if I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.020 

something<00:01:20.380> like<00:01:20.590> this

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
something like this

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.330 
something like this
okay<00:01:23.510> so<00:01:23.810> make<00:01:24.440> sure<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.620> you<00:01:24.860> planned<00:01:25.160> out

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
okay so make sure that you planned out

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.700 
okay so make sure that you planned out
first<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.120> is<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.300> front<00:01:26.690> this<00:01:27.320> is<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.500> end

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
first this is the front this is the end

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.610 
first this is the front this is the end
and<00:01:28.190> it's<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.850> plank<00:01:29.120> so<00:01:29.540> do<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:29.870> quickly<00:01:30.110> so

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
and it's the plank so do this quickly so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.770 
and it's the plank so do this quickly so
that<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:30.860> can<00:01:31.010> have<00:01:31.220> all<00:01:31.880> right

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
that you can have all right

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.290 
that you can have all right
drawing<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.890> look<00:01:34.040> at<00:01:34.190> this<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.030> very

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
drawing so look at this is the very

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.429 
drawing so look at this is the very
quick<00:01:35.690> sketch<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.470> how<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:36.740> look<00:01:36.950> like<00:01:36.979> right

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
quick sketch of how you look like right

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.219 
quick sketch of how you look like right
so<00:01:39.009> now<00:01:39.189> you<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.329> make<00:01:40.359> your<00:01:40.719> heart<00:01:40.869> of<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
so now you can make your heart of the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.020 
so now you can make your heart of the
wrapping<00:01:41.530> paper<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:43.200> looking<00:01:44.200> at<00:01:44.319> this<00:01:45.030> right

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
wrapping paper so looking at this right

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.749 
wrapping paper so looking at this right
because<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:47.109> is<00:01:47.319> 110

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
because this is 110

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.359 
because this is 110
I<00:01:49.790> mean<00:01:50.600> it's<00:01:51.020> gonna<00:01:51.200> pick<00:01:51.470> up<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.799> couple<00:01:52.100> of

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
I mean it's gonna pick up a couple of

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.789 
I mean it's gonna pick up a couple of
squares<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.570> if<00:01:53.750> I<00:01:53.899> will<00:01:54.110> complete<00:01:54.439> this

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
squares and so if I will complete this

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.340 
squares and so if I will complete this
arrangement<00:01:55.310> I'll<00:01:55.970> run<00:01:56.240> out<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:56.420> space<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.110> I

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
arrangement I'll run out of space so I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.910 
arrangement I'll run out of space so I
will<00:01:57.770> do<00:01:57.950> it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
will do it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.040 
will do it
in<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.400> orientation<00:01:59.970> all<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:00.720> for<00:02:00.900> this

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
in this orientation all right for this

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.770 
in this orientation all right for this
particular<00:02:01.670> drawing<00:02:02.670> should<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.330> have<00:02:03.510> space

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
particular drawing should I have space

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.890 
particular drawing should I have space
to<00:02:04.160> occupy<00:02:05.160> my<00:02:05.460> front<00:02:05.790> view

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
to occupy my front view

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
to occupy my front view
I<00:02:06.930> am<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.500> am<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.130> playing<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.580> over<00:02:08.850> here

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
I am you am I playing you over here

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.970 
I am you am I playing you over here
now<00:02:10.490> otherwise<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.060> okay<00:02:11.870> typically<00:02:12.800> what

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
now otherwise that okay typically what

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.040 
now otherwise that okay typically what
I'll<00:02:13.100> do<00:02:13.460> is<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.880> will<00:02:14.000> hook<00:02:14.300> up<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
I'll do is I will hook up the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.630 
I'll do is I will hook up the
intersection<00:02:15.620> lines<00:02:15.800> where<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.250> somewhere

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
intersection lines where so somewhere

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.820 
intersection lines where so somewhere

all the way from bottom to
the<00:05:30.139> site<00:05:30.580> right<00:05:31.580> now

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:33.939 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:40.830 

this<00:05:34.939> is<00:05:36.189> 4855<00:05:37.189> so<00:05:37.459> I<00:05:37.489> have<00:05:37.819> 40<00:05:38.389> from<00:05:38.659> the<00:05:38.869> site

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
this is 4855 so I have 40 from the site

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.230 
this is 4855 so I have 40 from the site
fifty-five<00:05:41.470> so<00:05:41.650> this<00:05:41.800> is<00:05:41.949> the<00:05:42.100> line<00:05:42.280> and<00:05:42.610> this

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
fifty-five so this is the line and this

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.530 
fifty-five so this is the line and this
goes<00:05:43.480> all<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.720> way<00:05:43.870> down

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.200

and<00:05:48.300> similar<00:05:49.139> to<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.350> bottom<00:05:49.680> so<00:05:49.889> I'm<00:05:50.009> gonna

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
and similar to the bottom so I'm gonna

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.120 
and similar to the bottom so I'm gonna
draw<00:05:50.340> a<00:05:50.370> continuous<00:05:51.000> line<00:05:51.389> that<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.139> right<00:05:52.410> and

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
draw a continuous line that is right and

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.879 
draw a continuous line that is right and
do<00:05:53.789> you<00:05:53.850> so<00:05:54.479> this<00:05:54.720> is<00:05:55.160> and

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
do you so this is and

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
now you realize that the selected part

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.439 
now you realize that the selected part
all<00:06:01.250> right<00:06:01.400> if<00:06:01.520> I<00:06:01.610> will<00:06:01.789> project<00:06:02.030> a<00:06:02.270> line

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
all right if I will project a line

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.920 
all right if I will project a line
across<00:06:02.860> the<00:06:03.860> center<00:06:04.039> part<00:06:04.400> will<00:06:05.300> be<00:06:05.479> seems<00:06:05.750> to

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
across the center part will be seems to

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.550 
across the center part will be seems to
be<00:06:06.280> alright<00:06:07.280> though<00:06:07.750> try-try<00:06:08.750> pratap<00:06:09.379> you

to<00:07:21.720> end<00:07:21.870> of<00:07:21.990> the<00:07:22.110> drawing<00:07:22.380> I'm<00:07:22.620> gonna<00:07:22.919> draw<00:07:23.160> the

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 
to end of the drawing I'm gonna draw the

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.999 
to end of the drawing I'm gonna draw the
orthographic<00:07:24.090> symbol<00:07:24.960> for<00:07:25.289> the<00:07:25.440> percent<00:07:25.889> go

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.009 
orthographic symbol for the percent go

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.670 
orthographic symbol for the percent go
to<00:07:26.190> graphic<00:07:26.490> projection<00:07:27.180> so<00:07:27.630> I'm<00:07:28.289> gonna<00:07:28.470> draw

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 
to graphic projection so I'm gonna draw

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.999 
to graphic projection so I'm gonna draw
is<00:07:28.830> it'll<00:07:29.580> be<00:07:29.669> like<00:07:29.849> this

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.009 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.879 

dr.<00:07:34.699> Klein<00:07:34.909> had<00:07:35.300> set<00:07:35.659> the<00:07:35.809> line<00:07:35.960> another

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889 
dr. Klein had set the line another

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.159 
dr. Klein had set the line another
center<00:07:37.339> line

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.169 
center line

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:41.770 
center line
then<00:07:39.680> I'm<00:07:39.830> going<00:07:39.979> to<00:07:40.009> draw<00:07:40.159> two<00:07:40.629> circuits<00:07:41.629> and

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
then I'm going to draw two circuits and

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.409 
then I'm going to draw two circuits and
tricks<00:07:41.960> occur<00:07:42.289> roughly<00:07:42.949> two<00:07:43.370> skill<00:07:43.729> and<00:07:44.210> this

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:44.419 
tricks occur roughly two skill and this

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:46.629 
tricks occur roughly two skill and this
is<00:07:44.569> my<00:07:44.749> first<00:07:45.469> job<00:07:45.680> of<00:07:46.159> the<00:07:46.219> graphic

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 
is my first job of the graphic

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.890 
is my first job of the graphic
projection<00:07:47.150> simple

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 
projection simple

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.080 
projection simple
all<00:07:49.380> right<00:07:49.530> when<00:07:49.920> you<00:07:50.010> throw<00:07:50.190> this<00:07:50.400> make<00:07:50.970> sure

all right when you throw this make sure

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.780 
all right when you throw this make sure
that<00:07:51.210> your<00:07:51.330> line<00:07:51.480> work<00:07:51.690> is<00:07:51.840> good<00:07:52.640> all<00:07:53.640> the

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:53.790 
that your line work is good all the

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.390 
that your line work is good all the
lines<00:07:54.000> are<00:07:54.240> supposed<00:07:54.480> to<00:07:54.540> end<00:07:54.750> precisely

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 
lines are supposed to end precisely

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.340 
lines are supposed to end precisely
I<00:07:56.430> hope<00:07:56.970> to<00:07:57.120> apologize<00:07:57.630> with<00:07:57.810> a<00:07:57.870> product<00:07:58.260> this

I hope to apologize with a product this
on<00:07:59.160> the<00:07:59.250> video

00:08:00.739 --> 00:08:00.749 
on the video

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:02.839 
on the video
it's<00:08:01.080> not<00:08:01.319> perfect<00:08:01.860> drawing<00:08:02.129> position<00:08:02.669> but
