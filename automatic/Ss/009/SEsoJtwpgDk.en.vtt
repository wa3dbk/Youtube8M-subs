00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.410 
all had a pretty big alternative strike
and<00:00:31.630> I<00:00:32.500> just<00:00:32.920> loved<00:00:33.220> not<00:00:33.520> being<00:00:33.790> mainstream

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
and I just loved not being mainstream

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.990

and<00:00:34.980> Meredith<00:00:35.980> was<00:00:36.129> always<00:00:36.460> born<00:00:36.790> as

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
and that the energy associated with that

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.840 
and that the energy associated with that
will<00:00:43.900> always<00:00:44.260> be<00:00:44.559> a<00:00:44.830> part<00:00:45.250> of<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.430> festival

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
something like that but I think that

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.920 
something like that but I think that
whole<00:02:00.490> thing<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:01.030> people<00:02:01.390> coming<00:02:01.720> together
