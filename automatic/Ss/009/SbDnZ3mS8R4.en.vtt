00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.920
 I judged by close 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.210
 Ilyley 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.840
 Your Judgment 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.789
 Bruno Cesar dominated 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.789
 we start this project the ball from the right but it passes 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.239
 in the first half of the game 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.140
 to surprise 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.740
 with which goalkeeper Caesar 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.740
 soon after the 1 to 0 for the corinthians 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.710
 but of course the game may exist a little bit 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.210
 to make the differential because the boat was docked 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.070
 positioning also ranged points 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.800
 in the counter-attack the other goal was the corinthians who entering a ball through the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 High try for something. 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.410
 someone had to fight with someone who knew the 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.190
 Bruno Caesar positively made another side of the state 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.760
 called chubby panic scenes 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.000
 the fuel continues in the center 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.760
 went to the top of the para 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 diego léo santana can i agree 0 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.030
 the bonfire 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 a little rhythm this game dealt with the subject 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.720
 the palm trees came to the goal 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.200
 he stresses that first with extreme happiness 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.760
 but at 42 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.150
 1 to 0 no avaí 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.350
 a decisive point that can define 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.549
 was up with the goal would go up to play music 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.790
 practically settled the game with the Corinthians and can loosen up a bit 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.320
 more now 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.830
 in that sense they released a few more opponents public leave 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.929
 the sides come out too much 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.719
 because the corinthians wary almost not so we have to think of ourselves 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.329
 cuba was not mad at the author of my people 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.069
 Roberto Carlos 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.519
 defeated on the other hand 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.229
 I'm going to the Tse 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 on the other side of the confrontation the father himself 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.579
 your parents 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.129
 it was an 8 minute second half 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.369
 Look at the ball with your foot. 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.069
 smokers 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.649
 it was as if roberto carlos cs 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:09.589
 deborah secco 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.949
 played was all built he could have set and could have beaten coconut and 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.949
 rang back from cuba term court 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.169
 the avaí since the two less players - trying to leave the game and still 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.199
 taking counter-attack with two players less 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.589
 wake up to challenge
