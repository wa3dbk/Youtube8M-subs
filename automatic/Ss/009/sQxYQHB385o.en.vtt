 pedestrian crossings on the highway but you 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.569
 are obliged to be a believer in the country 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.490

 the highway and watch car passed 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:05.500
 on the highway he sees a truck raging 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.500
 he avoids a motorcycle he avoids a twingo 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.210
 that's driver-road people who 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.400
 grumbles
