00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
works so we don't need to ask why it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.630 
works so we don't need to ask why it
works<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.680> complain<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.220> it's

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
to your um go to the pairing screen and

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.609 
to your um go to the pairing screen and
then<00:01:41.329> try<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> normal<00:01:43.079> way<00:01:43.290> as

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
instructed on screen and then what you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.039 
instructed on screen and then what you
do<00:01:49.310> take<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> batteries<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.659> back<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
do take out the batteries in the back of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.580 
do take out the batteries in the back of
the<00:01:52.140> remote<00:01:52.500> put<00:01:53.340> them<00:01:53.490> back<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.439> do<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the remote put them back in and do the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.249 
the remote put them back in and do the
same<00:01:55.619> process<00:01:56.399> over<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.659> should<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
same process over and that should do the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.420 
same process over and that should do the
trick<00:01:58.610> as<00:01:59.610> stupid<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.659> sounds<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:02.100> worked

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
