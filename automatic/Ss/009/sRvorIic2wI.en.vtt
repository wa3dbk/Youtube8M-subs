00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.060
 it means pure fix pipe so we see it 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.300
 pipe means quality 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.770
 pipes in every way 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.800
 what happens to her for just a couple 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.510
 years how she stood it means she 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.330
 uses floor collector on and 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:26.050
 heating this case is residential 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.340
 Izmailovsky complex I was dismantling 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.369
 their alteration 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.220
 heating system here this fittings 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.500
 here's an option because I already warmed it 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.980
 happens just falls off the pipe yet 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.940
 It becomes brittle that it is I Pecs 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.730
 I think that this is due to the fact that no 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.930
 normal stitching here as usual 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.010
 somewhere saved or 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.850
 the technical process is broken by itself text 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.560
 very reliable pipe in this case 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.100
 this is happening right now to you now 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.090
 will show 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 means that it can with it again clearly 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.640
 look now i am heating the pipe 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.729
 here we look means 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.770
 the pipe became transparent due to 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.780
 inner layer of dirt 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.770
 so the pipe was already the desktop all 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.109
 seen instantly and destruction of the pipe 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.979
 that is, as I understand it, there is simply no stitching 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:12.690
 just a piece of plastic is clearly not peks 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.800
 what happened to the pipe in just 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.840
 a couple of years of operation 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.840
 therefore I advise all the developer of vertex 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 throw out 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.950
 the same it is this 20 diameter too 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.630
 such nonsense 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.240
 although this should not have been at 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.130
 warming up the cupcake on the contrary you will be due 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.140
 become soft and he basically 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.560
 repair all damage 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:50.180
 here we see the end quickly 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.180
 thank you all, bye
