00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.430
 Gardening friends today I show you how 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.529
 the extremely powerful chaos enchantment 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.460
 arriving in the strongest enchantment 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.200
 completely cairo 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.700
 how the whole thing works I show 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.969
 as always after the prelude a lot 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.969
 fun 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.240
 basic requirement is it again 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.070
 that he is building the track here 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.140
 are the three main places have 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.210
 falls the old adlershof and fortress 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.400
 frost mother travels from fans dig out 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.380
 direction the old matthaus yard and there 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.060
 You meet her on a slideshow 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.190
 then compacted and automatically 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.200
 starts the quest march of the dead 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.030
 once the ash product is eliminated 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.190
 you talk to the resident dark elf 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.570
 Captain the turn of the task 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.340
 entrusted with the offers 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.930
 find out and that's easier 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.760
 said as done 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.310
 conversely it is easier done than 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.110
 you have to just say that 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.000
 ash blood-examine its earlier 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.030
 have destroyed and there you will find 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.260
 a letter called declaration of war dinka 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 what I read through is a whole 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.399
 funny background story again 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.050
 he then gives the whole in general again 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.910
 from the turn entrusted to you the task 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.470
 to go fortress france mode and 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.509
 to look there for the right one 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.220
 the whole thing is embedded in one again 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.740
 cool background history around general 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.240
 carius in one or another elder 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.910
 veteran scrolls among you maybe 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.170
 still known to be more in the 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.580
 but I do not want the point history 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.350
 betrayed but you find in solid 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.210
 cost a book or something again 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.620
 very much tells about the history 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.909
 recommended you read this again 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.580
 as I said, I do not want anything 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.750
 arriving in the fortress arrived 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.220
 of course you have to deal with the ashes 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.170
 beat up brother and then you find 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.729
 in this bag the key 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.320
 fortress frost mother him once 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.170
 sink and then it goes back 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.330
 and now there is an endboss fight on the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.580
 is saving again best 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.070
 equipment out best urge to swallow 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.640
 and prepare you for the endboss 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.350
 can handle a lot and then come 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.380
 we too clou viz the chaos 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.390
 enchantment of the nice gentleman general 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.340
 carius whom we will fight immediately 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.840
 that's what the champions wear 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.670
 the unique is damn cool 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.410
 looks and on the way the chaos 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.149
 enchantment and is also the only one 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.209
 Subject of this chaos enchantment 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.940
 and who now has some weapons on two 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.440
 stands around on thick warshemmer the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.200
 may indeed like I keep would you 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.360
 but recommend disenchanted this stick 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.860
 the champions then and get you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.920
 so that the chaos enchantment the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.940
 most powerful all enchantment types in 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.310
 completely cairo 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.670
 because he has the possibility both 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.470
 fire ice 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.110
 as well as lightning damage at the same time too 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.540
 cause a 50 with every stroke 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.099
 Percent chance all three elements 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.360
 causing damage 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.940
 that means it also has for everyone 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.860
 enemy types armed independently 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.330
 which ones resist your opponents 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.440
 that means he does not just have to 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.000
 any weak spots in the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.840
 opponents pay he yes all three 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.160
