00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello love my body no longer tweaks Bangert the churches and I will 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.380
 Show you today how he owns a glass door with the Main 1 point 7 off counters 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.349
 and the ski club is and builds 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.329
 as a first portrait of any block of materials 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:22.519
 It agrees that we have to go smart, which requires an option and builds bragging rights 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.019
 three blocks of clay 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.269
 and two blocks wide, two blocks wide 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.850
 so 2 opposite 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.570
 then the doubtless and does the same again 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 The best Bochnick is the Pistons 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.430
 this game went behind 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.670
 become a second one 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 The three does not do that with two parents 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.470
 and then of course we need it clearly 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.450
 because of the glass door 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.400
 that works of course, ascend or other stuff 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.549
 and now we need a tread say so a second box will Rattle 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.800
 each as avatars 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.920
 is dec 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.270
 that only exists here badly or 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.900
 available under a Vesper who with the reform 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.680
 there 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.800
 here 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.200
 the trust 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.880
 Loew need the Schalke 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 but the whole thing is a gear works 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.960
 and I just want to do that now 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.960
 and of course a switch 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 Banier placed nearby 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.980
 and as you see 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.360
 Fox has a case 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.640
 OM, despite being weaker than a prisoner, wants the 4 best when its expanding 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.719
 that builds only one percent off one input and one output 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.970
 because the whole works only on one side 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.509
 so 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.579
 Danny Type 2 is 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.579
 Dan kg more for the state every year 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.169
 So almost the percent 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.469
 This is where the outsiders set the house 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.939
 the door is open 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.939
 drive Dr AG 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.299
 So here she is from Leipzig ThÃ¼rs open 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.579
 Dagobert made Kirsch help 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.869
 and you have 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.869
 I could not do it now 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.779
 and looked at the base of numbers every year 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.829
 previous process costs per cent 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.749
 then do not take it 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.329
 Bonn 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.329
 Dr not on the page 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.949
 Rolfes met a must have gone himself 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.489
 Dr by Birgit Kiefer wife 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 that could be many hidden door and will 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.839
 and yes that was the way the lawyer Claes just started him 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.259
 and we are at the first time
