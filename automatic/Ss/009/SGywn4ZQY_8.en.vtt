you know glasses are great too but you
know<00:00:21.689> sometimes<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.650> that

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
know sometimes I just think that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.080 
know sometimes I just think that
contacts<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.340> nice<00:00:23.490> because<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.880> don't<00:00:24.060> have

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
contacts are nice because you don't have

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.330 
contacts are nice because you don't have
to<00:00:24.210> worry<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.720> breaking<00:00:25.050> them<00:00:25.410> or<00:00:25.740> getting

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to worry about breaking them or getting

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.490 
to worry about breaking them or getting
hit<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.330> let's<00:00:27.539> get<00:00:27.689> started<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
hit with the so let's get started so the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.050 
hit with the so let's get started so the
first<00:00:28.740> tip<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.670> girls<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
first tip that I have for girls that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 
first tip that I have for girls that
wear<00:00:30.420> glasses<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.529> use<00:00:31.679> two<00:00:32.340> different

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
wear glasses is to use two different

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.850 
wear glasses is to use two different
kinds<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.360> eyeshadow<00:00:33.780> colors<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
kinds of eyeshadow colors I think that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280 
kinds of eyeshadow colors I think that
an<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.190> over<00:00:35.399> color<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> best<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.750> well<00:00:37.170> as

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
an all over color is the best as well as

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.650 
an all over color is the best as well as
a<00:00:37.350> highlight<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> don't<00:00:38.879> really<00:00:39.210> need<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
a highlight so you don't really need a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.690 
a highlight so you don't really need a
crease<00:00:40.050> color<00:00:40.350> unless<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.010> want<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
crease color unless you want it to be a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
crease color unless you want it to be a
little<00:00:41.850> bit<00:00:41.940> more<00:00:42.210> dramatic<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:43.260> sometimes

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
little bit more dramatic but sometimes

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.930 
little bit more dramatic but sometimes
crease<00:00:43.950> colors<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.460> make<00:00:44.640> your<00:00:44.789> eyes<00:00:44.910> look

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
crease colors can make your eyes look

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.720 
crease colors can make your eyes look
really<00:00:45.450> dark<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.890> kind<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.250> hide<00:00:47.489> them

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
really dark and just kind of hide them

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910 
really dark and just kind of hide them
because<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.690> wear<00:00:48.930> glasses<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.620> already

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
because when you wear glasses it already

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.650 
because when you wear glasses it already
creates<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.579> bit<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.850> shadow<00:00:51.090> from

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
creates a little bit of a shadow from

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.959 
creates a little bit of a shadow from
the<00:00:51.840> glass<00:00:52.050> frames<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.489> were<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> crease

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the glass frames so if you were a crease

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.639 
the glass frames so if you were a crease
color<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.690> kind<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> makes<00:00:55.079> look<00:00:55.260> really

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
color to it kind of makes look really

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.740 
color to it kind of makes look really
dark<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.399> nice<00:00:56.610> palette<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.329> think

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
dark so a nice palette that I think

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.510 
dark so a nice palette that I think
works<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.079> good<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:58.980> over<00:00:59.340> lid

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
works really good for all over lid

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.900 
works really good for all over lid
colors<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.469> coastal<00:01:01.469> scents<00:01:01.710> 88<00:01:02.460> or

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
colors is this coastal scents 88 or

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
colors is this coastal scents 88 or
palette<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.110> has<00:01:04.350> 88<00:01:04.739> really

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
palette and so it just has 88 really

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.420 
palette and so it just has 88 really
warm<00:01:05.460> neutral<00:01:06.090> shades<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:08.040> great<00:01:08.310> for

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
warm neutral shades that are great for

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.789 
warm neutral shades that are great for
everyday<00:01:08.790> use<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.840> find<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.290> bunch<00:01:10.560> of

everyday use and you can find a bunch of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.920 
everyday use and you can find a bunch of
really<00:01:11.010> pretty<00:01:11.280> ones<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.720> can

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
really pretty ones in here that you can

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.510 
use and you can even have some
highlights<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:15.930> too<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:16.770> just

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
highlights in here too and there's just

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
highlights in here too and there's just
that<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:17.850> fun<00:01:18.210> ones<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.659> they're<00:01:18.810> still

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
that really fun ones but they're still

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.780 
that really fun ones but they're still
really<00:01:19.140> neutral<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> have

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
really neutral because when you have

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.399 
really neutral because when you have
glasses<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.509> definitely<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.170> you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
glasses I definitely think that you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.140 
glasses I definitely think that you
should<00:01:22.590> stay<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.400> neutral

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
should stay to the more neutral

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
should stay to the more neutral
eyeshadow<00:01:24.390> colors<00:01:25.049> rather<00:01:25.320> than<00:01:25.590> go<00:01:25.770> super

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
eyeshadow colors rather than go super

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.429 
eyeshadow colors rather than go super
bright<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.720> neutral<00:01:28.049> ones<00:01:28.200> will

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
bright because the neutral ones will

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.080 
bright because the neutral ones will
just<00:01:28.619> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> enhance<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.400> beating<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
just kind of enhance your beating if you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.760 
just kind of enhance your beating if you
want<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> little<00:01:30.540> smaller<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> palette<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
want a little smaller of a palette I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.460 
want a little smaller of a palette I
really<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.729> elf<00:01:33.170> little<00:01:34.170> quad

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
really think that this elf little quad

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.270 
really think that this elf little quad
in<00:01:34.799> nauvoo<00:01:35.700> neutrals<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.990> nice

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
in nauvoo neutrals is really nice

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.980 
in nauvoo neutrals is really nice
especially<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.939> two<00:01:39.180> shades<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.600> here

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
especially these two shades right here

recommend is the Stila the it girl
palette<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.469> think<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.130> these<00:01:59.280> two<00:01:59.549> would<00:01:59.700> be

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
palette I think that these two would be

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.319 
palette I think that these two would be
awesome<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:01.799> over<00:02:02.070> lip<00:02:02.219> colors<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:03.149> one

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329

dazzle light is really nice so that's a

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.449 
dazzle light is really nice so that's a
bunch<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.810> really<00:02:33.200> nice<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.650> chatah's<00:02:34.220> and

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
bunch of really nice I chatah's and

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.490 
bunch of really nice I chatah's and
another<00:02:35.120> thing<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.599> think<00:02:35.900> looks<00:02:36.079> really

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
another thing that I think looks really

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.559 
another thing that I think looks really
nice<00:02:36.620> when<00:02:36.859> you<00:02:36.890> have<00:02:37.040> glasses<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:38.060> eyeliner

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
nice when you have glasses it's eyeliner

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.509 
nice when you have glasses it's eyeliner
I<00:02:38.870> think<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.349> eyeliner<00:02:39.769> is<00:02:40.040> actually<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
I think that eyeliner is actually the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.099 
I think that eyeliner is actually the
most<00:02:40.700> important<00:02:41.299> when<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.599> have<00:02:41.810> glasses

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
most important when you have glasses

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.780 
most important when you have glasses
because<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.859> really<00:02:43.010> brightens<00:02:43.250> up<00:02:43.489> your<00:02:43.549> eyes

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
because it really brightens up your eyes

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.640 
because it really brightens up your eyes
and<00:02:44.239> makes<00:02:44.599> them<00:02:44.720> look<00:02:44.870> wider<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.500> more

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
and makes them look wider and more

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.610 
and makes them look wider and more
defined<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.879> eyeliner<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.540> used<00:02:47.930> was<00:02:48.260> the

think<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.129> it's<00:03:25.310> important<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.000> do<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.359> little

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
think that it's important to do a little

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.360 
think that it's important to do a little
bit<00:03:26.660> eyeliner<00:03:27.109> on<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.349> lower<00:03:27.680> lash<00:03:27.949> line<00:03:28.220> as

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
that if i was going to buy this I would

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.939 
that if i was going to buy this I would
either<00:04:01.970> get<00:04:02.209> a<00:04:02.269> dark<00:04:02.720> dark<00:04:02.959> brown<00:04:03.109> or<00:04:03.500> black

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
either get a dark dark brown or black

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.149 
either get a dark dark brown or black
because<00:04:04.669> this<00:04:04.909> brown<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.269> very<00:04:05.659> very<00:04:05.870> bro<00:04:06.199> also

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
because this brown is very very bro also

when<00:04:07.639> you<00:04:07.760> wear<00:04:07.940> glasses<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.629> kind<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:08.959> makes

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
when you wear glasses it kind of makes

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.439 
when you wear glasses it kind of makes
your<00:04:09.379> eyebrows<00:04:09.739> look<00:04:09.949> even<00:04:10.310> more<00:04:10.489> defined<00:04:10.879> so

brush<00:04:12.979> them<00:04:13.280> or<00:04:13.549> put<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.030> little<00:04:14.180> bit<00:04:14.419> of<00:04:14.479> clear

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
brush them or put a little bit of clear

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.500 
brush them or put a little bit of clear
gel<00:04:15.440> or<00:04:15.620> clear<00:04:15.890> mascara<00:04:16.370> on<00:04:16.580> top<00:04:16.850> just<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.239> kind

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
gel or clear mascara on top just to kind

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.870 
gel or clear mascara on top just to kind
of<00:04:17.600> smooth<00:04:18.260> them<00:04:18.410> out<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.950> if<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.640> want<00:04:19.850> you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
of smooth them out and if you want you

three times or talked about at least
three<00:04:26.480> times<00:04:26.630> in<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.470> video<00:04:28.130> because<00:04:28.610> i

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
three times in this video because i

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.850 
three times in this video because i
really<00:04:29.180> like<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.510> for<00:04:29.540> everything<00:04:29.930> it's<00:04:30.320> a

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
really like it for everything it's a

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.370 
really like it for everything it's a
satin<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:31.640> it<00:04:31.760> kind<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.090> light<00:04:32.300> enough<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.810> use

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
satin so it kind of light enough to use

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.930 
satin so it kind of light enough to use
as<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.800> crease<00:04:34.100> color<00:04:34.310> that's<00:04:34.520> really<00:04:34.760> light

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
as a crease color that's really light

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.600 
as a crease color that's really light
and<00:04:35.210> in<00:04:35.600> my<00:04:35.720> eyebrows<00:04:36.110> but<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.860> also<00:04:37.070> dark

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
and in my eyebrows but it's also dark

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.280 
and in my eyebrows but it's also dark
enough<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.090> can<00:04:38.180> build<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.540> up<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.110> it's

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
enough that you can build it up and it's

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.110 
enough that you can build it up and it's
just<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:39.650> nice<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.460> i<00:04:40.490> also<00:04:40.700> think<00:04:41.030> that

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
just so nice so i also think that

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.120 
just so nice so i also think that
lipstick<00:04:41.570> is<00:04:41.750> very<00:04:41.990> important<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:43.100> think

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
lipstick is very important and I think

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.950 
lipstick is very important and I think
that<00:04:43.460> nude<00:04:43.640> lipsticks<00:04:44.120> are<00:04:44.300> better<00:04:44.480> for<00:04:44.750> girls

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
that nude lipsticks are better for girls

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.630 
that nude lipsticks are better for girls
that<00:04:45.050> wear<00:04:45.260> glasses<00:04:45.500> because<00:04:45.770> it's<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.370> little

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
that wear glasses because it's a little

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.060 
that wear glasses because it's a little
bit<00:04:46.820> more<00:04:47.330> natural<00:04:47.810> looking<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.320> with<00:04:48.950> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
bit more natural looking and with the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.250 
bit more natural looking and with the
eyeliner<00:04:49.400> being<00:04:49.790> so<00:04:50.000> dramatic<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.690> think<00:04:51.080> that

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
eyeliner being so dramatic I think that

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.990 
eyeliner being so dramatic I think that
it's<00:04:51.440> really<00:04:51.710> helpful<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.160> have<00:04:52.280> really

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
it's really helpful to have really

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.780 
it's really helpful to have really
neutral<00:04:53.690> eyeshadow<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.410> really<00:04:54.710> neutral<00:04:55.220> you
