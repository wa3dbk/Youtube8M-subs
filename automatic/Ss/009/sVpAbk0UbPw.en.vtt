00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.920
 just a few very brief words for 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.779
 greet them and to thank them for 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.610
 I heart your presence in our country 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.130
 to attend a major event of 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.150
 democracy as is the position of a 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.189
 President elected by popular vote 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.640
 I had the honor of being chosen by 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.460
 for a second term and that honor me 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.220
 commits to continue on the path of 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.239
 results that we have been offering to 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:45.040
 correct and revise what it is 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.730
 may be failing and boosting 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.360
 with all the decision the big issues 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.320
 from the country 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.540
 Colombia, as you know, goes through a 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.420
 extraordinary moment of its history 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.190
 we 're not just having a good 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.270
 economic performance but also 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.660
 we are advancing as never before in the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.730
 closing the social gaps of that 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.680
 inequality that we are committed to 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.720
 reduce 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.590
 more and more Colombians 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.450
 overcome poverty 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.600
 and they go on to swell the middle class 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.420
 strengthened and there are also more 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.909
 they come out of extreme poverty and leave 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.159
 the infamous line of misery 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.429
 and the most important thing is that we move forward 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.219
 first time with a realistic vision of 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.770
 solution towards the completion of our 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.990
 internal armed conflict 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.649
 the first and most important step to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.890
 consolidate peace and peace in our 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.740
