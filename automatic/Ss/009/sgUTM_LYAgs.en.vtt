00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.740
 and well hello to all a decline and 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.410
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.850
 new video on battlefield 4 in this 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.760
 first episode I'll teach you 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.230
 how to activate the evolution on the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.150
 tablecloth hainan resort 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.190
 they are coming out triumphant brief so a 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.980
 English imax room we'll say tourism to 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.360
 hainan that's a real he who exist 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.400
 south of china an island very 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.600
 tourist which is an area of ​​33 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.640
 thousand square kilometers 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.079
 as is the case on battery iv also 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.420
 or almost 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.149
 in any case as regards 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.640
 the evolution of this map the evolution 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.280
 it's very simple we can collapse 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.079
 the two wings of the main building the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.699
 building in the middle hotel standards on 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.350
 so will be able to have passed the winged 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.640
 left either the rights are both 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.679
 as you wish 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.969
 to do this it's very simple it you 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.530
 just bring a weapon of 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.440
 massive destruction that one expects 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.809
 c4 m320 rpg short what you prefer 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.710
 on the other hand we chose 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.839
 launches rockets 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.970
 then once you have your soul 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.580
 it's even simpler you just need 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.560
 the shot is so it can seem stupid 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.110
 like that but in fact we have to break the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.579
 different bearing walls of each she 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.380
 finally at least the ale you have 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.579
 chosen so as you can see 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.229
 we are in the process of reducing 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.700
 ash is in crumbs this magnificent 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.229
 hotel this magnificent palace a five 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.149
 stars is all green this is a very 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.649
 nice map in passing but it is not 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.840
 which will prevent us from destroying it 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.729
 or at least already to destroy this 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.609
 building this hotel so when I you 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.170
 help on the ground floor and on the stor 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.609
 tends to stages only of straight line 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.340
 or the left or both as you 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:40.369
 want it from the con it's 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.439
 finished and well the allele the tower is going 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.000
 collapse on itself like a 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.740
 the house of cards was very 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.600
 pretty it'll leave a little cloud of 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.270
 dust for a few moments 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.890
 and it's completely changed 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.429
 inside the tablecloth indeed 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.890
 flag we will be more easily 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.280
 accessible by the sides of the shot 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.740
 strategically it's also interesting 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.350
 because if the flag is yours like it 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.110
 will be obliged to pass either by the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.450
 main door is climbed in meadow 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.590
 eat the various debris and that's 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.350
 often much easier to 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.150
 monitor and keep 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.740
 we can even hide in and they 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.750
 are served as protection finally brief 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.430
 it depends on your style of play 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.620
 but it also shows the game well 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.760
 it may be a good idea or not where 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.450
 according to him he is also the game of your 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.650
 team 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.900
 because we are not alone in playing on 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.940
 the map well that can be effective 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.100
 to keep safe 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.420
 the middle flag before the video 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.100
 does not end I wanted to make a 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.200
