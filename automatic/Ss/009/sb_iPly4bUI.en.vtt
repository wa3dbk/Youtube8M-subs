00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
you can sync it with iTunes and it won't

you can sync it with iTunes and it won't
think<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.770> it's<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.190> correct<00:03:05.520> app<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.450> it's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
think that it's a correct app so it's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.700 
think that it's a correct app so it's
really<00:03:06.630> nice<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.080> I'll<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.350> sync<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.650> with

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
really nice and I'll just sync it with

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.410 
really nice and I'll just sync it with
your<00:03:07.890> iTunes<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:08.940> want<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.210> worry<00:03:09.360> about

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
your iTunes and you want to worry about

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.240 
your iTunes and you want to worry about
it<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.290> next<00:03:10.530> one<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.710> want<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.950> talk<00:03:11.010> about<00:03:11.130> a

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
it the next one I want to talk about a

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.490 
it the next one I want to talk about a
side<00:03:11.580> delete<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.120> isn't<00:03:12.450> as<00:03:12.690> popular<00:03:13.110> one

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
side delete this isn't as popular one

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.770 
side delete this isn't as popular one
but<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:13.740> think<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.100> necessary<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:15.000> when

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
but I think it's necessary to get when

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.400 
but I think it's necessary to get when
you<00:03:15.810> first<00:03:16.110> get<00:03:16.740> Cydia<00:03:17.160> because<00:03:18.320> then<00:03:19.320> you

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
you first get Cydia because then you

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.690 
you first get Cydia because then you
will<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.620> any<00:03:19.800> problem<00:03:20.130> deleting<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.520> apps

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
will have any problem deleting the apps

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.280 
will have any problem deleting the apps
usually<00:03:21.540> when<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.750> have<00:03:21.840> an<00:03:21.990> app<00:03:22.140> you're

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
usually when you have an app you're

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.290 
usually when you have an app you're
gonna<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.800> uninstall<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.520> like<00:03:23.820> if<00:03:24.209> I

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
gonna have to uninstall it like if I

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.210 
gonna have to uninstall it like if I
were<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.570> understand<00:03:24.930> sadly<00:03:25.410> I'd<00:03:25.590> go<00:03:25.709> modify

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
were to understand sadly I'd go modify

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.460 
were to understand sadly I'd go modify

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
and remove and I'd have to go through

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.590 
and remove and I'd have to go through
the<00:03:28.650> whole<00:03:28.770> process<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.520> opening<00:03:30.270> up<00:03:30.360> cydia

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600
