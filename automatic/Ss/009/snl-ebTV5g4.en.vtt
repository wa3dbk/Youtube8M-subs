00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.190
 begins the time to start 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.069
 prepare for the summer and all the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.759
 world begins to search the internet in 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.030
 journals in newspapers to see how I can 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.890
 lose weight and right there is the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.199
 key never lose weight not at dawn 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.500
 then they look for the fad diets and there 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.980
 appear the entire amount of diets 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.230
 the only way to drink liquids or 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.610
 only consume a single type of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.360
 food or hyperproteic diets or 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 the dissociated diets and that's where the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.050
 organism suffers because because if 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.200
 we take for example a car if 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.829
 I just put naphtha in the car 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.379
 your naphtha tank on your tires in your 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.070
 water tank the car will not work 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.660
 because you need different fuels 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.309
 our body also needs 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.310
 different different foods 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.220
 fuels for 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:10.860
 really live healthy then everything 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.550
 what is fad diets the only thing that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.980
 produce is generally a decrease 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.800
 of muscle mass people are 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.170
 happy because she loses weight but low 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.020
 of weight breaking muscle and losing 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.200
 water staying with a larger cluster 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.930
 still of fats with which the bounce 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.920
 It's very important 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.410
 it is common that we begin to see notices of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.740
 pills that propose us a 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.880
 thin slimming or that with that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.090
 let's burn fat or that really we 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.460
 are offering the panacea there is that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.369
 be very careful many of those 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.900
 pills usually have diuretics or 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.660
 often have substances that activate the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.750
 metabolism but that in the long run they will 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.570
 bring really big problems not 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.700
 you must lose weight you have to 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.150
 deserve that is a change in culture 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 that we have to achieve, people come and 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.070
 weight loss consultation and we 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.730
 usually we say no no it's going to 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.000
 lose weight you are going to grow you are going to 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.730
 increase your muscle mass will lower your 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.250
 adipose tissue with which you do not 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.500
 only going to lose weight but 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.050
 It's also going to lose volume 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.720
 remember that half a kilo of fat is 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.269
 much larger in volume than medium 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.060
 kilogram of muscle at this time we 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.630
 we can say that there is in the country a 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.620
 very interesting possibility of being able 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.250
 achieve that ideal weight or healthy weight 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.769
 to face the summer and just the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.250
 protein contribution plan is us 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.860
 proposing a series of benefits 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.340
 really very interesting first and by 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.820
 above all things is to lower the fat 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.420
 body with a very decrease 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.510
 very fast important body fat 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.000
 with an increase in lean mass there is 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.640
 the key point on the other hand allows 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.250
 make a short easy treatment 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.190
 very good performance in terms of 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.800
 amount of kilos that one can download in 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.280
 short time and one allows a 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.040
 food reeducation where the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.459
 patient will be learning to eat 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.550
 different and going back to a plan of 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:48.390
 balanced varied feeding 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.720
 moderate in terms of quantities and 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.600
 adapted to your biological needs the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.610
 patient is seen by his doctor 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.840
 header by your nutrition graduate 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.810
 permanently that is the patient
