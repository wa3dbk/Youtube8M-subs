lock up this is the first symptom you
can<00:03:15.569> look<00:03:15.720> for<00:03:15.989> before<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.190> start<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.580> shiver

and<00:03:18.000> shake<00:03:18.239> with<00:03:18.810> hypothermia<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:20.400> when<00:03:20.550> we

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
and shake with hypothermia so when we

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.369 
and shake with hypothermia so when we

very<00:03:22.590> easily<00:03:23.900> it's<00:03:24.900> time<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.260> warm<00:03:25.470> up<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.819> we

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
very easily it's time to warm up so we

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.270 
very easily it's time to warm up so we
would<00:03:27.090> either<00:03:27.209> put<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.690> more<00:03:27.959> clothing<00:03:28.319> or

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
weather because the wool fibers

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.450

from the Sheep has a hollow shaft

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.760 
from the Sheep has a hollow shaft
so<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.150> provides<00:04:27.600> insulation<00:04:27.990> in<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.680> of

so it provides insulation in and of
itself<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.460> then<00:04:30.330> as<00:04:30.600> it's<00:04:31.220> created<00:04:32.220> into

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
itself and then as it's created into

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.360 
itself and then as it's created into
wool<00:04:32.820> fabric<00:04:33.410> there's<00:04:34.410> even<00:04:34.740> more<00:04:34.770> insulation

and even if this fabric gets wet it will

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.230 
and even if this fabric gets wet it will
still<00:04:38.640> retain<00:04:38.970> quite<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.690> bit<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:39.990> warmth<00:04:41.240> the
