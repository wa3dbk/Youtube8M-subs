00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 very good guys here we are in others 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.950
 digital languages 5 online and how are you 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.240
 watching our screens effectively 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.400
 this point of playing a race and it's 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.440
 with the pea car in this case I have 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.910
 put to the green paint and good in 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.650
 true the painting came screeching green 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.240
 but there will be that shrill they have nothing 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.949
 because this green is very expected how 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.210
 is watching but maybe we are here in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.580
 a little career of having a career 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.100
 enough because I have no minimum for you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.800
 or shit if frame is that he knows what 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.480
 I was doing before there was a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 of things this has been thumbnails for 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.630
 youtube catching screenshots of the game and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.920
 such and to do that then removed the mini 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.570
 map of the game to be able to do the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 vegetables and they and those we put life or 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.930
 We can leave everything for you but good 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.760
 I go first because it's new has happened 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.210
 well no car so perfect 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.160
 no problem 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.180
 with media theme that I really am 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.250
 love car that I do not know why 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 are worth and will happen when it is on the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.120
 Car looks pretty boy in color 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 before when when chosen such would be 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.899
 rather more good but it's worth a 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 man walking down the street in plaza no 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.350
 this is it worth the boardwalk 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.410
 of the saints 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.269
 but you can not with it is the race 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.350
 You know, guys, I'm talking, we're in 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.090
 a race like it's going pretty 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.229
 chula in which then we can crash 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.729
 at any time with any 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.770
 car crash that would come out are all 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.780
 jumping or is it a kind of career 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 in which where you jump can 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.899
 jump the other cars on the other side 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.580
 and for having put enough cases 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.500
 pretty strong so let's hope that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.700
 that does not happen to me I go first is the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.190
 first with enough comfort to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.330
 come someone careful is worth a thousand avoided 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.330
 pass in front pass on the other side 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.979
 that is the first and third interface 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.940
 finished now well and third is worth and is 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.399
 that I was wrong because I did not have 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.470
 minimap I have not realized that 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.690
 had to turn for entry so 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.100
 careful in the following the next 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.810
 back how is that curve because to achieve 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.670
 that I can roll it up again so 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.110
 watch out 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.310
 people come here for him but not 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.630
 because I want not because I'm going over and not 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.710
 because the race like this is its opening 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.810
 gave for care 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.110
 and third as I say the first is the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.110
 lilac 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.040
 we are going let's go let's go to and the s 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.640
 whatever it is and already gave as it is and we are going 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.640
 in europe 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.810
 and here 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.299
 the guys who are caught the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.780
 purple is that this one gets the traffic light 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.280
 for people worth it and the more 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.780
 line threw the semaphore motor sack 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.910
 saying how clear 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.590
 the first system that turns around 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.940
 more or less then we will pass the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.940
 first if I remember correctly, it is worth 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.099
 about to be able 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.209
 the fuck race because it's about 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.470
 to crash but good care and care 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.180
 It happens to us with another car at the same time 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.860
 and no and we've all left intact 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.739
 kids pointed to the end of that 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.799
 contracts very pro journalist people 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.090
 worth as I say this to catch the ida 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.780
 served the slipstream now careful care 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.390
 watch out 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.920
 madryn and example before reaching 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.180
 the goal in one of these or six sheets that 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.280
 brought forward a fact that I with some 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.349
 car of this that goes out there that is the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.280
 they stick and two fixed stations since the 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.269
 car in front sticks it 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.739
 continuously but with links like 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.670
 teleported is therefore worth 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.670
 above what has never been seen 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:41.700
 the worst moment is to make things more 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.430
 ethics of the world 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.340

 they have aligned the stars so that I 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.460
 pass that nor the traffic light pulls 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.660
 semaphore of eggs new uncle this one 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.820

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.570
 top of power 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.890
 masters you have to be a little 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.799

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.790
