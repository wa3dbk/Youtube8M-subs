I'm probably going to show you some

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.410 
I'm probably going to show you some
cloning<00:00:36.540> Clyde<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> trial

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
cloning Clyde and this is just the trial

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.810 
cloning Clyde and this is just the trial
version<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:40.160> hopefully<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.340> show<00:00:41.760> you

version but hopefully I can show you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.350 
version but hopefully I can show you
what<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:45.350> mean<00:00:46.350> normal<00:00:47.360> starts

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
what it's like and mean normal starts

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.500 
what it's like and mean normal starts
off<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.660> him<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> comic<00:00:49.500> book<00:00:49.680> style<00:00:50.090> at<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
off with him a comic book style at the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.030 
off with him a comic book style at the
beginning<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.940> Clyde<00:00:54.260> went<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> cloning

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
beginning and Clyde went into a cloning

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.240 
beginning and Clyde went into a cloning
facility<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:57.320> he<00:00:58.320> gets<00:00:58.470> locked<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
facility and he gets locked up and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.969 
facility and he gets locked up and
cloned<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.510> he<00:01:04.440> graphics

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
cloned and so here we are he graphics

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.040 
cloned and so here we are he graphics
were<00:01:05.130> in<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.430> cell<00:01:05.790> shading<00:01:06.330> type<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.390> cut

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
were in a cell shading type so you cut

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.730 
were in a cell shading type so you cut
this<00:01:11.210> go<00:01:12.210> ahead<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.270> cloning<00:01:15.869> Clyde<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.350> more

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
this go ahead and cloning Clyde is more

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.790 
this go ahead and cloning Clyde is more
like<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:19.490> lemming<00:01:20.490> sport<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.320> an<00:01:22.470> action

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
like a lemming sport I more of an action

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.570 
like a lemming sport I more of an action
he<00:01:22.920> type<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:26.100> gotta<00:01:26.540> get<00:01:27.540> Clyde<00:01:28.580> clone

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
he type and you gotta get Clyde clone

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.940 
he type and you gotta get Clyde clone
him<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.660> his<00:01:30.780> clones<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.470> escape<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.250> then

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
him get his clones to escape and then

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.980 
him get his clones to escape and then
hopefully<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.580> end<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.000> then

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
hopefully you get to the end and then

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.450 
hopefully you get to the end and then
save<00:01:37.770> yourself<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.890> going<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.040> trampoline

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
save yourself and going on trampoline

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.960 
save yourself and going on trampoline

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
like claw like change yourself into

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.440 
like claw like change yourself into
frogs<00:02:31.689> chickens<00:02:32.549> mutants<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:36.090> which<00:02:37.090> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
frogs chickens mutants and which is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.209 
frogs chickens mutants and which is
alright<00:02:38.379> but<00:02:40.109> it<00:02:41.109> does<00:02:41.319> add<00:02:41.349> a<00:02:41.530> little<00:02:41.799> bit<00:02:41.980> to

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
alright but it does add a little bit to

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.660 
alright but it does add a little bit to
the<00:02:42.370> genre<00:02:42.909> but<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:44.650> hard<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.250> be<00:02:45.430> done

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the genre but it's hard to be done

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.960 
the genre but it's hard to be done
before<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:48.370> got<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.669> classic<00:02:48.909> stand<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.079> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
before it's got the classic stand on the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.899 
before it's got the classic stand on the
pads<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.389> activator<00:02:53.079> which<00:02:53.470> you'll<00:02:54.310> see<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.760> a

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
pads to activator which you'll see in a

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.979 
pads to activator which you'll see in a
second<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:57.310> good<00:02:57.579> thing<00:02:57.609> is<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:58.269> can<00:02:58.450> press<00:02:58.750> Y

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
second the good thing is you can press Y

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.619 
second the good thing is you can press Y
and<00:02:59.319> then<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.739> can<00:02:59.889> switch<00:03:00.250> into<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.269> this

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
and then you can switch into like this

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.020 
and then you can switch into like this
little<00:03:01.870> beam<00:03:02.189> where<00:03:03.189> you<00:03:03.280> can<00:03:03.430> change<00:03:03.760> into

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
little beam where you can change into

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.149 
little beam where you can change into
clones<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.489> get<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:08.349> objective<00:03:08.859> is<00:03:08.950> you've

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
clones so get the objective is you've

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.330 
clones so get the objective is you've
gotta<00:03:09.340> destroy<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.439> defense<00:03:11.439> systems<00:03:12.010> which

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
gotta destroy the defense systems which

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.379 
gotta destroy the defense systems which
is<00:03:12.669> this<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.870> then<00:03:14.819> get<00:03:15.819> your<00:03:15.939> clothes<00:03:16.180> to

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
is this and then get your clothes to

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.129 
is this and then get your clothes to
escape<00:03:16.810> if<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:18.010> can<00:03:18.189> do<00:03:18.599> ensue<00:03:19.599> /<00:03:19.780> attacks

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
escape if you can do ensue / attacks

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.920 
escape if you can do ensue / attacks
like<00:03:20.409> added<00:03:20.769> then<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:25.389> moment<00:03:25.569> is<00:03:25.780> being

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
like added then the moment is being

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.740 
like added then the moment is being
recorded<00:03:26.290> off<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.979> video<00:03:27.489> camera<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:29.440> it's<00:03:30.750> not

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
recorded off a video camera so it's not

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.219 
recorded off a video camera so it's not
going<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.049> be<00:03:32.109> that<00:03:32.139> good<00:03:32.379> of<00:03:32.439> a<00:03:32.620> color<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.930> go
