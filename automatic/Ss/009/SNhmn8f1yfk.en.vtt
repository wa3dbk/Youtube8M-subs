00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.119
 of his university life because I have been

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 way in the processes how they carry the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.410
 education I also liked how 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.230
 Teachers teach the process that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.510
 so they have their gymnasium structure and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.930
 your location place that I like the most 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.300
 the university is the environment that is very 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.510
 relaxed people are very formal 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.719
 we all help each other teachers 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.910
 they also teach us a lot and 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.010
 We share enough with everyone what I 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.469
 have liked the university have been 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.049
 the spaces I really like the pensum and 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.380
 mainly the people and especially the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.680
 keys I feel better 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 in that university all the people the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.570
 the people very bacana and the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.860
 facilities and everything I like the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 university I really like the spaces 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.300
 welcome the welcome they have then 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.640
 for new students I have had 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.659
 many experiences but I have known 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.929
 well different people and tape at school 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.190
 it's something totally different was known 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.479
 20 new after they have not 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.009
 appeared checks and there is not very happy 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.740
 I vocalized more then to get 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.690
 friends with other people and look at the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.130
 point of view that they have about 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.649
 of the university and the career that are 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.280
 studying experiences that this 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.040
 week I've met new people and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.080
 I do not like the university very much if 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.460
 a change of ways and glasses of the school 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.220
 it's very different from college and I 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.899
 feels too good well first touched 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.910
 a schedule rather small on Tuesdays 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.600
 but but with is the moral for for the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.910
 career is like I'm new because nothing 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.760
 always a little nervous and everything but 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.760
 I'm going like adapting and it's very cool
