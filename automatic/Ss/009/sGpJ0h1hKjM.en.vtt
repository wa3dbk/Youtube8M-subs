I'm gonna give you a quick sound sample
it<00:00:39.780> sounds<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.500> actually<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.860> pretty

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it sounds like it's actually a pretty

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.440 
it sounds like it's actually a pretty
sweet<00:00:41.670> amplifier<00:00:42.150> it<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:43.730> went<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.880> a<00:00:44.910> Guitar

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
sweet amplifier it is I went to a Guitar

sweet amplifier it is I went to a Guitar
Center<00:00:45.480> about<00:00:46.380> a<00:00:46.410> month<00:00:46.650> ago<00:00:46.740> and<00:00:47.130> look

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
Center about a month ago and look

the<00:00:48.640> same<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.360> same<00:00:49.540> amp<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:49.960> it<00:00:49.990> was<00:00:50.140> about

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
the same the same amp and it was about

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.760 
the same the same amp and it was about
$400<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.840> recently<00:00:53.260> dropped<00:00:53.500> down<00:00:53.710> to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
$400 and it was recently dropped down to

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.980 
$400 and it was recently dropped down to
200<00:00:54.400> i'm<00:00:54.790> guessing<00:00:55.300> me<00:00:55.450> because<00:00:55.750> it<00:00:55.870> was<00:00:55.960> a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
200 i'm guessing me because it was a

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.980 
200 i'm guessing me because it was a
discontinued<00:00:56.620> model<00:00:56.920> i<00:00:57.010> don't<00:00:57.160> know<00:00:57.280> but<00:00:58.210> it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
discontinued model i don't know but it

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.350 
discontinued model i don't know but it
actually<00:00:59.320> has<00:00:59.590> a<00:00:59.620> pretty<00:00:59.980> sweet<00:01:00.190> sound<00:01:00.520> for<00:01:01.000> a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
actually has a pretty sweet sound for a

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.060 
actually has a pretty sweet sound for a
200<00:01:01.900> hour<00:01:01.960> amplifier<00:01:02.470> i<00:01:02.500> was<00:01:02.680> actually<00:01:02.950> pretty

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
200 hour amplifier i was actually pretty

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.820 
200 hour amplifier i was actually pretty
surprised<00:01:03.430> i<00:01:03.640> turned<00:01:03.940> into<00:01:04.059> my<00:01:04.210> rabin<00:01:04.600> RG<00:01:05.260> 64

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
surprised i turned into my rabin RG 64

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.429 
surprised i turned into my rabin RG 64
this<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.090> uh

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
this so uh

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
this so uh
let's<00:01:09.009> uh<00:01:09.219> let's<00:01:09.460> let's<00:01:09.909> get<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.180> sample

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:35.590 

you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.300 

yeah

yeah

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:51.370 

and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.280 

that<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.360> basic<00:03:53.710> thing<00:03:54.710> they<00:03:54.950> have<00:03:55.930> for<00:03:56.930> 200

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
that is a basic thing they have for 200

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.460 
that is a basic thing they have for 200
bucks<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.920> am<00:03:58.370> pretty<00:03:58.700> impressed<00:03:59.470> considering

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
bucks I am pretty impressed considering

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.180 
bucks I am pretty impressed considering
it<00:04:00.590> was<00:04:00.710> a<00:04:00.740> foreign<00:04:01.100> dollar<00:04:01.340> amplifier

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.110 

I<00:04:04.310> wasn't<00:04:04.820> expecting<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:06.350> kind<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.770> a<00:04:07.120> sound

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
I wasn't expecting that kind of a sound

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
I wasn't expecting that kind of a sound
out<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.510> tunable<00:04:08.810> amplifier

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
out of a tunable amplifier

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.040 
out of a tunable amplifier
the<00:04:11.530> overdrive<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.460> great<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.360> game<00:04:13.540> channel

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
the overdrive is great the game channel

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.940 
the overdrive is great the game channel
is<00:04:14.230> it's<00:04:15.010> got<00:04:15.280> it's<00:04:15.520> got<00:04:15.640> enough<00:04:16.950> distortion

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
is it's got it's got enough distortion

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.340 
is it's got it's got enough distortion
to<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.310> what<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.299> heard<00:04:19.630> on<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.930> high-gain

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
to it what you heard on the high-gain

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.570 
to it what you heard on the high-gain
channel<00:04:20.769> which<00:04:20.860> is<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.040> first<00:04:21.310> one<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.459> played

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
channel which is the first one I played

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.460 
channel which is the first one I played
that<00:04:22.060> was<00:04:22.210> about<00:04:22.450> with<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.020> gain<00:04:23.200> about

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
that was about with the gain about

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.190 
that was about with the gain about
halfway<00:04:23.680> up<00:04:24.100> and<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:25.300> still<00:04:25.540> has<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:25.960> much

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
halfway up and it still has that much

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.280 
halfway up and it still has that much
crunch<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.360> of<00:04:28.360> course<00:04:28.630> that's<00:04:28.900> that's

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
crunch in it so of course that's that's

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.960 
crunch in it so of course that's that's
plenty<00:04:29.770> of<00:04:29.860> distortion<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.400> this<00:04:30.520> amplifier

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
plenty of distortion on this amplifier

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.870 
plenty of distortion on this amplifier
so<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.170> course<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.770> hate<00:04:32.980> works<00:04:33.490> all<00:04:33.730> with

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
so and of course it hate works all with

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.310 
so and of course it hate works all with
different<00:04:34.210> ways<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.480> can<00:04:34.630> do<00:04:34.720> classic<00:04:35.140> rock

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
different ways you can do classic rock

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.920 
different ways you can do classic rock
heavy<00:04:35.620> metal<00:04:35.770> whatever<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.430> prefer<00:04:36.930> it

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
heavy metal whatever you prefer it

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.480 
heavy metal whatever you prefer it
sounds<00:04:38.230> really<00:04:38.350> good<00:04:38.590> with<00:04:38.800> drop<00:04:39.040> tunings

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
sounds really good with drop tunings

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.750 
sounds really good with drop tunings
like<00:04:39.910> drop<00:04:40.180> D<00:04:40.390> drop<00:04:40.900> C<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.470> kind<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.680> thing<00:04:41.920> it

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
like drop D drop C that kind of thing it

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.330 

it<00:04:58.360> also<00:04:58.540> it<00:04:58.960> looks<00:04:59.170> great<00:04:59.800> and

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.850 

that's<00:05:02.820> pretty<00:05:03.000> much<00:05:03.150> did<00:05:03.389> you<00:05:03.630> know<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:04.470> think

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
that's pretty much did you know I think

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.100 
that's pretty much did you know I think
it's<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.280> pretty<00:05:05.760> good<00:05:05.850> amp<00:05:06.180> considering<00:05:07.050> I

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
it's a pretty good amp considering I

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.250 
it's a pretty good amp considering I
wasn't<00:05:07.470> really<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.740> fan<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.040> crate<00:05:09.020> but<00:05:10.020> I

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
wasn't really a fan of crate but I

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.120 
wasn't really a fan of crate but I
actually<00:05:10.590> kind<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:11.760> turned<00:05:12.000> out<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:13.130> crate

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
actually kind of turned out to a crate

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.850 
actually kind of turned out to a crate
man<00:05:14.340> so

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
man so

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.969 
man so
that<00:05:17.370> was<00:05:17.460> kind<00:05:17.669> of<00:05:17.699> stupid<00:05:17.879> but<00:05:18.150> anyways<00:05:18.979> yeah

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
that was kind of stupid but anyways yeah

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.399 
that was kind of stupid but anyways yeah
overall<00:05:20.729> I<00:05:20.759> would<00:05:20.969> give<00:05:21.060> this<00:05:21.389> amp<00:05:21.629> for<00:05:22.020> what<00:05:22.379> I

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
overall I would give this amp for what I

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.499 
overall I would give this amp for what I
paid<00:05:22.680> for<00:05:23.039> it<00:05:23.069> I'd<00:05:23.699> give<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.150> maybe<00:05:24.330> like

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
paid for it I'd give it maybe like

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.230 
paid for it I'd give it maybe like
between<00:05:24.990> one<00:05:25.289> one<00:05:26.219> in<00:05:26.370> ten<00:05:26.610> I'll<00:05:26.759> give<00:05:26.789> about<00:05:27.210> a

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
between one one in ten I'll give about a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.719 
between one one in ten I'll give about a
nine<00:05:27.539> because<00:05:28.530> there<00:05:28.770> is<00:05:28.889> some<00:05:29.129> problems<00:05:29.580> with

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
nine because there is some problems with

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.600 
nine because there is some problems with
it

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
it

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.600 
it
has<00:05:31.150> a<00:05:31.180> lot<00:05:31.479> of<00:05:31.509> feedback<00:05:32.400> depending<00:05:33.400> on<00:05:33.490> how

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
has a lot of feedback depending on how

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.790 
has a lot of feedback depending on how
close<00:05:33.819> you<00:05:34.090> actually<00:05:34.210> amplifier<00:05:34.780> how<00:05:35.020> loud<00:05:35.560> it

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
close you actually amplifier how loud it

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.879 
close you actually amplifier how loud it
is<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:38.020> does<00:05:38.289> it<00:05:38.400> doesn't<00:05:39.400> have<00:05:39.789> much<00:05:40.150> of<00:05:40.210> a<00:05:40.889> of

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
is it does it doesn't have much of a of

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.760 
is it does it doesn't have much of a of
a<00:05:42.099> buzz<00:05:42.419> when<00:05:43.419> like<00:05:43.900> with<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.199> distortion

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
a buzz when like with the distortion

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.409 
a buzz when like with the distortion
like<00:05:45.099> something<00:05:45.490> fun<00:05:45.699> to<00:05:45.819> do<00:05:45.909> it<00:05:46.030> still<00:05:46.240> has

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
like something fun to do it still has

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.209 
like something fun to do it still has
that<00:05:46.719> but<00:05:47.469> that's<00:05:47.650> something<00:05:47.919> that<00:05:47.949> you<00:05:48.039> could

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
that but that's something that you could

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:49.890 
that but that's something that you could
get<00:05:48.400> fix<00:05:48.819> easily<00:05:49.180> if<00:05:49.300> you<00:05:49.360> had<00:05:49.479> like<00:05:49.569> a<00:05:49.629> noise

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
get fix easily if you had like a noise

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.980 
get fix easily if you had like a noise
Gator<00:05:50.259> song<00:05:50.699> but<00:05:51.699> if<00:05:51.819> not<00:05:52.000> it's<00:05:52.240> it's<00:05:52.449> not<00:05:52.659> it's

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
Gator song but if not it's it's not it's

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.989 
Gator song but if not it's it's not it's
manageable

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:56.999 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:58.969 

and<00:05:57.509> it's<00:05:58.049> pretty<00:05:58.199> it's<00:05:58.559> a<00:05:58.589> pretty<00:05:58.619> basic

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
and it's pretty it's a pretty basic

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.479 
and it's pretty it's a pretty basic
amplifier<00:05:59.539> it's<00:06:00.539> not<00:06:00.749> like<00:06:00.899> line<00:06:01.709> six<00:06:02.129> butter

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:02.489 
amplifier it's not like line six butter

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:04.669 
amplifier it's not like line six butter
to<00:06:02.729> where<00:06:03.149> there's<00:06:03.509> so<00:06:03.749> many<00:06:03.809> knobs<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.349> can't

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:04.679 
to where there's so many knobs you can't

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:06.079 
to where there's so many knobs you can't
figure<00:06:04.829> out<00:06:04.949> what<00:06:05.159> what's<00:06:05.519> what<00:06:05.759> it's<00:06:05.909> just

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 
figure out what what's what it's just

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.289 
figure out what what's what it's just
really<00:06:06.239> simple<00:06:06.689> it's<00:06:07.399> it's<00:06:08.399> down<00:06:08.999> to<00:06:09.179> the

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:09.299 
really simple it's it's down to the

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:11.460 
really simple it's it's down to the
point

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
point

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.510 
point
pretty<00:06:12.470> much<00:06:12.590> a<00:06:12.830> kick-ass<00:06:13.220> amfAR

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.120 

that's<00:06:17.030> pretty<00:06:17.479> much<00:06:17.690> it<00:06:17.930> for<00:06:18.080> me<00:06:18.169> I've

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
that's pretty much it for me I've

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.560 
that's pretty much it for me I've
enjoyed<00:06:19.580> it

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
enjoyed it

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.710 
enjoyed it
and<00:06:20.720> I<00:06:21.020> will<00:06:21.170> surely<00:06:21.470> buy<00:06:21.950> another<00:06:22.880> amplifier

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
and I will surely buy another amplifier

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.780 
and I will surely buy another amplifier
from<00:06:23.810> Crate<00:06:24.140> if<00:06:24.380> I<00:06:24.500> get<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.830> opportunity<00:06:25.400> to

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.210 

and<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.750> would<00:06:29.170> actually<00:06:29.350> recommend<00:06:29.650> this<00:06:30.100> to

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
and I would actually recommend this to

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.980 
and I would actually recommend this to
anybody<00:06:30.430> who's<00:06:30.820> on<00:06:30.970> a<00:06:31.030> budget<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.540> can<00:06:31.780> find

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
anybody who's on a budget and can find

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.090 
anybody who's on a budget and can find
these<00:06:32.080> amplifiers<00:06:32.410> considering<00:06:33.040> they

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
these amplifiers considering they

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.400 
these amplifiers considering they
discontinued<00:06:33.700> it<00:06:33.850> might<00:06:34.030> be<00:06:34.180> impossible<00:06:35.140> to

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
discontinued it might be impossible to

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.040 
discontinued it might be impossible to
find<00:06:35.500> them<00:06:35.860> here<00:06:36.010> pretty<00:06:36.190> soon<00:06:36.280> but<00:06:36.550> for<00:06:37.180> what

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
find them here pretty soon but for what

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.200 
find them here pretty soon but for what
I<00:06:38.080> paid<00:06:38.350> for<00:06:38.650> it<00:06:38.680> I'm<00:06:38.830> happy<00:06:39.010> if<00:06:39.580> you<00:06:39.790> can<00:06:39.940> find

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
I paid for it I'm happy if you can find

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.210 
I paid for it I'm happy if you can find
one<00:06:40.420> I<00:06:40.630> suggest<00:06:41.170> you<00:06:41.530> try<00:06:41.770> it<00:06:41.800> and<00:06:42.070> if<00:06:42.130> you

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
one I suggest you try it and if you

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.980 
one I suggest you try it and if you
don't<00:06:42.310> like<00:06:42.520> it<00:06:42.760> go<00:06:43.270> elsewhere<00:06:43.690> if<00:06:43.780> you<00:06:43.870> do

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
don't like it go elsewhere if you do

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.240 
don't like it go elsewhere if you do
like<00:06:44.170> it<00:06:44.350> I<00:06:44.440> suggest<00:06:44.620> you<00:06:44.920> buy<00:06:45.070> it<00:06:45.130> because

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
like it I suggest you buy it because

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.430 
like it I suggest you buy it because
it's<00:06:45.430> one<00:06:46.330> of<00:06:46.420> the<00:06:46.510> best<00:06:46.690> amplifiers<00:06:47.200> I've

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
it's one of the best amplifiers I've

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.870 
it's one of the best amplifiers I've
I've<00:06:47.950> used<00:06:48.250> and<00:06:48.490> it's<00:06:49.450> it<00:06:49.900> it<00:06:50.710> throws<00:06:51.070> my<00:06:51.310> line6

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
I've used and it's it it throws my line6

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.060 
I've used and it's it it throws my line6
on<00:06:52.090> the<00:06:52.180> ground<00:06:52.390> and<00:06:52.720> stomps<00:06:53.440> all<00:06:53.560> over<00:06:53.860> it

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 
on the ground and stomps all over it
