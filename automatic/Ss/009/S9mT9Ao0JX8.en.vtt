bringing<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.030> new<00:00:03.810> video<00:00:04.080> well<00:00:04.859> it's<00:00:05.100> not

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
bringing you a new video well it's not

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.039 
bringing you a new video well it's not
old<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.609> it<00:00:05.759> well<00:00:06.210> actually<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:06.660> probably<00:00:06.720> is

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
old is it well actually it probably is

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.500 
old is it well actually it probably is
but<00:00:07.710> it's<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.160> tutorial<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.970> how<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.179> make<00:00:09.330> an

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
but it's a tutorial on how to make an

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.990 
but it's a tutorial on how to make an
xor<00:00:10.110> gate<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.679> think<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.190> called<00:00:11.309> XOR<00:00:11.759> gate

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
xor gate I think it's called XOR gate

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.770 
xor gate I think it's called XOR gate
I'm<00:00:12.780> not<00:00:12.929> sure<00:00:13.080> that's<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.620> person<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.780> are

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
I'm not sure that's what person as are

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.070 
I'm not sure that's what person as are
in<00:00:16.199> Minecraft<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.460> first<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.060> all<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.840> is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
in Minecraft so first of all this is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.450 
in Minecraft so first of all this is
what<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.560> will<00:00:19.650> look<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.160> finished

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
what it will look like the finished

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.490 
what it will look like the finished
product<00:00:20.760> then<00:00:21.060> two<00:00:21.180> then<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.020> then<00:00:22.320> I'll<00:00:22.470> show

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
product then two then and then I'll show

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.590 
product then two then and then I'll show
you<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.830> how<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> integrate<00:00:23.939> into<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
you what how to integrate into and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900 
you what how to integrate into and
integrate<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.560> into<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> house<00:00:26.670> or

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
integrate it into you like a house or

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
integrate it into you like a house or
something<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> first<00:00:28.590> off<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> want<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.039> get

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
yourself some building blocks and sounds

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.190 
yourself some building blocks and sounds
so<00:00:32.340> kiddish<00:00:33.380> building<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:35.960> put<00:00:36.960> some

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
so kiddish building right put some

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.610 
so kiddish building right put some
redstone<00:00:37.410> torches<00:00:37.770> down<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.590> do<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
redstone torches down like that do that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.910 
redstone torches down like that do that
and<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.460> should<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.610> some<00:00:41.820> light<00:00:42.000> no<00:00:42.450> no<00:00:43.020> not

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and you should have some light no no not

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
and you should have some light no no not
something<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.840> do<00:00:45.840> some<00:00:45.989> reading

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
something like that do some reading

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.150 
something like that do some reading
coming<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.559> each<00:00:47.340> side<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.950> know<00:00:49.950> not

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
coming out each side so we know not

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.340 
coming out each side so we know not
there<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:51.780> put<00:00:51.989> lever<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.739> each<00:00:52.890> side

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
there and then put lever on each side

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.439 
there and then put lever on each side
and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.860> come<00:00:56.610> back<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.879> rare<00:00:57.059> put<00:00:57.329> some

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
rest in there should be activated if

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.360 
rest in there should be activated if
it's<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.710> don't<00:01:01.710> know<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.129> you've

then get your racing torches put them
down<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:09.360> them<00:01:09.510> down<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:11.280> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
down put them down and then your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
down put them down and then your
redstone<00:01:12.090> coming<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:14.189> i'm<00:01:14.460> using

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
redstone coming out and then i'm using

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.510 
redstone coming out and then i'm using
an<00:01:14.820> iron<00:01:14.909> door<00:01:16.520> for<00:01:17.930> example<00:01:18.930> purposes<00:01:19.280> we<00:01:20.280> hit

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
an iron door for example purposes we hit

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.420 
an iron door for example purposes we hit
and<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> should<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.780> bein<00:01:21.960> open<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.130> then

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and it should go for bein open and then

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.710 
and it should go for bein open and then
from<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.759> side<00:01:23.939> should<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.210> had<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> close<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
from this side should we had to close it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.560 
from this side should we had to close it
and<00:01:24.869> i'll<00:01:25.680> stay<00:01:25.830> open<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> clips<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.119> switch<00:01:27.330> but

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and i'll stay open it clips a switch but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.440 
and i'll stay open it clips a switch but
what's<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> difference<00:01:28.110> inside<00:01:28.530> yes<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:29.850> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
what's the difference inside yes I do so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.999 
what's the difference inside yes I do so
that's<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.340> hole<00:01:33.829> that's<00:01:34.829> why

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that's that's it a hole that's why

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.640 
that's that's it a hole that's why
should<00:01:35.159> look<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.340> ish<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.470> i'm<00:01:37.619> just

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
should look like ish so now i'm just

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.780 
should look like ish so now i'm just
going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> show<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.070> how<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.390> build<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
going to show you how to build it into a

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.010 
going to show you how to build it into a
house<00:01:41.790> type<00:01:42.360> style<00:01:43.229> type<00:01:43.649> thing<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.520> is
