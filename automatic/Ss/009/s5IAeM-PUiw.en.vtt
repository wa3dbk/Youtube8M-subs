00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.059
 the likoud s 2 is a fable is a big 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.980
 t &amp; e tablet smartphone for 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.800
 French 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.380
 it's a smartphone with a screen of 6 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.869
 inches full HD 1080p 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.060
 so the best of the definition on a 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.590
 screen of this size there as one can 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.840
 see him a lot of details of 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.310
 definition on on the screen on the front 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.220
 always if we continue we obviously 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.879
 the acer brand overhung from this smiling 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.420
 curve so red smile to remind 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.909
 the spirit of the brand with a camera 2 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.320
 wide-angle megapixels if I can 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.760
 to show you the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.660
 opportunities that this offers we get 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.630
 way 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 quite easily enough we're also going 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.200
 find the sensitive keys on the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.100
 bottom of the terminal when we pass on the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.110
 slice we find two speakers and 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.479
 its two speakers are amplified 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.770
 by dolby digital technology more 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.869
 which is the new evolution of the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.280
 dolby software that is accompanied 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.890
 also a dedicated application 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.020
 allowing access to your equalizer your 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.100
 preferred settings and settings 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.720
 predefined on the rear panel there is a 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.460
 plaque that recalls he goes presence of the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.320
 dolby digital plus acer brand 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.380
 also the big sensor of 13 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.790
 megapixels that can deliver the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.850
 4k videos 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.180
 four cases that means ultra hd ultra 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.110
 hd 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.450
 these four times 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.500
 the full hd that means we get 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.350
 four times more details 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.020
 an image four times larger and one 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.560
 find this sensor surrounded by four 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.960
 led for a powerful and diffuse flash 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.930
 when one is in a distant subject or 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.620
 in a close subject in macro mode on 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.800
 see here one of the four microphones that 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.450
 were also two bottom terminal 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.350
 and so his four pickups are used to 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.340
 have in different modes 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.320
 of use a very clear sound with 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.959
 active noise cancellation what wants 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.720
 say active noise cancellation and who 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.620
 so lets have a subpoena of 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.550
 ambient noise 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.500
 because we are in an environment 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.140
 noisy they also allow a 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.060
 clearer capture of sound especially in 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.630
 your video when we're in the mode of 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.090
 concert video jack for example on the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.010
 slice finally opposed we find the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.160
 volume buttons 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.959
 the nano sim slot ex the port 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.090
 microsd extension very important 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.910
 when you want to remove save from the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.160
 video in 4k obviously that supports 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.989
 up to 128 giga with standard sd xc 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.080
 and finally the carrying charges why the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.030
 data transfer and loose and the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.030
 charge as I say usb 2 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.420
 in terms of screens I make you a 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.990
 small demonstration of the video in full 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.990
 hd on the screen 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.850
 in the camera we bring for example 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.020
 an innovation acer with the possibility 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.910
 to do an autofocus 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.380
 with automatic exposure but 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.420
 also to move his point 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.470
 of exposure to be able to all 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.640
 simply choose the level 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.470
 of exhibition that one wants to give to one's 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.960
 photo so more or less light this 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.860
 which allows to have a picture with 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.210
 constant exposure 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.720
 at the video level we find 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.420
 obviously the 4k the famous ultra 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.980
 hd we settle here very simply and we 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.210
 films at a speed of 24 frames per 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.510
 second what gives you a movement 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.510
 fluid 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.780
 in all situations 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.130
 the acia likoud s ii is a smartphone 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.510
 integrating the latest developed chip 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:01.250
 by qualcomm snapdragon 800 with a 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.709
 frequency of 2.2 gigahertz parker which 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.209
 gives a great fluidity of interface 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.870
 accompanied by 2 gigas of ram and a 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.680
 internal memory of 16 gig of rome 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.630
 obviously this memory is expandable 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.180
 thanks to the microsd support we 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.900
 the acer liquid s 2 is available in two 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.750
 colors at the end of October at 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.750
