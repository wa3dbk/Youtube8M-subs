00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
whatever you want to call it but I know

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.450 
whatever you want to call it but I know
this<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.900> kind<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.139> an<00:00:16.260> old<00:00:16.470> set<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.220> been

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
this is kind of an old set and it's been

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.290 
this is kind of an old set and it's been
out<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.880> while<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.770> since<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.100> had<00:00:21.029> it

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
out for a while but since I just had it

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
out for a while but since I just had it
and<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.570> didn't<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> review<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.619> thought

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and I didn't do a review on that thought

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.590 
and I didn't do a review on that thought
maybe<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.550> would<00:00:23.730> be<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> good<00:00:24.029> time<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
maybe this would be a good time to do it

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.980

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
then it's turning this around these are

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.659 
then it's turning this around these are
each<00:04:48.840> like<00:04:49.139> individual<00:04:49.800> big<00:04:49.979> pieces<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.639> have

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
each like individual big pieces you have

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.899 
each like individual big pieces you have
to<00:04:50.880> put<00:04:51.060> together<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.570> set<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:53.370> then<00:04:53.789> meet

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
pretty heavy and got all the engines

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.149 
pretty heavy and got all the engines
here<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:01.020> only<00:05:01.199> problem<00:05:01.680> I<00:05:01.770> had<00:05:01.979> with

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
here and the only problem I had with

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.600 
here and the only problem I had with
this<00:05:02.340> set<00:05:02.669> was<00:05:03.030> Lego<00:05:03.930> didn't<00:05:04.289> send<00:05:04.530> me<00:05:04.740> two<00:05:05.430> of

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
this set was Lego didn't send me two of

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.080 
this set was Lego didn't send me two of
these<00:05:05.990> yellow<00:05:06.990> pieces<00:05:07.289> here<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:07.949> I<00:05:08.580> had<00:05:08.909> to

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
these yellow pieces here so I had to

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.300 
these yellow pieces here so I had to
wait<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.360> while<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.930> finish<00:05:10.229> building<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.860> and

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
wait a while to finish building it and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.890 
wait a while to finish building it and
if<00:05:11.760> they<00:05:11.970> would<00:05:12.120> have<00:05:12.180> gave<00:05:12.479> me<00:05:12.659> all<00:05:12.780> the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
if they would have gave me all the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.480 
if they would have gave me all the
pieces<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.320> probably<00:05:13.740> would<00:05:14.039> have<00:05:14.070> done<00:05:14.190> a

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
pieces I probably would have done a

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.409 
pieces I probably would have done a
review<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.360> like<00:05:15.539> right<00:05:15.930> away<00:05:16.970> but<00:05:17.970> yeah<00:05:18.150> so
