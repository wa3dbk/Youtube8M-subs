00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
fret in this case it's a third fret and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.210 
fret in this case it's a third fret and
then<00:01:14.939> roll<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.420> finger<00:01:15.810> onto<00:01:16.740> its<00:01:16.890> side

then roll your finger onto its side

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.520 
then roll your finger onto its side

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.530 
this you actually want most of the
pressure<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.220> be<00:02:01.400> on<00:02:01.550> these<00:02:01.700> higher<00:02:02.030> strings

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
pressure to be on these higher strings

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.130 
pressure to be on these higher strings
the<00:02:02.720> first<00:02:02.930> couple<00:02:03.230> strings<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:05.630> tip<00:02:06.020> of

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
the first couple strings and the tip of

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.109 
the first couple strings and the tip of
your<00:02:06.170> finger<00:02:06.440> just<00:02:06.560> kind<00:02:06.800> of<00:02:06.890> comes<00:02:07.670> over<00:02:07.790> here

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
your finger just kind of comes over here

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.950 
your finger just kind of comes over here
and<00:02:08.210> just<00:02:08.330> kind<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.570> grabs<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.200> low<00:02:09.350> string<00:02:10.960> so

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
and just kind of grabs the low string so

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.260 
and just kind of grabs the low string so
when<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.230> are<00:02:12.440> approaching<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.130> bar<00:02:13.340> have

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
when you are approaching the bar have

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.650 
when you are approaching the bar have
most<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.780> pressure<00:02:15.020> be<00:02:16.120> on<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.240> first<00:02:17.480> two

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
most of the pressure be on the first two

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.360 
most of the pressure be on the first two
strings<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:21.050> you'll<00:02:21.530> get<00:02:21.680> all<00:02:21.770> your<00:02:21.920> notes<00:02:22.130> to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
strings and you'll get all your notes to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.970 
strings and you'll get all your notes to
ring<00:02:22.520> out<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:24.290> can<00:02:24.440> use<00:02:24.470> these<00:02:24.740> same

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
ring out and you can use these same

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.250 
ring out and you can use these same
techniques<00:02:26.200> with<00:02:27.200> jazz<00:02:27.530> chords<00:02:28.870> for<00:02:29.870> instance

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
techniques with jazz chords for instance

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.550 
techniques with jazz chords for instance
so<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.709> an<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.980> minor<00:02:31.250> seven<00:02:31.700> chords<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.560> lot

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
so this is an a minor seven chords a lot

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.750 
so this is an a minor seven chords a lot
of<00:02:33.680> people<00:02:33.980> learn<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.370> when<00:02:34.640> they're

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
of people learn this when they're

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.690 
of people learn this when they're
starting<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.209> learn<00:02:35.390> jazz<00:02:35.690> guitar

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
starting to learn jazz guitar

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.190 
starting to learn jazz guitar
now<00:02:37.700> we're<00:02:37.850> not<00:02:37.940> playing<00:02:38.270> really<00:02:38.989> on<00:02:39.110> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
now we're not playing really on the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.170 
now we're not playing really on the
fingertips<00:02:39.739> of<00:02:40.340> any<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.700> our<00:02:40.790> fingers<00:02:41.150> for

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
fingertips of any of our fingers for

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.300 
fingertips of any of our fingers for
this<00:02:41.450> chord<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.170> second<00:02:42.590> finger<00:02:42.800> I'm

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
this chord the second finger I'm

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.250 
this chord the second finger I'm
actually<00:02:43.550> playing<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.239> little<00:02:44.810> bit<00:02:45.020> flat

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
actually playing a little bit flat

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.440 
actually playing a little bit flat
finger<00:02:45.680> where<00:02:46.580> most<00:02:46.760> beginning<00:02:47.090> students

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
finger where most beginning students

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.030 
finger where most beginning students
want<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.660> play<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.930> first<00:02:48.110> place<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.980> do

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
want to play in the first place but I do

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.150 
want to play in the first place but I do
that<00:02:49.280> for<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.489> reason<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.950> the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
that for a reason so that I get the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.300 
that for a reason so that I get the
sixth<00:02:52.670> string<00:02:52.880> fifth<00:02:53.180> fret<00:02:53.269> note<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.310> the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
learned to do this and then I was like

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.539 
learned to do this and then I was like
oh<00:03:22.310> wow<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.519> can<00:03:22.730> use<00:03:22.820> that<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.120> guitar<00:03:23.420> so

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
oh wow I can use that on the guitar so

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.130 
oh wow I can use that on the guitar so
we've<00:03:25.549> got<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.670> fifth<00:03:25.910> fret<00:03:26.120> second<00:03:26.840> string<00:03:26.870> a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
we've got a fifth fret second string a

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.960 
we've got a fifth fret second string a
little<00:03:27.230> bit<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.590> lazy<00:03:27.769> finger<00:03:28.190> then<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
little bit of a lazy finger then the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.770 
little bit of a lazy finger then the
third<00:03:29.299> finger<00:03:29.920> kind<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.010> breaks<00:03:31.190> backwards

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.680 

and<00:03:35.260> you're<00:03:35.380> muting<00:03:35.710> this<00:03:36.070> string<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.970> the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690
