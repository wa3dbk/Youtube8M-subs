00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
actually using in this short average of

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.430 
actually using in this short average of
five<00:00:25.130> here<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:26.000> long<00:00:26.270> v2<00:00:26.630> that<00:00:26.840> i<00:00:26.870> set<00:00:27.170> up<00:00:27.290> for

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440

five here so long v2 that i set up for
you<00:00:27.530> guys<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:28.120> honestly<00:00:29.120> i<00:00:29.180> think<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:29.480> is<00:00:29.660> the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
you guys so honestly i think this is the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.260 
you guys so honestly i think this is the
best<00:00:29.870> along<00:00:30.290> v2<00:00:30.680> that<00:00:30.980> i<00:00:31.010> have<00:00:31.310> never<00:00:31.580> set<00:00:32.090> up

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
best along v2 that i have never set up

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.380 
best along v2 that i have never set up
it's<00:00:32.560> super<00:00:33.560> quick<00:00:33.860> now<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.310> might<00:00:34.460> be<00:00:34.640> just<00:00:34.880> a

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
it's super quick now it might be just a

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.960 
it's super quick now it might be just a
tiny<00:00:35.750> tiny<00:00:35.960> bit<00:00:36.620> gummy<00:00:36.920> after<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:37.490> sets<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:37.910> the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
tiny tiny bit gummy after it sets in the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
middle for a couple days but that's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.810 
middle for a couple days but that's
because<00:00:39.860> there's<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:40.280> little<00:00:40.460> bit<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.640> weight

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
because there's a little bit of weight
