 well know how to close that smell of a new ship came to the right place in the hand 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:18.000

 only one that will not be in any other cruise company. 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.849
 This is the well being and the club that you take on board but you have to at the end of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.760
 March you are free to do what you want until the moment when several 

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:39.289

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.820

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.660
 follow them try other booths with balcony 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.250
 and to which we arrived at the internal booths all this with the exclusive stations to 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.790
 mind 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.930
 one of the best parts of freestyle cruising is the non-dinner schedule 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.210
 Be done 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.980
 ncl you're there to have meals when the politician who 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.290
 Wish 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.890
 so when strangers are ringing the bell for a meal you 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.200
 you are free to finish your booklet to console the lucky round or 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 simply ask for another sold 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000
 all the places' in the unfortunate case there and sophisticated 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.619
 but if you want to be very well 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.190
 feel at ease 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.490
 It is clear that the great and modern ships of the NCL are a spectacle called 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.680
 So 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.520
 or if we should start 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.600
 are wires talk about the ship and how 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.990
