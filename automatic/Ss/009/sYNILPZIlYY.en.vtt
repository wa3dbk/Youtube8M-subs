00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.959
 watching the program similar to the previous 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.999
 it was built a stack know my system xix in lies two tab 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.809
 more are the hill for iron 2003 more than robberies more 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.089
 if the normal reduction potentials are -0 14 volts and +0 79 and 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:36.550
 dissident bolton suspended mind 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.200
 if he processed challenges that take place in the final and explains that I feel bad 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.340
 for how I captured with comma 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 and qualcomm 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 let's go back remember 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.040
 it is always convenient to remember everything was silenced 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.960
 ensler variation of free energy of innovative ideas - n 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.840
 efe in your brain 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.840
 if it's a priority for the stack 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.560
 spontaneous spontaneous reaction 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.330
 implies that in the workshop 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.590
 the jec has to be 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.050
 negative 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.520
 which it involves 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.510
 is a zero of the activity has to be possible 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.890
 so that the amb reaction will be spontaneous 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.340
 the electromotive force of the battery has to be positive 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.340
 for any reaction gifts 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 for any reaction of euros to 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.530
 so you see aralar 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.240
 d 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.110
 more just that it's 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.070
 If it does not exist, if in this reaction, it is not positive 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.850
 reaction march from left to right to send march so much better differs the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.490
 right in the direction of the process symbol the higher the more 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.369
 positive 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.989
 the potential 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.989
 of this modest reaction in my lap 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.139
 let's see then we have practically the same as before 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.759
 We have two 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.219
 efe 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.340
 two contention potential standard reduction we have to 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.799
 he is a zero 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.019
 l is a third 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.509
 this year the most 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.069
 this year 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.969
 is equal to avn - 0 14 volts 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.389
 estes 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.869
 I have about six months of more recent reductions in my revolution 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.789
 it would be that this year or two more added 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.989
 madrid 11 electrons to give this year according to iu 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.729
 would have a 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.259
 a potential of semifinal 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:06.179
 a difference of two and a potential relative to the liters side of hydrogen 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.439
 letter w to the reference electron 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.269
 that would be the same - in a statement we know 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.379
 the other potential 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.619
 would be 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:22.659
 percent and steal sum 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.539
 when human rights have arrived and in some moments 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:33.059
 equal to 100 +0 77 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.209
 in the museum malaria 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.949
 we would have to in relations with the continent 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.900
 by the way to the arch even more the environment 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.869
 narrated efe 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.039
 percent when adding 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.039
 jacobo this is a zero what is 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.739
 0 77 multi-device 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.079
 well I want to combine these posts 12 thousand cells 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.039
 to give me a lime 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:17.069
 if I want to combine these two ashtrays to give me a lime 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.259
 and both are reductions 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.490
 I'll have to turn over one of them to have some illusion 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.529
 reduction 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.529
 if I turn it down the first 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.840
 if I turn around the first semi-reaction the potential is the one that lula 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.840
 it would be positive the sum would be positive 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.509
 I flipped it the second would have a potential to be very negative reluctant 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.270
 both would be negative when added 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.360
 read would give me negative 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.389
 then what I have to do evidently he 3 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:57.840
 so that the process is spontaneous 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.840
 turn around this lady reaction 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.240
 pavle the turn 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.479
 When turning it over, vary the sign 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.710
 the potential to be a lie 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.979
 then we would have that the iron remains as it is 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.149
 they remain us as they are the ones that he had to take him 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.689
 the inm 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.559
 a duty 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:27.900
 of savings 2 wise men 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.339
 some are from the environment 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:32.740
 for luzardo 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.089
 I have two more bow 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:40.680
 the left united in his brain and guardiola mason ohio ee 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.289
 I want to flip the other one that was weird 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.580
 the other one was strange 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.370
 Aralar solidum are excited and a strange Monaco 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.490
 one molar for electrons in addition 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.020
 since we would have a hill that would have to change the sign 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.219
 let's see what I do not remember how it was 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.159
 was 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:11.330
 0 14 everything change plus 0 14 and 0 77 like this +0 14 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:14.339
 0 77 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:23.329
 this would be even more were 14 volts and this would be 0 77 volts also more 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.460
 so 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.529
 this would be 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.029
 this would be a reaction 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.539
 between the electrons the hand we already know that it is more in these years reaction a 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.159
 Perdomo server 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.159
 about one hundred thousand 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:44.129
 the reduction reaction 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:46.860
 this series about 6 thousand 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.699
 reaction 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.610
 of echoes 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.370
 os boats followed ocampo - ignacio negativo and japan have reduced
