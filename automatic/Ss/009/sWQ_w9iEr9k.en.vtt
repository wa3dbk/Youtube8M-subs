00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
it is called a DRAM safe inject site and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.120 
it is called a DRAM safe inject site and
mixer<00:00:15.230> that<00:00:16.230> up<00:00:16.379> closer<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.100> a

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
mixer that up closer you can have a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.380 
mixer that up closer you can have a
better<00:00:17.310> look<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.730> it

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
better look at it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
to apply liquid fertilizer in my case is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.860 
to apply liquid fertilizer in my case is
going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:30.949> compost<00:00:31.949> tea<00:00:32.719> through<00:00:33.719> your

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
needing that I've got a similar nozzle

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.940 
needing that I've got a similar nozzle
already<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:48.989> my<00:00:49.170> hose<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
already on my hose you don't want to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.970 
already on my hose you don't want to
restrict<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.760> water<00:00:50.940> flow<00:00:51.469> if<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.590> restrict

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
restrict the water flow if you restrict

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.040 
restrict the water flow if you restrict
the<00:00:53.160> water<00:00:53.340> flow<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.420> gonna<00:00:54.539> work<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the water flow it's not gonna work so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.910 
the water flow it's not gonna work so
well<00:00:55.260> according<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> directions<00:00:56.399> anyways

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
well according to the directions anyways

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.279 
well according to the directions anyways
it<00:00:58.920> says<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> needs<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.640> oh<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.840> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it says it needs about oh what is that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
it says it needs about oh what is that
I<00:01:01.320> mean<00:01:01.530> look<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:01.859> notes<00:01:02.359> you<00:01:03.359> need<00:01:03.510> about

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
I mean look at my notes you need about

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.630 
I mean look at my notes you need about
five<00:01:04.019> gallon<00:01:04.409> per<00:01:04.589> minute<00:01:04.619> water<00:01:05.129> flow<00:01:05.460> for

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
five gallon per minute water flow for

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.260 
five gallon per minute water flow for
this<00:01:05.790> thing<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> work<00:01:06.150> effectively<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this thing to work effectively so this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.660 
this thing to work effectively so this
is<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> working<00:01:09.960> part

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.300 

have<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.240> closer<00:01:13.660> look<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.320> got<00:01:14.500> a<00:01:14.530> plastic

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
have a closer look you got a plastic

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.500 
have a closer look you got a plastic
tube<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.840> on<00:01:17.110> one<00:01:17.290> end<00:01:17.500> there<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.510> don't

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
tube and on one end there is I don't

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.000 
tube and on one end there is I don't
know<00:01:19.720> how<00:01:19.900> well<00:01:20.050> you<00:01:20.080> can<00:01:20.230> see<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:20.860> is<00:01:20.920> a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
know how well you can see that it is a

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.780 
know how well you can see that it is a
spring<00:01:21.580> filter<00:01:22.000> keeps<00:01:23.340> big<00:01:24.340> things<00:01:24.640> from

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
spring filter keeps big things from

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.580 
spring filter keeps big things from
getting<00:01:25.210> in<00:01:25.360> there<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.230> hose<00:01:26.380> and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
getting in there and the hose and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.230 
getting in there and the hose and
clogging<00:01:26.950> things<00:01:27.190> up<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.610> then<00:01:27.700> also<00:01:27.910> it

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
clogging things up and then also it

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.770 
clogging things up and then also it
prevents<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.229> hose<00:01:29.380> from<00:01:30.360> sucking<00:01:31.360> down<00:01:31.600> to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
prevents the hose from sucking down to

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.000 
prevents the hose from sucking down to
the<00:01:31.870> bottom<00:01:32.140> of<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.350> bucket<00:01:32.530> you're<00:01:32.830> using

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
the bottom of the bucket you're using

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.000 
the bottom of the bucket you're using
for<00:01:33.790> your<00:01:33.820> fertilizer<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:35.110> is<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.530> working

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
for your fertilizer this is the working

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.760 
for your fertilizer this is the working
end<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.370> this<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:38.610> part<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:40.770> set

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
end of this this is the part that set

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.590 
end of this this is the part that set
does<00:01:42.040> all<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.370> siphoning<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.060> mixes<00:01:43.390> the

this is a backflow preventer keeps if

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.440 
this is a backflow preventer keeps if
you<00:01:50.470> lose<00:01:50.680> if<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.190> lose<00:01:51.550> section<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.180> going<00:01:52.390> to

you lose if you lose section is going to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:06.990 
you lose if you lose section is going to
keep<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:53.050> fertilizer<00:01:53.500> out<00:01:53.650> of<00:01:53.890> your<00:02:05.880> foot<00:02:06.880> to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
keep the fertilizer out of your foot to

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.270 
keep the fertilizer out of your foot to
the<00:02:07.149> filter<00:02:07.690> end<00:02:07.930> in<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:08.830> case<00:02:09.070> I'm<00:02:09.250> using

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the filter end in this case I'm using

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.960 
the filter end in this case I'm using
water<00:02:09.670> I've<00:02:09.940> got<00:02:10.119> two<00:02:10.330> quarts<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.780> water<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
water I've got two quarts of water you

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.640 
water I've got two quarts of water you
should<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.300> put<00:02:13.480> some<00:02:13.750> compost<00:02:14.080> tea<00:02:14.470> in

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
should have put some compost tea in

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.670 
should have put some compost tea in
there<00:02:14.830> or<00:02:15.040> maybe<00:02:15.190> some<00:02:15.989> food<00:02:16.989> coloring<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.560> we

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
there or maybe some food coloring so we

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.550 
there or maybe some food coloring so we
could<00:02:17.860> see<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.100> little<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.459> better<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:18.940> I

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
could see a little bit better but I

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.680 
could see a little bit better but I
think<00:02:20.560> it'll<00:02:20.680> work<00:02:20.830> out<00:02:20.920> we're<00:02:21.100> gonna<00:02:21.160> put

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
think it'll work out we're gonna put

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:32.440 
think it'll work out we're gonna put
that<00:02:22.690> into<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.320> water

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.449
