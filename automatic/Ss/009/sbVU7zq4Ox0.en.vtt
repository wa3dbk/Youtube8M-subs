00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.120 
is a kinetic multi-touch particle
visualizer<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.269> that's<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.570> whole<00:00:09.690> lot<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.130> big

visualizer and that's a whole lot of big

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.379 
visualizer and that's a whole lot of big
words<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.639> basically<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.240> thing

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
what I'm going to talk about today is

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.269 
what I'm going to talk about today is
just<00:00:18.930> walk<00:00:19.109> through<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> actual<00:00:20.010> features

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
just walk through the actual features

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
just walk through the actual features
and<00:00:20.609> how<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.760> specifically<00:00:21.330> control<00:00:21.600> them

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and how you specifically control them

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.310 
and how you specifically control them
and<00:00:22.170> maybe<00:00:23.010> talk<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> little<00:00:23.550> bit<00:00:23.730> about<00:00:24.320> what

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and maybe talk a little bit about what

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.519 
and maybe talk a little bit about what
each<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.920> does<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.019> first<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
each of them does so first we have the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.740 
each of them does so first we have the
single<00:00:29.160> touch<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.699> guess<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.269> should<00:00:30.420> start<00:00:30.660> off

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
single touch I guess I should start off

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.220 
single touch I guess I should start off
by<00:00:30.929> saying<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:32.420> what<00:00:33.420> makes<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.780> was<00:00:33.870> unique

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
by saying that what makes it was unique

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.780 
by saying that what makes it was unique
is<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.649> depending<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.430> number<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
is that depending on the number of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.910 
is that depending on the number of
fingers<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.630> down<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> screen<00:00:37.770> at

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
fingers you have down on the screen at

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.049 
fingers you have down on the screen at
any<00:00:38.040> point<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.340> time<00:00:38.370> you'll<00:00:38.730> get<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> different

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
any point in time you'll get a different

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.510 
any point in time you'll get a different
mode<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.570> interaction<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.340> switch

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
mode of interaction and you can switch

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.069 
mode of interaction and you can switch
back<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.760> forth<00:00:41.969> between<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.600> modes<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
back and forth between these modes to

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.290 
back and forth between these modes to
create<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.829> whole<00:00:44.309> number<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> effects<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
create a whole number of effects and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
create a whole number of effects and
animations<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.379> synchronize<00:00:46.890> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
animations and you can synchronize this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.299 
animations and you can synchronize this
to<00:00:47.460> music<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:49.050> friends<00:00:49.230> or<00:00:49.620> anything<00:00:50.010> so

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to music or with friends or anything so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.520 
to music or with friends or anything so
I'm<00:00:50.430> gonna<00:00:50.579> talk<00:00:50.730> about<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.000> different<00:00:51.270> modes

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
I'm gonna talk about the different modes

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.950 
I'm gonna talk about the different modes
and<00:00:52.530> talk<00:00:52.860> about<00:00:52.980> how<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.219> control<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.820> so

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
and talk about how you control them so

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
and talk about how you control them so
the<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> single<00:00:55.860> finger<00:00:56.100> mode<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the first is the single finger mode and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.310 
the first is the single finger mode and
you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.969> sort<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.239> run<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:57.989> finger

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you can just sort of run your finger

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
you can just sort of run your finger
around<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.680> screen<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.160> particles<00:01:00.090> will

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
around the screen and particles will

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.810 
around the screen and particles will
spawn<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.140> finger<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
spawn with your finger it and if you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.390 
spawn with your finger it and if you
hold<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.840> still<00:01:04.229> will<00:01:04.500> kind<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> radiate<00:01:05.159> like

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
hold it still will kind of radiate like

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.670 
hold it still will kind of radiate like
this<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.990> sort<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.320> move<00:01:07.500> your

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
this and you can sort of move your

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.800 
this and you can sort of move your
finger<00:01:08.070> around<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.450> use<00:01:09.570> big

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
finger around and so you can use big

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.510 
finger around and so you can use big
gestures<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.130> very<00:01:11.400> small

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
gestures or you can use very small

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
gestures or you can use very small
movements<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> very<00:01:12.810> small<00:01:13.110> movements<00:01:13.530> can

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
movements the very small movements can

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.440 
movements the very small movements can
create<00:01:13.979> different<00:01:14.549> effects<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.150> throughout

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
create different effects and throughout

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320 
create different effects and throughout
a<00:01:15.689> zoo<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> gestures<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.729> big<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
a zoo the gestures can be big and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
a zoo the gestures can be big and
dramatic<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.320> also<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:19.680> subtle

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
dramatic and it can also be very subtle

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
dramatic and it can also be very subtle
to<00:01:20.640> create<00:01:20.939> different<00:01:21.060> effects<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.689> let's

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
to create different effects so let's

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
to create different effects so let's
move<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:22.560> fingers<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.009> needed<00:01:23.250> two

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
move on to two fingers we needed two

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.649 
move on to two fingers we needed two
fingers<00:01:23.700> you're<00:01:23.790> gonna<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.270> sort<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
fingers you're gonna get this sort of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.219 
fingers you're gonna get this sort of
just<00:01:25.259> sort<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.470> attractive<00:01:25.979> area<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.460> this

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
just sort of attractive area like this

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.300 
just sort of attractive area like this
you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.680> it'll<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.920> bigger<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you know and it'll get bigger and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910 
you know and it'll get bigger and
smaller<00:01:29.549> depending<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.320> how<00:01:31.320> wide<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.740> go

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
smaller depending on how how wide you go

smaller depending on how how wide you go
and<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.310> fun<00:01:32.549> things<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.939> put<00:01:33.900> the

fingers out here and grab all of them

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.230 
fingers out here and grab all of them
collect<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.400> sort<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.700> start<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.970> move

it<00:01:39.390> around<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.950> course<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> faster<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
it around and of course the faster you

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.600 
it around and of course the faster you
move<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> different<00:01:44.310> color

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
move it and the different color

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.090 
move it and the different color
particles<00:01:45.149> move<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> outside<00:01:46.049> there's<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
particles move to the outside there's a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
particles move to the outside there's a
lot<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.369> fun<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.880> use<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> collect

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
lot of fun you can use this to collect

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.870 
lot of fun you can use this to collect
fireballs<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> throw<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.399> sorts<00:01:50.820> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
fireballs and throw them in all sorts of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
fireballs and throw them in all sorts of
things<00:01:51.229> let's<00:01:52.229> move<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> three<00:01:52.829> fingers

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
things let's move on to three fingers

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.139 
things let's move on to three fingers
when<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.280> put<00:01:53.399> three<00:01:53.610> fingers<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:54.000> we're

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
when we put three fingers now we're

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450 
when we put three fingers now we're
gonna<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:55.229> sort<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.219> sort<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
gonna get this sort of like this sort of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.240 
gonna get this sort of like this sort of
a<00:01:56.579> vortex<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.540> kind<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.780> fun<00:01:58.250> turns

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a vortex thing that's kind of fun turns

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.880 
a vortex thing that's kind of fun turns
out<00:01:59.430> Moo's<00:02:00.030> ooh<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> Japanese<00:02:01.409> word<00:02:01.860> for

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
out Moo's ooh it's the Japanese word for

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
out Moo's ooh it's the Japanese word for
vortex<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.210> there's<00:02:03.420> also<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.689> sushi<00:02:03.990> roll

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
vortex and there's also a sushi roll

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.490 
vortex and there's also a sushi roll
named<00:02:04.590> after<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.040> maybe<00:02:05.790> some<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
named after it maybe some of you

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.590 
named after it maybe some of you
that<00:02:06.820> so<00:02:07.820> with<00:02:07.940> three<00:02:08.090> fingers<00:02:08.240> we<00:02:08.420> can<00:02:08.450> do<00:02:08.570> a

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
that so with three fingers we can do a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.210 
that so with three fingers we can do a
lot<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.840> really<00:02:09.140> fun<00:02:09.380> stuff<00:02:09.410> it's<00:02:09.800> gonna<00:02:09.920> chase

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
lot of really fun stuff it's gonna chase

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.590 
lot of really fun stuff it's gonna chase
after<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.670> three<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:10.970> them<00:02:11.060> we<00:02:11.210> can<00:02:11.360> switch

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
after the three of them we can switch

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.110 
after the three of them we can switch
between<00:02:11.750> different<00:02:12.140> fingers<00:02:12.700> move<00:02:13.700> around

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
between different fingers move around

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.690 
between different fingers move around
with<00:02:14.780> de<00:02:14.870> for<00:02:15.050> for<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.290> second<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.520> throw

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
with de for for a second I like to throw

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.230 
with de for for a second I like to throw
them<00:02:16.880> back<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.240> forth<00:02:17.450> sometimes<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:20.120> we're

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
them back and forth sometimes so we're

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.550 
them back and forth sometimes so we're
gonna<00:02:20.360> move<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.600> four<00:02:20.900> fing<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.320> go<00:02:21.440> to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
gonna move on to four fing as we go to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.460 
gonna move on to four fing as we go to
four<00:02:21.770> fingers<00:02:22.930> you'll<00:02:23.930> see<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.320> does

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
four fingers you'll see that it does

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.960 
four fingers you'll see that it does
something<00:02:24.650> similar<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.340> three<00:02:25.640> fingers

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
something similar to the three fingers

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.150 
something similar to the three fingers
but<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.750> tuned<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.290> different<00:02:27.650> way<00:02:27.830> on

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
but it's it tuned in a different way on

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.910 
but it's it tuned in a different way on
the<00:02:28.490> red<00:02:28.940> particles<00:02:29.420> actually<00:02:29.630> move<00:02:30.530> towards

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
the red particles actually move towards

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.490 
the red particles actually move towards
the<00:02:31.160> outside<00:02:31.520> well<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.230> event<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the outside well in the event that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.910 
the outside well in the event that
you've<00:02:33.740> colored<00:02:34.160> them<00:02:34.310> red<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:36.620> can<00:02:36.770> get

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
you've colored them red and you can get

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.710 
you've colored them red and you can get
down<00:02:37.070> really<00:02:37.490> small<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.150> let<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.450> sort<00:02:38.630> of

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
down really small and let it sort of

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.199 
down really small and let it sort of
collect<00:02:40.570> pull<00:02:41.570> it<00:02:41.750> out<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:43.760> also<00:02:43.940> have

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
collect pull it out and you also have

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.290 
collect pull it out and you also have
great<00:02:44.390> effects<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.770> five<00:02:46.280> fingers<00:02:46.760> now<00:02:47.120> this

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
great effects so five fingers now this

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.460 
great effects so five fingers now this
is<00:02:47.420> where<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.630> gets<00:02:47.780> interesting<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.260> get<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
is where it gets interesting you get the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.630 
is where it gets interesting you get the
whole<00:02:48.650> thing<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:49.010> your<00:02:49.070> hand<00:02:49.280> like<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.580> and

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
whole thing with your hand like this and

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.580 
whole thing with your hand like this and
sort<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.000> move<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.270> around<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.959> you'll<00:02:51.380> notice

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
sort of move it around and you'll notice

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.670 
sort of move it around and you'll notice
that<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.430> moves<00:02:53.140> sort<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.200> been<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.350> 3d

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that it moves sort of been a 3d

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.370 
that it moves sort of been a 3d
perspective<00:02:54.980> here<00:02:55.520> you<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.209> throw<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.600> stop

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
perspective here you can throw it stop

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.050 
perspective here you can throw it stop
it<00:02:57.620> move<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.280> around<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.760> one<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:58.940> my

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
it move it around this is one of my

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.120 
it move it around this is one of my
favorites<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.630> is<00:02:59.810> just<00:02:59.989> sort<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.230> grab<00:03:00.950> them

favorites this is just sort of grab them

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.620 
favorites this is just sort of grab them
and<00:03:01.280> throw<00:03:01.430> them<00:03:01.459> mode<00:03:01.790> so<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.300> be<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.510> any

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
and throw them mode so you can be in any

and throw them mode so you can be in any
of<00:03:02.720> these<00:03:02.840> other<00:03:03.050> modes<00:03:03.260> say<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:04.430> three

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
of these other modes say like three

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.590 
of these other modes say like three
fingers<00:03:04.820> I'm<00:03:05.060> going<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.209> put<00:03:05.330> two<00:03:05.450> fingers

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
fingers I'm going to put two fingers

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.930 
fingers I'm going to put two fingers
down<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.890> freezes<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.520> I<00:03:07.580> can<00:03:07.730> move<00:03:07.820> it

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
down and it freezes it and I can move it

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.840 
down and it freezes it and I can move it
around<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.590> 3d<00:03:09.590> space<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.920> throw<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.519> I<00:03:10.549> can<00:03:10.760> do

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
around in 3d space and throw it I can do

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.670 
around in 3d space and throw it I can do
that<00:03:11.000> for<00:03:11.570> many<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.870> other<00:03:11.989> modes<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.380> can<00:03:12.530> I

that for many of the other modes I can I

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.020 
that for many of the other modes I can I
can<00:03:12.830> go<00:03:12.950> into<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> five<00:03:13.400> finger<00:03:13.670> mode<00:03:13.820> and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
can go into the five finger mode and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.789 
can go into the five finger mode and
freeze<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:15.049> move<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.230> around<00:03:15.380> which<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.769> a

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
freeze it and move it around which is a

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.140 
freeze it and move it around which is a
lot<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.070> fun<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.430> do<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.700> sort<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:16.910> get<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
lot of fun to do to sort of get the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.820 
lot of fun to do to sort of get the
thing<00:03:17.299> in<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.450> different<00:03:17.810> shapes<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.560> freeze

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
thing in the different shapes and freeze

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.949 
thing in the different shapes and freeze
them<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.310> see<00:03:19.519> what<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.670> have<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.780> let's

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
them and then see what you have so let's

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.930 
them and then see what you have so let's
move<00:03:21.080> on<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.290> six<00:03:21.650> now<00:03:21.799> past<00:03:22.130> five<00:03:22.430> fingers<00:03:22.820> I

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
move on to six now past five fingers I

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.570 
move on to six now past five fingers I
recommend<00:03:23.330> of<00:03:23.390> course<00:03:23.420> using<00:03:23.780> two<00:03:23.989> hands<00:03:24.580> most

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
recommend of course using two hands most

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.670 
recommend of course using two hands most
of<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.790> have<00:03:25.970> no<00:03:26.120> choice<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:26.660> we're<00:03:27.350> gonna<00:03:27.440> go

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
of you have no choice so we're gonna go

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.180 
of you have no choice so we're gonna go
like<00:03:27.890> this

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
like this

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.360 
like this
now<00:03:28.519> it's<00:03:28.730> gonna<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:30.500> different<00:03:30.860> modes<00:03:31.040> above

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
now it's gonna the different modes above

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.340 
now it's gonna the different modes above
five<00:03:31.640> fingers<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.120> meant<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.390> be<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.690> bit<00:03:33.080> larger

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
five fingers I meant to be a bit larger

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.520 
five fingers I meant to be a bit larger
in<00:03:33.709> there<00:03:33.830> display<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.049> more<00:03:36.049> subtlety

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
in there display and and more subtlety

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.259 
in there display and and more subtlety
will<00:03:36.860> be<00:03:36.980> required<00:03:37.489> when<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:37.880> move<00:03:38.060> your

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
will be required when you move your

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.350 
will be required when you move your
fingers<00:03:38.660> around<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.370> nice<00:03:40.579> 3d<00:03:41.060> shape

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
fingers around so but this nice 3d shape

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.569 
fingers around so but this nice 3d shape
and<00:03:41.630> I'm<00:03:41.720> just<00:03:41.900> now<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.190> going<00:03:43.459> to

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
and I'm just now this is going to

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.020 
and I'm just now this is going to
actually<00:03:43.730> respond<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:45.760> translation<00:03:46.760> so<00:03:46.880> as

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
actually respond to translation so as

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.789 
actually respond to translation so as
you<00:03:47.180> move<00:03:47.420> your<00:03:47.630> group<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.930> hands<00:03:48.140> around<00:03:48.290> you

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
you move your group of hands around you

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.280 
you move your group of hands around you
but<00:03:48.950> fingers<00:03:49.100> around<00:03:49.310> sorry<00:03:49.900> it's<00:03:50.900> going<00:03:51.200> to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
but fingers around sorry it's going to

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.569 
but fingers around sorry it's going to
slide<00:03:51.560> around<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:54.110> compress<00:03:54.829> your

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
slide around if you compress your

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.500 
slide around if you compress your
fingers<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:57.470> will<00:03:57.650> sort<00:03:58.010> of<00:03:58.160> make<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.640> move

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
fingers it will sort of make it move

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.319 
fingers it will sort of make it move
around<00:03:59.660> nice<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:00.410> slowly<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.890> big<00:04:01.160> if<00:04:01.519> you

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
around nice and slowly and big if you

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.569 
around nice and slowly and big if you
expand<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.350> think<00:04:03.829> of<00:04:03.920> this<00:04:03.980> like<00:04:04.160> tightening

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
expand and think of this like tightening

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.069 
expand and think of this like tightening
a<00:04:04.640> rubber<00:04:04.850> band<00:04:05.030> it'll<00:04:05.329> it'll<00:04:05.810> make<00:04:05.959> it

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
a rubber band it'll it'll make it

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.569 
a rubber band it'll it'll make it
contract<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.769> move<00:04:06.860> around<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.370> course

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
contract and move around and of course

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.680 
contract and move around and of course
you<00:04:07.700> can<00:04:07.850> still<00:04:08.060> move<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.329> around<00:04:08.420> while

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
you can still move it around while

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.720 
you can still move it around while
you're<00:04:08.810> doing<00:04:09.079> this<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.620> then<00:04:10.250> any<00:04:10.370> point<00:04:10.670> in

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
you're doing this and then any point in

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.670 
you're doing this and then any point in
time<00:04:10.760> you'll<00:04:11.120> lift<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.390> finger<00:04:11.570> in<00:04:11.840> we're<00:04:12.620> in

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
time you'll lift a finger in we're in

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.629 
time you'll lift a finger in we're in
that<00:04:12.829> 3d<00:04:13.280> mode<00:04:13.599> five<00:04:14.599> fingers<00:04:14.989> here

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
that 3d mode five fingers here

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.729 
that 3d mode five fingers here
so<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.449> this<00:04:17.599> this<00:04:17.930> one<00:04:18.169> has<00:04:18.289> a<00:04:18.319> lot<00:04:18.590> of

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
so and this this one has a lot of

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.770 
so and this this one has a lot of
subtlety<00:04:19.189> to<00:04:19.219> it<00:04:19.430> try<00:04:20.180> moving<00:04:20.449> your<00:04:20.509> hand

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
subtlety to it try moving your hand

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.050 
subtlety to it try moving your hand
slowly<00:04:21.109> through<00:04:21.560> here<00:04:21.829> or<00:04:22.250> quickly<00:04:22.729> this<00:04:22.939> is

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
slowly through here or quickly this is

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.089 
slowly through here or quickly this is
really<00:04:23.300> relaxing<00:04:23.719> this<00:04:23.870> one<00:04:24.050> happy<00:04:25.009> little

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
really relaxing this one happy little

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.860 
really relaxing this one happy little
trees<00:04:25.430> right<00:04:26.020> at<00:04:27.020> seven<00:04:27.590> fingers<00:04:28.569> we<00:04:29.569> have<00:04:29.689> the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
trees right at seven fingers we have the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.249 
trees right at seven fingers we have the
spiral<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.800> spiral<00:04:31.639> is<00:04:31.699> kind<00:04:31.879> of<00:04:31.939> interesting

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
spiral the spiral is kind of interesting

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.929 
spiral the spiral is kind of interesting
if<00:04:33.259> we<00:04:33.469> get<00:04:33.650> our<00:04:33.770> hands<00:04:33.979> sort<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.400> centered

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:34.939 
if we get our hands sort of centered

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.420 
if we get our hands sort of centered
here<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.870> spiral<00:04:36.259> will<00:04:36.349> also<00:04:36.740> react<00:04:37.099> to<00:04:37.340> the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
here the spiral will also react to the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.179 
here the spiral will also react to the
same<00:04:37.639> type<00:04:37.939> of<00:04:38.180> interaction<00:04:38.689> that<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.189> sixth

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189 
same type of interaction that the sixth

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.730 
same type of interaction that the sixth
finger<00:04:40.400> mode<00:04:40.789> reacts<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.569> in<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:42.020> you'll<00:04:42.590> be

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
finger mode reacts to in that you'll be

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.600 
finger mode reacts to in that you'll be
able<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:43.099> expand<00:04:43.819> and<00:04:44.620> compress<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:46.490> get

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
able to expand and compress to get

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.129 
able to expand and compress to get
different<00:04:46.849> things<00:04:47.000> that<00:04:47.090> happen<00:04:47.389> and<00:04:47.569> then

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
different things that happen and then

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.559 
different things that happen and then
also<00:04:48.289> translate<00:04:49.069> to<00:04:49.669> offset<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.270> various

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
also translate to offset the various

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.740 
also translate to offset the various
curves<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.580> then<00:04:52.729> from<00:04:52.939> here<00:04:52.969> if<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.419> can<00:04:53.629> of

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
curves and then from here if you can of

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.570 
curves and then from here if you can of
course<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.020> can<00:04:54.139> lift<00:04:54.259> two<00:04:54.409> fingers<00:04:54.800> go<00:04:55.430> right

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
course you can lift two fingers go right

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.029 
course you can lift two fingers go right
in<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.729> five<00:04:55.969> finger<00:04:56.300> mode<00:04:56.919> shake<00:04:57.919> your

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
in that five finger mode shake your

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.779 
in that five finger mode shake your
spiral<00:04:58.340> out<00:04:58.930> that's<00:04:59.930> kind<00:05:00.080> of<00:05:00.169> fun<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:01.490> make

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
spiral out that's kind of fun and make

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.080 
spiral out that's kind of fun and make
it<00:05:01.909> go<00:05:02.060> again<00:05:02.389> you<00:05:02.539> sort<00:05:02.779> can<00:05:02.930> do<00:05:03.050> this<00:05:04.090> even

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
it go again you sort can do this even

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.249 
it go again you sort can do this even
while<00:05:05.240> you're<00:05:05.360> moving<00:05:05.569> it<00:05:05.629> around<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:09.050> let's

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
while you're moving it around so let's

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.959 
while you're moving it around so let's
go<00:05:09.349> down<00:05:09.469> to<00:05:09.500> seven<00:05:09.949> hair<00:05:10.129> roots<00:05:10.340> from<00:05:10.669> seven

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
go down to seven hair roots from seven

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.189 
go down to seven hair roots from seven
we're<00:05:11.090> gonna<00:05:11.180> transition<00:05:11.629> in<00:05:11.870> one<00:05:12.050> of<00:05:12.139> my

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
we're gonna transition in one of my

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.409 
we're gonna transition in one of my
favorites<00:05:12.650> which<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:12.800> eight<00:05:13.129> eight<00:05:13.939> is<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.180> sort

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
favorites which is eight eight is a sort

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.869 
favorites which is eight eight is a sort
of<00:05:14.479> spin<00:05:14.689> on<00:05:14.810> five<00:05:15.110> if<00:05:15.349> we<00:05:15.529> grab<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.400> with<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.639> now

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
of spin on five if we grab it with a now

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.600 
of spin on five if we grab it with a now
it<00:05:17.240> kind<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:17.810> freezes<00:05:18.259> it<00:05:18.409> but<00:05:18.590> what<00:05:19.159> we<00:05:19.279> can<00:05:19.460> do

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
it kind of freezes it but what we can do

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.610 
it kind of freezes it but what we can do
now<00:05:19.759> is<00:05:19.969> smash<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:20.719> we're<00:05:21.050> gonna<00:05:21.169> push<00:05:21.440> I'm

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
now is smash it we're gonna push I'm

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.409 
now is smash it we're gonna push I'm
gonna<00:05:21.740> do<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.889> very<00:05:22.039> subtly<00:05:22.610> very<00:05:22.909> slowly<00:05:23.240> and

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
gonna do it very subtly very slowly and

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.939 
gonna do it very subtly very slowly and
just<00:05:23.539> kind<00:05:23.690> of<00:05:23.719> push<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.289> then<00:05:24.710> smash<00:05:24.919> it

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
just kind of push and then smash it

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.010 
just kind of push and then smash it
downward<00:05:25.639> and<00:05:25.849> then<00:05:26.210> pull<00:05:26.479> it<00:05:26.629> outwards<00:05:26.960> and

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
downward and then pull it outwards and

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.749 
downward and then pull it outwards and
we<00:05:27.110> can<00:05:27.229> sort<00:05:27.409> of<00:05:27.469> do<00:05:27.650> this<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.219> what's

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
we can sort of do this and what's

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.300 
we can sort of do this and what's
interesting<00:05:29.440> is<00:05:30.440> that<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.710> can<00:05:31.009> release<00:05:31.279> a

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
interesting is that I can release a

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.589 
interesting is that I can release a
finger<00:05:31.699> and<00:05:31.879> then<00:05:31.969> we're<00:05:32.089> right<00:05:32.210> back<00:05:32.270> into

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
finger and then we're right back into

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.170 
finger and then we're right back into
separate<00:05:33.020> seven<00:05:33.319> finger<00:05:33.529> mode<00:05:33.849> and<00:05:34.849> here's

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
separate seven finger mode and here's

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.999 
separate seven finger mode and here's
our<00:05:35.389> spiral<00:05:35.690> again<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:36.199> we<00:05:36.319> can<00:05:36.349> transition

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
our spiral again so we can transition

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.670 
our spiral again so we can transition
between<00:05:37.159> seven<00:05:37.960> or<00:05:38.960> rather<00:05:39.169> this<00:05:39.379> is<00:05:39.500> eight

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
between seven or rather this is eight

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.219 
between seven or rather this is eight
and<00:05:39.919> then<00:05:40.250> into<00:05:40.490> seven<00:05:40.849> and<00:05:41.180> then<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.080> eight

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
and then into seven and then to eight

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.309 
and then into seven and then to eight
and<00:05:42.650> sort<00:05:43.039> of<00:05:43.069> just<00:05:43.190> control<00:05:43.669> this<00:05:43.909> spiral<00:05:44.319> do

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
and sort of just control this spiral do

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:50.140 
and sort of just control this spiral do
what<00:05:45.439> it<00:05:45.529> wants<00:05:46.150> rather<00:05:47.150> what<00:05:47.330> you<00:05:47.360> want<00:05:47.629> to<00:05:47.750> do
