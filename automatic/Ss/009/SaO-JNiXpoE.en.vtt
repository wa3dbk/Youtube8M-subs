00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.440
 this friends and we are in still here 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.830
 on day 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.190
 and we see the amount of tents that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.190
 we have 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.840
 and I'm feeding them 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.610
 but we also have 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.610
 defaulters telescopes 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.329
 that our ponds will soon 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.630
 bring some vents for 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.790
 put them here 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:47.420
 and we see the filtering system 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.420
 we see this small filter efe 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.980
 we give the whole installation 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.899
 Each of these gutters is 180 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.899
 liters 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.400
 here we see the pups of the shot take this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.800
 what white fish 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.670
 here are the biggest ones have a 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.670
 week of birth 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.470
 this is already bigger they have 20 days 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.790
 this we just spent yesterday yesterday 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.590
 they exploded from the eggs 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:54.870
 We feed them with rotifers 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.870
 paramÃ©s and are microorganisms that 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.480
 that occur in fresh water too 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.620
 already when they are somewhat grown 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.040
 as well as this I say in more 34 days the 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.040
 we passed 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.080
 we went to these gutters 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.299
 they are tents 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.709
 let's say the amount 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.240
 soon for example this is 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.290
 unoccupied I will bring about two sunsets 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.540
 to grow it since the water is in 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.650
 constant recirculation does not 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.040
 keeps the same water 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.030
 this would be equivalent to changing the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.040
 water every day 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.040
 for better development 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.140
 in all the facilities 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.830
 and this is where we have raised the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.830
 artery our houses 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.690
 Y 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.540
 here with this we feed the fish 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.600
 well this is all and I hope there is 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.600
 liked
