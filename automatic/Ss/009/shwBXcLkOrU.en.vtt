00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
call and forced back so we could try a

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.050 
call and forced back so we could try a

possible<00:03:58.540> he<00:03:58.870> gets<00:03:59.050> mana<00:03:59.260> leak<00:03:59.470> so<00:03:59.590> as<00:03:59.680> he<00:03:59.800> does

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
possible he gets mana leak so as he does

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.170 
possible he gets mana leak so as he does
right<00:04:00.100> now<00:04:00.220> he<00:04:00.280> loses<00:04:00.760> all<00:04:00.880> that<00:04:01.000> precious

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
right now he loses all that precious

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.030 
right now he loses all that precious
