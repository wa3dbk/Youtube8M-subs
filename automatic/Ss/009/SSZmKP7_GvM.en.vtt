00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.360
 hello friends welcome once again 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.860
 we are in the temple at night 2.0 and by 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.409
 what have you come back to try again 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.860
 no no no no no no no no no no no no 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:16.529
 I have not returned to see what there is 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.860
 behind all this map what there is for 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.020
 underneath all its functioning and we are going to 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.610
 start by the east well of wishes 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.800
 to call it somehow fixos 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.240
 that here in the background there are some push buttons 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.990
 that when you throw something in this case that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.030
 has a tnt 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.770
 the door opens very well then we are going to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.989
 enter inside quiet that this that 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.910
 I'm doing right now it's dumb 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.850
 that really what behind everything you go 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.720
 to flip in good colors let's catch 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.699
 some torches that are here some 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.660
 torches and let's put them here 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.420
 so you can see everything it's worth to notice that 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.500
 we have pressed one I do not realize which one 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 it has been if this west 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.420
 I think this is the good part and this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.030
 it's the bad part, let's check it 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.430
 you see that something has suddenly sounded there 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.100
 floor in the good and here to notice that there 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.700
 another floor in the good now opens 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.700
 now 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.530
 well everything is done I stepped on the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 bad and now tread on the good but the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.990
 thing is not going to stay here I'm going to catch 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.990
 all this well let's chop around here 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.750
 to a faster man so part a little 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.880
 faster with the is with the sword 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.860
 we start the pistons and it starts to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.230
 leave below what has been 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.540
 all the machinery 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.010

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.759
 good face 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.310
 what machines did that sound to go from 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.750
 machines for life 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.189

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:38.200

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.150
 or not to notice impressive 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.879

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.209
 circuits are circuits taken to 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.209
 Minecraft 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.280
 God became the night and suddenly 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.659
 the darkness then let's throw around here 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.510
 down to the best we give in the head of 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.599
 night and there is the full brightness that is the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.879
 story that if you do not see by now 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.689

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.689
 night yes 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.200
 frugal 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.200
 what I have mounted here 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.820
 and all the machinery here 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:35.100
 this group of people disco 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.100
 he deserves to try a temple 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.560
 but good 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.290

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.319

 ease 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.170

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.900
