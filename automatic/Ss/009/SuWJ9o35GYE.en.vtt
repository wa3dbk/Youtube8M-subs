00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.040
 I made my first videos here 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.120
 the name of the hour is so uncomfortable because I was 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.280
 below and now i'm almost sitting but okay 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.490
 long ago in April 2014 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.810
 or rather six months ago I was shooting my own 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 first launch heading 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.939
 and a layer many normal still ask and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.539
 will be right because few people remember 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:38.370
