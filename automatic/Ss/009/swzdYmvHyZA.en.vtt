 My name is Liliana and I am a biosafety consultant CristÃ³foli. Our goal today is to help 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.539
 you to get to know your equipment better and give some practical suggestions on biosafety 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.369
 in your office. Please contact me whenever you need. For your convenience we share 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.300
 this topic presentation. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.900
 To set up a dental office 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 To set up your dental office it is important that you know the legislation of your municipality. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.940
 Before renting or buying the property go to the sanitary surveillance and ask for directions. 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.200
 See also the Anvisa manual which is the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.300
 which deals with dental offices. 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.280
 The manual of routines and procedures is a written document, where you will detail all the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.090
 routines and procedures performed in your office. Must be drawn by you 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.000
 and your team and reflect the real work. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 A suggestion of topics to be developed: 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.000
 How to use protective barriers in your office. 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.000
 Caring for the environment is one of the ways 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.549
 avoid cross-infection in dental offices. The routine between patients should 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.540
 be careful that areas that have been touched by gloved and contaminated hands 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.120
 by the dental activity during the procedure becomes safe for the next patient. 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.779
 In clinical procedures this can be accomplished by cleaning, followed by disinfection 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:22.019
 or expedited by the use of disposable barriers exchanged to each patient. See what they are 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.629
 locations. In the patient's chair the back back, the head and arms, 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.969
