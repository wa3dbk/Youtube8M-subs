00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.110 

every<00:00:01.589> day<00:00:01.740> we<00:00:01.920> throw<00:00:02.220> away<00:00:02.340> millions<00:00:02.820> of

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
every day we throw away millions of

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.880 
every day we throw away millions of
electronic<00:00:03.570> devices<00:00:03.600> because<00:00:04.470> they<00:00:04.589> get<00:00:04.710> old

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
electronic devices because they get old

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.490 
electronic devices because they get old
and<00:00:05.040> become<00:00:05.310> worn<00:00:05.549> out<00:00:06.049> but<00:00:07.049> usually<00:00:07.410> it's

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and become worn out but usually it's

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.110 
and become worn out but usually it's
only<00:00:07.710> one<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.099> components<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.730> causes

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
only one of the components that causes

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.370 
only one of the components that causes
the<00:00:09.210> problem<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:12.420> rest<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.809> device<00:00:13.080> works

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the problem the rest of the device works

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.230 
the problem the rest of the device works
fine<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.070> needlessly<00:00:14.460> thrown<00:00:14.790> away

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.849 

simply<00:00:18.240> because<00:00:18.390> electronic<00:00:19.230> devices<00:00:19.529> are

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
simply because electronic devices are

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.670 
simply because electronic devices are
not<00:00:20.189> designed<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.880> last<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:22.410> makes

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
not designed to last this makes

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.320 
not designed to last this makes
electronic<00:00:23.039> waste<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> fastest

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
electronic waste one of the fastest

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.820 
electronic waste one of the fastest
growing<00:00:24.420> waste<00:00:24.840> streams<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> world<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
growing waste streams in the world and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.279 
growing waste streams in the world and
our<00:00:26.310> phone<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> biggest<00:00:27.539> causes

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.690 

so<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> new<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.790> phone<00:00:34.489> it's<00:00:35.489> made

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
so this is a new kind of phone it's made

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.830 
so this is a new kind of phone it's made
of<00:00:35.850> blocks<00:00:39.260> detachable<00:00:40.260> blogs<00:00:41.570> they<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.629> all

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
of blocks detachable blogs they are all

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.260 
of blocks detachable blogs they are all
connected<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> base<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.270> base

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
connected to the base and the base

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.680 
connected to the base and the base
connects<00:00:45.750> everything<00:00:46.079> together<00:00:47.690> electrical

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
connects everything together electrical

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.240 
connects everything together electrical
signals<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.140> transferred<00:00:49.649> through<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> pins

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
signals are transferred through the pins

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.020 
signals are transferred through the pins
and<00:00:51.469> two<00:00:52.469> small<00:00:52.860> screws<00:00:53.160> lock<00:00:53.520> everything<00:00:53.789> in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
and two small screws lock everything in

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.869 
and two small screws lock everything in
place<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.949> instance<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.489> phone<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
place so if for instance your phone is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.459 
place so if for instance your phone is
getting<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.270> slow<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.320> just

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
getting a little slow you can just

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.459 
getting a little slow you can just
upgrade<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.920> block<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.309> affects<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> speed

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
upgrade the block that affects the speed

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
upgrade the block that affects the speed
or<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.739> something<00:01:01.980> breaks<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.390> easily
