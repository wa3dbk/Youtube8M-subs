I<00:00:13.290> went<00:00:13.559> over<00:00:13.710> up<00:00:13.860> shifting<00:00:14.309> now<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.330> going<00:00:15.480> to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
I went over up shifting now I'm going to

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.620 
I went over up shifting now I'm going to
talk<00:00:15.660> about<00:00:15.809> down<00:00:16.109> shifting<00:00:17.420> now<00:00:18.420> there<00:00:18.570> are

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
talk about down shifting now there are

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.160 
talk about down shifting now there are
two<00:00:18.779> main<00:00:18.960> ways<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.380> downshift<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:21.170> what

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
two main ways to downshift you can what

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.660 
two main ways to downshift you can what
you'll<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.560> most<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> times<00:00:23.189> when<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.490> go

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
you'll do most of the times when you go

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.150 
you'll do most of the times when you go
up<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> stop<00:00:24.449> sign<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.779> light<00:00:25.439> that's<00:00:25.859> red

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
up to a stop sign or light that's red

click all the way down okay honestly
that's<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.390> most<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.780> time

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
that's what I do most of time

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.079 
that's what I do most of time
but<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.109> method<00:00:39.410> you<00:00:39.710> really<00:00:40.039> should<00:00:40.339> learn<00:00:41.030> to

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
but a method you really should learn to

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.490 
but a method you really should learn to
use<00:00:41.710> it's<00:00:42.710> called<00:00:42.980> engine<00:00:43.579> braking<00:00:43.820> now

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
use it's called engine braking now

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.750 
use it's called engine braking now
whenever<00:00:45.500> you're<00:00:45.739> first<00:00:46.010> breaking<00:00:46.339> in<00:00:46.579> your

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
whenever you're first breaking in your

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.149 
whenever you're first breaking in your
motorcycle<00:00:47.480> when<00:00:47.570> you<00:00:47.629> first<00:00:47.809> get<00:00:48.019> it<00:00:48.199> it's

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
motorcycle when you first get it it's

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.819 
motorcycle when you first get it it's
recommended<00:00:49.729> that<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:49.879> use<00:00:50.000> engine<00:00:50.510> braking

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
recommended that you use engine braking

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.939 
recommended that you use engine braking
and<00:00:51.829> I'm<00:00:52.010> going<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.250> basically<00:00:52.399> show<00:00:52.729> you<00:00:53.949> what

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
and I'm going to basically show you what

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.370 
and I'm going to basically show you what
I<00:00:55.039> do

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
I do

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.090 
I do
hopefully<00:00:57.250> this<00:00:57.460> will<00:00:57.610> be<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:58.920> red<00:00:59.920> light

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
hopefully this will be a red light

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.300 
hopefully this will be a red light
coming<00:01:00.340> up<00:01:00.580> but<00:01:00.760> if<00:01:00.850> not<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:02.260> know<00:01:02.320> before<00:01:02.740> you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
coming up but if not you know before you

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.640 
coming up but if not you know before you
at<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.610> it<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:04.000> anticipate<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.809> stop<00:01:05.199> you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
at you it you anticipate to stop you

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.010 
at you it you anticipate to stop you
pull<00:01:05.920> in<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.100> clutch<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:07.120> downshift<00:01:07.390> and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
pull in the clutch and downshift and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.920 
pull in the clutch and downshift and
your<00:01:08.620> bike<00:01:08.800> will<00:01:09.010> automatically<00:01:09.640> rev<00:01:10.330> up<00:01:10.450> rpms

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
your bike will automatically rev up rpms

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.649 
your bike will automatically rev up rpms
and<00:01:11.260> come<00:01:11.440> slow<00:01:11.830> down<00:01:12.010> do<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.790> again

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
and come slow down do it again

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.870 
and come slow down do it again
he's<00:01:15.530> got<00:01:15.710> downhill<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.400> it's<00:01:16.549> a<00:01:16.610> little

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
he's got downhill so it's a little

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.719 
he's got downhill so it's a little
harder<00:01:17.180> but<00:01:17.900> that's<00:01:18.020> basically<00:01:18.439> it<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:18.650> slow

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
harder but that's basically it you slow

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.910 
harder but that's basically it you slow
I<00:01:19.759> want<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.210> very<00:01:20.360> good<00:01:20.509> example<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.439> uh<00:01:21.500> you

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
basically as you're slowing down you're

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.530 
basically as you're slowing down you're
going<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.280> want<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.580> sit<00:01:25.670> down<00:01:25.880> shift<00:01:26.240> no<00:01:26.479> you

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
going to want to sit down shift no you

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.070 
going to want to sit down shift no you
want<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.110> make<00:01:27.259> sure<00:01:27.470> your<00:01:28.220> rpms<00:01:28.790> match<00:01:29.149> well

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
the gear you're going into would you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.520 
the gear you're going into would you
basically<00:01:32.509> go<00:01:32.690> down<00:01:32.770> gear<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.979> gear<00:01:34.250> no

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
basically go down gear to gear no

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.960 
basically go down gear to gear no
besides<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.799> your<00:01:36.950> besides<00:01:37.460> when<00:01:37.850> you're

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
besides in your besides when you're

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.139 
besides in your besides when you're
braking<00:01:38.240> any<00:01:38.360> motorcycle<00:01:38.869> another<00:01:40.149> reason

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
braking any motorcycle another reason

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.930 
braking any motorcycle another reason
why<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.830> good<00:01:42.830> is<00:01:43.009> because<00:01:43.039> when<00:01:43.820> you're

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
why this is good is because when you're

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.760 
why this is good is because when you're
coming<00:01:44.149> up<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.390> red<00:01:44.690> lights<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.970> you're

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
coming up to red lights a and and you're

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.389 
coming up to red lights a and and you're
if<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.950> didn't<00:01:50.050> engine<00:01:51.050> break<00:01:51.289> all<00:01:52.039> you<00:01:52.250> did

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
if you didn't engine break all you did

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.010 
if you didn't engine break all you did
was<00:01:52.429> pull<00:01:52.789> in<00:01:52.880> your<00:01:52.970> clutch<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.509> as<00:01:53.840> you're

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
was pull in your clutch and as you're

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.559 
was pull in your clutch and as you're
slowing<00:01:54.409> down<00:01:54.580> you're<00:01:55.580> going<00:01:56.119> down<00:01:56.270> all<00:01:56.539> the

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
slowing down you're going down all the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:57.550 
slowing down you're going down all the
way<00:01:56.630> at<00:01:56.720> first<00:01:56.899> but<00:01:57.140> then<00:01:57.259> all<00:01:57.409> of<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.530> sudden

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
way at first but then all of a sudden

if<00:02:02.720> you're<00:02:02.869> halfway<00:02:03.319> through<00:02:03.500> don't<00:02:04.460> shift

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
if you're halfway through don't shift

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.160 
if you're halfway through don't shift
you<00:02:04.759> don't<00:02:04.940> know<00:02:05.000> what<00:02:05.149> gear<00:02:05.330> you're<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:05.539> so

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
you don't know what gear you're in so

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.199 
you don't know what gear you're in so
you<00:02:06.259> could<00:02:06.380> have<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.590> come<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> stop<00:02:07.220> or<00:02:07.789> find

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
you could have to come to a stop or find

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.550 
you could have to come to a stop or find
the<00:02:08.360> gear<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.780> hope<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.049> pick<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> right

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
the gear and hope you pick the right

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.350 
the gear and hope you pick the right
gear<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:10.039> then<00:02:10.190> you've<00:02:10.700> got<00:02:11.209> basically

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
gear and then you've got basically

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.199 
gear and then you've got basically
million<00:02:12.140> cars<00:02:12.350> behind<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.209> you're

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
million cars behind you and you're

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.920 
million cars behind you and you're
holding<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.540> traffic<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.540> you're<00:02:17.720> down

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
holding a traffic so so if you're down

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.100 
holding a traffic so so if you're down
shifting<00:02:18.760> or<00:02:19.760> slowly<00:02:20.090> using<00:02:20.480> engine<00:02:20.870> braking

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
shifting or slowly using engine braking

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.310 
shifting or slowly using engine braking
you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.120> light<00:02:23.329> turns<00:02:23.630> green<00:02:23.750> you'll

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
you can and the light turns green you'll

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.720 
you can and the light turns green you'll
know<00:02:24.470> what<00:02:24.650> gear<00:02:24.769> you're<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.610> can

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
know what gear you're in and you can

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.710 
know what gear you're in and you can
just<00:02:25.910> go<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.820> made<00:02:29.030> any<00:02:29.060> sense<00:02:29.420> at<00:02:29.630> all

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
just go so if that made any sense at all

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.460 
just go so if that made any sense at all

injured<00:02:38.239> wood<00:02:38.540> when<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.470> engine<00:02:39.799> brake

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
injured wood when you engine brake

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.530 
injured wood when you engine brake
special<00:02:40.459> especially<00:02:41.030> when<00:02:41.150> you're<00:02:41.269> warming

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
special especially when you're warming

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.680 
special especially when you're warming
uh<00:02:41.600> when<00:02:42.350> you're<00:02:42.470> braking<00:02:42.739> in<00:02:42.859> your<00:02:42.980> bike

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
uh when you're braking in your bike

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.690 
uh when you're braking in your bike
engine<00:02:44.690> braking<00:02:44.900> really<00:02:45.290> helps<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.220> we're

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
engine braking really helps so we're

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.160 
engine braking really helps so we're
first<00:02:46.880> gear<00:02:47.230> go<00:02:48.230> in<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.380> second<00:02:48.769> gear

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
fourth gear and see I didn't have enough

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.290 
fourth gear and see I didn't have enough

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
time to engine right here which most of

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.940 
time to engine right here which most of
the<00:03:05.360> time<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.540> don't<00:03:05.870> because<00:03:06.349> I'm<00:03:06.500> driving

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
the time I don't because I'm driving

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.550 
the time I don't because I'm driving
like<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.280> maniac<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.540> pulled<00:03:09.319> in<00:03:09.440> my

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
like a maniac and so I pulled in my

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.150 
like a maniac and so I pulled in my
clutch

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
clutch

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.130

I<00:03:10.190> applied<00:03:10.910> both<00:03:11.180> brakes<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.750> front<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.080> back

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
I applied both brakes the front and back

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.320 
I applied both brakes the front and back
brake<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.220> came<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.580> stop<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.000> I<00:03:14.060> clicked

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
brake and I came to a stop and I clicked

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.350 
brake and I came to a stop and I clicked
all<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.660> way<00:03:14.750> down<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.200> first<00:03:15.380> gear

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
all the way down the first gear

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.520 
all the way down the first gear
and<00:03:19.180> in<00:03:20.180> most<00:03:20.420> cases<00:03:20.750> this<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.260> what<00:03:21.380> you're

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
and in most cases this is what you're

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.160 
and in most cases this is what you're
going<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.739> do<00:03:21.860> because<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:23.630> know<00:03:23.690> unless

completely know really well and you can

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.920 
completely know really well and you can
anticipate<00:03:28.340> you're<00:03:29.299> going<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.510> need<00:03:29.629> to<00:03:29.720> slow
