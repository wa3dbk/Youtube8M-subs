00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
up this signal as symbols by shooting

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.150 
up this signal as symbols by shooting
them<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.209> certain<00:02:12.420> order

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160

this<00:02:52.400> one<00:02:52.670> will<00:02:52.940> turn<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.140> will<00:02:54.290> go

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
this one will turn it out and it will go

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.240 
this one will turn it out and it will go
in<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.370> smoke<00:02:55.910> right<00:02:56.420> back<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.810> your<00:02:57.160> when<00:02:58.160> you

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
in the smoke right back in your when you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.280 
in the smoke right back in your when you
move<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.730> next<00:02:58.880> step<00:02:59.300> then<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.930> spin

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
move on to the next step then you spin

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.690 
move on to the next step then you spin
the<00:03:00.410> disc<00:03:00.530> we've<00:03:00.830> all<00:03:00.980> done<00:03:01.160> this<00:03:01.280> before

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the disc we've all done this before

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.780 
the disc we've all done this before
spin<00:03:02.270> walls<00:03:02.480> they're<00:03:02.840> all<00:03:02.960> yellow<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.790> line

spin walls they're all yellow and line

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.570 
spin walls they're all yellow and line
up<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.120> disk<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:06.920> can<00:03:07.160> get<00:03:07.400> this

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
up the disk so that you can get this

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.070 
up the disk so that you can get this
next<00:03:07.850> part<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.150> ultimen<00:03:08.420> staff<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:08.900> very

don't had jobs really quick I can catch

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.580 
don't had jobs really quick I can catch
it<00:03:51.290> it's<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.820> seems<00:03:53.480> like<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.020> normal<00:03:54.380> shot

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590

but when you charge it up I didn't
realize<00:03:59.480> this<00:03:59.600> first<00:03:59.930> I<00:04:00.080> thought<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.350> was<00:04:00.440> just

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
realize this first I thought it was just

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.310 
realize this first I thought it was just
a<00:04:00.680> thunder<00:04:00.980> gun<00:04:01.160> use<00:04:01.550> all<00:04:01.850> six<00:04:02.120> shots<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:02.750> it

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
a thunder gun use all six shots and it

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.280 
a thunder gun use all six shots and it
shoots<00:04:03.830> out<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.100> tornado<00:04:04.790> like<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.900> not<00:04:06.110> very

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
shoots out a tornado like it's not very

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.949 
shoots out a tornado like it's not very
say<00:04:06.530> much<00:04:06.770> right<00:04:07.220> now<00:04:07.250> but<00:04:07.850> it<00:04:08.030> sucks<00:04:08.480> them<00:04:08.750> in

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
say much right now but it sucks them in

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.320 
say much right now but it sucks them in
and<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.590> kills<00:04:09.950> them<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:10.820> can<00:04:10.940> see<00:04:11.090> here<00:04:11.240> on

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
and it kills them so you can see here on

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.699 
and it kills them so you can see here on
my<00:04:11.360> second<00:04:11.900> shot<00:04:12.080> you<00:04:12.200> able<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.440> see<00:04:12.590> the

my second shot you able to see the

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.830 
my second shot you able to see the
tornado<00:04:12.980> go<00:04:13.640> up<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.000> background<00:04:14.390> look<00:04:14.690> at

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
tornado go up in the background look at

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.080 
tornado go up in the background look at
that<00:04:15.050> thing<00:04:15.410> probably<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.340> most<00:04:16.520> power<00:04:16.730> you

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
that thing probably the most power you

that thing probably the most power you
know<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.930> eye<00:04:18.440> staff<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.950> very<00:04:19.010> similar<00:04:19.520> but<00:04:19.730> I

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
know the eye staff is very similar but I

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.219 
know the eye staff is very similar but I
like<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:20.270> let<00:04:20.750> me<00:04:20.780> know<00:04:20.840> what<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.109> guys
