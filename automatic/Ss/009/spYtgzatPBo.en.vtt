00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.670 
I already unlocked all my skills so
basically<00:03:00.400> what<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.700> do<00:03:00.880> is<00:03:01.090> try<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.080> kill

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
basically what you do is try to kill

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.730 
basically what you do is try to kill
every<00:03:03.430> person<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.910> see<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.120> your<00:03:04.360> way<00:03:04.740> because

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
every person you see in your way because

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.020 
every person you see in your way because
if<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:05.980> don't<00:03:06.130> they're<00:03:06.459> going<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.640> kill<00:03:06.820> you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
if you don't they're going to kill you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:16.280 
if you don't they're going to kill you
and<00:03:08.790> basically<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.330> move<00:03:10.540> with<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:10.959> oh<00:03:15.180> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
and basically you move with this oh and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.390 
and basically you move with this oh and
as<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.500> can<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:17.650> that's<00:03:17.920> my<00:03:18.040> rank<00:03:18.250> right

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
as you can see that's my rank right

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.449 
as you can see that's my rank right
there<00:03:18.610> brinca<00:03:19.239> wha<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:23.100> there's<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.160> lot<00:03:24.430> of

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
there brinca wha and so there's a lot of

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.729 
there brinca wha and so there's a lot of
hackers<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.239> this<00:03:25.360> game<00:03:25.600> guys<00:03:25.810> there<00:03:26.440> are

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
hackers in this game guys there are

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.620 
hackers in this game guys there are
people<00:03:27.130> who<00:03:27.340> fast<00:03:28.000> attack<00:03:28.270> which<00:03:28.480> is

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
people who fast attack which is

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.440 
people who fast attack which is
basically<00:03:29.020> run<00:03:29.320> faster<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:29.920> they<00:03:29.950> could<00:03:30.450> get

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
basically run faster so they could get

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.040 
basically run faster so they could get
the<00:03:31.570> flags<00:03:31.840> faster<00:03:32.380> or<00:03:32.560> just<00:03:32.920> kill<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.220> faster

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
the flags faster or just kill you faster

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.150 
the flags faster or just kill you faster
there's<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.110> lot<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.350> hackers<00:03:35.739> in<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:35.980> game

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
that could go between walls when you see

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.530 
that could go between walls when you see
them<00:03:37.989> but<00:03:38.709> other<00:03:39.010> than<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.280> game<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.239> just
