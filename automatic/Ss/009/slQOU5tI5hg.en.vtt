care<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.479> suture<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:53.930> completely

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
care of the suture is completely

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.090 
care of the suture is completely
approximated<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.170> should<00:01:57.350> be<00:01:57.530> this

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
approximated of that should be this

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.859 
approximated of that should be this
about<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.640> width<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:59.210> pen<00:01:59.479> if<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.690> took<00:01:59.810> a

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
about the width of a pen if you took a

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.240 
about the width of a pen if you took a
