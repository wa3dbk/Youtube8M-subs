an area that I want to fade and it will

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.420 
an area that I want to fade and it will
give<00:00:45.420> basically<00:00:46.420> remove<00:00:47.410> some<00:00:47.770> of<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.070> denim

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
going to be experienced these processes

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.259 
going to be experienced these processes
a<00:00:53.469> little<00:00:53.800> differently<00:00:54.160> this<00:00:54.850> one<00:00:55.059> works

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
a little differently this one works

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.069 
a little differently this one works
really<00:00:55.390> well<00:00:55.719> for<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:57.340> any<00:00:57.660> fading<00:00:58.660> you

them<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:03.250> you're<00:01:03.399> trying<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.760> accomplish<00:01:04.089> is

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
them what you're trying to accomplish is

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.359 
them what you're trying to accomplish is
the<00:01:04.570> look<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.930> washing<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.590> drying<00:01:05.860> jeans

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
over and over and over again so that's

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.460 
over and over and over again so that's
another<00:01:09.939> way<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.150> just<00:01:10.479> do<00:01:10.630> it's<00:01:10.780> ugly<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.200> wash

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
another way to just do it's ugly is wash

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.420 
another way to just do it's ugly is wash
them<00:01:12.659> pretty<00:01:13.659> often<00:01:13.900> but<00:01:14.619> this<00:01:14.920> as<00:01:15.159> you<00:01:15.280> can

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
them pretty often but this as you can

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.520 
them pretty often but this as you can
see<00:01:15.610> is<00:01:15.729> lightening<00:01:16.150> up<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.299> area<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.500> you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
see is lightening up the area and you

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.370 
see is lightening up the area and you
can<00:01:18.189> get<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.400> larger<00:01:18.880> kind<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.570> area<00:01:20.020> if<00:01:20.200> you

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
can get a larger kind of area if you

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.289 
can get a larger kind of area if you
want<00:01:20.560> fading<00:01:21.159> in<00:01:21.280> smaller<00:01:21.670> areas<00:01:21.759> like<00:01:22.270> a

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
want fading in smaller areas like a

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.420 
want fading in smaller areas like a
longest<00:01:22.689> theme<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:23.530> can<00:01:23.650> scrape<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.189> with<00:01:24.250> a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
longest theme you can scrape it with a

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.480 
longest theme you can scrape it with a
pocketknife<00:01:25.390> or<00:01:25.750> an<00:01:25.840> exacto<00:01:26.290> knife<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.799> expose

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
pocketknife or an exacto knife to expose

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.700 
pocketknife or an exacto knife to expose
some<00:01:27.759> of<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.909> white<00:01:28.240> under<00:01:28.720> threads<00:01:29.079> which

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
some of the white under threads which

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.780 
some of the white under threads which
will<00:01:30.490> have<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.210> fading<00:01:33.090> effect<00:01:35.790> ultimately

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
will have a fading effect ultimately

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.929 
will have a fading effect ultimately
once<00:01:37.030> it's<00:01:37.210> washed<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.600> dried<00:01:37.780> or<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.640> along

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
once it's washed and dried or just along

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.649 
once it's washed and dried or just along
a<00:01:39.970> small<00:01:40.299> area<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.720> create<00:01:41.049> kind<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.070> small

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
a small area to create kind of a small

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.090 
a small area to create kind of a small
faded<00:01:43.659> spot<00:01:43.920> sorry<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:47.049> like<00:01:47.380> some<00:01:47.710> scratch

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
faded spot sorry or like some scratch

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.219 
faded spot sorry or like some scratch
marks<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.880> depending<00:01:51.880> on<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.420> denim<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.990> the

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
marks and depending on the denim and the

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.319 
marks and depending on the denim and the
way<00:01:53.409> that<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.799> move<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.040> blade<00:01:54.399> it<00:01:54.759> will<00:01:55.119> have

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
way that you move the blade it will have

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.510 
way that you move the blade it will have
different<00:01:55.630> effects<00:01:56.049> done<00:01:56.770> vertically<00:01:57.219> it

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
different effects done vertically it

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.490 
different effects done vertically it
will<00:01:57.640> create<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.969> small<00:01:58.299> faded<00:01:58.840> spot<00:01:59.020> done

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
will create a small faded spot done

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.190 
will create a small faded spot done
horizontally<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.969> will<00:02:01.149> expose<00:02:01.509> these<00:02:01.869> cross

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
horizontally it will expose these cross

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.779 
horizontally it will expose these cross
threads<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:02.829> have<00:02:03.039> kind<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.399> snagged

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
threads and have kind of a snagged

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.070 
threads and have kind of a snagged
effect<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:05.469> again<00:02:06.280> once<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.789> is<00:02:06.969> done<00:02:07.299> wash

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
effect but again once this is done wash

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.860 
effect but again once this is done wash
