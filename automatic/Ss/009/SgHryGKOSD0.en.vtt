neatly in separate piles of equal

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.330 
neatly in separate piles of equal

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.740 

another<00:00:38.160> way<00:00:38.370> people<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> same<00:00:39.210> thing<00:00:39.510> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
another way people do the same thing is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.709 
another way people do the same thing is
they<00:00:40.260> bring<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> full<00:00:40.890> stack<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.629> cut<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
they bring out a full stack and cut it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.290 
they bring out a full stack and cut it
off<00:00:42.840> into<00:00:43.079> fives<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.850> they<00:00:44.850> stack<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> out

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
off into fives and they stack it out

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.660 
off into fives and they stack it out
neatly<00:00:45.570> or<00:00:45.899> sometimes<00:00:46.500> after<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:46.980> last<00:00:47.280> cut

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
neatly or sometimes after the last cut

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.240 
neatly or sometimes after the last cut
they'll<00:00:48.539> Fleury<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.350> last<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:50.010> so

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
they'll Fleury the last one out so

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.619 
they'll Fleury the last one out so
everybody<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.670> see<00:00:50.910> how<00:00:51.059> much<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.510> each

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
everybody can see how much was in each

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.650 
everybody can see how much was in each
stack<00:00:52.399> standard<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.640> stacks<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.149> five<00:00:54.390> but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
stack standard is stacks of five but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.150

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.749 
say they're going to bet six white chips
and<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.040> let<00:01:50.610> them<00:01:50.790> tip<00:01:51.030> over<00:01:51.420> as

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
and they just let them tip over as

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.760 
and they just let them tip over as
opposed<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.119> me<00:01:54.299> extremely<00:01:54.630> messy<00:01:55.170> messy

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
and not caring the reason this matters

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.840 
and not caring the reason this matters
is<00:01:58.290> because<00:01:58.649> how<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:58.979> put<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.430> chips<00:01:59.640> into

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
is because how you put your chips into

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.450 
is because how you put your chips into
the<00:01:59.939> pot<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.869> give<00:02:01.020> away<00:02:01.140> information<00:02:01.979> about
