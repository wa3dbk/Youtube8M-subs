okay hey guys so I'm gonna turn off the
light<00:00:04.850> okay<00:00:05.850> so<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:07.069> already<00:00:08.069> used<00:00:08.340> my<00:00:08.490> key<00:00:09.120> tap

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
light okay so I already used my key tap

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.589 
light okay so I already used my key tap
puller<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.920> put<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.250> WASD<00:00:12.150> keys

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
puller and put in the WASD keys

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.080 
puller and put in the WASD keys
so<00:00:13.730> here<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.089> lighting<00:00:15.540> functions<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:17.060> so<00:00:18.060> I

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so here the lighting functions and so I

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.720 
so here the lighting functions and so I
think<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.630> normal<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.369> then<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.580> can

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
think this is normal and then you can

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.970 
think this is normal and then you can
change<00:00:21.420> your<00:00:21.570> brightness<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
change your brightness I have it on the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.290 
change your brightness I have it on the
lowest<00:00:23.100> setting<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.760> like<00:00:24.000> lowest

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
lowest setting because I like lowest

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.570 
lowest setting because I like lowest
setting<00:00:24.800> highest<00:00:25.800> setting<00:00:26.010> usually<00:00:26.130> gives<00:00:26.460> me

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
setting highest setting usually gives me

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:37.250 
setting highest setting usually gives me
a<00:00:26.640> headache<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:34.700> next<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.200> this<00:00:37.200> one

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
a headache and next one is this one

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.240 
a headache and next one is this one
which<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.980> breathing<00:00:38.579> mode<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.829> change

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
which is a breathing mode you can change

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:51.380 
which is a breathing mode you can change
the<00:00:41.399> brightness<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:43.250> change<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> speed<00:00:50.390> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the brightness and change the speed so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
the brightness and change the speed so
this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.050> slowing<00:00:52.379> slowest<00:00:53.340> setting

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
this is all it's slowing slowest setting

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.549 
this is all it's slowing slowest setting
and<00:00:54.559> then<00:00:57.890> this<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.079> like<00:01:01.079> marquee

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and then this is was it like marquee

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:16.800 
and then this is was it like marquee
mode<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.400> change<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> speed

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.300 

and<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.170> on<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.350> slow<00:01:18.619> setting<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.579> then

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
and this is on a slow setting and then

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.660 
and this is on a slow setting and then
this<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.490> snake<00:01:22.759> mode<00:01:22.970> because<00:01:24.250> ducky<00:01:25.250> shine<00:01:25.280> 3

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
this is snake mode because ducky shine 3

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.859 
this is snake mode because ducky shine 3
is<00:01:25.759> year<00:01:25.939> of<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.119> snake<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:29.000> I'm<00:01:29.210> gonna<00:01:29.390> change

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
is year of the snake so I'm gonna change

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:38.100 
is year of the snake so I'm gonna change
speed

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.270 

and<00:01:38.320> then<00:01:38.890> next<00:01:39.310> setting<00:01:39.760> is<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.190> this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
and then next setting is what is this

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.630 
and then next setting is what is this
one<00:01:42.630> okay<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:43.840> this<00:01:44.350> one<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.800> press<00:01:45.490> the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
one okay so this one you press the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:57.030 
one okay so this one you press the
button<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:48.060> LED<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.240> off

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.300 

and<00:01:57.130> then<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.970> next<00:01:58.180> setting<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.810> oops<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
and then the next setting is oops this

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.380 
and then the next setting is oops this
one<00:02:04.590> which<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.620> my<00:02:05.890> favorite<00:02:06.340> ripple<00:02:06.700> mode<00:02:06.880> but

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
one which is my favorite ripple mode but

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.600 
one which is my favorite ripple mode but
I<00:02:07.420> don't<00:02:07.720> like<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:08.020> when<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:08.320> on<00:02:08.610> fastest

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
I don't like it when it's on fastest

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.850 
I don't like it when it's on fastest
speed<00:02:09.820> so<00:02:10.330> I'm<00:02:10.390> gonna<00:02:10.660> lower<00:02:10.960> it<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.680> this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
speed so I'm gonna lower it so is this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.310 
speed so I'm gonna lower it so is this
one<00:02:18.100> where<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.340> press<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.360> key<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.110> whole

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
one where you press a key and the whole

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.090 
one where you press a key and the whole
line<00:02:20.560> lets<00:02:20.860> up<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.440> except<00:02:23.440> for<00:02:23.470> that

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
line lets up like that except for that

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:47.850 
line lets up like that except for that
one<00:02:24.370> key<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.760> then<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.960> just<00:02:41.140> off<00:02:46.860> and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
one key and then this is just off and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.600 
one key and then this is just off and
then<00:02:48.040> we<00:02:48.130> go<00:02:48.280> back<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.580> on<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:54.100> switches<00:02:54.490> I
