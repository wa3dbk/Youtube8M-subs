00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
ending it's like the first one where the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.670 
ending it's like the first one where the
kid<00:01:32.490> actually<00:01:32.850> dies<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.470> all

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
kind of were guessing that it was the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
kind of were guessing that it was the
bite<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> 87<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.229> there's<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:37.920> many

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
things that were going against it and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.789 
things that were going against it and
then<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> final<00:01:40.590> thing

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
then this is just like the final thing

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
then this is just like the final thing
that<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.159> kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> shows<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
that just kind of shows this is not the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.210 
that just kind of shows this is not the
bite<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> 87<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> whole<00:01:43.860> nother<00:01:43.979> bite

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bite of 87 this is a whole nother bite

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.039 
bite of 87 this is a whole nother bite
now<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.970> still<00:01:45.360> leaves<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.570> question<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
now that still leaves the question as to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.660 
now that still leaves the question as to
what<00:01:46.439> happened<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.860> bite<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> 87<00:01:47.189> who

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
what happened with the bite of 87 who

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.130 
what happened with the bite of 87 who
caused<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.180> bite<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.390> 87<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.869> still<00:01:49.020> don't

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
caused the bite of 87 we still don't

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
caused the bite of 87 we still don't
know<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.320> yet<00:01:49.500> maybe<00:01:50.310> we'll<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.790> something

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
know that yet maybe we'll know something

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
know that yet maybe we'll know something
about<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> DLC<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> don't<00:01:52.710> know

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
about that in the DLC I don't know

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
about that in the DLC I don't know
judging<00:01:53.759> off<00:01:53.880> what<00:01:54.060> Scott<00:01:54.270> said<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.780> don't

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
judging off what Scott said I don't

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.100
