00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
what I did what spawn was I didn't quite

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.980 
what I did what spawn was I didn't quite
change<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.160> drawing<00:01:24.550> style<00:01:24.970> nearly<00:01:25.870> as

dramatically<00:01:26.440> as<00:01:26.650> he<00:01:26.830> did<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:27.760> might

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
dramatically as he did and that might

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.250 
dramatically as he did and that might
have<00:01:28.120> been<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.390> one<00:01:28.540> thing<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.140> know

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
then we weren't quite prepared you got

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.360 
then we weren't quite prepared you got
to<00:01:30.940> sort<00:01:31.120> of<00:01:31.210> ease<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.720> American<00:01:32.470> public<00:01:32.830> into

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
cool might been just a little bit ahead

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.100 
cool might been just a little bit ahead
of<00:01:48.130> his<00:01:48.250> time<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.850> know<00:01:49.000> if<00:01:49.210> if<00:01:49.539> he<00:01:49.720> was<00:01:49.869> doing

had<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> couple<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.789> ideas<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.390> thought<00:02:10.599> about

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
had a couple of ideas I thought about

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.780 
had a couple of ideas I thought about
and<00:02:11.200> pitched<00:02:11.380> them<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.890> came<00:02:12.130> up<00:02:12.250> with<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.489> idea

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and pitched them I came up with the idea

actual story I think I was lucky because

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.900 
actual story I think I was lucky because
I<00:02:42.700> came<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:43.060> late<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.630> process<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:45.060> I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
I came in late in the process and I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.990 
I came in late in the process and I
probably<00:02:47.630> they<00:02:47.870> had<00:02:48.080> achieved<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:49.160> lot<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.370> what

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
probably they had achieved a lot of what

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.910 
probably they had achieved a lot of what
they<00:02:50.360> were<00:02:50.420> after<00:02:50.900> with<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.590> earlier

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
they were after with the earlier

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.010 
they were after with the earlier
directors<00:02:52.490> so<00:02:52.880> coming<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:53.480> late<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.690> was<00:02:53.930> able

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
directors so coming in late I was able

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.570 
directors so coming in late I was able
to<00:02:54.140> pretty<00:02:54.650> much<00:02:54.770> do<00:02:55.069> what<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.220> wanted

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.730 

the<00:02:58.580> disadvantage<00:02:59.240> I<00:02:59.360> had<00:02:59.569> was<00:02:59.840> that<00:02:59.870> I<00:03:00.380> didn't

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
the disadvantage I had was that I didn't

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.310 
the disadvantage I had was that I didn't
have<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.890> lot<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.069> time<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:02.660> main<00:03:02.870> challenge

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
have a lot of time the main challenge

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.250 
have a lot of time the main challenge
was<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.680> creating<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.310> robot<00:03:04.810> subject<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.930> robot

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
was in creating a robot subject a robot

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.850 
was in creating a robot subject a robot
character<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:07.760> came<00:03:08.750> across<00:03:08.990> as<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.350> living

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
character that came across as a living

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.690 
character that came across as a living
thinking<00:03:10.430> feeling<00:03:12.040> consciousness<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.430> human

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
thinking feeling consciousness the human

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.979 
thinking feeling consciousness the human
characters<00:03:14.060> they're<00:03:14.239> pretty<00:03:14.570> much<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.840> way<00:03:14.959> I

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
characters they're pretty much the way I

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.559 
characters they're pretty much the way I
always<00:03:15.680> draw<00:03:15.890> humans<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:17.000> was<00:03:17.180> easy

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
always draw humans so that was easy

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.070 
always draw humans so that was easy
but<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.050> robot<00:03:18.730> had<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.330> right<00:03:20.540> look

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
but the robot had to have the right look

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.890 
but the robot had to have the right look
of<00:03:21.350> menace<00:03:21.830> but<00:03:22.489> at<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.730> same<00:03:22.910> time<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.510> look<00:03:23.750> of

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
of menace but at the same time a look of

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.130 
of menace but at the same time a look of
innocence<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:25.550> was<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:26.150> very<00:03:26.480> strict<00:03:26.840> rule

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
innocence and it was a very strict rule

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.530 
innocence and it was a very strict rule
that<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.530> could<00:03:27.739> not<00:03:27.950> have<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.519> human<00:03:28.910> face<00:03:29.150> or

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
that it could not have a human face or

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.900 
that it could not have a human face or
have<00:03:29.720> human<00:03:30.110> anatomy<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:30.769> literally<00:03:31.370> spent

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
have human anatomy I literally spent

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.479 
have human anatomy I literally spent
months<00:03:32.239> designing<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.530> redesigning<00:03:33.650> and

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
months designing and redesigning and

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.339 
months designing and redesigning and
revising<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.360> robot<00:03:35.690> design

it's lost its fascination it was such a
relief<00:03:55.159> to<00:03:55.549> use<00:03:56.109> 3d<00:03:57.109> elements<00:03:57.560> because<00:03:57.950> I'm

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
relief to use 3d elements because I'm

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.190 
relief to use 3d elements because I'm
used<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.579> doing<00:03:58.670> everything<00:03:59.120> by<00:03:59.599> hand<00:03:59.870> and

think probably of the audience and is
certainly<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:29.479> most<00:04:29.720> psychologically

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490

on<00:04:35.599> a<00:04:35.660> trip

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.350 

not<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.949> psychedelic<00:04:40.550> aspects<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.210> it

not just the psychedelic aspects of it

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.180 
not just the psychedelic aspects of it
it's<00:04:41.539> something<00:04:41.990> that's<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.620> kind<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:42.949> thing

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
it's something that's the kind of thing

it's something that's the kind of thing
that<00:04:43.340> Peter<00:04:43.580> feels<00:04:44.509> and<00:04:44.810> thinks<00:04:44.990> about<00:04:45.229> which

that Peter feels and thinks about which

that Peter feels and thinks about which
is<00:04:45.919> let's<00:04:46.639> look<00:04:46.849> at<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.120> from<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.509> totally

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
is let's look at it from a totally

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.290 
is let's look at it from a totally
different<00:04:48.620> point<00:04:48.830> of<00:04:49.009> view<00:04:49.250> every<00:04:49.940> night<00:04:50.120> when

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
different point of view every night when

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.899 
different point of view every night when
we<00:04:50.330> dream<00:04:50.690> we<00:04:50.990> immerse<00:04:51.740> ourselves<00:04:51.889> into<00:04:52.639> an

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
we dream we immerse ourselves into an

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.670 
we dream we immerse ourselves into an
artificial<00:04:53.300> world<00:04:53.599> of<00:04:53.840> our<00:04:53.960> own<00:04:54.110> making<00:04:54.320> and

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
artificial world of our own making and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.649 
artificial world of our own making and
they're<00:04:55.190> very<00:04:55.340> convincing<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.360> thought

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
they're very convincing so I thought

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.010 
they're very convincing so I thought
well<00:04:57.409> what<00:04:57.860> if<00:04:57.889> a<00:04:58.310> machine<00:04:58.909> could<00:04:59.599> be<00:04:59.750> put

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
well what if a machine could be put

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.950 
well what if a machine could be put
inside<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:00.710> human<00:05:01.039> dream<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.639> felt<00:05:02.599> completely

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
inside a human dream I felt completely

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.279 
inside a human dream I felt completely
free<00:05:03.259> to<00:05:03.440> make<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:04.310> know<00:05:04.400> as<00:05:04.610> as<00:05:05.110> wild<00:05:06.110> and

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
free to make it you know as as wild and

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.659 
free to make it you know as as wild and
colorful<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.389> unpredictable<00:05:08.389> as<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.110> dream

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
colorful and unpredictable as a dream

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.629 
colorful and unpredictable as a dream
the<00:05:10.669> piece<00:05:10.880> is<00:05:11.060> really<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.419> anti<00:05:11.780> matrix<00:05:12.289> and

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
the piece is really the anti matrix and

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.430 
the piece is really the anti matrix and
matriculated<00:05:13.639> there<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.120> real<00:05:14.270> world<00:05:14.539> but

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
matriculated there is the real world but

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.830 
matriculated there is the real world but
then<00:05:15.620> there<00:05:15.979> is<00:05:16.009> the<00:05:16.430> world<00:05:16.639> inside<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.539> human

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
then there is the world inside the human

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.950 
then there is the world inside the human
mind<00:05:18.080> which<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.710> completely<00:05:19.960> internally

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
mind which is completely internally

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.980 
mind which is completely internally
interpreted<00:05:21.650> world<00:05:22.099> so<00:05:22.699> it's<00:05:23.599> going<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.900> be<00:05:23.960> a

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
interpreted world so it's going to be a

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.899 
interpreted world so it's going to be a
gigantic<00:05:24.440> challenge<00:05:25.009> to<00:05:25.280> let<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.759> audience

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
gigantic challenge to let the audience

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.180 
gigantic challenge to let the audience
in<00:05:26.389> on<00:05:26.750> what<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.229> humans<00:05:27.620> are<00:05:27.830> letting<00:05:28.009> the

and for the imagine sequences I

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.499 
and for the imagine sequences I
approached<00:05:47.169> it<00:05:47.410> with<00:05:47.620> a<00:05:47.680> very<00:05:48.509> kaleidoscopic

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
approached it with a very kaleidoscopic

recording<00:06:11.860> all<00:06:12.340> of<00:06:12.490> these<00:06:12.610> sounds<00:06:12.789> build<00:06:13.720> all

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
recording all of these sounds build all

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.830 
recording all of these sounds build all
these<00:06:14.080> contraptions<00:06:14.550> and<00:06:15.550> then<00:06:15.669> they're

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
these contraptions and then they're

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.749 
these contraptions and then they're
squeaking<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:17.039> pushing<00:06:18.039> and<00:06:18.190> swinging<00:06:18.520> and

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
squeaking and pushing and swinging and

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.070 
squeaking and pushing and swinging and
turning<00:06:19.060> and<00:06:19.210> you<00:06:19.389> know<00:06:19.479> making<00:06:19.810> all<00:06:19.960> these

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
turning and you know making all these

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.510 
turning and you know making all these
crazy<00:06:20.740> sounds

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.240 

I<00:06:25.780> sort<00:06:26.780> of<00:06:26.840> see<00:06:27.050> the<00:06:27.259> robot<00:06:27.560> as<00:06:27.680> an<00:06:27.830> innocent

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
I sort of see the robot as an innocent

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.330 
I sort of see the robot as an innocent
and<00:06:28.460> in<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.240> end<00:06:29.389> my<00:06:29.599> hope<00:06:29.810> is<00:06:30.020> that<00:06:30.050> you<00:06:30.620> maybe

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
and in the end my hope is that you maybe

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.920 
and in the end my hope is that you maybe
start<00:06:31.789> to<00:06:31.849> feel<00:06:32.060> a<00:06:32.090> little<00:06:32.270> bit<00:06:32.449> of<00:06:32.569> empathy

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
start to feel a little bit of empathy

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.189 
start to feel a little bit of empathy
for<00:06:33.110> it

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.889
