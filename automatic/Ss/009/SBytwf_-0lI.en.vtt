00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.979
 and it seems that this segment of my channel 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.979
 he has been quite forgotten 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.349
 begins to be watered lived applauded to 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.170
 michael bay that has made us love this 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.599
 movie in 2007 and made us a target in 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.849
 2011 seemed like with every sequel that 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.529
 it came out in this movie this one was going for 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.840
 down and like I no longer had salvation 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.780
 everyone came at a moment to 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.360
 believe that this movie was not for more 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.460
 but four neighborhoods pass and this 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.200
 Transformers movie does not enter as 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.879
 a kind of happy bird for 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.860
 show us all that still 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.320
 has life that can still be 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.030
 successful that can still be super 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.920
 shrill and you can do super well in the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.379
 cinema and the truth is that it has achieved 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.719
 more you come back with transformers 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.640
 has made some amazing changes it seems 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.559
 that they realized they had 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.569
 to make some changes move chips 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.570
 necessary and the truth is that it has 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:06.729
 remained a movie to one characters to 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 an action to one all effects 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.600
 specials and all the things that from 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.729
 way the definitely surfer soybean 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.480
 1 and the protagonist was the most 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.430
 hallucinatory 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.690
 This idiot forgot that I need 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.670
 to heaven when he found out that if 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.720
 we talked would not be the protagonist that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 I wanted the copy not enough transformers not 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.660
 I bet when you find out that 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.250
 come would offer the new batman too 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.380
 of complaining is like brand and there when 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.210
 people drawing conclusions from before 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.740
 to see a movie and the end that happened 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.740
 by getting the voice can this guy has 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.480
 literally gone crazy he pointed crazy 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.670
 renounced all movies 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.260
 blockbusters to all movies 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.330
 commercial wants to make movies 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.770
 independent we have lost it of 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.990
 we have truly lost it 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.700
 while megan fox is very 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.550
 misfortune is not just changed by 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.050
 Cuba are mutant turtles had to be 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.050
 treacherous woman 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.259
 yes yes logic 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.000
 bye 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.890
 but the pretty one of this movie of his 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.780
 known action factor more 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.459
 box office but this like not 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.409
 He imported a lot into production because 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.510
 I knew that to transform a franchise 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.950
 already entrenched in the market so it's not 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.629
 there would be many problems commented of the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.540
 protagonism were also in charge of 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.420
 that he was 40 years old for that too 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.340
 have more adult audience in the saga but 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.170
 Obvious that they also did a very good 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.709
 play since they put a daughter 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.269
 adolescent of 17 years obviously the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.579
 movie because real life is the girl 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.590
 is 19 years old and with this he maintained 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.930
 happy to all the cutlery of the world 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.599
 Nicholas is chosen to fill the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.250
 empty that leaves megan fox I think when 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.709
 we talk about hamas actresses we are not going to 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.750
 do here a versus of acting talent 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.239
 or something like that because if we're 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.099
 competing with someone obviously what 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.889
 what we are going to do is a versus 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.900
 sensuality and beauty and let me tell you 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.659
 Nicholas bears you've never lost 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.260
 to win mid this woman is 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:14.939
 super but that the mass of the universe and not 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.939
 I think it has competition 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.470
 but we also have to be honest 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.329
 This girl is beautiful is beautiful she can not 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.040
 make the sexual hottie that everyone 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.790
 I was waiting but he has an angel face 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.709
 and it's very, very beautiful and a character 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.810
 that has caught my attention is happy is 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.450
 this gringo that I really have been 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.639
 with each disk that is because it looks 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.379
 it turns out that this is the protagonist of 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.480
 the new series of silicon studies 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.700
 valley here we will see in this series 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.190
 super relaxed like crazy because they are 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.340
 seeing and the seventh character that this 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.409
 15 ok is the same as I know that this 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.689
 movie the truth is that I do not know parents 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.129
 I argued that so nice is or 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.659
 the less they changed the course 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.730
 they would have cut their hair since their 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.650
 characters looked alike but nothing like that is 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.959
 that this I think is the first 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.639
 attack from that figure the second factor 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.210
 from that movie to me I think it's 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.950
 pretty cliche to do it 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.440
 protagonist of the movie also be 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.020
 technology lover have a 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.090
 popular robotic and this is all 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.490
 what should not have changed him 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.920
 promised a more normal progression and 

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.500
 then make the robot over suits 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.210
 what they interact in ways 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.850
 different but he also had 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.770
 called robots things like that is how 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.170
 that there that I did not like so much 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.410
 that he thought he had a second 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.360
 to tap while has spent four 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.220
 years since the Chicago attacks and such 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.650
 it seems that now humanity no longer 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.690
 trust more in the autobots the government 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.270
 next to an ally this is a 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.400
 alien robots are hunting at 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.260
 all cars are good or bad 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.600
 apart there is also one enter the 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.270
 hydrological that you are creating prototypes 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.910
 of the best france and his whole band if 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.490
 realize that optimal provisional 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.560
 I just talked about robot prototypes 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.170
 I just talked about a robot alien 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.110
 that also has a whole army and 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.790
 we also have legendary robots 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.500
 that if you have seen the trailer they are 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.430
 the dinosaurs 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.490
 and more the government side the group 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.260
 technological that among them is 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.970
 fighting with common interests and this 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.160
 we also add all the drama that 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.070
 exists between father and daughters boyfriends 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.380
 mother-in-law in-laws all this stories 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.810
 they link together they make each 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.520
 character in each story have very 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.710
 good balance throughout the movie 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.290
 that space for everyone because the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.700
 movie lasts almost three hours so 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.830
 if he is going to go to the cinema 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.510
 make sure you pee first well to 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.760
 so that you will not miss a single 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.640
 minute of this movie and go to the cinema 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.620
 come back and comment and tell me what you 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.770
 it seemed this movie and see you soon 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.860
 in another without tangles in another movie 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.860
 bye
