00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.600 

so<00:00:01.530> in<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.740> tutorial<00:00:01.800> we'll<00:00:02.370> look<00:00:02.429> at<00:00:02.580> a

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
so in this tutorial we'll look at a

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.889 
so in this tutorial we'll look at a
couple<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:02.909> different<00:00:03.149> ways<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.600> creating

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
couple of different ways of creating

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.010 
couple of different ways of creating
basic<00:00:04.770> loops<00:00:05.060> and<00:00:06.060> both<00:00:06.210> ways<00:00:06.420> are<00:00:06.629> quite<00:00:06.839> easy

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
basic loops and both ways are quite easy

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.660 
basic loops and both ways are quite easy
one<00:00:07.350> way<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> little<00:00:08.069> bit<00:00:08.189> more<00:00:08.340> advanced

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
one way is a little bit more advanced

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.600 
one way is a little bit more advanced
than<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.179> other<00:00:09.330> but<00:00:09.570> not<00:00:09.750> too<00:00:09.900> difficult<00:00:10.610> so

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
than the other but not too difficult so

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.310 
than the other but not too difficult so
starting<00:00:12.000> from<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> default<00:00:12.780> session<00:00:13.230> of

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
starting from a default session of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.609 
starting from a default session of
Newton<00:00:13.700> well<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:14.940> change<00:00:15.470> some<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
Newton well first change some of the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.700 
Newton well first change some of the
initial<00:00:16.949> parameters<00:00:18.500> specifically<00:00:19.500> we'll

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
initial parameters specifically we'll

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.010 
initial parameters specifically we'll
change<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.130> speed<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.789> 29<00:00:21.210> meters<00:00:21.539> per<00:00:21.720> second

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
change the speed to 29 meters per second

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.920 
change the speed to 29 meters per second
which<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.560> about<00:00:23.160> 65<00:00:23.820> miles<00:00:24.269> an<00:00:24.449> hour<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
which is about 65 miles an hour and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.410 
which is about 65 miles an hour and
that's<00:00:25.710> about<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.070> speed<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:27.000> would<00:00:27.119> expect

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that's about the speed you would expect

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.710 
that's about the speed you would expect
at<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> beginning<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> looping<00:00:28.769> element

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
at the beginning of a looping element

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.939 
at the beginning of a looping element
and<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:30.900> we'll<00:00:31.140> change<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.800> Y<00:00:31.920> position

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
and then we'll change the Y position

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.060 
and then we'll change the Y position
from<00:00:32.610> 20<00:00:33.180> 25<00:00:33.540> meters<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.500> bring<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> track<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
from 20 25 meters just bring the track a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.959 
from 20 25 meters just bring the track a
little<00:00:35.160> bit<00:00:35.370> closer<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> ground<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:37.969> then

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
little bit closer to the ground and then

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
little bit closer to the ground and then
it<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.149> change<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> g-force<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.160> one

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it will change the g-force to what one

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.979 
it will change the g-force to what one
would<00:00:41.640> expect<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> beginning<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.809> loop

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
would expect at the beginning of a loop

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
would expect at the beginning of a loop
in<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.430> case<00:00:44.640> I'll<00:00:44.850> put<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.270> about<00:00:45.390> three<00:00:45.690> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
in this case I'll put in about three and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
in this case I'll put in about three and
a<00:00:45.840> half<00:00:45.870> G's<00:00:46.309> three-and-a-half<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.460> four<00:00:47.489> G's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a half G's three-and-a-half to four G's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.319 
a half G's three-and-a-half to four G's
is<00:00:48.059> usually<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> good<00:00:49.070> normal<00:00:50.070> force<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.520> start

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
is usually a good normal force to start

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.799 
is usually a good normal force to start
off<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> next<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.660> make<00:00:54.780> sure

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
off with so next you want to make sure

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
off with so next you want to make sure
that<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> orientation<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.370> changed<00:00:56.969> from<00:00:57.120> its

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that the orientation is changed from its

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
that the orientation is changed from its
default<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.930> Euler<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:59.640> quadrillions<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
default of Euler to quadrillions and you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.709 
default of Euler to quadrillions and you
want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> use<00:01:02.609> quaternions<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> pretty<00:01:03.660> much

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
want to use quaternions and pretty much

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.670 
want to use quaternions and pretty much
any<00:01:04.080> sort<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> looping<00:01:05.070> element<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.530> loop

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
any sort of looping element so the loop

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.700 
any sort of looping element so the loop
itself<00:01:08.040> will<00:01:08.250> consist<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.939> three<00:01:09.750> sections<00:01:10.290> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
itself will consist of three sections in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.179 
itself will consist of three sections in
the<00:01:10.939> first<00:01:11.939> section<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> end<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the first section I like to end with a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.270 
the first section I like to end with a
pitch<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:14.909> 30<00:01:15.210> degrees<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.560> adjust<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
pitch of about 30 degrees so adjust the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.230 
pitch of about 30 degrees so adjust the
length<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> first<00:01:18.180> section<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
length of the first section so that the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
length of the first section so that the
end<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.229> pitch<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.740> third<00:01:22.950> 30

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
end is about the pitch of a third 30

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.730 
end is about the pitch of a third 30
degrees<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.110> form<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.350> entrance

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
degrees and this will form the entrance

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.260 
degrees and this will form the entrance
of<00:01:25.890> our<00:01:25.950> loop<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:27.170> then<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.229> second<00:01:28.619> section

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
of our loop and then the second section

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.999 
of our loop and then the second section
will<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> body<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.470> loop<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.860> we'll

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
will be the body of the loop so we'll

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
will be the body of the loop so we'll
continue<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.000> length<00:01:33.240> adjust<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> link<00:01:34.290> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
continue the length adjust the link so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.870 
continue the length adjust the link so
that<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.710> loops<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.759> around<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> gain

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that it loops on around and now to gain

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.219 
that it loops on around and now to gain
a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.240> more<00:01:39.479> insight<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.049> what's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
a little bit more insight to what's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
a little bit more insight to what's
going<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.590> let<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.890> turn<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.090> visual<00:01:42.450> fins

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
going on let me turn on the visual fins

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.060 
going on let me turn on the visual fins
and<00:01:43.049> switch<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.770> normal<00:01:44.490> lateral<00:01:45.180> force<00:01:46.070> so

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and switch to normal lateral force so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.440 
and switch to normal lateral force so
what<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.369> shows<00:01:47.880> us<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:50.450> graphical

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
what this shows us is a graphical

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.850 
what this shows us is a graphical
representation<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> force<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.740> each

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
representation of the force in each

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.700 
representation of the force in each
point<00:01:53.310> along<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.700> track<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.320> case<00:01:55.530> we

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
point along the track so in this case we

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.590 
point along the track so in this case we
haven't<00:01:55.950> changed<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.790> normal<00:01:57.090> force<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:57.479> all

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
haven't changed the normal force at all

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
haven't changed the normal force at all
it's<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.049> three<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.380> half<00:01:58.439> cheese<00:01:58.799> along<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it's a three and a half cheese along the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.240 
it's a three and a half cheese along the
entire<00:02:00.060> length<00:02:00.530> that's<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.680> very<00:02:01.799> realistic

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
entire length that's not very realistic

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.480 
entire length that's not very realistic
we<00:02:02.579> want<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.509> normal<00:02:03.689> force<00:02:04.490> smaller

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
we want to make the normal force smaller

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.510 
we want to make the normal force smaller
at<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.090> apex<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.810> loop<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:08.190> get

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
at the apex of the loop and then get

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.760 
at the apex of the loop and then get
larger<00:02:08.879> again<00:02:09.170> toward<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> bottom<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
larger again toward the bottom of the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.040 
larger again toward the bottom of the
loop<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:12.300> easiest<00:02:12.599> way<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> achieving

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
loop and the easiest way of achieving

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.880 
loop and the easiest way of achieving
this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.000 
this
is<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.490> bump<00:02:14.670> transition<00:02:15.740> so<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.830> one<00:02:16.980> I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
is with the bump transition so the one I

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.760 
is with the bump transition so the one I
normally<00:02:17.430> use<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> we'll

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
normally use is this one and so we'll

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.500 
normally use is this one and so we'll
just<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.340> now<00:02:24.140> 2<00:02:25.140> minus<00:02:25.560> 3<00:02:26.190> g's<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:30.060> like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
just this now 2 minus 3 g's and like

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.530 
just this now 2 minus 3 g's and like
this<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.020> then<00:02:31.740> readjust<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.820> length<00:02:33.060> so

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
this and then readjust the length so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.370 
this and then readjust the length so
that<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.640> end<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.660> section<00:02:37.110> is

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
that the end of the of this section is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.670 
that the end of the of this section is
it<00:02:38.280> about<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.640> same<00:02:38.670> y<00:02:39.150> position<00:02:39.570> as<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
it about the same y position as the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.070 
it about the same y position as the
beginning<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:42.030> see<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.209> visually<00:02:42.750> here

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
beginning you can see that visually here

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.850 
beginning you can see that visually here
but<00:02:43.290> also<00:02:43.440> look<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:44.610> we<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.880> see<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.860> it

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
but also look up here we can see that it

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.949 
but also look up here we can see that it
ends<00:02:47.700> or<00:02:47.880> begins<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.360> ends<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.660> about<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
ends or begins and ends and about the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.560 
ends or begins and ends and about the
same<00:02:49.170> y-value<00:02:49.640> Matt<00:02:50.640> nut<00:02:50.820> creates<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.239> more<00:02:51.480> or

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
same y-value Matt nut creates a more or

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.380 
same y-value Matt nut creates a more or
less<00:02:51.600> symmetric<00:02:52.350> loop<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.670> again<00:02:53.970> if<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.239> look

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
less symmetric loop and again if we look

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.580 
less symmetric loop and again if we look
at<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.660> force<00:02:55.650> fins<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:57.150> see<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.290> this

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
at the force fins we see that in this

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.650 
at the force fins we see that in this
section<00:02:58.860> since<00:02:59.550> this<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.850> bump<00:03:00.090> transition

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
section since this is a bump transition

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.350 
section since this is a bump transition
it<00:03:01.110> starts<00:03:01.769> off<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.550> g-force<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.120> three

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
it starts off with the g-force of three

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.620 
it starts off with the g-force of three
and<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> half<00:03:03.540> G's<00:03:04.670> then<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.820> gets<00:03:05.880> smaller<00:03:06.269> at

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
and a half G's then it gets smaller at

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.240 
and a half G's then it gets smaller at
toward<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> middle<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> section<00:03:08.070> and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
toward the middle of the section and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.800 
toward the middle of the section and
then<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.580> gets<00:03:08.640> larger<00:03:09.060> again<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.420> ends<00:03:09.600> at

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
then it gets larger again and ends at

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.600 
then it gets larger again and ends at
three<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.140> half<00:03:10.170> G's<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
three and a half G's so that's the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.860 
three and a half G's so that's the
function<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:13.470> bump<00:03:13.650> transition<00:03:14.220> and

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
function of of the bump transition and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.100 
function of of the bump transition and
then<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.019> create<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:17.000> pullout<00:03:18.000> again<00:03:18.810> we<00:03:18.930> just

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
then to create the pullout again we just

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.729 
then to create the pullout again we just
add<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> third<00:03:19.860> section<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:21.720> creates<00:03:22.380> our

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
add a third section and that creates our

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.229 
add a third section and that creates our
loop<00:03:23.720> now<00:03:24.720> we<00:03:24.780> need<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.200> do<00:03:25.799> one<00:03:25.950> more<00:03:26.100> thing

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
loop now we need to do one more thing

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.180 
loop now we need to do one more thing
that's<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.540> prevent<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.230> loop<00:03:28.380> from<00:03:28.650> hitting

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
that's to prevent the loop from hitting

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.520 
that's to prevent the loop from hitting
itself<00:03:29.640> when<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:29.940> comes<00:03:30.090> back<00:03:30.180> around<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.810> we

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
itself when it comes back around and we

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.770 
itself when it comes back around and we
do<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.799> by<00:03:32.010> adjusting<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.790> role<00:03:33.120> value<00:03:33.600> of

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
do this by adjusting the role value of

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.420 
do this by adjusting the role value of
the<00:03:34.410> middle<00:03:34.650> section<00:03:35.100> like<00:03:35.910> souls<00:03:36.269> will<00:03:36.660> add

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the middle section like souls will add

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.759 
the middle section like souls will add
maybe<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.549> 15<00:03:39.420> degree<00:03:39.900> roll<00:03:40.910> minus<00:03:41.910> 15<00:03:42.239> degrees

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
maybe a 15 degree roll minus 15 degrees

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.380 
maybe a 15 degree roll minus 15 degrees
now<00:03:43.769> if<00:03:43.920> we<00:03:43.980> will<00:03:44.160> rotate<00:03:44.310> around<00:03:44.579> we<00:03:44.910> see<00:03:45.180> that

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
now if we will rotate around we see that

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.920 
now if we will rotate around we see that
indeed<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:47.070> loop<00:03:47.280> does<00:03:47.610> miss<00:03:48.090> itself<00:03:48.480> on<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
indeed the loop does miss itself on the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.090 
indeed the loop does miss itself on the
way<00:03:49.019> down<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.350> that's<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> first<00:03:52.769> way<00:03:52.980> of

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
way down so that's the first way of

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.530 
way down so that's the first way of
creating<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.519> loop<00:03:53.640> it's<00:03:53.820> it's<00:03:54.030> quite<00:03:54.209> easy<00:03:54.239> in

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
creating a loop it's it's quite easy in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.449 
creating a loop it's it's quite easy in
order<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.380> change<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.769> shape<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.250> loop

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
order to change the shape of the loop

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.130 
order to change the shape of the loop
the<00:03:56.970> parameters<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.630> want<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.870> change

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
the parameters that you want to change

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.550 
the parameters that you want to change
is<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:59.239> normal<00:04:00.239> force<00:04:00.480> at<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.930> beginning<00:04:01.350> as

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
is the normal force at the beginning as

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.729 
is the normal force at the beginning as
well<00:04:01.829> as<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.370> transition<00:04:02.850> normal<00:04:03.180> force<00:04:03.739> you

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
well as the transition normal force you

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.900 
well as the transition normal force you
can<00:04:04.890> also<00:04:05.040> adjust<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:06.239> length<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:08.670> first

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
can also adjust the length of the first

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.710 
can also adjust the length of the first
section<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:10.070> ends<00:04:11.070> at<00:04:11.540> more<00:04:12.540> or<00:04:12.570> less

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
section so that it ends at more or less

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.930 
section so that it ends at more or less
than<00:04:13.049> 30<00:04:13.230> degrees<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.430> play<00:04:14.579> around<00:04:14.670> with

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
than 30 degrees you can play around with

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.099 
than 30 degrees you can play around with
the<00:04:15.000> different<00:04:15.090> parameters<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.810> create<00:04:16.019> the

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
the different parameters to create the

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.520 
the different parameters to create the
shape<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.440> loop<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.100> want<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:19.200> second

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
shape of loop that you want the second

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.440 
shape of loop that you want the second
method<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.950> creating<00:04:20.100> loops<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.760> very<00:04:21.150> similar

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
method of creating loops is very similar

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.670 
method of creating loops is very similar
to<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.750> first<00:04:21.900> method<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:23.130> let<00:04:23.250> me<00:04:23.280> restart

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
to the first method so let me restart

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.790 
to the first method so let me restart
to<00:04:25.639> show<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:26.000> again<00:04:26.620> we'll<00:04:27.620> have<00:04:27.770> a

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
to show you that again we'll have a

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.689 
to show you that again we'll have a
speed<00:04:28.520> of<00:04:28.550> 29<00:04:28.940> m/s<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:30.190> normal<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.340> three<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.669> a

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
speed of 29 m/s a normal of three and a

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:38.890 
speed of 29 m/s a normal of three and a
half<00:04:31.729> GS<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.970> why<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.300> 5<00:04:35.600> meters<00:04:37.630> this<00:04:38.630> time

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
half GS and why of 5 meters this time

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.719 
half GS and why of 5 meters this time
we'll<00:04:39.110> switch<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.770> multi-zone<00:04:40.190> force

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
we'll switch to multi-zone force

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.719 
we'll switch to multi-zone force
sections<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.830> again<00:04:43.250> we<00:04:43.400> want<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.610> make<00:04:43.699> sure

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
sections and again we want to make sure

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.129 
sections and again we want to make sure
that<00:04:43.910> our<00:04:44.090> orientation<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:45.139> a<00:04:45.410> quaternion<00:04:45.970> and

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
that our orientation is a quaternion and

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.900 
that our orientation is a quaternion and
now<00:04:48.139> what<00:04:48.320> we're<00:04:48.440> going<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.620> do<00:04:48.770> is<00:04:49.009> have<00:04:49.729> three

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
now what we're going to do is have three

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.870 
now what we're going to do is have three
normal<00:04:52.910> subs<00:04:53.449> owns<00:04:53.690> at<00:04:54.590> span<00:04:55.039> a<00:04:55.070> single<00:04:55.639> role

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
normal subs owns at span a single role

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.930 
normal subs owns at span a single role
in<00:04:56.120> lateral<00:04:56.449> zone<00:04:57.130> and<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.460> easiest<00:04:58.580> way

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
in lateral zone and so the easiest way

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.070 
in lateral zone and so the easiest way
of<00:04:59.060> doing<00:04:59.330> this<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.720> to<00:05:00.349> lock<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:01.340> lateral<00:05:01.759> and

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
of doing this is to lock the lateral and

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.089 
of doing this is to lock the lateral and
roll<00:05:03.550> sub<00:05:04.550> zones<00:05:04.789> like<00:05:05.150> this<00:05:05.389> and<00:05:05.889> then<00:05:06.889> again

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
roll sub zones like this and then again

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.650 
roll sub zones like this and then again
we'll<00:05:07.280> proceed<00:05:07.430> exactly<00:05:07.759> as<00:05:08.060> we<00:05:08.270> did<00:05:08.630> before

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
we'll proceed exactly as we did before

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.020 
we'll proceed exactly as we did before
well<00:05:09.199> just<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.710> length<00:05:09.949> of<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:12.590> normal

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
well just the length of the normal

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.370 
well just the length of the normal
sub-zone<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.240> can<00:05:14.389> see<00:05:14.570> that's<00:05:14.750> normal<00:05:15.169> subs

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
sub-zone you can see that's normal subs

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.370 
sub-zone you can see that's normal subs
own<00:05:15.560> because<00:05:16.270> of<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.389> color<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.229> the

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
own because of the color of the of the

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.550 
own because of the color of the of the
slider<00:05:19.690> adjust<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.810> length<00:05:20.990> so<00:05:21.289> that<00:05:21.320> this

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
slider adjust the length so that this

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.249 
slider adjust the length so that this
section<00:05:22.070> ends<00:05:22.250> at<00:05:22.400> about<00:05:22.580> 30<00:05:22.820> degrees<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.479> pitch

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
section ends at about 30 degrees a pitch

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.189 
section ends at about 30 degrees a pitch
of<00:05:24.410> 30<00:05:24.590> degrees<00:05:25.090> like<00:05:26.090> this<00:05:26.330> you<00:05:26.539> can<00:05:26.690> see<00:05:26.930> the

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
of 30 degrees like this you can see the

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.230 
of 30 degrees like this you can see the
role<00:05:27.440> in<00:05:27.710> lateral<00:05:28.370> force<00:05:28.639> or<00:05:29.449> lateral<00:05:29.810> zones

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
role in lateral force or lateral zones

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.879 
role in lateral force or lateral zones
adjust<00:05:32.240> their<00:05:32.870> links<00:05:33.139> automatically<00:05:33.560> because

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
adjust their links automatically because

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.620 
adjust their links automatically because
they're<00:05:34.070> locked<00:05:34.310> to<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:34.970> length<00:05:35.270> of<00:05:35.479> the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
they're locked to the length of the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.969 
they're locked to the length of the
normal<00:05:36.320> zone<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:37.610> then<00:05:38.599> we'll<00:05:38.780> add<00:05:38.930> a<00:05:39.380> second

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
normal zone and then we'll add a second

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.159 
normal zone and then we'll add a second
normal<00:05:40.220> zone<00:05:40.460> which<00:05:40.699> will<00:05:40.909> form<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.479> body<00:05:41.900> of

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
normal zone which will form the body of

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.469 
normal zone which will form the body of
our<00:05:42.409> loop<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.830> proceed<00:05:43.610> again<00:05:43.909> exactly<00:05:44.210> like

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
our loop and proceed again exactly like

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.180 
our loop and proceed again exactly like
like<00:05:44.870> before<00:05:46.449> we'll<00:05:47.449> choose<00:05:47.780> a<00:05:48.349> normal

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
like before we'll choose a normal

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:57.089 
like before we'll choose a normal
transition<00:05:49.849> a<00:05:50.830> bump<00:05:51.830> transition<00:05:52.630> minus<00:05:53.630> 3<00:05:53.840> g's

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.960 

adjust<00:05:58.099> the<00:05:58.370> length<00:05:58.669> of<00:05:58.909> this<00:05:59.090> sub<00:05:59.780> zone<00:06:00.970> so

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
adjust the length of this sub zone so

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.710 
adjust the length of this sub zone so
that<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:03.880> force<00:06:04.880> is<00:06:05.000> at<00:06:05.120> a<00:06:05.150> minimum<00:06:05.479> at<00:06:05.630> the

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
that the force is at a minimum at the

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.589 
that the force is at a minimum at the
apex<00:06:06.110> of<00:06:06.229> the<00:06:06.349> loop<00:06:06.530> and<00:06:07.250> then<00:06:08.240> we'll<00:06:08.419> add<00:06:08.570> a

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
apex of the loop and then we'll add a

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:14.710 
apex of the loop and then we'll add a
third<00:06:10.930> normal<00:06:11.930> zone<00:06:12.169> that<00:06:13.449> completes<00:06:14.449> the

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
third normal zone that completes the

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.219 
third normal zone that completes the
loop<00:06:14.870> so<00:06:15.620> the<00:06:15.710> final<00:06:16.039> step<00:06:16.310> is<00:06:16.720> again<00:06:17.720> to

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
loop so the final step is again to

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.499 
loop so the final step is again to
adjust<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:19.039> role<00:06:19.220> so<00:06:19.550> that<00:06:19.699> the<00:06:19.789> element<00:06:20.150> mrs.

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
adjust the role so that the element mrs.

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.740 
adjust the role so that the element mrs.
itself<00:06:20.930> when<00:06:21.440> it<00:06:21.530> loops<00:06:21.710> back<00:06:21.830> around<00:06:21.949> and<00:06:22.750> so

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
itself when it loops back around and so

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.550 
itself when it loops back around and so
we'll<00:06:23.930> just<00:06:23.960> add<00:06:24.349> a<00:06:25.720> roll<00:06:26.720> value<00:06:27.050> of<00:06:27.139> say<00:06:27.349> minus

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
we'll just add a roll value of say minus

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.499 
we'll just add a roll value of say minus
20<00:06:27.979> degrees<00:06:28.630> you<00:06:29.630> can<00:06:29.780> see<00:06:29.960> now<00:06:30.139> the<00:06:30.169> loop<00:06:31.509> will

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
20 degrees you can see now the loop will

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:34.870 
20 degrees you can see now the loop will
miss<00:06:32.659> itself<00:06:33.099> the<00:06:34.099> main<00:06:34.250> difference<00:06:34.279> between

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
miss itself the main difference between

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.519 
miss itself the main difference between
this<00:06:35.150> method<00:06:35.539> and<00:06:35.659> the<00:06:35.719> previous<00:06:36.080> method<00:06:36.409> is

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
this method and the previous method is

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.080 
this method and the previous method is
that<00:06:36.560> now<00:06:36.860> the

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
that now the

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
the role occurs along the entire length

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.310 
the role occurs along the entire length
of<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.580> element<00:06:40.720> instead<00:06:41.720> of<00:06:41.930> just<00:06:42.110> this

center section as before and this
creates<00:06:44.690> a<00:06:44.810> marginally<00:06:45.970> smoother<00:06:46.970> element

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
creates a marginally smoother element

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.400 
creates a marginally smoother element
another<00:06:49.850> diagnostic<00:06:50.240> that<00:06:50.630> you<00:06:50.720> can<00:06:50.870> use<00:06:51.110> to

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
another diagnostic that you can use to

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.250 
another diagnostic that you can use to
ensure<00:06:52.160> that<00:06:52.460> the<00:06:52.790> loop<00:06:52.940> is<00:06:53.060> properly<00:06:53.900> shaped

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
ensure that the loop is properly shaped

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.060 
ensure that the loop is properly shaped
as<00:06:54.590> to<00:06:55.550> examine<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:57.050> vertical<00:06:57.470> radius<00:06:57.800> of<00:06:57.979> the

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
as to examine the vertical radius of the

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.760 
as to examine the vertical radius of the
element<00:06:58.430> and<00:06:58.750> again<00:06:59.750> what<00:06:59.900> we<00:06:59.990> want<00:07:00.169> to<00:07:00.260> see<00:07:00.500> is

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
element and again what we want to see is

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.490 
element and again what we want to see is
that<00:07:01.220> the<00:07:01.370> radius<00:07:01.669> is<00:07:02.020> smallest<00:07:03.020> at<00:07:03.199> the<00:07:03.290> top

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
that the radius is smallest at the top

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.100 
that the radius is smallest at the top
of<00:07:03.530> the<00:07:03.740> loop<00:07:03.889> and<00:07:04.820> if<00:07:05.510> we<00:07:05.630> can<00:07:05.780> see<00:07:05.960> what

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
of the loop and if we can see what

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.920 
of the loop and if we can see what
happens<00:07:06.440> by<00:07:07.250> exaggerating<00:07:07.910> the<00:07:08.330> effect<00:07:08.660> so

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
happens by exaggerating the effect so

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.360 
happens by exaggerating the effect so
let<00:07:09.080> me<00:07:10.419> decrease<00:07:11.680> the<00:07:12.680> transition<00:07:13.220> from

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
let me decrease the transition from

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.900 
let me decrease the transition from
minus<00:07:13.820> 3<00:07:14.030> 2-3<00:07:14.360> and<00:07:14.570> a<00:07:14.630> half<00:07:14.660> of<00:07:15.350> the<00:07:15.440> center

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:15.910 
minus 3 2-3 and a half of the center

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:22.090 
minus 3 2-3 and a half of the center
subsection<00:07:20.080> so<00:07:21.080> now<00:07:21.200> you<00:07:21.260> see<00:07:21.650> that<00:07:21.680> the<00:07:21.919> loop

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100 
subsection so now you see that the loop

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.950 
subsection so now you see that the loop
is<00:07:22.280> flatter<00:07:22.639> up<00:07:22.820> top<00:07:23.060> and<00:07:23.270> as<00:07:23.389> a<00:07:23.419> reflection<00:07:23.780> of

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
is flatter up top and as a reflection of

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.490 
is flatter up top and as a reflection of
that<00:07:24.020> the<00:07:24.950> radius<00:07:25.310> is<00:07:26.030> larger<00:07:26.780> than<00:07:26.900> it<00:07:27.020> is<00:07:27.169> on

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
that the radius is larger than it is on

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.490 
that the radius is larger than it is on
either<00:07:28.040> side<00:07:28.870> and<00:07:29.870> again<00:07:30.260> that's<00:07:30.410> something

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
either side and again that's something

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.290 
either side and again that's something
that<00:07:30.650> we<00:07:30.770> want<00:07:30.919> to<00:07:30.950> avoid<00:07:31.250> that<00:07:31.669> will<00:07:31.850> result

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
that we want to avoid that will result

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.480 
that we want to avoid that will result
in<00:07:32.450> a<00:07:32.510> vertical<00:07:32.690> pump<00:07:33.220> when<00:07:34.220> you're<00:07:34.340> writing

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
in a vertical pump when you're writing

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.240 
in a vertical pump when you're writing
your<00:07:34.639> your<00:07:35.030> coaster<00:07:35.740> so<00:07:36.740> let<00:07:36.830> me<00:07:36.860> change<00:07:37.100> this

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.250 
your your coaster so let me change this

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.629 
your your coaster so let me change this
back<00:07:37.460> to<00:07:37.610> three<00:07:38.560> and<00:07:39.560> again<00:07:39.680> adjust<00:07:40.340> the

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 
back to three and again adjust the

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.730 
back to three and again adjust the
length<00:07:41.240> and<00:07:42.820> in<00:07:43.820> fact<00:07:43.970> I<00:07:44.060> think<00:07:44.150> I'm<00:07:44.300> going<00:07:44.450> to

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:44.740 
length and in fact I think I'm going to

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:51.580 
length and in fact I think I'm going to
make<00:07:45.740> this<00:07:45.889> about<00:07:46.130> 2.9<00:07:50.110> so<00:07:51.110> yes<00:07:51.260> I<00:07:51.380> think<00:07:51.410> that

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:51.590 
make this about 2.9 so yes I think that

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.100 
make this about 2.9 so yes I think that
looks<00:07:51.860> much<00:07:52.130> nicer<00:07:52.310> and<00:07:52.900> there<00:07:53.900> you<00:07:53.960> have<00:07:54.020> it

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.110 
looks much nicer and there you have it

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.000 
looks much nicer and there you have it
the<00:07:54.289> basic<00:07:54.590> loop<00:07:54.849> nothin<00:07:55.849> to<00:07:55.970> it
