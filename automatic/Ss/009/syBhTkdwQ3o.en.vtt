00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
my hair last night like I said I would

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.280 
my hair last night like I said I would
and<00:03:30.770> this<00:03:31.190> time<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.700> took<00:03:31.760> each<00:03:32.060> section<00:03:32.600> spritz

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
and this time I took each section spritz

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.890 
and this time I took each section spritz
it<00:03:33.470> with<00:03:33.500> water<00:03:33.620> I<00:03:34.310> added<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:35.120> little<00:03:35.270> bit<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.510> my

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
it with water I added a little bit of my

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.990 
it with water I added a little bit of my
Cantu<00:03:36.350> shea<00:03:36.380> butter<00:03:36.740> leave-in<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.790> then<00:03:38.830> my

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
Cantu shea butter leave-in and then my

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.690 
Cantu shea butter leave-in and then my
miss<00:03:41.000> jessie's<00:03:41.420> curly<00:03:41.990> buttercream<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:43.040> then

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
miss jessie's curly buttercream and then

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.450 
miss jessie's curly buttercream and then
twisted<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:44.990> put<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.740> in<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.920> bantu<00:03:46.250> knot

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
twisted it and put it in the bantu knot

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.050 
twisted it and put it in the bantu knot
so<00:03:46.700> hopefully<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:48.590> not<00:03:48.860> gonna<00:03:49.040> be<00:03:49.310> as<00:03:49.490> frizzy

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
so hopefully it's not gonna be as frizzy

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.660 
so hopefully it's not gonna be as frizzy
today<00:03:50.780> that's<00:03:51.170> what<00:03:51.440> I'm<00:03:51.590> hoping<00:03:51.740> I<00:03:52.220> did<00:03:52.430> about

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
today that's what I'm hoping I did about

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.960 
today that's what I'm hoping I did about
I<00:03:53.170> think<00:03:54.170> 15<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.680> 16<00:03:57.010> made<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.190> sections<00:03:58.580> just

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
I think 15 to 16 made the sections just

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.640 
I think 15 to 16 made the sections just
a<00:03:59.120> little<00:03:59.390> bit<00:03:59.540> small<00:03:59.840> take<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:00.200> little<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.620> my

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
a little bit small take a little of my

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.310 
a little bit small take a little of my
whole<00:04:01.160> oil<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:03.680> put<00:04:03.920> some<00:04:04.070> on<00:04:04.100> my<00:04:04.250> hand

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.570 

so<00:04:10.630> my<00:04:11.630> hands<00:04:11.870> won't<00:04:12.050> create<00:04:12.440> more<00:04:12.710> frizz<00:04:13.070> and

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
so my hands won't create more frizz and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.860 
so my hands won't create more frizz and
I'm<00:04:16.580> really<00:04:16.760> hoping<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.299> these<00:04:17.450> are<00:04:17.660> dry

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
I'm really hoping that these are dry

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.890 
I'm really hoping that these are dry
because<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:19.070> did<00:04:19.370> them<00:04:19.460> last<00:04:19.520> night<00:04:19.850> before<00:04:20.660> I

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
because I did them last night before I

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.110 
because I did them last night before I
went<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:21.110> sleep<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.770> then<00:04:21.980> when<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.820> got<00:04:23.000> up

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
went to sleep and then when I got up

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.690 
went to sleep and then when I got up
this<00:04:23.240> morning<00:04:23.300> I<00:04:24.110> worked<00:04:24.350> out<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:25.460> then<00:04:25.610> I

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
this morning I worked out so then I

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.490 
this morning I worked out so then I
started<00:04:26.000> with<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.210> dryer<00:04:26.510> for<00:04:26.930> almost<00:04:27.200> an<00:04:27.380> hour

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
started with a dryer for almost an hour

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.970 
started with a dryer for almost an hour
so<00:04:27.950> I'm<00:04:28.040> hoping<00:04:29.290> really<00:04:30.290> hoping<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.650> it's

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
so I'm hoping really hoping that it's

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:41.470 
so I'm hoping really hoping that it's
completely<00:04:31.550> dry<00:04:33.190> cuz<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.400> would<00:04:40.480> definitely

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
completely dry cuz that would definitely

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.620 
completely dry cuz that would definitely
not<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.690> fan<00:04:42.250> this<00:04:43.250> was<00:04:43.460> a<00:04:43.490> fail<00:04:43.790> again<00:04:44.210> because
