00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
format so it turned out that I ended up

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.019 
format so it turned out that I ended up
shooting<00:00:20.430> all<00:00:20.699> these<00:00:21.029> pictures<00:00:21.359> us<00:00:22.020> raw<00:00:23.029> it

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.550 
shooting all these pictures us raw it
sucks<00:00:24.390> because<00:00:24.630> these<00:00:24.900> pictures<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.439> now

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
sucks because these pictures are now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.470 
sucks because these pictures are now
really<00:00:25.949> big<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:26.760> trying<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.359> do<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
really big and I'm trying to just do a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.750 
really big and I'm trying to just do a
quick<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:27.810> time-lapse<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.310> turns<00:00:29.519> out

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
quick little time-lapse and it turns out

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.220 
quick little time-lapse and it turns out
you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.060> I'm<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.359> gonna<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.660> able<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.050> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you know I'm not gonna be able to do it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.620 
you know I'm not gonna be able to do it
as<00:00:32.070> quickly<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.390> because

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
as quickly as like that just because

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.690 
as quickly as like that just because
these<00:00:33.809> files<00:00:34.050> are<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.530> over<00:00:34.890> 20<00:00:35.309> megabytes

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
these files are like over 20 megabytes

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.869 
these files are like over 20 megabytes
each<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> need<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> convert<00:00:37.800> very<00:00:38.309> quickly

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
each so I need to convert very quickly

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.180 
each so I need to convert very quickly
um<00:00:39.469> the<00:00:40.469> RAW<00:00:40.710> files<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.850> JPEG<00:00:42.420> format<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.260> don't

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
um the RAW files to JPEG format I don't

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.459 
um the RAW files to JPEG format I don't
really<00:00:44.550> care<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.750> too<00:00:45.930> much<00:00:46.050> control

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
really care to have too much control

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.209 
really care to have too much control
over<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:48.120> settings<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> wanted<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> quickly

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
over the settings so I wanted to quickly

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
over the settings so I wanted to quickly
do<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.329> know<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.570> gonna<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
do it and I you know I was gonna do it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.520 
do it and I you know I was gonna do it
in<00:00:51.960> Photoshop<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:53.780> opening<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.930> Photoshop

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
in Photoshop but opening up Photoshop

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.779 
in Photoshop but opening up Photoshop
and<00:00:55.770> trying<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.100> figure<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.610> batch

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and trying to figure out the batch

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.459 
and trying to figure out the batch
system<00:00:57.300> turned<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.289> bit

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
system turned out to be a little bit

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.119 
system turned out to be a little bit
more<00:00:58.590> complex<00:00:59.190> than<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.820> wanted<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:01.129> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
more complex than I really wanted to you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.579 
more complex than I really wanted to you
know<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.640> involved<00:01:02.910> with<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> quickly

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
know get involved with so I quickly

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.789 
know get involved with so I quickly
looked<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.220> YouTube<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.360> found<00:01:06.799> another

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
looked on YouTube and I found another

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.940 
looked on YouTube and I found another
option<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.210> decided<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.860> is

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
option that I decided to go with what is

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.200 
option that I decided to go with what is
it<00:01:11.070> called<00:01:11.420> its<00:01:12.420> called<00:01:12.540> rocker<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.700> it's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
it called its called rocker it's a it's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.170 
it called its called rocker it's a it's
a<00:01:15.390> small<00:01:15.540> little<00:01:16.140> program<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:18.000> basically

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
a small little program that basically

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.870 
a small little program that basically
does<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.950> simple<00:01:20.310> options

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
does just that with very simple options

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.499 
does just that with very simple options
and<00:01:21.439> I<00:01:22.439> decided<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.070> give<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.460> try<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and I decided to give it a try so I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.120 
and I decided to give it a try so I
wanted<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> share<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.619> wanted<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> post

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
wanted to share this I wanted to post

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.590 
wanted to share this I wanted to post
this<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> people<00:01:27.450> kind

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this because I know a lot of people kind

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.030 
this because I know a lot of people kind
of<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.290> through<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.619> whole<00:01:28.799> thing

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of you know go through that whole thing

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.999 
of you know go through that whole thing
where<00:01:29.250> they'll<00:01:29.490> take<00:01:29.720> pictures<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.650> there

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
where they'll take pictures that there

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.830 
where they'll take pictures that there
that<00:01:32.040> are<00:01:32.369> way<00:01:32.579> too<00:01:32.610> big<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.570> don't<00:01:33.720> want

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that are way too big and they don't want

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.859 
that are way too big and they don't want
to<00:01:33.869> spend<00:01:34.110> too<00:01:34.229> much<00:01:34.350> time<00:01:34.409> converting<00:01:35.220> these

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
to spend too much time converting these

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.319 
to spend too much time converting these
it<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:37.170> probably<00:01:37.650> still<00:01:38.250> take<00:01:38.549> quite<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> bit

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it will probably still take quite a bit

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.580 
it will probably still take quite a bit
of<00:01:39.420> time<00:01:39.630> depending<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.110> how<00:01:40.200> many<00:01:40.409> pictures

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
of time depending on how many pictures

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.859 
of time depending on how many pictures
you<00:01:40.740> took<00:01:42.829> for<00:01:43.829> example<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.369> took<00:01:44.430> about<00:01:45.180> 1200

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you took for example I took about 1200

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.550 
you took for example I took about 1200
pictures<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.299> take<00:01:48.810> quite<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
pictures so that's going to take quite a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.270 
pictures so that's going to take quite a
bit<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.250> even<00:01:51.210> though<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:52.079> far<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.619> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
bit of time even though as far as you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.620 
bit of time even though as far as you
know<00:01:53.399> trying<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.700> figure<00:01:54.030> out<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> settings

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
know trying to figure out the settings

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
know trying to figure out the settings
and<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> take

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and all of that it's not going to take

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.709 
and all of that it's not going to take
much<00:01:56.399> time

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
much time

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.969 
much time
I<00:01:57.780> will<00:01:58.939> check<00:01:59.939> to<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.600> kind<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
I will check to see what kind of

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.580 
I will check to see what kind of
settings<00:02:01.979> or<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.520> kind<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.170> quality<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> get

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
settings or what kind of quality I get

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.969 
settings or what kind of quality I get
out<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.040> these<00:02:05.159> JPEGs<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.380> far<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.799> looks

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
out of these JPEGs but so far it looks

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.790 
out of these JPEGs but so far it looks
like<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> easiest<00:02:09.420> in

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
like it's going to be the easiest in

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.479 
like it's going to be the easiest in
simplest<00:02:10.800> way<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.459> it

egg bus and I have my raw files here so
I<00:02:34.269> have<00:02:34.599> these<00:02:34.989> giant<00:02:35.439> 28<00:02:36.129> megabyte<00:02:36.730> files<00:02:37.090> you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
I have these giant 28 megabyte files you

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.539 
I have these giant 28 megabyte files you
know<00:02:37.599> each<00:02:37.780> one<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.889> know<00:02:39.010> QuickTime

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
know each one and you know QuickTime

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.220 
know each one and you know QuickTime
which<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.939> what<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.299> program<00:02:40.569> that<00:02:40.659> I<00:02:40.719> use<00:02:40.750> to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
which is what the program that I use to

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.949 
which is what the program that I use to
process<00:02:41.590> my<00:02:41.709> time<00:02:41.950> lapses<00:02:42.420> doesn't<00:02:43.420> even<00:02:43.569> read

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
process my time lapses doesn't even read

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.479 
process my time lapses doesn't even read
the<00:02:44.109> cr2<00:02:44.560> files<00:02:44.829> which<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.159> the<00:02:45.280> camera<00:02:45.730> RAW

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
the cr2 files which is the camera RAW

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.679 
the cr2 files which is the camera RAW
files<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.909> Canon<00:02:49.510> creates<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:52.150> basically

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
files that Canon creates so I basically

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.710 
files that Canon creates so I basically
need<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.169> convert<00:02:53.620> these<00:02:53.859> into<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.669> JPEG<00:02:55.060> format

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
need to convert these into a JPEG format

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.750 
need to convert these into a JPEG format
that<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.109> use<00:02:56.319> so<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:56.980> did<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> quick<00:02:57.519> search

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that I can use so I did a quick search

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.830 
that I can use so I did a quick search
on<00:02:57.939> Google<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:59.079> found<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.819> app<00:03:01.180> called

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
on Google and I found this app called

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.250 
on Google and I found this app called
rocker<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.040> went<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:04.090> softonic<00:03:04.629> which<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.079> a

rocker so I went to softonic which is a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.709 
rocker so I went to softonic which is a

to down to a place to you can download
the<00:03:09.760> software<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:12.099> download<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.519> from

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
the software and I download it from

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.140 
the software and I download it from
there

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
there

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.009 
there
once<00:03:13.689> I<00:03:13.810> downloaded<00:03:14.169> the<00:03:14.319> files<00:03:14.590> umm<00:03:16.019> it

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
once I downloaded the files umm it

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.949 
once I downloaded the files umm it
downloaded<00:03:17.650> with<00:03:17.799> these<00:03:18.040> two<00:03:18.659> versions<00:03:19.659> of<00:03:19.840> it

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
downloaded with these two versions of it

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.659 
downloaded with these two versions of it
for<00:03:20.169> some<00:03:20.319> reason<00:03:20.620> I'm<00:03:20.739> not<00:03:20.769> sure<00:03:21.069> exactly<00:03:21.310> why

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
for some reason I'm not sure exactly why

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.610 
for some reason I'm not sure exactly why
but<00:03:21.699> I<00:03:22.599> just<00:03:22.659> went<00:03:22.930> ahead<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.260> used<00:03:23.530> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
but I just went ahead and used the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.670 
but I just went ahead and used the
latest<00:03:24.750> they<00:03:25.750> probably<00:03:26.019> give<00:03:26.379> you<00:03:26.500> two

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
latest they probably give you two

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.469 
latest they probably give you two
versions<00:03:27.069> just<00:03:27.280> because<00:03:27.549> maybe<00:03:27.699> on<00:03:28.150> some

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
versions just because maybe on some

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.710 
versions just because maybe on some
older<00:03:29.019> OS<00:03:29.919> you<00:03:30.849> know<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.180> might<00:03:31.329> not<00:03:31.359> be<00:03:31.510> able

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
older OS you know it might not be able

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.210 
older OS you know it might not be able
to<00:03:31.780> run<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.139> newest<00:03:32.470> version<00:03:32.799> or<00:03:32.919> something

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
to run the newest version or something

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.479 
to run the newest version or something
but<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.370> was<00:03:33.760> able<00:03:33.909> to<00:03:34.060> run<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.629> latest<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
but I was able to run the latest the

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.229 
but I was able to run the latest the
2.3.3<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.120> went<00:03:37.659> ahead<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.019> opened<00:03:38.109> this

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
2.3.3 so I went ahead and opened this

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.089 
2.3.3 so I went ahead and opened this
without<00:03:40.239> really<00:03:40.540> knowing<00:03:41.199> too<00:03:41.439> much<00:03:41.470> about<00:03:41.620> it

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
without really knowing too much about it

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.689 
without really knowing too much about it
I<00:03:43.090> just<00:03:43.569> kind<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.810> got<00:03:43.930> started<00:03:44.349> I<00:03:44.739> just<00:03:45.340> went

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
I just kind of got started I just went

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.899 
I just kind of got started I just went
to<00:03:46.090> batch<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.470> batch<00:03:47.919> option<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.459> really<00:03:48.669> what

went ahead and said the source folder so
I<00:03:59.290> found<00:04:00.009> my<00:04:00.699> source<00:04:01.269> files<00:04:01.689> which<00:04:02.139> were<00:04:02.349> these

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
I found my source files which were these

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:08.999 
I found my source files which were these
I<00:04:04.949> went<00:04:05.949> back<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.579> settings<00:04:07.180> batch<00:04:07.509> and<00:04:08.009> did

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
I went back to settings batch and did

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.399 
I went back to settings batch and did
the<00:04:09.329> destination<00:04:10.329> which<00:04:10.629> I<00:04:10.840> wanted<00:04:11.169> to<00:04:11.290> do

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
the destination which I wanted to do

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.059 
the destination which I wanted to do
under<00:04:11.709> edits<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.840> then<00:04:14.169> I<00:04:14.290> went<00:04:14.500> ahead<00:04:14.620> and

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
under edits and then I went ahead and

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.659 
under edits and then I went ahead and
say<00:04:15.489> start<00:04:15.909> batch<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:17.280> that's<00:04:18.280> pretty<00:04:18.489> much

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
say start batch and that's pretty much

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.529 
say start batch and that's pretty much
it<00:04:18.880> so<00:04:19.590> rocker<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:20.889> now<00:04:21.070> finished<00:04:21.639> it<00:04:22.240> did

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
it so rocker is now finished it did

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.770 
it so rocker is now finished it did
about<00:04:22.719> a<00:04:23.050> thousand<00:04:24.389> 167<00:04:25.389> image

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
about a thousand 167 image

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.960 
about a thousand 167 image
six<00:04:26.440> seconds<00:04:26.800> per<00:04:26.920> image<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:27.310> took<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.670> hundred

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
six seconds per image it took a hundred

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.360 
six seconds per image it took a hundred
and<00:04:28.300> twenty<00:04:28.720> three<00:04:28.900> minutes<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.980> actually

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
and twenty three minutes so it actually

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.220 
and twenty three minutes so it actually
took<00:04:30.520> like<00:04:30.700> two<00:04:30.910> hours<00:04:30.940> which<00:04:31.570> isn't<00:04:31.780> really

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
took like two hours which isn't really

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.200 
took like two hours which isn't really
that<00:04:33.160> fast<00:04:34.740> but<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:36.370> didn't<00:04:36.820> really<00:04:37.000> have<00:04:37.090> to

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
that fast but I didn't really have to

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.000 
that fast but I didn't really have to
think<00:04:37.330> much<00:04:37.570> about<00:04:37.600> settings<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.560> just<00:04:38.770> kind

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
think much about settings it just kind

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.790 
think much about settings it just kind
of<00:04:39.070> did<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.490> on<00:04:39.700> its<00:04:40.510> own<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.290> came<00:04:41.650> back

of did it on its own and you came back
two<00:04:41.980> hours<00:04:42.040> later<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.460> here<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.360> have<00:04:43.390> my

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
two hours later and here it is I have my

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.810 
two hours later and here it is I have my
finished<00:04:44.140> pictures<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:45.040> let's<00:04:45.070> go<00:04:45.580> ahead<00:04:45.640> and

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
finished pictures so let's go ahead and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.750 
finished pictures so let's go ahead and
quit<00:04:46.360> that<00:04:46.600> program<00:04:47.140> if<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:48.520> look<00:04:48.790> inside<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.480> my

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
quit that program if I look inside of my

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.220 
quit that program if I look inside of my
folder<00:04:51.760> where<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.000> told<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.690> put<00:04:52.990> all<00:04:53.110> the

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
folder where I told it to put all the

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.580 
folder where I told it to put all the
pictures<00:04:53.380> now<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.740> have<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.810> series<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.840> JPEGs

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
pictures now I have a series of JPEGs

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.870 
pictures now I have a series of JPEGs
that<00:04:57.010> are<00:04:57.430> about<00:04:57.880> four<00:04:58.300> megabytes<00:04:58.870> each

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
that are about four megabytes each

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.180 
that are about four megabytes each
instead<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:01.090> 28<00:05:01.720> so<00:05:02.230> now<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.410> should<00:05:02.770> be<00:05:02.890> able<00:05:03.010> to

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
instead of 28 so now I should be able to

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.090 
instead of 28 so now I should be able to
process<00:05:03.490> these<00:05:03.820> as<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.030> time-lapse<00:05:04.600> so<00:05:05.560> this<00:05:05.890> is

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
process these as a time-lapse so this is

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.550 
process these as a time-lapse so this is
the<00:05:06.340> time-lapse<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:07.120> I<00:05:07.150> was<00:05:07.360> working<00:05:08.260> on

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
the time-lapse that I was working on

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.240 
the time-lapse that I was working on
that<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.010> shot<00:05:09.370> yesterday<00:05:09.669> we<00:05:10.630> were<00:05:11.130> working<00:05:12.130> on

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
that I shot yesterday we were working on

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.950 
that I shot yesterday we were working on
this<00:05:12.960> 1962<00:05:13.960> b/w<00:05:14.590> engine<00:05:15.360> we<00:05:16.360> literally<00:05:16.690> took

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
this 1962 b/w engine we literally took

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.020 
this 1962 b/w engine we literally took
the<00:05:17.020> whole<00:05:17.350> engine<00:05:17.800> down<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.460> put<00:05:18.730> took<00:05:18.880> all

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
the whole engine down and put took all

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.030 
the whole engine down and put took all
the<00:05:19.120> components<00:05:19.660> out<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.050> and<00:05:20.169> installed

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
the components out of it and installed

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.420 
the components out of it and installed
them<00:05:21.220> on<00:05:21.310> another<00:05:21.730> block<00:05:22.540> another<00:05:23.200> engine<00:05:23.650> put

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
them on another block another engine put

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.110 
them on another block another engine put
it<00:05:24.550> back<00:05:24.700> in<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.060> in<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.870> bus<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:27.340> got<00:05:27.970> it

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
it back in the in the bus and got it

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.090 
it back in the in the bus and got it
back<00:05:28.150> running<00:05:28.810> so<00:05:29.230> this<00:05:29.470> was<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.770> time-lapse

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
back running so this was the time-lapse

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.680 
back running so this was the time-lapse
that<00:05:30.280> I<00:05:30.310> was<00:05:30.460> shooting<00:05:30.640> yesterday<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:31.570> that<00:05:31.660> I
