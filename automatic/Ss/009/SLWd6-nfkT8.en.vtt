00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.400
 welcome to the kitchen of the great i martins we usually see together 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.660
 a recipe that Mr Graziano has shown us of the great winemakers who 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.680
 it is a presotto with mascarpone the very simple recipe erbusco usa and above all 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.099
 very creamy 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.469
 we will also see how to enrich it with some delicacies let's start immediately 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.309
 with risotto we will use carnaroli rice and we will start by making a 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.859
 what romantic I use shallot because it is particularly fragrant and me 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.090
 like it as a rich base like this 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.450
 a knob of butter 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.030
 we have already prepared some good broth alternatively we can use del 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.120
 meat broth to be made with the nut 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.400
 add rice 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.930
 if we proceed with its roasting let us remember a lively flame 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.320
 constantly mixing it with earth 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.880
 about a minute and a half 2 minutes 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 now let's go fade with white wine 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 gay 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.410
 in this phase it will give 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.430
 right degree of acidity our rice and therefore will lighten that feeling 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.680
 greasy that could have made 8 at the end of cooking 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.780
 so I evaporate the alcohol that we can use our cooking 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 wetting with the broth 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.990
 therefore as a first operation we are going to heat a non-stick pan 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.070
 sufficiently large 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.659
 in which we will add some Parmesan to make a nice one 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.620
 hot 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.100
 what we do a we want to give it some color and then this time 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.070
 I will use saffron 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.930
 I'm not going to get rid of the grated cheese so I can color it 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.830
 scents 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.450
 let's go pour 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 our cheese inside the pan 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.039
 - we're going to distribute evenly 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.739
 fine as you see our waffle 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.069
 if coupled if merged that has been created 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:31.839
 took a nice saffron color as you can see we go to tribal tattoo la 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.739
 we overturn a container that gives it the shape it is 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.469
 enough 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.150
 existing to the heat here it is enough to turn it upside down 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.489
 position it and let it cool let's go to toast some almonds 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.569
 we have almonds to 7 of the flaked almonds we are going to add 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.569
 in the pan 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.819
 as you can see the almonds have taken on color we do not toast too much 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.529
 otherwise they tend to become sea we take some parsley also 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.529
 I love you while risotto completes its cooking 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.329
 add the mascarpone to our rice 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.959
 we also add the chopped parsley 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.669
 it we mix fassino to make our risotto creamy 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.599
 here is our beautiful creamy risotto creamed we go to serve
