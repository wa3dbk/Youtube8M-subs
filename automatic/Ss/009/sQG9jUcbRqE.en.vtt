00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello guys and welcome back to the canal 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.680
 aaron manager in this video I wanted 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.480
 tell you about the water kefir and how 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.280
 prepare it which will finish a lot 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.840
 ancient even spoke marco polo 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.550
 in its members and originates in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.110
 Turkey or in any case in Eastern Europe that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.120
 another different ways also in different 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.680
 languages is a drink too much 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.940
 interesting for us bodybuilders or 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.859
 however ahead of fitness and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 well-being as it is very rich in 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.939
 mineral salts of amino acids vitamins 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 especially vitamins of the group b and i 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.990
 natural probiotics 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 we know most of the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.800
 bacterial flora is found in the apparatus 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.600
 gastrointestinal and this represents 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 an excellent defense in our system 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.160
 immune and therefore also for us to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.559
 purple bill welfare lovers of 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.260
 fitness maintain good health of the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.789
 our gastrointestinal system and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.690
 Immune system is extremely 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.550
 important 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.989
 It is true that we are what we eat or 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.239
 the better we are than ours 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.309
 organism is able to assimilate e 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.780
 then metabolize a system 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.949
 functioning and healthy is capable of 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 extrapolate to better metabolize i 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.690
 macronutrients and micronutrients that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.780
 we introduce with the diet to prepare 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.780
 Water kefir is very simple is needed 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.820
 a container a colander of course 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 granules of sugar kefir from 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.310
 dried fruit but let's look at the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.759
 kefyr already prepared here is this 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.619
 prepared after 48 hours of fermentation 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.189
 see this this vase 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.860
 then obviously opening the jar you see 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.200
 right away that there was this 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 fermentation process 24 hours 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.600
 fermentation of the granules year brent e 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.930
 works that were a drink that has a 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.759
 laxative effect 48 hours instead one 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.509
 richest in probiotics and more 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.140
 astringent effect then usually one 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.270
 once a safe drink is prepared with 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.869
 this is this strainer 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.179
 in another vessel here you see the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.490
 granules in this case as inserted 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.860
 you can also get dried prunes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.630
 decide to give and put any 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.090
 type of dried fruit to give a taste 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 there is also someone who creates something different to the drink 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.709
 of probiotic movito by putting in 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.069
 mint leaves or strawberries or del 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.519
 lemon or other important to wash e 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.370
 then rinse the container to create 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.790
 a new kiss and then a new new one 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.299
 fermentation then I insert water 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.310
 hot 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.590
 in this vase and then begins to put 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.079
 the sugar usually the ratio is 3 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 spoons of wheat kefir to understand 3 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:38.130
 spoons of sugar or 120 g of sugar 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.769
 make 6 tablespoons of kefir obviously 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.410
 then you learn to find what they are 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.290
 right dosages as mentioned 24 hours 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.230
 obviously more sucrose remains 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.200
 lucrose and more fructose and therefore that 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.970
 more laxative effect 48 hours more 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.000
 probiotics because more anhydride is created 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.790
 carbonica there is more presentation and the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.609
 kefyr has more stringent effect because 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.040
 a bit more acid fruit can be 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.730
 just entered but after that once 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.670
 rinsed with strange even taste 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.130
 this fruit because it no longer knows it is not 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.139
 sweeter and anti tastes for 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.930
 of antiquity because however the granules have 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.630
 metabolized they also ate 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.280
 fructose from important fruit 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:29.609
 rinse the granules you can top up the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.859
 jar with other water here too 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:37.560
 let's say you will learn then go second 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:42.569
 your measurements usually here too 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.269
 we talk about half a liter for 6 tablespoons 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.040
 of sugar and 6 tablespoons of kefir then 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.530
 had seen we put the plums 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.079
 dry again and then in this case I have 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.209
 inserted my 8 tablespoons of kefir 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.400
 obviously the vase is very large so 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.419
 let's say I arrived at these quantities 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.810
 over time I did not immediately leave with 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.000
 these quantities 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.500
 interesting to also know that the big ones 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.600
 which fir and obviously are 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.700
 live moments and then multiply into 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.680
 continuation and then you will see that later 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.570
 two days of fermentation is 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.770
 double even triples one 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.750
 depending on the temperatures you have 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.609
 in your room usually with 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.200
 temperatures above 20 degrees 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.690
 come even then tripled after 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.850
 two days you no longer know where to put them 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.450
 so much so that at the moment I am there 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:31.230
 freezing and putting in in fact 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.050
 freezer for precisely giving them to friends or 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.000
 acquaintances or now I am going to 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.440
 leave for los angeles so i'll have to 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.570
 make one of the last kisses and then later 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.730
 put them in the freezer and in any case like 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.610
 see at this moment take them out 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.430
 when I come back and then start doing again 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.940
 fermentation is all this a video 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.530
 very fast on kefir and how to prepare it 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.660
 let me know what you think 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.100
 and if you are interested in the granules I am 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.740
 looking for a moment how to send them in 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.180
 Italy in an efficient and economical way 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.010
 so let me know if you are 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.169
 interested so I organize myself better 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.169
 hello guys, see you soon
