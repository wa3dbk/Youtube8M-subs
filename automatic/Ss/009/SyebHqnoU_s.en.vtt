00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
problem with this okay as you can see

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.120 
problem with this okay as you can see
it's<00:02:06.470> pretty<00:02:07.010> big<00:02:07.220> fish<00:02:07.550> tank<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:09.130> it's

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
it's pretty big fish tank this and it's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.000 
it's pretty big fish tank this and it's
too<00:02:10.369> heavy<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.940> move<00:02:11.060> really<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:12.440> literally

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
too heavy to move really it literally

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.199 
too heavy to move really it literally
waited<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.790> them<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.550> logical<00:02:16.940> way<00:02:17.060> of

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
waited on them so the logical way of

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.940 
waited on them so the logical way of
doing<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.570> is<00:02:17.690> removing<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.350> water<00:02:18.530> out<00:02:18.860> of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
doing it is removing the water out of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.060 
doing it is removing the water out of
the<00:02:19.310> tank<00:02:19.690> not<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:20.840> over<00:02:21.110> them<00:02:21.260> do<00:02:21.680> not<00:02:21.860> remove

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
the tank not all over them do not remove

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.949 
the tank not all over them do not remove
all<00:02:22.280> because<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.880> need<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.150> fish<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.600> live<00:02:23.810> in

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
all because you need the fish to live in

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.780 
all because you need the fish to live in
something<00:02:24.380> doing<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.739> while<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.340> paint<00:02:25.550> it

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.260 

catch<00:03:39.800> can<00:03:40.099> simply<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.790> gravel<00:03:41.150> out<00:03:41.270> there

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270

just<00:03:44.270> as<00:03:44.420> if<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.569> were<00:03:44.690> doing<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.410> normal

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
water from head into their making this

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.010 
water from head into their making this
larger<00:04:52.640> I'm<00:04:52.850> going<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.150> save<00:04:53.360> this<00:04:53.570> water<00:04:53.840> and

larger I'm going to save this water and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.680 
larger I'm going to save this water and
put<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.380> back<00:04:54.530> in<00:04:54.710> later<00:04:54.970> there<00:04:55.970> we<00:04:56.120> go<00:04:56.270> simple

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
put it back in later there we go simple

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:06.100 
put it back in later there we go simple
as<00:04:56.780> that<00:04:56.840> so<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:57.890> works<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:05.120> obviously<00:05:05.390> when

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
as that so it works and obviously when

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
into the dustbin I mean if you do it's

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.840 
into the dustbin I mean if you do it's
not<00:05:12.110> a<00:05:12.140> problem<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.740> walk<00:05:12.919> survive<00:05:13.250> just<00:05:13.729> get

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
not a problem the walk survive just get

of moving this and I mean this is

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.589 
of moving this and I mean this is
actually<00:06:29.220> a<00:06:29.250> breathing<00:06:29.669> tank<00:06:30.000> at<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.270> moment

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
actually a breathing tank at the moment

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.390 
actually a breathing tank at the moment
I've<00:06:30.720> got<00:06:30.930> a<00:06:30.960> lot<00:06:31.229> of<00:06:31.259> baby<00:06:31.560> fish<00:06:31.860> in<00:06:32.039> there<00:06:32.190> and

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
wouldn't do this if I didn't think it

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.160 
wouldn't do this if I didn't think it
was<00:06:35.400> safe<00:06:35.610> so<00:06:36.449> yeah<00:06:37.380> there<00:06:38.009> we<00:06:38.130> go
