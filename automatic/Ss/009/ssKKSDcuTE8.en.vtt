heighten inflation throughout 2012 into
2013<00:01:26.080> but<00:01:27.070> when<00:01:27.550> people<00:01:27.850> look<00:01:28.000> at<00:01:28.090> these

2013 but when people look at these

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.910 
2013 but when people look at these
forecasts<00:01:28.750> they<00:01:28.780> see<00:01:28.960> high<00:01:29.290> numbers<00:01:29.620> for<00:01:29.800> beef

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920

forecasts they see high numbers for beef
and<00:01:30.130> veal<00:01:30.280> they<00:01:30.760> shouldn't<00:01:31.060> think<00:01:31.180> that's

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
and veal they shouldn't think that's

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.940 
and veal they shouldn't think that's
just<00:01:31.660> because<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.080> price<00:01:32.260> of<00:01:32.410> corn<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.710> going

just because the price of corn is going

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.710 
just because the price of corn is going
up<00:01:33.100> there<00:01:33.130> just<00:01:33.520> there<00:01:33.729> are<00:01:33.880> bigger<00:01:34.360> more

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
up there just there are bigger more
