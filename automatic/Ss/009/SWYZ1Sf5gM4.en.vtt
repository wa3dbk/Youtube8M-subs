00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.080
 Nowadays you spend a lot of time. 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.610
 to put small short distance and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.520
 this makes the consumption of 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.410
 fuel the engine connected to you 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.270
 It has a car of this as we are 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.950
 fighting here which is a complete vehicle 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.790
 with power steering with air 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.800
 conditioning 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.989
 these equipments will be consuming 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.780
 fuel without the father being 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.180
 shifting and that today is one of the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.719
 bigger problems in big capitals 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.570
 the other thing is also the condition of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.560
 gasoline with a 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 very large alcohol something with water and 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.890
 very high and this makes the car 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.740
 lose power and at the same time as this 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.500
 It is this water and that someone in excess 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.570
 is not converted into fuel in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.570
 lost fuel and feeds 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.820
 the spout is you do not stay the range of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.130
 car torque is car acceleration 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.230
 ideal for running gear 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.540
 if you shift gears with too much rotation 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.030
 low it will consume more if you 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 gear shift beyond rotation and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.040
 certified by the manufacturer also 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.570
 The same thing happens, so it's there to stay. 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.730
 a tip for users 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.280
 take a look at the manual there in the manual it 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.590
 will have the indicating the touch range 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 ideal of the institution of the image and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.880
 always use the march party in the cafe 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.280
 another tip for consumption of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 fuel is the verification of the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.950
 tire calibration and the use of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.690
 measure defined correctly as 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.479
 specified by the manufacturer in the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.030
 The vehicle you are going to do every week is 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.009
 the exact calibration of the vinyl check the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 use situation of the vehicle he is 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.810
 total load that will count on the partial 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.240
 okay and look at the rhythm which is also 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.670
 in the car manual as to Libya should 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.519
 to be used was the tire he is in 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.430
 low and low as we call it 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.420
 makes the car is is spend more 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.420
 floor fuel
