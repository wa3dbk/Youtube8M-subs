00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.440 
years ago and one of the first waters
that<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.380> picked<00:02:34.650> up<00:02:34.800> was<00:02:34.860> array<00:02:35.340> spring<00:02:36.240> water

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
that I picked up was array spring water

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.180 
that I picked up was array spring water
out<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.080> smoky<00:02:37.350> mountains<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.980> really

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
out of the smoky mountains that I really

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.890 
out of the smoky mountains that I really
like<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.520> way<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.850> packaging<00:02:39.330> was<00:02:39.420> done<00:02:39.600> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
like the way the packaging was done and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.750 
like the way the packaging was done and
so<00:02:40.650> what<00:02:40.860> i<00:02:40.890> thought<00:02:41.130> i<00:02:41.160> would<00:02:41.340> do<00:02:41.460> is<00:02:41.610> just

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
so what i thought i would do is just

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.660 
so what i thought i would do is just
start<00:02:42.000> collecting<00:02:42.450> different<00:02:42.570> bottles<00:02:43.140> oh
