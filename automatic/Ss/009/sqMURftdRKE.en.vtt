00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
hello this is the third video on index

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.200 
hello this is the third video on index
numbers<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:09.170> we<00:00:10.170> will<00:00:10.320> demonstrate

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
numbers and we will demonstrate

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.669 
numbers and we will demonstrate
calculation<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.360> last<00:00:12.750> payers<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.259> past<00:00:13.500> age

index using Microsoft actual let us

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.660 
index using Microsoft actual let us
recall<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.170> formula<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.160> need<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.430> find

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
recall the formula that we need to find

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.009 
recall the formula that we need to find
out<00:00:20.910> last<00:00:21.570> payers<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.020> past<00:00:22.260> days<00:00:22.410> index<00:00:24.019> we

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
out last payers and past days index we

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.220 
out last payers and past days index we
need<00:00:26.449> total<00:00:27.650> of<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.070> price<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.609> quantity<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.340 

then<00:00:34.640> we<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.760> need<00:00:35.940> basic<00:00:36.300> quantities<00:00:36.930> for

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.500 
what we need is P and Q 0 total so we
need<00:03:23.260> P<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.920> Q<00:03:24.160> due<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.370> total<00:03:24.520> which<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:24.970> here

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
need P and Q due to total which is here

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.230 
need P and Q due to total which is here
and<00:03:27.150> over<00:03:28.150> here<00:03:28.830> Q<00:03:29.830> 0<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.910> time<00:03:31.090> in

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
and over here Q 0 so all the time in

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.540 
and over here Q 0 so all the time in
case<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.540> last<00:03:31.750> payers<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.680> denominator<00:03:33.280> will

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
case of last payers the denominator will

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.270 
case of last payers the denominator will
be<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.760> same<00:03:33.940> P<00:03:34.450> naught<00:03:34.630> Q<00:03:34.959> 0<00:03:35.230> which<00:03:35.890> is<00:03:36.070> this

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
be the same P naught Q 0 which is this

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.280 
be the same P naught Q 0 which is this
and<00:03:36.840> case<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:38.020> past<00:03:38.200> days<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:39.310> will<00:03:39.550> be<00:03:39.870> P<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.080> Q

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
and case of past days it will be P and Q

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.880 
and case of past days it will be P and Q
in<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:42.280> one<00:03:42.430> in<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.910> last<00:03:43.120> column<00:03:43.530> divided<00:03:44.530> by

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
in the one in the last column divided by

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.270 
in the one in the last column divided by
P<00:03:45.640> naught<00:03:45.880> Q<00:03:46.150> 1<00:03:46.180> which<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:48.060> this<00:03:49.060> column<00:03:49.450> here

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
P naught Q 1 which is this column here

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.880 
P naught Q 1 which is this column here
now<00:03:51.280> we<00:03:52.030> also<00:03:52.209> need<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.600> multiply<00:03:52.780> them<00:03:53.260> by<00:03:53.470> a

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
now we also need to multiply them by a

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.910 
now we also need to multiply them by a
hundred<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:55.830> this<00:03:56.830> is<00:03:57.040> going<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.430> be<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:58.920> price

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
hundred so this is going to be the price

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.180 
hundred so this is going to be the price
index<00:04:00.270> using<00:04:01.270> last<00:04:01.480> pairs<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.890> our

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
index using last pairs and this is our

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.760 
index using last pairs and this is our
price<00:04:03.580> index<00:04:03.970> using<00:04:04.630> ASAE's<00:04:05.640> method<00:04:07.260> so<00:04:08.260> we

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
price index using ASAE's method so we

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.170 
price index using ASAE's method so we
can<00:04:08.920> put<00:04:09.130> them<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:10.540> order<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:12.730> is<00:04:12.970> going

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
can put them in order so this is going

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.800 
can put them in order so this is going
to<00:04:13.300> be<00:04:13.390> our<00:04:13.510> ear<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.670> this<00:04:15.670> will<00:04:15.850> be<00:04:16.030> say<00:04:16.270> lust

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
to be our ear and this will be say lust

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.350 
to be our ear and this will be say lust
pairs<00:04:18.870> index<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.230> here<00:04:21.190> we<00:04:21.370> have<00:04:21.549> path<00:04:21.850> J's

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.500 

method<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.600> then<00:04:26.640> we<00:04:27.640> will<00:04:27.880> keep<00:04:28.240> the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
method and then we will keep the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.250

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
relevant answers that we found so this

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.510 
relevant answers that we found so this

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
ear 1 we found last pairs this and

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.130 
ear 1 we found last pairs this and
passage<00:04:51.730> we<00:04:52.120> found<00:04:52.480> one<00:04:52.570> hundred<00:04:52.810> fourteen

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
passage we found one hundred fourteen

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.250 
passage we found one hundred fourteen
point<00:04:53.380> five<00:04:53.560> one<00:04:53.770> eight<00:04:53.980> nine<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:56.140> is

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
point five one eight nine so this is

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.550 
point five one eight nine so this is
basically<00:04:56.680> how<00:04:57.510> we<00:04:58.510> should<00:04:58.750> be<00:04:58.900> calculating

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
basically how we should be calculating

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.780 
basically how we should be calculating
last<00:05:00.040> payers<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.490> passage<00:05:01.920> index<00:05:02.920> using
