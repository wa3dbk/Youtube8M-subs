I<00:00:00.920> just<00:00:01.920> got<00:00:02.129> back<00:00:02.340> from<00:00:02.629> my<00:00:03.629> trip<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:06.379> my

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
I just got back from my trip and my

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.169 
I just got back from my trip and my
parents<00:00:07.740> picked<00:00:07.919> me<00:00:08.069> up<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.460> then<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.790> stayed

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
parents picked me up and then we stayed

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.209 
parents picked me up and then we stayed
at<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.929> campsite<00:00:11.120> growt<00:00:12.120> pond<00:00:12.980> campsite<00:00:13.980> in

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
at a campsite growt pond campsite in

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.070 
at a campsite growt pond campsite in
Vermont<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:18.470> last<00:00:19.470> time<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.770> ran<00:00:20.160> out<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.400> light

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
Vermont and last time I ran out of light

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.599 
Vermont and last time I ran out of light
so<00:00:22.699> this<00:00:23.699> time<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.600> see<00:00:25.160> my<00:00:26.160> gravity

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so this time you get to see my gravity

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.009 
so this time you get to see my gravity
filter<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.599> action<00:00:28.080> now<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:30.779> fill

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
filter in action now this is the fill

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.920 
filter in action now this is the fill
bag<00:00:32.930> closes<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> dry<00:00:34.590> bag<00:00:35.899> with<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
bag closes just like a dry bag with a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.069 
bag closes just like a dry bag with a
quick<00:00:37.680> attachment<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:40.489> inside<00:00:42.079> there's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
quick attachment here and inside there's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:01:14.160 
quick attachment here and inside there's
a<00:00:43.940> pre-filter

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.440 

these<00:01:15.220> two<00:01:16.220> parts<00:01:16.580> don't<00:01:16.850> come<00:01:17.120> with<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
these two parts don't come with the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.300 
these two parts don't come with the
filter<00:01:18.310> this<00:01:20.170> hydration<00:01:21.170> pack<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:22.010> the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
filter this hydration pack and the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:36.370 
filter this hydration pack and the
adapter<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.340> fits<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.330> it

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.950 

I<00:01:37.659> find<00:01:38.659> that<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.080> filter<00:01:39.350> can<00:01:39.830> be<00:01:39.860> slow

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
I find that this filter can be slow

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.780 
I find that this filter can be slow
until<00:01:41.960> it's<00:01:42.290> waterlogged<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.610> it's

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
until it's waterlogged and that it's

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.460 
until it's waterlogged and that it's
really<00:01:44.180> fast<00:01:45.220> sometimes<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.790> can<00:01:47.470> waterlog

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
really fast sometimes you can waterlog

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.020 
really fast sometimes you can waterlog
this<00:01:48.680> filter<00:01:49.159> by<00:01:52.330> actually<00:01:54.280> back<00:01:55.280> flushing<00:01:55.700> it

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
this filter by actually back flushing it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.310 
this filter by actually back flushing it
a<00:01:56.060> little<00:01:56.360> bit<00:01:58.330> like<00:01:59.330> right<00:01:59.659> when<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.020> filter

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
a little bit like right when you filter

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:10.779 
a little bit like right when you filter
it<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:05.270> should<00:02:05.509> take<00:02:05.690> maybe<00:02:08.649> 30<00:02:09.649> seconds<00:02:10.399> to

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
it this should take maybe 30 seconds to

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:26.009 
it this should take maybe 30 seconds to
fill<00:02:12.459> this<00:02:13.750> two<00:02:14.750> liter<00:02:15.080> bag<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:25.190> you're<00:02:25.370> done

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
fill this two liter bag and you're done

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:38.470 
fill this two liter bag and you're done
filtering<00:02:33.430> just<00:02:36.850> shake<00:02:37.850> up<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> water<00:02:38.360> a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
filtering just shake up the water a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.039 
filtering just shake up the water a
little<00:02:38.600> bit<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.140> dump<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.620> out<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.840> just

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
little bit and dump it out and you just

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.830 
little bit and dump it out and you just
backflow<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.100> little<00:02:46.340> bit<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.790> haven't<00:02:47.600> used

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
backflow it a little bit I haven't used

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.229 
backflow it a little bit I haven't used
