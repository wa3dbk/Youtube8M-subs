you<00:00:02.639> see<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.389> hosts<00:00:04.290> resist<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.370> invasion<00:00:05.640> of

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
you see how hosts resist the invasion of

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.430 
you see how hosts resist the invasion of
pathologies<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.810> first<00:00:07.020> lines<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.379> defense

but what happens if the patterns are

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
group of what this is we'll look at

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100 
group of what this is we'll look at
later<00:01:26.909> called<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> lymphocytes<00:01:27.750> these

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
later called the lymphocytes these

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
later called the lymphocytes these
produce<00:01:28.409> antibodies<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> humoral

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
produce antibodies and the humoral

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210 
produce antibodies and the humoral
response<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:31.500> we're<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.740> interest<00:01:32.040> them

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
response but we're not interest them

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.899 
response but we're not interest them
today<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.299> simply<00:01:34.490> comparison<00:01:35.490> between<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
today it's simply comparison between the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
today it's simply comparison between the
nuclei<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.570> look<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.320> famous<00:01:37.530> sites

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
nuclei if you look for famous sites

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.890 
nuclei if you look for famous sites
which<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.579> regular<00:01:39.000> globe<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
which kind of a regular globe and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.620 
which kind of a regular globe and
websites<00:01:40.500> which<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.220> rounds<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:41.970> way<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
websites which are rounds one way to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.620 
websites which are rounds one way to
tell<00:01:42.840> them<00:01:42.960> apart<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:44.299> let's<00:01:45.299> look<00:01:45.390> at<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
tell them apart so let's look at the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.100 
tell them apart so let's look at the
process<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.820> phagocytosis<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:49.020> are

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
process of phagocytosis so there are

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
process of phagocytosis so there are
five<00:01:49.290> steps<00:01:49.560> first<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.820> attraction

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
five steps first of these is attraction

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
five steps first of these is attraction
then<00:01:52.189> recognition<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.770> pathogen<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
then recognition of the pathogen and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.160 
then recognition of the pathogen and
attachment<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> Faga<00:01:56.969> site<00:01:57.270> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
attachment to the Faga site in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.740 
attachment to the Faga site in
government<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.219> where<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.750> failure

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
government which is where the failure

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.620 
government which is where the failure
site<00:02:00.930> actually<00:02:01.219> sort<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.360> wraps<00:02:03.360> itself

site actually sort of wraps itself

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.330

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.180 
the surface this is important later on
when<00:04:17.909> we<00:04:18.000> look<00:04:18.150> at<00:04:18.269> specific<00:04:18.979> responses<00:04:19.979> and

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
when we look at specific responses and

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.640 
when we look at specific responses and
so<00:04:20.970> let's<00:04:21.120> have<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.299> little<00:04:21.450> video<00:04:21.719> and<00:04:22.019> see<00:04:22.500> how

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
so let's have a little video and see how

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.690 
so let's have a little video and see how
this<00:04:22.770> process<00:04:23.400> works

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
this process works

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.410 
this process works
let's<00:04:26.420> take<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.810> back<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:29.000> can<00:04:29.150> see

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
let's take it back so you can see

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.700 
let's take it back so you can see
pathogens<00:04:30.230> attracted<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:32.030> touches<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:33.530> then

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
pathogens attracted it touches it then

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.060 
pathogens attracted it touches it then
starts<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.100> engulf<00:04:35.050> eventually<00:04:36.050> forming<00:04:36.530> this

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
starts to engulf eventually forming this

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.690 
starts to engulf eventually forming this
Vega<00:04:37.790> zones<00:04:38.090> bubble<00:04:39.070> around<00:04:40.070> these<00:04:40.490> the

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
Vega zones bubble around these the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.750 
Vega zones bubble around these the
lysosomes<00:04:41.240> or<00:04:41.600> blue<00:04:41.870> dots<00:04:42.620> which<00:04:43.370> will<00:04:43.580> then

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
lysosomes or blue dots which will then

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.460 
lysosomes or blue dots which will then
fuse<00:04:44.750> with<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.410> fake<00:04:45.620> same<00:04:45.940> fill<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.060> with

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
fuse with the fake same fill it with

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.830 
fuse with the fake same fill it with
hydrolytic<00:04:48.470> enzymes<00:04:49.330> free<00:04:50.330> radicals

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
hydrolytic enzymes free radicals

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.470 
hydrolytic enzymes free radicals
hydrogen<00:04:51.320> peroxide<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:52.370> pathogen<00:04:52.820> was

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
hydrogen peroxide and the pathogen was

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.140 
hydrogen peroxide and the pathogen was

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
digested and eventually anything that

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.510 
digested and eventually anything that
