00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
importance of color color is important

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.960 
importance of color color is important
apart<00:00:16.770> from<00:00:16.859> being<00:00:17.070> very<00:00:17.310> attractive<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> look

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
apart from being very attractive to look

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.480 
apart from being very attractive to look
at<00:00:18.180> because<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.900> tells<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.859> age<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> Y

wine and you can tell you a lot more

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.960 
wine and you can tell you a lot more
it's<00:00:24.630> important<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.109> realize<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.410> color

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
it's important to realize that color

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.730 
it's important to realize that color
comes<00:00:26.970> entirely<00:00:27.420> from<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.960> skins<00:00:28.260> it's<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
comes entirely from the skins it's the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.560 
comes entirely from the skins it's the
pigmentation<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.580> skins<00:00:29.939> which<00:00:30.179> brings

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
pigmentation in the skins which brings

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.560 
pigmentation in the skins which brings
the<00:00:30.750> color<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.800> white<00:00:32.099> wines<00:00:32.540> which<00:00:33.540> are

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the color and so white wines which are

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
the color and so white wines which are
basically<00:00:34.140> made<00:00:34.350> from<00:00:34.559> white<00:00:34.980> grapes<00:00:35.010> which

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
basically made from white grapes which

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
basically made from white grapes which
will<00:00:35.760> naturally<00:00:35.880> actually<00:00:36.390> green<00:00:36.780> when

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
will naturally actually green when

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.430 
will naturally actually green when
they're<00:00:37.260> picked<00:00:38.450> don't<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.719> any<00:00:39.899> color<00:00:40.170> when

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
they're picked don't have any color when

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.850 
they're picked don't have any color when
they<00:00:40.590> start<00:00:40.920> off<00:00:41.070> their<00:00:41.309> life<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:42.620> red<00:00:43.620> wines

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
they start off their life and red wines

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.560 
they start off their life and red wines
which<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:46.399> red<00:00:47.399> grapes<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> thin

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
which can have red grapes for the thin

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.869 
which can have red grapes for the thin
skin<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:49.170> will<00:00:49.379> add<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:50.129> color<00:00:50.430> or

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
skin which will add a little color or

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
skin which will add a little color or
red<00:00:51.239> grapes<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> very<00:00:52.020> thick<00:00:52.379> skin<00:00:52.559> which

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
red grapes for the very thick skin which

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.130 
red grapes for the very thick skin which
will<00:00:52.980> add<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> lot<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.399> color<00:00:53.640> our<00:00:54.140> macerated

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
will add a lot of color our macerated

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
will add a lot of color our macerated
during<00:00:55.440> fermentation<00:00:55.649> time<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.090> skins

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
during fermentation time on the skins

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
during fermentation time on the skins
for<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.870> 10<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> 15<00:00:58.289> days<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
for about 10 to 15 days so they have a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.660 
for about 10 to 15 days so they have a
very<00:00:59.579> slow<00:00:59.850> extraction<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> color<00:01:01.670> what

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
very slow extraction of color what

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.410 
very slow extraction of color what
happens<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:04.019> white<00:01:04.589> wines<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.850> they<00:01:06.150> age

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
happens with white wines is as they age

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.520 
happens with white wines is as they age
they<00:01:07.140> gain<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.799> color<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.930> what<00:01:09.930> happens<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
they gain in color and what happens the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.990 
they gain in color and what happens the
opposite<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.010> red<00:01:11.189> wines<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:11.820> aged

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
opposite with red wines as they aged

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.590 
opposite with red wines as they aged
they<00:01:12.450> lose<00:01:12.990> color<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.979> white<00:01:14.220> wines<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:15.000> said

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
they lose color so white wines are said

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
they lose color so white wines are said
technically<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> matter<00:01:16.680> eyes<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.369> color

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
technically to matter eyes that color

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.700 
technically to matter eyes that color
gets<00:01:18.030> fuller<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.930> fuller<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.259> fuller<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
gets fuller and fuller and fuller and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.380 
gets fuller and fuller and fuller and
then<00:01:19.920> brown<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> brown<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.820> branagh<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.240> look

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
then brown and brown and branagh to look

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.350 
then brown and brown and branagh to look
like<00:01:21.570> Madeira<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.170> red<00:01:22.860> wines<00:01:23.210> supposed<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
like Madeira and red wines supposed to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
like Madeira and red wines supposed to
oxidize<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.170> means<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:25.560> lose<00:01:25.770> color<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
oxidize which means they lose color and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.140 
oxidize which means they lose color and
to<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> point<00:01:27.119> they're<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.570> quite<00:01:27.810> pale

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150

be fresh fruity and dry we then look at

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.430 
be fresh fruity and dry we then look at
the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
little 70 on blonde but at the vastly

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.850 
little 70 on blonde but at the vastly
higher<00:02:17.130> proportion<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.820> Semyon<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.860> it's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
higher proportion of Semyon and it's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.460 
higher proportion of Semyon and it's
fermented<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.520> cask<00:02:20.780> whereas<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> 70<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.290> plan

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
fermented in cask whereas the 70 on plan

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.810 
fermented in cask whereas the 70 on plan
would<00:02:22.650> have<00:02:22.680> been<00:02:22.800> fermented<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.550> stainless

steel tank so no possible oxidation

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.350 
steel tank so no possible oxidation
there<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:27.630> golden<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.610> if<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.000> look<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
there it's golden and if you look at the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.630 
there it's golden and if you look at the
legs<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.020> wine<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.890> tears<00:02:32.190> which<00:02:32.460> go

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
legs on this wine the tears which go

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.130 
legs on this wine the tears which go
down<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.030> glass<00:02:33.210> which<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.870> very

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
down the glass which I can see very

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.800 
down the glass which I can see very
clearly<00:02:34.560> they're<00:02:35.370> very<00:02:35.580> thick<00:02:35.910> which<00:02:36.570> means

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
clearly they're very thick which means

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.690 
clearly they're very thick which means
even<00:02:37.200> without<00:02:37.410> smelling<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.280> tasting<00:02:38.580> it

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
even without smelling it and tasting it

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.160 
even without smelling it and tasting it
you<00:02:39.000> know<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.450> wine<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.840> going<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.080> be<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
you know that wine is going to be a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.600 
you know that wine is going to be a
sweet<00:02:40.410> wine<00:02:40.620> or<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.010> know<00:02:41.190> it's<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.550> be

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
sweet wine or you know it's going to be

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.320 
sweet wine or you know it's going to be
a<00:02:41.670> rich<00:02:41.850> wine<00:02:42.410> then<00:02:43.490> we<00:02:44.490> turn<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.970> Madeira

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
a rich wine then we turn to the Madeira

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.900 
a rich wine then we turn to the Madeira
2000<00:02:45.930> Madeira<00:02:46.410> which<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.770> actually<00:02:47.160> broad<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
2000 Madeira which is actually broad and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.110 
2000 Madeira which is actually broad and
that<00:02:48.720> has<00:02:49.050> become<00:02:49.260> Ron<00:02:49.740> it's<00:02:50.340> lived<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.850> cask

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that has become Ron it's lived in cask

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.720 
that has become Ron it's lived in cask
for<00:02:51.510> over<00:02:51.870> 20<00:02:52.170> years<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:53.100> has<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.550> colour

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
for over 20 years and it has the colour

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.840 
for over 20 years and it has the colour
has<00:02:54.470> Madurai<00:02:55.470> x'd<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.550> it's<00:02:56.760> a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
has Madurai x'd and so it's a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.550 
has Madurai x'd and so it's a
concentration<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.570> color<00:02:57.810> within<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> cask

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
concentration of color within the cask

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.520 
concentration of color within the cask
so<00:02:59.310> those<00:02:59.580> three<00:02:59.970> those<00:03:00.570> three<00:03:00.630> wines<00:03:01.050> are<00:03:01.350> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
so those three those three wines are the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.260 
so those three those three wines are the
many<00:03:01.710> million<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.220> wines<00:03:02.460> in<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.760> world<00:03:02.970> just

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
many million of wines in the world just

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.180 
many million of wines in the world just
show<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:04.200> gradation<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.740> color<00:03:04.800> which

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
show you the gradation of color which

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.910 
show you the gradation of color which
you<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.520> see<00:03:05.730> from<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.840> dry<00:03:07.290> young<00:03:07.680> wine

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you can see from a very dry young wine

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.110 
you can see from a very dry young wine
to<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> sweet<00:03:09.590> wine<00:03:10.590> at<00:03:10.770> five<00:03:10.980> years<00:03:11.100> old<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:12.090> a

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
can see as I said earlier that red wines

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.880 
can see as I said earlier that red wines
lose<00:03:40.170> color<00:03:40.560> with<00:03:40.980> age<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.000> first<00:03:42.300> wine

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890
