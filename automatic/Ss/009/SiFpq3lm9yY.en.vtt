the<00:02:46.530> point<00:02:46.709> where<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.010> can't<00:02:47.220> even<00:02:47.400> tell<00:02:47.550> it's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
the point where we can't even tell it's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.340 
the point where we can't even tell it's
a<00:02:47.730> video<00:02:47.850> game<00:02:47.970> anymore<00:02:48.330> when<00:02:48.959> we're<00:02:49.110> looking
