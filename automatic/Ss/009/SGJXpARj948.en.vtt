00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
just basically move these around to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
just basically move these around to
where<00:01:16.619> where<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.189> want<00:01:17.400> them<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.820> touch

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
where where you want them you can touch

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.940 
where where you want them you can touch
either<00:01:18.240> side<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> put<00:01:19.320> these<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
either side so you got to put these the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
either side so you got to put these the
right<00:01:20.070> color<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.580> both<00:01:20.610> spots<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.619> way

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
right color on both spots so that way

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.899 
right color on both spots so that way
doesn't<00:01:22.920> matter<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.280> side<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> user

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
doesn't matter what side the user

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.010 
doesn't matter what side the user
touches<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.640> got<00:01:30.060> 5<00:01:30.329> loaded<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.840> here

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
touches and then I got 5 loaded in here

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:42.370 
touches and then I got 5 loaded in here
so<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:31.890> left

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.590 

and<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.369> should<00:01:43.549> be<00:01:43.579> it<00:01:43.700> back<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.479> main

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
and that should be it back to the main

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.300 
and that should be it back to the main
menu<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.229> starts<00:01:45.469> over<00:01:45.560> again<00:01:45.710> none<00:01:46.280> of

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
the pictures repeat themselves once

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.230 
the pictures repeat themselves once
you're<00:01:48.829> out<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:48.979> pictures<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:49.670> goes<00:01:49.850> back<00:01:50.060> to

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240
