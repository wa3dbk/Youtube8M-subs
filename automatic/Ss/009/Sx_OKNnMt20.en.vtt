latest camera and it's x series lineup

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.890 
latest camera and it's x series lineup
and<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.800> direct<00:00:17.490> update<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> code<00:00:18.630> x

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
and it's a direct update to the code x

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.040 
and it's a direct update to the code x
20<00:00:19.529> camera<00:00:19.980> although<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.850> x<00:00:21.060> study<00:00:21.300> does<00:00:21.630> look

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
20 camera although the x study does look

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.769 
20 camera although the x study does look
a<00:00:22.230> lot<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.920> x20<00:00:23.850> there<00:00:24.029> are<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.570> major

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
a lot like the x20 there are some major

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.620 
a lot like the x20 there are some major
updates<00:00:25.410> especially<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.160> its<00:00:26.279> design<00:00:26.630> first

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
updates especially in its design first

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.509 
updates especially in its design first
off<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> camera<00:00:28.410> has<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> more<00:00:28.920> modern<00:00:29.279> look<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
off the camera has a more modern look to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.429 
off the camera has a more modern look to
it<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.599> there<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> lot

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
it so as you can see there are a lot

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.639 
it so as you can see there are a lot
more<00:00:31.470> straight<00:00:32.040> edges<00:00:32.610> around<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.120> camera

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
more straight edges around the camera

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.590 
more straight edges around the camera
the<00:00:34.649> dimensions<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> cam<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.210> slightly

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the dimensions of the cam are slightly

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.139 
the dimensions of the cam are slightly
larger<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.710> allows<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> hold<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.850> give

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
larger it allows you to hold and give

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.750 
larger it allows you to hold and give
the<00:00:39.300> camera<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.690> lot<00:00:39.899> better<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.469> fact<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.340> off

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the camera a lot better in fact it off

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.549 
the camera a lot better in fact it off
with<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> new<00:00:42.239> rubberized<00:00:42.840> grip<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.469> front

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
with a new rubberized grip in the front

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
with a new rubberized grip in the front
of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> camera<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.879> gives<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> nice

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
of the camera that gives you a nice

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
of the camera that gives you a nice
texture<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.469> when<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> hold<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> with

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
texture so that when you hold it with

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.990 
texture so that when you hold it with
one<00:00:47.489> hand<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> lot<00:00:48.420> easier<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:49.260> hold<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
one hand is a lot easier to hold now the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360 
one hand is a lot easier to hold now the
size<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> camera<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> also<00:00:52.559> largely<00:00:53.100> due

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
size of the camera is also largely due

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.979 
size of the camera is also largely due
to<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> fact<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.300> offers<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
to the fact that it now offers a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.520 
to the fact that it now offers a
high-capacity<00:00:55.590> battery<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.910> uses<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.270> same

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
high-capacity battery it uses the same

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.069 
high-capacity battery it uses the same
battery<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.550> x100<00:01:00.510> series<00:01:00.960> of

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
battery as you as the x100 series of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.770 
battery as you as the x100 series of
cameras<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> NP<00:01:01.980> 95<00:01:02.609> battery<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.660> going

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
cameras the NP 95 battery and it's going

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
cameras the NP 95 battery and it's going
to<00:01:03.870> allow<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.260> take<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> lot<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:04.979> shots<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
to allow you to take a lot more shots to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
to allow you to take a lot more shots to
charge<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.420> you're<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.570> running<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:07.110> at

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
charge so that you're not running out at
