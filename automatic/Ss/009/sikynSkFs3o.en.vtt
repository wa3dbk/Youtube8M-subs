way through now this one's a little bit

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.650 
way through now this one's a little bit
thicker<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.430> mean<00:01:24.610> it's<00:01:24.759> totally<00:01:24.970> up<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.330> you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
how thick you want it but just cooks

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.330 
how thick you want it but just cooks
easier<00:01:28.000> when<00:01:28.119> it's<00:01:28.270> thinner<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:29.070> I'll<00:01:30.070> show

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
easier when it's thinner and I'll show

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.190 
easier when it's thinner and I'll show
you<00:01:30.430> what<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.580> do<00:01:30.880> if<00:01:31.210> it's<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.570> bit<00:01:31.720> too<00:01:31.899> thick

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
to fix this you just get some plastic

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.920 
to fix this you just get some plastic
wrap<00:01:39.210> put<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.300> out<00:01:40.479> like<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:40.950> break<00:01:41.950> some<00:01:42.220> off

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
wrap put it out like that break some off

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.670 
wrap put it out like that break some off
put<00:01:43.930> fat<00:01:44.170> chicken<00:01:44.650> in<00:01:44.799> fold<00:01:45.700> plastic<00:01:46.240> over<00:01:46.680> get

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
put fat chicken in fold plastic over get

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.740 
put fat chicken in fold plastic over get
something<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.369> hit<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:48.700> with<00:01:48.850> or<00:01:49.090> roll<00:01:49.330> it<00:01:49.360> out

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
something to hit it with or roll it out

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.249 
something to hit it with or roll it out
and<00:01:51.240> feed<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.450> down<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.580> desired

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and feed it down to the desired

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.030 
and feed it down to the desired
thickness<00:01:58.229> okay<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.320> now<00:01:59.619> I'm<00:01:59.710> just<00:01:59.799> going<00:02:00.009> to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
thickness okay so now I'm just going to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.130 
thickness okay so now I'm just going to
grab<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.490> few<00:02:00.820> plates<00:02:01.119> I'm<00:02:01.509> going<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.750> break<00:02:01.960> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
grab a few plates I'm going to break the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.039 
grab a few plates I'm going to break the
egg<00:02:02.350> into<00:02:02.740> this<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:04.119> might<00:02:04.299> need<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.540> few<00:02:04.810> more

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
egg into this you might need a few more
