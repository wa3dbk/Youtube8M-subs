00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.240
 the focus of course has its 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.949
 roots in the smock appeal the brand 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.990
 founded by the multiple world champion 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.119
 Mike Wise with in the boat 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.860
 jÃ¶rg ahrens my sandbox game 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.329
 Colleagues from cologne with me in the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.099
 I am a cyclist 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.099
 painted urban is also on the fair 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.719
 in munich so multiple German 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.759
 crossmeister and now I am just standing 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:34.770
 in front of a cross wheel with andreas and am 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.300
 brand manager and that's a team bike 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.379
 namely the wheel of an American 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.430
 cross teams in which also the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.510
 American master drives 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.449
 It is a very nice bike with 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.620
 great paint from the team rafah the 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.489
 are so synonymous a bit for this 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.879
 pastel shades andreas the highlight of this 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.499
 bike which you think would be for 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.479
 you personally for me completely 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.510
 clearly the optics of course just that 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.190
 pastel tones the era focus on the team 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.400
 to be played in the jersey 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.680
 this pink this light blue that for me 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 a clear highlight and of course the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.409
 components 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.420
 yes I see the new road bike is 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.690
 So it is super easy to install 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.120
 Note the gradation of the chainrings 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.760
 a bit like the class of students 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.370
 46er chainring front in the 36th 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.820
 So that's how the u15 translations in 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.290
 today a full carbon frame 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.600
 with the brakes like that of course in the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.550
 cross-country saying is necessary the last 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.290
 this frame are comparable to 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.550
 the road frame or are the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.500
 completely different in the cross others 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.470
 loads are exactly natural 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.390
 they are adapted to the load 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.770
 There is a sport that is very clear 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 geometry is a bit too 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.240
 otherwise you have a higher bottom bracket 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.960
 because it just is not on the card 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.950
 road down but of course with 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.410
 a little bit clear, too, it's one 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.420
 original team advice because in the normal case 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.430
 Do not install any first wheels 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.930
 So there are the team wheels also 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.660
 carbon rims with glued 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.700
 hose what is left to say 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.060
 Too bad is dirty too 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.060
 make or
