00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
the ball size or notice now that it

the ball size or notice now that it
looks<00:01:54.320> smaller<00:01:54.679> than<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.979> baseball<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.700> that's

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
looks smaller than a baseball and that's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.340 
looks smaller than a baseball and that's
because<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.330> baseball<00:01:56.750> is<00:01:56.899> going<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.110> squeeze

in between there and shoot out so when

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.630 
in between there and shoot out so when
you're<00:01:59.750> shooting<00:02:00.250> softballs<00:02:01.250> are<00:02:01.429> pitching
