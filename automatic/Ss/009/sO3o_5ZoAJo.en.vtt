00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.880
 amortized work as a banking consultant monk not work experience 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.669
 thank you i know when i try to 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.499
 rightly letters and publicity 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.980
 the remaining god entrepreneur 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.180
 today if we want this is an online tire product I personally know 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.310
 three ways to buy it 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.640
 weight I can not participate in an auction that was low radiators 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.140
 or I can buy it for sofia sof 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.440
 today we want to introduce a new way 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.940
 hearing job wants to introduce and not create because the module we have created 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.960
 he, but let's take a little cue as he could with auctions 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.040
 first cue from the so-called cash which are the solidarity buying groups 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.100
 where bimbemble of people come together 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 to lose control perhaps for this 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.730
 we want to bring 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.750
 from the offline drug market tomorrow place of enjoyment 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.470
 how 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.660
 combining the strength of the social network 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.090
 dr the simplicity of purchase of the order and give life to the first social 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.740
 with March 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.780
 little and am very practical just boar 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.320
 and then exits 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 maybe today I want to buy a mobile phone and go directly from 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.930
 arms seller will open the fixed price 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 so there is no image bargaining but if I can't collect 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.670
 the request of multiple users 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.990
 the request for interventions what I do I go back to from 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 legal intervention looks before I was alone 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.110
 now that we are in 100 it depends on the group that seems to be creating 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.470
 nano what piece do you do 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.560
 so if I fall into bargaining spells 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.880
 and is with you the law of demand and the offer I have the mind 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.110
 the new price 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 at least modify the starting crazy for modified 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.820
 but also the seller wish an important negotiation in which 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.880
 so magicleghe 1 a shopkeeper a wholesaler a hadden merchant sold 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.970
 in 100 aifon edc see dozens of selling them 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:13.349
 iva majoli I come more to 600 euros - 500 euros but in what way 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.569
 I sell you all comes down together born currency 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.429
 oneminutes will have a set time 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:22.669
 because anyway 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 when above all a maximum number of users 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.329
 to me it seems only said that in the moment of crisis 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.629
 As a market there are opportunities 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.500
 I believe that this unjust choice and launch form fits 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.389
 because if I put a person not real needs to save 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.799
 we address to one billion users of daddy dance horns 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.149
 and looking for 20% of these indicators when used 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.149
 internet and to be able to buy products 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.479
 here is this cumulus 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.559
 I calculate some questions 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.309
 bye Bye 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:18.409
 right to a battle marked by telecom italia an idea exactly 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.989
 identical yours 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.879
 instead competing with this guy there are so many competitors 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.159
 the cute mohammedia social shopping though 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.959
 understand if it is made a little lentini trike by conversano web xd loves making money. 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.329
 I've been there by sector 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.779
 not just an idea 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.779
 baby girl I like just wanna dance like that 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.329
 graphics 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.219
 mother land register 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.819
 the only thing I wanted to ask you is how this service starts 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.269
 then mambo 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.269
 I translated how they are conventionally lost 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.519
 Anyway, I run away from it even when a social network app and cheer 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.099
 feisbuk twitter 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.099
 then interfaced 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.189
 few words lilly 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.680
 so should the passion be at cost
