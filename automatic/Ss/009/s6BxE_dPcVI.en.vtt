it<00:01:16.060> actually<00:01:16.300> is<00:01:16.630> very<00:01:16.810> simple<00:01:17.050> you<00:01:17.380> just<00:01:17.649> have

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
it actually is very simple you just have

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.969 
it actually is very simple you just have
to<00:01:18.100> take<00:01:18.280> one<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.119> leaves<00:01:19.360> okay<00:01:20.050> and<00:01:20.229> you

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
to take one of the leaves okay and you

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.400 
to take one of the leaves okay and you
will<00:01:21.130> see<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.399> it<00:01:21.580> has<00:01:21.610> these<00:01:22.420> incisions

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
will see that it has these incisions

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.130 
will see that it has these incisions
they<00:01:23.950> they<00:01:24.580> go<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:25.030> center<00:01:25.660> you<00:01:25.869> know

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
they they go to the center you know

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.710 
they they go to the center you know
there<00:01:26.380> they<00:01:26.740> are<00:01:26.800> very<00:01:27.160> very<00:01:27.399> clear<00:01:27.729> so<00:01:28.420> most

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
there they are very very clear so most

of the times when you see these and you
see<00:01:30.399> this<00:01:30.490> kind<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.820> shape<00:01:31.060> you'll<00:01:31.690> recognize

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
see this kind of shape you'll recognize

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.460 
see this kind of shape you'll recognize
a<00:01:32.470> cabernet<00:01:33.070> sauvignon<00:01:33.430> vine<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.930> now<00:01:35.080> the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
a cabernet sauvignon vine right now the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.090 
a cabernet sauvignon vine right now the
graves<00:01:35.890> are<00:01:36.130> still<00:01:36.430> very<00:01:36.789> green<00:01:37.149> but<00:01:38.100> when

this race mature more or less in October
time<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:43.030> become<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.720> know<00:01:43.840> very<00:01:44.550> compact

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
time they become you know very compact

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.090 
time they become you know very compact
and<00:01:45.850> at<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.179> same<00:01:46.390> time<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:47.140> graves<00:01:47.860> are

and<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:02.079> can<00:02:02.229> recognize<00:02:02.680> them<00:02:02.979> because<00:02:03.250> you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
and you can recognize them because you

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.630 
and you can recognize them because you
know<00:02:03.759> they<00:02:03.909> have<00:02:04.119> this<00:02:04.299> clear<00:02:04.630> color<00:02:05.640> master

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
plan is a single bin here but at the

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.090 
plan is a single bin here but at the
same<00:02:08.500> time<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:08.979> has<00:02:09.810> different<00:02:10.810> areas<00:02:11.440> with

same time it has different areas with

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.490 
same time it has different areas with
different<00:02:12.310> conditions<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.360> example<00:02:13.900> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
different conditions for example the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.560 
different conditions for example the
vines<00:02:14.829> that<00:02:14.980> are<00:02:15.160> more<00:02:15.459> closer<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.239> river

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
vines that are more closer to the river

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.039 
vines that are more closer to the river
this<00:02:17.350> one's<00:02:17.820> muscle<00:02:18.820> times<00:02:18.970> are<00:02:19.150> more<00:02:19.360> fertile

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
this one's muscle times are more fertile

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.130 
this one's muscle times are more fertile
okay<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.709> soils<00:02:21.250> are<00:02:21.340> more<00:02:21.640> deeper<00:02:22.269> well<00:02:22.900> if

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
okay the soils are more deeper well if

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.890 
okay the soils are more deeper well if
you<00:02:23.320> go<00:02:23.530> more<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.340> hillside<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.630> sauce

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
you go more to the hillside the sauce

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.740 
you go more to the hillside the sauce
then<00:02:26.140> become<00:02:26.500> more<00:02:26.709> compact<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:28.450> there
