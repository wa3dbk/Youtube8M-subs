better fourth quarters and really like
look<00:02:56.010> downfield<00:02:56.250> try<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.879> make<00:02:57.060> things<00:02:57.269> happen

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
look downfield try to make things happen

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.099 
look downfield try to make things happen
that<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:59.159> could<00:02:59.549> happen<00:02:59.579> if<00:03:00.120> he<00:03:00.510> put

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
that that could happen if he put

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.259 
that that could happen if he put
together<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.590> season<00:03:01.890> he<00:03:02.010> had<00:03:02.190> last<00:03:02.459> year<00:03:02.609> but

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
together the season he had last year but

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.729 
together the season he had last year but
played<00:03:03.540> better<00:03:03.810> down<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.200> stretch<00:03:04.379> in<00:03:04.560> some

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
played better down the stretch in some

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.869 
played better down the stretch in some
close<00:03:04.920> games<00:03:04.950> will<00:03:05.370> probably<00:03:05.640> having<00:03:05.790> a

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
close games will probably having a

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.360 
close games will probably having a
different<00:03:06.150> conversation<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:07.040> don't<00:03:08.040> know<00:03:08.250> if

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
different conversation I don't know if

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.190 
different conversation I don't know if
they<00:03:08.549> think<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:09.030> or<00:03:09.390> expect<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.170> happen

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
they think that or expect that to happen

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.750 
they think that or expect that to happen
they're<00:03:10.530> certainly<00:03:10.799> not<00:03:10.890> banking<00:03:11.459> on<00:03:11.609> it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
they're certainly not banking on it

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.520 
they're certainly not banking on it
because<00:03:12.120> they've<00:03:12.299> given<00:03:12.450> themselves<00:03:12.690> Matt

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
because they've given themselves Matt

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.259 
because they've given themselves Matt
Flynn<00:03:13.859> and<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.459> Russell<00:03:14.879> Wilson<00:03:15.180> as

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
Flynn and and Russell Wilson as

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.569 
Flynn and and Russell Wilson as
alternatives<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.440> think<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:16.950> tavaris<00:03:17.400> went

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
alternatives but I think if tavaris went

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.039 
alternatives but I think if tavaris went
out<00:03:17.669> there<00:03:17.819> and<00:03:17.880> looked<00:03:18.209> different<00:03:18.720> during

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
out there and looked different during

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.080 
out there and looked different during
the<00:03:19.109> preseason<00:03:19.319> than<00:03:19.709> he<00:03:19.799> has<00:03:19.980> which<00:03:20.790> is

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
the preseason than he has which is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.940 
the preseason than he has which is
unlikely<00:03:21.840> given<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.380> we've<00:03:22.530> seen<00:03:22.799> him

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
unlikely given that we've seen him

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.309 
unlikely given that we've seen him
extensively<00:03:23.549> we<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.510> three<00:03:24.780> by<00:03:24.930> far<00:03:25.169> he

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
extensively we of the three by far he

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.110 
extensively we of the three by far he
has<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> most<00:03:25.739> experience<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.430> don't<00:03:26.940> think

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
has the most experience I don't think

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.030 
has the most experience I don't think
they<00:03:27.180> expected<00:03:27.299> but<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:27.900> don't<00:03:28.109> think<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
they expected but I don't think that the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.280 
they expected but I don't think that the
door<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.280> closed<00:03:29.730> well<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.959> going<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.169> be<00:03:31.260> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
door is closed well it's going to be a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.780 
door is closed well it's going to be a
conversation<00:03:31.919> that's<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.310> continue<00:03:32.519> to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
conversation that's going to continue to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.670 
conversation that's going to continue to
go<00:03:32.970> on<00:03:33.000> training<00:03:33.510> camp<00:03:33.750> starts<00:03:34.049> july<00:03:34.379> twenty

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
go on training camp starts july twenty

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.839 
go on training camp starts july twenty
eighth<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.069> then<00:03:35.160> we'll<00:03:35.280> see<00:03:35.430> how<00:03:35.549> long<00:03:35.669> it

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
eighth and then we'll see how long it

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.610 
eighth and then we'll see how long it
takes<00:03:36.030> after<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:36.959> into<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.319> preseason

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
takes after that into the preseason

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.990 
takes after that into the preseason
before<00:03:38.010> they<00:03:38.099> make<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.280> choice<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.730> by<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.879> way

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
before they make a choice and by the way

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.830 
before they make a choice and by the way
you're<00:03:39.090> going<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.239> want<00:03:39.359> to<00:03:39.419> check<00:03:39.599> out<00:03:39.720> the

outtakes of this particular video

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.490
