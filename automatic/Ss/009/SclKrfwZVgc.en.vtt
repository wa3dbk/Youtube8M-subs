00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
more effectively in your negotiation so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
more effectively in your negotiation so
let's<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.590> started<00:00:46.710> by<00:00:47.100> talking<00:00:47.160> about<00:00:47.640> price

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
let's get started by talking about price

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.170 
let's get started by talking about price
let's<00:00:48.690> say<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.160> want<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.340> confront<00:00:50.910> your

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
let's say you want to confront your

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.959 
let's say you want to confront your
supplier<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:51.780> price<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.129> ideally<00:00:53.129> end<00:00:53.399> up

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
supplier by price and ideally end up

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.819 
supplier by price and ideally end up
with<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> better<00:00:54.420> price<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.469> end<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
with a better price at the end of the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.209 
with a better price at the end of the
day<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> could<00:00:57.329> say<00:00:57.570> something<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:58.219> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
day now you could say something like so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.660 
day now you could say something like so
I<00:00:59.250> guess<00:00:59.670> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.390> best<00:01:00.570> price<00:01:00.840> right

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
I guess this is your best price right

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
I guess this is your best price right
but<00:01:02.670> that's<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.210> weak<00:01:03.619> something<00:01:04.619> more

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but that's kind of weak something more

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
but that's kind of weak something more
powerful<00:01:05.299> would<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.780> show<00:01:07.110> more

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
powerful would be to show more

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.550 
powerful would be to show more
confidence<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:09.420> show<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:10.080> control

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
confidence and and show more control

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.649 
confidence and and show more control
over<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.920> negotiation<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.479> say

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
over the negotiation and you can say

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.830 
over the negotiation and you can say
something<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.260> I'm<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.760> convinced<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.570> we

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
something like I'm not convinced that we

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
something like I'm not convinced that we
have<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.409> best<00:01:16.740> price<00:01:17.220> proposal<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
have your best price proposal on the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.710 
have your best price proposal on the
table<00:01:19.400> much<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.670> confident<00:01:21.299> much<00:01:21.479> more

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
table much more confident much more

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.429 
table much more confident much more
powerful<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:23.189> likely<00:01:23.460> elicit<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.479> more

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
powerful and will likely elicit a more

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.520 
powerful and will likely elicit a more
open<00:01:25.860> response<00:01:26.700> from<00:01:26.909> your<00:01:27.090> supplier<00:01:27.530> let's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
open response from your supplier let's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530 
open response from your supplier let's
take<00:01:28.710> another<00:01:28.860> example<00:01:29.040> let's<00:01:30.030> say<00:01:30.240> you're

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
take another example let's say you're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.499 
take another example let's say you're
negotiating<00:01:31.500> several<00:01:32.490> terms<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:33.180> an

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
negotiating several terms of an

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.319 
negotiating several terms of an
agreement<00:01:34.100> now<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.159> might<00:01:35.549> say<00:01:35.820> something

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
agreement now you might say something

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.819 
agreement now you might say something
like<00:01:36.720> well<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.350> guess<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:39.259> lead<00:01:40.259> time<00:01:40.560> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
like well I guess that that lead time is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.510 
like well I guess that that lead time is
set<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.700> stone<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.439> what<00:01:43.439> else<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.860> negotiable

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
set in stone so what else is negotiable

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.350 
set in stone so what else is negotiable
about<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.240> proposal<00:01:46.310> again<00:01:47.310> pretty<00:01:48.030> weak

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
about your proposal again pretty weak

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.109 
about your proposal again pretty weak
pretty<00:01:48.780> weak<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:50.070> could<00:01:50.250> say<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:50.579> more

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
pretty weak you could say something more

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
pretty weak you could say something more
confident<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:52.920> power<00:01:53.130> something

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
confident to have more power something

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.660 
confident to have more power something
like<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.290> I'd<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.979> challenge<00:01:56.280> my

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
like you know I'd like to challenge my

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.940 
like you know I'd like to challenge my
assumptions<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.200> those<00:01:58.469> assumptions

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
assumptions in one of those assumptions

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.959 
assumptions in one of those assumptions
is<00:01:59.520> that<00:02:00.420> there's<00:02:01.170> no<00:02:01.500> flexibility<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.640> lead

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
is that there's no flexibility in lead

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.539 
is that there's no flexibility in lead
time<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.079> let's<00:02:04.469> challenge<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.130> assumption

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
time so let's challenge that assumption

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.150 
time so let's challenge that assumption
let's<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> table<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> see<00:02:07.469> you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
let's get it on a table and and see you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.010 
let's get it on a table and and see you
know<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> true<00:02:08.879> picture<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.479> with

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
know what the true picture is with

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.320 
know what the true picture is with
regard<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> lead<00:02:10.830> time<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.160> how<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.970> might<00:02:12.150> be

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
regard to lead time and how it might be

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.190 
regard to lead time and how it might be
able<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.780> improve

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
able to be improve
