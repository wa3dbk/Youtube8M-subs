00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.739
 Hello everyone and am betty 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.620
 welcome once again to my channel today 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:08.929
 I bring you an old school gameplay that 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.200
 He called when everyone went to the 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.669
 cabbage with normally with the m-40 for one 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.379
 formerly, many were also used 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.030
 bars with the bow that I do not like 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.760
 a lot because accuracy is the truth 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.820
 that goes down quite a bit and well I will explain 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.520
 a little bit how to play sniper 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.830
 It makes me tell you that I tell you three years 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.990
 more or less before it was implanted 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.100
 the rule that if you went with a bow that 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.560
 you were good player and just what 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.900
 I am going to count, because they are experiences 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.260
 you know I've had a lot with this 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.839
 Youtube 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.680
 I'm going to explain a little how you can 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.379
 before montages leave in the description 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.539
 as much mine as of other people that equal 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.180
 you do not know now but yes they were 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.360
 important in your day for example the bon 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.549
 ixe operator perry and well I could 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.670
 say countless of them I do not know if 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:06.960
 also that the zinc channel today 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.600
 it is used for assemblies or excess of other 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.899
 people that good because they will be the most 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.470
 important in the past and today I'm going to 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.690
 tell a little bit of what it was about 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.659
 formerly and today the same is done 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.539
 also not but not so much with something that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.409
 formerly it was looking for 12 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.299
 people or 18 in a land war 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.819
 they were all with him and pedrosa were what 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.000
 it was called the spice per lo vi and good 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.069
 because that was trying to make who fitz 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.460
 but not of four but of kits of a 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.250
 know how many deaths 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.990
 what happens what happened with those 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.020
 they are there but I saw that there were many setup 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.119
 and what about recipes because I do not know 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.820
 He recognized exactly as a player 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.650
 not then a good player was a 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.900
 person who got a click 78 but 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.300
 Of course it happens that these people are 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.149
 they really let themselves be killed then 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.670
 Then he did not see them and 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.990
 they said not like that and not less with acts 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.630
 then the first person who changed 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.850
 to regular good the regular with what 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.400
 it would be if I was the cob was jacques I'm 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.290
 sure you know now what else does 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.530
 She is a very important person 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.600
 that separates a little from optique because 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.560
 You already know what hats he was in 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.780
 optics 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.500
 and well, they were two of the first 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.680
 people to use as the regular scouts 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.570
 and good from then on, but 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.730
 changing things were no longer done 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.710
 so many is hyper I saw it was frowned upon 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.080
 if there was a person he would upload a montage 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.240
 with a co it was a topic it is 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.430
 those who and good were left to do the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.870
 sniper I saw it in simply with your 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.470
 team then good where ever in a 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.440
 such dominance what happens what good 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.360
 also first of all the first person 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.090
 that I saw that I was doing this because it's the same 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.700
 sure you know her now is the grid 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.620
 what happens to me a little bit like me 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.140
 except me talking about in the community 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.650
 Spanish that was a bit the pioneer and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.290
 then everyone started doing it 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.140
 It happened a little like me not 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.840
 he was the pioneer and then there were people 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.849
 It's not that I did better because 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.950
 you know that mounts say gray then 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.650
 they have millions of visits only one 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.890
 has millions of visits and that's why 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.930
 because he threw it initially paid to 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.640
 him when he started to like an assembly 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.040
 every three months but then it started to 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.659
 do it every six months every year and at 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.340
 less for me that's what left me 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.870
 like him but then if he took a 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.120
 assembly of three parts but good is 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.590
 it was eternal and I did not like that anymore 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.670
 today circuit continues to make more than 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.720
 that 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.130
 gameplays with because it's like what we 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.330
 has happened to the whole world we started with 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.160
 the assemblies I did not do before 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.870
 comments you have in the comments 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.550
 I started doing English then no longer 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.550
 I passed it to Spanish but the same thing happens to me 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.720
 and is that when going from the assemblies 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.820
 weekly to the engine 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.210
 to comments although it is what also 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.730
 it's not starting now but it's what 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.520
 who is liking more now because 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.620
 you really see if a person is good or 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.420
 no and then because the comment is 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.700
 center entertaining because you fucking mother 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.650
 do not 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.870
 well I have few deaths left is not 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.310
 a gameplay of the best because I said 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.640
 well let's get us a job with 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.950
 arc for the topic that I'm taking today 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.560
 and it takes a long time without playing with 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.960
 the bow almost that is not a big one is good 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.340
 It's not bad, it 's not bad, you know that 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.490
 I do not care about the deaths that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.130
 have now it's running out 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.290
 I remember that below you will have what 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.560
 first then my montage is a stick or 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.770
 three will leave and then of people who 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.740
 the snyder community was important 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.389
 because the past you see it and then already 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.090
 you comment missing is that it has been 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.909
 bully 20 I hope you leave comments 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.440
 I like it and you know all that is 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.550
 doing returns for mister bolivia a 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.550
 greeting and until next time
