can't stand each other these are

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.100 
can't stand each other these are
actually<00:06:26.180> pretty<00:06:26.270> challenging<00:06:26.600> we're<00:06:26.990> going

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
actually pretty challenging we're going

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.930 
actually pretty challenging we're going
to<00:06:27.170> show<00:06:27.260> you<00:06:27.290> couple<00:06:27.560> ways<00:06:27.800> to<00:06:27.830> do<00:06:28.160> these<00:06:28.280> but
