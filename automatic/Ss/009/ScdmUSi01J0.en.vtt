 buy the boot to take care of the action or the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.880
 mercury I recommend you buy 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.579
 America and especially if you are 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.799
 playing against a champion of ours 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.560
 fourth item will be defensive you can 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.110
 opt for the ranking or armor of the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.049
 org and for the last two items you 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.050
 will make the black cleaver and last breath 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.920
 remember that the guardian angel is always a 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.110
 good option 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.590
 the choice of the good day because it is a 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.930
 champion 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.870
 enough volatile you can use it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.599
 both in the top and in the midi with the same 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.160
 efficiency or difficulty 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.010
 those champions who can 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.580
 to approach for several consecutive times as 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.680
 idea, there was yes in return 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.220
 the choice of plaster is good against champions 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.930
