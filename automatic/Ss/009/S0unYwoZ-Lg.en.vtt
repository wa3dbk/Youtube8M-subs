00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
three different quality levels on my

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.130 
three different quality levels on my
camera<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.549> film<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.909> i<00:01:24.090> always<00:01:24.630> film<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.080> the

camera to film in i always film in the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
camera to film in i always film in the
lowest<00:01:25.470> quality<00:01:25.799> level<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
lowest quality level just because it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
lowest quality level just because it
takes<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> least<00:01:27.689> time<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.140> upload<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:29.280> is

takes the least time to upload this is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.660 
takes the least time to upload this is
this<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.540> highest<00:01:31.290> i'm<00:01:31.670> filming

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670

this is actually the highest i'm filming
in<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.390> supposedly<00:01:33.960> its<00:01:34.290> HD

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
in right now it's supposedly its HD

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.710 
in right now it's supposedly its HD
filling<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.790> HD<00:01:36.090> i'm<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.360> sure<00:01:36.479> how<00:01:36.570> it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720

likely this is actually going to take

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.999 
likely this is actually going to take
probably<00:01:41.869> who<00:01:42.869> knows<00:01:43.110> how<00:01:43.350> long<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.770> upload

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.880 
probably who knows how long to upload
even<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> lowest<00:01:45.360> quality<00:01:45.680> level<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.770> my

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
even on the lowest quality level on my

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.069 
even on the lowest quality level on my
camera<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.460> 10<00:01:48.000> minute<00:01:48.210> video<00:01:48.299> takes<00:01:48.689> me<00:01:48.840> close

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
camera a 10 minute video takes me close

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.069 
camera a 10 minute video takes me close
to<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.320> hour<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:50.040> upload<00:01:50.630> which<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> very

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to an hour to upload which is a very

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.420 
to an hour to upload which is a very
very<00:01:52.200> long<00:01:52.320> time<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.250> that's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
very long time I don't know if that's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.179 
very long time I don't know if that's
because<00:01:53.520> YouTube<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.450> slow<00:01:54.659> or<00:01:54.979> if<00:01:55.979> it's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
because YouTube is just slow or if it's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.350 
because YouTube is just slow or if it's
because<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.430> lot<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> people<00:01:56.729> are<00:01:56.939> uploading<00:01:57.149> at

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
because a lot of people are uploading at

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.270 
because a lot of people are uploading at
the<00:01:57.420> same<00:01:57.570> time<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.200> always<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the same time but I always have it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.649 
the same time but I always have it
always<00:01:59.460> takes<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.729> very<00:01:59.850> long<00:01:59.969> time<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.479> upload

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
always takes a very long time to upload

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.520 
always takes a very long time to upload

you know let me know of course if if it

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.580 
you know let me know of course if if it
takes<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.430> little<00:02:18.730> bit<00:02:18.909> longer<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.569> upload<00:02:19.930> but

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
takes a little bit longer to upload but

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.190 
takes a little bit longer to upload but
not<00:02:20.829> anything<00:02:21.549> ridiculous<00:02:21.909> I'll<00:02:22.480> continue

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
filming in a higher quality level for

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.959 
filming in a higher quality level for
the<00:02:25.269> most<00:02:25.420> part<00:02:25.629> even<00:02:26.019> in<00:02:26.170> HD<00:02:26.499> I<00:02:27.129> can't<00:02:27.760> get

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
the most part even in HD I can't get

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.539 
the most part even in HD I can't get
close<00:02:28.329> up<00:02:28.409> detail<00:02:29.409> now<00:02:29.829> I'm<00:02:30.069> really<00:02:30.219> close<00:02:30.459> to

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
close up detail now I'm really close to

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.949 
close up detail now I'm really close to
the<00:02:30.579> camera<00:02:30.790> here<00:02:30.909> i'm<00:02:31.090> sure<00:02:31.420> that's<00:02:31.629> probably

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the camera here i'm sure that's probably

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.309 
the camera here i'm sure that's probably
a<00:02:32.049> fuzzy<00:02:32.650> looking<00:02:33.219> finger<00:02:33.569> for<00:02:34.569> some<00:02:34.719> reason<00:02:35.109> i

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
a fuzzy looking finger for some reason i

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.709 
a fuzzy looking finger for some reason i
can't<00:02:35.859> get<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.549> it's<00:02:36.819> just<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.420> camera

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
can't get it to it's just the camera

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.110 
can't get it to it's just the camera
itself<00:02:37.810> won't<00:02:38.349> get<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.829> that<00:02:39.609> close<00:02:39.879> detail

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
itself won't get that that close detail

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.059 
itself won't get that that close detail
it<00:02:40.689> will<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.260> pictures<00:02:41.620> without<00:02:41.829> in

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
it will with the pictures without in

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.459 
it will with the pictures without in
video<00:02:42.310> format<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.150> unfortunately<00:02:44.139> i<00:02:44.230> still

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
can't get real close but the overall

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.569 
can't get real close but the overall
picture<00:02:46.629> should<00:02:47.019> be<00:02:47.230> better<00:02:47.469> if<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:48.099> is<00:02:48.219> let<00:02:48.489> me

something pretty cool how it works is

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.679 
something pretty cool how it works is
once<00:03:09.250> i<00:03:09.430> get<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.639> one<00:03:09.879> hundred<00:03:09.969> dollars<00:03:10.419> then

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
once i get to one hundred dollars then

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.119 
once i get to one hundred dollars then
