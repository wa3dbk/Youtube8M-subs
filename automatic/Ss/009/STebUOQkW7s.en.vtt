new motors the object of this little
course<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.480> pick<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> four<00:00:25.500> blue<00:00:26.310> tubes

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
course is to pick up the four blue tubes

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.769 
course is to pick up the four blue tubes
bring<00:00:27.720> them<00:00:27.869> over<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.670> White<00:00:29.670> goal<00:00:30.000> drop

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
bring them over to the White goal drop

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.729 
bring them over to the White goal drop
one<00:00:31.109> at<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.890> time<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.739> with

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
one at a time for the first two with

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
one at a time for the first two with
about<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.980> second<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.550> between<00:00:35.880> each<00:00:35.910> drop

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
about a second in between each drop

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
about a second in between each drop
showing<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.440> control<00:00:37.980> them<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
showing that we can control them and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.510 
showing that we can control them and
then<00:00:39.090> drop<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> remaining<00:00:39.960> two<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:41.190> will<00:00:41.309> then

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
then drop the remaining two it will then

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.549 
then drop the remaining two it will then
back<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:44.120> track<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> line<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.140> line

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
back up and track the line with the line

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.540 
back up and track the line with the line
sensors<00:00:47.070> until<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> bumps<00:00:47.879> into<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
sensors until it bumps into the this a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.350 
sensors until it bumps into the this a
frame<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> frame<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> mock-up<00:00:53.879> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
frame and the a frame is a mock-up of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.279 
frame and the a frame is a mock-up of
the<00:00:54.719> actual<00:00:55.670> ladder<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:57.030> used<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the actual ladder that's used in the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
the actual ladder that's used in the
round<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.739> game<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.789> will<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.120> try<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
round up game it will then try to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.549 
round up game it will then try to
attempt<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.289> low<00:01:02.010> hang<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.049> we'll<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> lucky<00:01:04.350> if

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
attempt a low hang and we'll be lucky if

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.950 
attempt a low hang and we'll be lucky if
it<00:01:04.680> does<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:06.060> goes<00:01:07.040> I've<00:01:08.040> also

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
it does it but here goes I've also

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.410 
it does it but here goes I've also
programmed<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.080> nice<00:01:10.260> convenient<00:01:10.650> feature

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
programmed a nice convenient feature

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.560 
programmed a nice convenient feature
with<00:01:12.420> these<00:01:13.310> five<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.640> six<00:01:14.939> switches<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
with these five and six switches that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.899 
with these five and six switches that
are<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> front<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.430> vex<00:01:17.700> joystick

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
are on the front of the the vex joystick

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
are on the front of the the vex joystick
by<00:01:21.320> touching<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.700> upper<00:01:24.119> two<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.950> holding

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
by touching the upper two and holding

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
by touching the upper two and holding
them<00:01:26.040> down<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.520> three<00:01:26.700> seconds<00:01:27.180> I'll<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
them down for three seconds I'll do that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.359 
them down for three seconds I'll do that
one<00:01:28.020> two<00:01:28.439> three<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.180> arm<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.439> autonomous<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
one two three you arm the autonomous and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.550 
one two three you arm the autonomous and
then<00:01:33.380> touching<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.310> upper<00:01:35.840> six<00:01:36.840> switch<00:01:37.170> or

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
then touching the upper six switch or

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.950 
then touching the upper six switch or
they<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.100> run<00:01:38.759> continuously<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
they you run continuously on the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
they you run continuously on the
autonomous<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.890> step<00:01:41.159> through<00:01:41.369> each

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
autonomous or you can step through each

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.300 
autonomous or you can step through each
step<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.200> touch<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.649> lower<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.270> then

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
step if you touch the lower one and then

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.219 
step if you touch the lower one and then
after<00:01:47.310> its<00:01:47.430> armed<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.149> top<00:01:48.689> switch<00:01:48.990> will

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
after its armed the top switch will

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.789 
after its armed the top switch will
disconnect<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.890> again<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.909> any<00:01:51.030> time<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.799> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
disconnect it again at any time and the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.350 
disconnect it again at any time and the
bottom<00:01:53.189> switch<00:01:53.600> will<00:01:54.600> enable<00:01:55.790> each<00:01:56.790> step<00:01:57.149> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
bottom switch will enable each step and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.719 
bottom switch will enable each step and
if<00:01:58.020> you're<00:01:58.200> running<00:01:58.530> continuously<00:01:58.920> when<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
if you're running continuously when you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.090 
if you're running continuously when you
hit<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.450> continuously<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.950> we'll

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
hit it it will go continuously so we'll

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:13.480 
hit it it will go continuously so we'll
give<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> shot<00:02:03.229> here<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.350> go

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:36.870
