00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 good morning friends i am rubÃ©n and 17 and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.569
 we are in a new career of gt5 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.309
 online with subscribers and guys like 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 I'm seeing I have the center here 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.639
 press and cream and let's see how we 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.410
 in this race here visiting 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.450
 Participants are, by the way, many 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.789
 thank you all for participating and good 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.830
 let's see the race starts as you see 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.930
 a single round is worth one round 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
 because the circuit is like five 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.820
 kilometers and it's a mega raid 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.189
 long it's worth seeing in the thumbnail 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.470
 then I have only put one 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.640
 back because I do not know I think it's going to be 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.829
 very dodgy so just in case he has 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 put one lap worth Germany 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.320
 it went ahead perfect good 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.660
 for the moment I'm going second let's see and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.280
 come eye come, see you later gone 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 a little bit later they told me 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.390

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.129

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 you want let's go yes sir so that corduroy 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.969
 so that the first panas that now 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.100
 they arrive they push me by tornado happened nothing 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.890
 come every enough data and now we 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.790
 let's see all the faces in the lupine 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.710
 in the world pride 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.330
 now with this concentrate environment 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.120
 for this man I do not have for the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.940
 inside and we eat the wall 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.940
 let's see the rapid 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.920
 to the point that from the point to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.770
 it's down there 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.770
 we did not start it and 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.299
 If there is a stone in the path, it has 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.520
 I had to eat me or it is very 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.240
 strong 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.280
 instead of falling into your listen we go there 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.899
 if it is what I say now even though 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.509
 last nothing happens we will see the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.880
 faces and the first one to pass the world 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.469
 race will be the one that wins that is that now 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.289
 we will see each other for the moment 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.549
 I'm banking that you're going 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.689
 I'm going fifth that really is last 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.920
 because there is one that has been stopped 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.009
 in the goal I do not know why 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.530
 that is, he is here in a quiet plan doing 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.680
 act of presence is valid but it is already 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.960
 and as I say we are really going to see why 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.550
 now in the world we have really not 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.319
 let's see really I do not know how much is left 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.160
 it remains to see I will have that we have to 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.720
 to be arriving and it's really worth we have 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.860
 this point is worth 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.680
 look of shawal you have seen and if damn 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.250
 wallride that is, but that is just 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.250
 huge 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:35.500
 6 because seriously 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.490
 Everybody here 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.870
 Let's see 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.760
 we have to get to the bit already really 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.560
 to get to some king 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.250
 and we jump around here we leave the car and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.379
 there is the perfect tree 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.750
 is approaching is approaching is 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.090
 about the time in world rising 2 is 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.780
 about the moment walt drive 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.550
 I'm not seeing anymore I'm not seeing no 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.519
 I fear one has already started some king 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.849
 another is beginning what comes next keep 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.310
 guys who come crashing crash 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.060
 worth comes the won ride comes the world 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.739
 race 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.290
 peak just tell me that I enjoy the 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.069
 first tell me what happened to me the first 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.930
 We must not believe and I pass it to the whore 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.180
 first let's go yes sir why the hell 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.640
 I'd better go last the whole race if 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.760
 then I pass it to the damn first 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.769
 so that nothing is not worth going last 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.920
 for nothing because we get in the goal 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.680
 and we won the mother race of mine 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.870
 then they say what they want me 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.480
 I just passed the super long king goal to 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.220
 the damn first goddess even had 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.500
 than having put it two laps even 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.060
 but well then this round he played a 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.590
 short poquillo the meat is the truth 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.349
 but well nothing happens 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.790
 but if nothing happens, so it's good 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.019
