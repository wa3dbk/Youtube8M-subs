her<00:02:22.950> lashes<00:02:23.250> look<00:02:23.760> carefully<00:02:25.130> same<00:02:26.130> thing<00:02:26.430> I

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
her lashes look carefully same thing I

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:39.710 
her lashes look carefully same thing I
always<00:02:26.549> do<00:02:27.090> before

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.400 

I<00:02:39.780> don't<00:02:40.770> use<00:02:41.180> liquid<00:02:42.180> eyeliner<00:02:42.810> because<00:02:43.110> it

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
I don't use liquid eyeliner because it

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.260 
I don't use liquid eyeliner because it
comes<00:02:43.650> out<00:02:43.800> too<00:02:44.070> dark<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.520> too<00:02:44.610> harsh<00:02:44.970> and

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
comes out too dark and too harsh and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.700 
comes out too dark and too harsh and
then<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.110> can<00:02:46.290> look<00:02:46.880> kind<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.000> two<00:02:48.390> made<00:02:48.660> up<00:02:48.710> so

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
then it can look kind of two made up so

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.470 
then it can look kind of two made up so
that's<00:02:49.950> why<00:02:50.100> I'm<00:02:50.190> using<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.610> cream<00:02:50.850> liner<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that's why I'm using a cream liner and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.020 
that's why I'm using a cream liner and
just<00:02:51.720> adding<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.200> little<00:02:52.230> more<00:02:52.620> water<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.790> let's

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
just adding a little more water so let's
