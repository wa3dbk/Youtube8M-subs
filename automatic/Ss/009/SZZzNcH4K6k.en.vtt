at<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.720> point<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.080> time<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.590> am<00:03:05.360> almost<00:03:06.360> back

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
at this point in time I am almost back

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.600 
at this point in time I am almost back
to<00:03:06.989> full<00:03:07.020> recovery<00:03:07.980> I'm<00:03:08.220> allowed<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.489> do

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
to full recovery I'm allowed to do

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.150 
to full recovery I'm allowed to do
anything<00:03:08.849> except<00:03:09.390> for<00:03:09.420> contact<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.530> head<00:03:11.040> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
anything except for contact and head the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.000 
anything except for contact and head the
ball<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:12.410> guess<00:03:13.410> I've<00:03:13.560> learned<00:03:13.860> that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
ball I guess I've learned that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.800 
ball I guess I've learned that
concussions<00:03:14.520> are<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.700> lot<00:03:14.849> more<00:03:14.880> serious<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.480> I

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
concussions are a lot more serious and I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.890 
concussions are a lot more serious and I
thought<00:03:16.230> they<00:03:16.380> were<00:03:17.060> at<00:03:18.060> first<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.510> thought

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
thought they were at first I thought

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.660 
thought they were at first I thought
that<00:03:19.080> if<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.410> got<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.680> concussion<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.370> just

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
that if I got a concussion I just

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.850 
that if I got a concussion I just
bounced<00:03:21.270> back<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.750> go<00:03:22.140> back<00:03:22.319> on<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.680> field

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
bounced back and go back on the field

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.370 
bounced back and go back on the field
and<00:03:23.130> now<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.640> realize<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.450> they<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:24.930> any

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and now I realize that they do any

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.740 
and now I realize that they do any
seasons<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.610> never<00:03:27.270> thought<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.630> that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
seasons and I never thought that that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:53.650 
seasons and I never thought that that
actually<00:03:27.959> happened<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:29.250> obviously<00:03:29.370> did

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.720
