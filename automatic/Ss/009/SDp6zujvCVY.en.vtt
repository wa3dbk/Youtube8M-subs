toss the idea out the window the next

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.289 
toss the idea out the window the next
one<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> looked<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.180> was<00:01:09.180> uh<00:01:11.000> what<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
one I looked at was uh what was it

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
one I looked at was uh what was it
called<00:01:12.770> fatality<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.900> looked<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> very

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
called fatality I it looked like a very

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.630 
called fatality I it looked like a very
nice<00:01:17.400> headset<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.990> only<00:01:19.200> thing<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.189> didn't

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
nice headset the only thing is it didn't

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.990 
nice headset the only thing is it didn't
use<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> USB<00:01:23.330> cable<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.659> used<00:01:25.340> these<00:01:26.340> adapters

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
use a USB cable it used these adapters

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.109 
use a USB cable it used these adapters
and<00:01:27.470> for<00:01:28.470> me<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.860> guess<00:01:28.979> my<00:01:29.280> sound<00:01:29.549> card<00:01:29.640> can't

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and for me I guess my sound card can't

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.590 
and for me I guess my sound card can't
really<00:01:30.360> can't<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.790> use<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.450> their

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
really can't really use these to their

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440 
really can't really use these to their
full<00:01:33.810> potential<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.850> couldn't<00:01:36.329> really

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
full potential and so I couldn't really

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.200 
full potential and so I couldn't really
use<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:38.579> next<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.060> looked<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.509> was
