00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
welcome to the hello origami tutorial

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.840 
welcome to the hello origami tutorial
for<00:00:03.840> making<00:00:04.110> an<00:00:04.200> envelope<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.490> gonna<00:00:05.730> be

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
for making an envelope this is gonna be

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.849 
for making an envelope this is gonna be
ideal<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.450> taking<00:00:06.810> notes<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.350> sending<00:00:07.710> them

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
ideal for taking notes and sending them

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.740 
ideal for taking notes and sending them
you're<00:00:08.069> folding<00:00:08.220> them<00:00:08.460> up<00:00:08.580> we'll<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.360> using<00:00:09.540> an

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
you're folding them up we'll be using an

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.600 
you're folding them up we'll be using an
a4<00:00:09.929> proportion<00:00:10.860> piece<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.160> paper

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
a4 proportion piece of paper

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.919 
a4 proportion piece of paper
so<00:00:12.509> how<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> letter<00:00:13.440> written<00:00:13.650> there<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
so how have a letter written there the

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.050 
so how have a letter written there the
first<00:00:15.929> thing<00:00:16.139> we'll<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.560> doing<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:17.310> folding<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
first thing we'll be doing is folding a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:29.060 
first thing we'll be doing is folding a
piece<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.420> paper<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.960> half<00:00:19.320> like<00:00:20.220> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.159 

I<00:00:29.099> need<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.060> make<00:00:30.150> sure<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> particular

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
I need to make sure that this particular

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.060 
I need to make sure that this particular
crease<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:32.040> quite<00:00:32.640> straight<00:00:33.090> quite<00:00:33.600> tight

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
crease is quite straight quite tight

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.920 
crease is quite straight quite tight
very<00:00:35.070> strong

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.860 

it<00:00:42.500> will<00:00:42.620> unfold<00:00:42.980> that<00:00:43.220> and<00:00:43.420> now<00:00:44.420> we're<00:00:44.690> going

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
it will unfold that and now we're going

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.870 
it will unfold that and now we're going
to<00:00:44.990> fold<00:00:45.380> in<00:00:45.830> these<00:00:46.070> two<00:00:46.400> corners<00:00:48.640> so<00:00:49.640> it's<00:00:49.790> the

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
to fold in these two corners so it's the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.970 
to fold in these two corners so it's the
two<00:00:50.060> opposite<00:00:50.840> corner<00:00:51.140> say<00:00:51.260> top<00:00:51.500> left<00:00:51.770> and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
two opposite corner say top left and

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.450 
two opposite corner say top left and
bottom<00:00:52.160> right<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:54.020> follow<00:00:54.200> those<00:00:54.410> in<00:00:54.680> again

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
bottom right to follow those in again

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.670 
bottom right to follow those in again
make<00:00:55.820> sure<00:00:56.060> your<00:00:56.239> creases<00:00:56.690> are<00:00:56.810> quite<00:00:57.110> tight<00:00:57.410> I

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
make sure your creases are quite tight I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.310 
make sure your creases are quite tight I
need<00:00:58.580> to<00:00:58.670> make<00:00:58.790> sure<00:00:58.820> it's<00:00:59.210> carefully<00:00:59.780> lined

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
need to make sure it's carefully lined

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.190 
need to make sure it's carefully lined
up<00:01:00.559> there<00:01:00.970> with<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.270> first<00:01:02.510> crease<00:01:02.840> that<00:01:03.080> we

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
up there with the first crease that we

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.609 
up there with the first crease that we
made<00:01:03.440> we<00:01:03.950> fold<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.430> half<00:01:05.290> close<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:06.500> can

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
made we fold it in half close you can

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:20.000 
made we fold it in half close you can
get<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.310> better

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.450 

now<00:01:20.580> we're<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:21.320> essentially

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
now we're going to be essentially

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.260 
now we're going to be essentially
covering<00:01:23.460> up<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.640> rest<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.880> our<00:01:23.970> letter<00:01:24.120> by

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
covering up the rest of our letter by

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.840 
covering up the rest of our letter by
folding<00:01:24.660> in<00:01:24.810> these<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.230> sides<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:26.190> line<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
folding in these two sides just line it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
folding in these two sides just line it
up<00:01:27.270> exactly<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.840> previous<00:01:30.840> folded

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
up exactly with the previous folded

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.980 
up exactly with the previous folded
piece<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.620> can<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.980> they're<00:01:35.700> very

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
piece so you can see they're very

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.960 
piece so you can see they're very
carefully<00:01:36.990> lined<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:40.010> and<00:01:41.010> we'll<00:01:41.580> be<00:01:41.700> doing

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
carefully lined up and we'll be doing

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:50.149 
carefully lined up and we'll be doing
that<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.300> both<00:01:43.140> sides

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.330 

so<00:01:50.790> now<00:01:50.939> our<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.649> essentially<00:01:52.950> covered

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so now our that was essentially covered

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.929 
so now our that was essentially covered
we're<00:01:54.180> folding<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> flats<00:01:55.759> said<00:01:56.759> she<00:01:56.820> was

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
we're folding in the flats said she was

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:57.830 
we're folding in the flats said she was
going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> bring<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> back<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> more

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
going to bring it back to a more

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.529 
going to bring it back to a more
rectangular<00:01:58.350> shape<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:58.950> and<00:02:01.579> again<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:03.210> just

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
rectangular shape here and again we just

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.710 
rectangular shape here and again we just
have<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.810> carefully<00:02:04.470> line<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.860> up<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.789> the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
have to carefully line it up with the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.790 
have to carefully line it up with the
original<00:02:07.170> crease<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.619> we<00:02:07.740> made<00:02:09.649> make<00:02:10.649> sure

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
original crease that we made make sure

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.699 
original crease that we made make sure
it's<00:02:10.979> straight

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
it's straight

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.199 
it's straight
and<00:02:13.219> again

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
and again

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.270 
and again
and<00:02:15.719> show<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.140> all<00:02:16.290> your<00:02:16.590> creases<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.159> this

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
and show that all your creases in this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.610 
and show that all your creases in this
one<00:02:17.459> are<00:02:17.670> very<00:02:17.909> tight

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.229 

get<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.310> other<00:02:25.400> sides<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:28.340> are<00:02:28.640> nearly

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
get on the other sides and we are nearly

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.580 
get on the other sides and we are nearly
done<00:02:29.360> actually<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.430> there<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> go

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.259 

all<00:02:37.129> we<00:02:37.250> need<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.489> do<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.700> tuck<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.120> those

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
all we need to do is tuck in those

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.910 
all we need to do is tuck in those
little<00:02:38.569> flaps<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:39.019> stick<00:02:39.200> out<00:02:39.349> into<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
little flaps that stick out into the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.910 
little flaps that stick out into the
little<00:02:40.129> pockets<00:02:40.720> see<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.959> just<00:02:42.560> like<00:02:42.650> that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
little pockets see that just like that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.110 
little pockets see that just like that
slide<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.519> one<00:02:43.670> in<00:02:43.790> there

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120

and<00:02:50.599> we<00:02:51.599> finished<00:02:51.930> our<00:02:52.050> envelope

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
and we finished our envelope

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.820 
and we finished our envelope
it's<00:02:54.560> quite<00:02:54.799> simple<00:02:55.450> weight<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.840> well
