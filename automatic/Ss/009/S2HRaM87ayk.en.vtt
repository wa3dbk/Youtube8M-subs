00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
the metal things on them for his claws I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.660 
the metal things on them for his claws I
don't<00:01:33.230> know<00:01:33.290> if<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.410> said<00:01:33.620> that<00:01:33.740> right<00:01:33.980> and<00:01:34.250> then

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
don't know if I said that right and then

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.400 
don't know if I said that right and then
I<00:01:34.730> put<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.000> tusks<00:01:35.390> on<00:01:35.510> his<00:01:35.660> back<00:01:35.900> here<00:01:36.290> I

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
I put the tusks on his back here I

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.830 
I put the tusks on his back here I
didn't<00:01:36.980> just<00:01:37.130> sculpt<00:01:37.600> points<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.720> then

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
didn't just sculpt points and then

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.240 
didn't just sculpt points and then
connect<00:01:39.410> them<00:01:39.590> because<00:01:39.770> they<00:01:39.890> would<00:01:40.010> just<00:01:40.040> be

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
connect them because they would just be

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.470 
connect them because they would just be
able<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.430> break<00:01:40.610> off<00:01:40.790> really<00:01:41.120> easily<00:01:41.210> these

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
able to break off really easily these

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.050 
able to break off really easily these
actually<00:01:41.870> have<00:01:42.020> metal<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.470> them<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.060> plastic

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
actually have metal in them and plastic

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.760 
actually have metal in them and plastic
too<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:44.510> if<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.750> hit<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.110> it's<00:01:45.320> not<00:01:45.560> gonna

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
too so if you hit it it's not gonna

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.070 
too so if you hit it it's not gonna
break<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.880> might<00:01:47.030> scratch<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.510> paint<00:01:47.750> but<00:01:47.960> if

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
break you might scratch the paint but if

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.480 
break you might scratch the paint but if
you<00:01:48.170> dropped<00:01:48.440> him<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.620> those<00:01:48.890> they<00:01:49.160> would<00:01:49.310> not

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
you dropped him on those they would not

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.920 
you dropped him on those they would not
break<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:50.030> wanted<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.360> make<00:01:50.480> sure<00:01:50.510> he<00:01:50.780> was

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930

there's steel in there that goes down

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.460

we wanted to give him a humanoid look

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.410 
we wanted to give him a humanoid look

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
bone structures a little bit different

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.009 
bone structures a little bit different
and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.489> course<00:02:13.700> his<00:02:13.910> eyes<00:02:14.150> are<00:02:14.720> black

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
and then of course his eyes are black

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.319 
and then of course his eyes are black
with<00:02:15.260> white<00:02:15.499> centers<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:16.849> give<00:02:17.060> them<00:02:17.180> kind

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
with white centers just give them kind

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.080 
with white centers just give them kind
of<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.629> more<00:02:18.049> menacing<00:02:18.260> unique<00:02:19.249> look<00:02:19.609> and<00:02:19.939> then

of a more menacing unique look and then

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.130 
of a more menacing unique look and then
I<00:02:20.150> left<00:02:20.359> the<00:02:20.450> chin<00:02:20.749> thing

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
I left the chin thing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.930 
I left the chin thing
almost<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.710> same<00:02:21.890> as<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.220> original<00:02:22.610> design

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
almost the same as the original design

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.809 
almost the same as the original design
for<00:02:23.240> him<00:02:23.390> just<00:02:23.630> because<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.190> kind<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.700> an

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
for him just because it is kind of an

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.309 
for him just because it is kind of an
iconic<00:02:26.150> look<00:02:26.480> for<00:02:26.660> him<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:26.930> as<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.170> can<00:02:27.260> tell

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
iconic look for him so as you can tell

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.650 
iconic look for him so as you can tell
it's<00:02:27.650> very<00:02:27.860> similar<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.910> original<00:02:29.030> just

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
it's very similar to the original just

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.590 
it's very similar to the original just
kind<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.020> like<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> new<00:02:30.440> 52<00:02:30.890> twist<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.270> skin

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
kind of like a new 52 twist so the skin

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.050 
kind of like a new 52 twist so the skin
is<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> satiny<00:02:33.830> color<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.640> didn't<00:02:34.819> want<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
is like a satiny color I didn't want to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.449 
is like a satiny color I didn't want to
be<00:02:35.150> too<00:02:35.360> flat<00:02:35.630> or<00:02:35.870> too<00:02:36.080> glossy<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.800> it's<00:02:37.310> got

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
be too flat or too glossy and it's got

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.490 
be too flat or too glossy and it's got
really<00:02:37.730> subtle<00:02:38.209> shading<00:02:38.480> I'm<00:02:38.840> not<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.110> fan<00:02:39.470> of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
really subtle shading I'm not a fan of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.620 
really subtle shading I'm not a fan of
skin<00:02:40.040> having<00:02:40.430> really<00:02:40.700> strong<00:02:40.940> shading<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.480> it

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
skin having really strong shading on it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.440 
skin having really strong shading on it
so<00:02:42.260> that's<00:02:42.470> why<00:02:42.620> it's<00:02:42.800> got<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> tiniest

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
so that's why it's got just the tiniest

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.120 
so that's why it's got just the tiniest
bit<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.870> darker<00:02:45.230> brown<00:02:45.440> underneath<00:02:45.890> with

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
bit of a darker brown underneath with

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.710 
bit of a darker brown underneath with
the<00:02:46.160> light<00:02:46.370> brown<00:02:46.610> drybrushed

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the light brown drybrushed

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.720 
the light brown drybrushed
and<00:02:48.170> then<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.680> made<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.890> tusks<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.489> off-white

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and then I made the tusks and off-white

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.670 
and then I made the tusks and off-white
because<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.660> don't<00:02:50.840> like<00:02:51.050> I<00:02:51.260> didn't<00:02:51.470> think<00:02:51.530> they

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
because I don't like I didn't think they

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.040 
because I don't like I didn't think they
should<00:02:51.830> look<00:02:52.010> completely<00:02:52.630> stark<00:02:53.630> white<00:02:53.870> I

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
should look completely stark white I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.510 
should look completely stark white I
just<00:02:54.200> thought<00:02:54.290> would<00:02:54.440> look<00:02:54.560> weird<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:55.340> did

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
just thought would look weird so we did

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.680 
just thought would look weird so we did
that<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.000> mouth<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.360> eyes<00:02:56.480> are

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
that and then the mouth and eyes are

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.620 
that and then the mouth and eyes are
glossy<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.590> look<00:02:57.890> kind<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.520> wet<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.450> rest

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
glossy to look kind of wet and the rest

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.430 
glossy to look kind of wet and the rest
is<00:02:59.930> as<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.860> can<00:03:00.890> tell<00:03:01.100> not<00:03:01.910> glossy<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.320> then

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
is as you can tell not glossy and then

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.660 
is as you can tell not glossy and then
if<00:03:03.530> you're<00:03:03.650> familiar<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:04.070> tusks<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.580> know

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
if you're familiar with tusks you know

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.610 
if you're familiar with tusks you know
that<00:03:04.850> he<00:03:04.970> can<00:03:05.209> spawn<00:03:05.600> little<00:03:05.930> minion<00:03:06.350> type

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
that he can spawn little minion type

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.979 
that he can spawn little minion type
characters<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:08.060> we<00:03:08.150> wanted<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.420> do<00:03:08.570> something

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
characters so we wanted to do something

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.050 
characters so we wanted to do something
like<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.260> but<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:09.769> quite<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.190> same<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:11.030> we

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
like that but not quite the same so we

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.670 
like that but not quite the same so we
made<00:03:11.390> him<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.600> little<00:03:11.930> minion<00:03:12.290> that's<00:03:12.440> kind<00:03:12.650> of

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
made him a little minion that's kind of
