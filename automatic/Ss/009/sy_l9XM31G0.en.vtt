with it as they could've which

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.240 
with it as they could've which
considering<00:03:58.900> this<00:03:58.990> is<00:03:59.140> only<00:03:59.320> an<00:03:59.470> hour<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.740> 35

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
considering this is only an hour and 35

minutes<00:04:00.310> i<00:04:00.790> guess<00:04:01.180> i<00:04:01.390> can<00:04:01.570> see<00:04:01.780> why<00:04:01.990> maybe<00:04:02.530> if

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
minutes i guess i can see why maybe if

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.110 
minutes i guess i can see why maybe if
they<00:04:02.800> have<00:04:02.980> made<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.310> movie<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:03.610> little<00:04:03.850> longer
