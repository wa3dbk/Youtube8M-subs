Bach's Brandenburg Concertos in the back

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.710 
Bach's Brandenburg Concertos in the back
when<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> music<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.820> slow<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.330> controllers

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
when the music is slow the controllers

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.510 
when the music is slow the controllers
like<00:02:22.870> super<00:02:23.350> duper<00:02:23.530> sensitive<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.310> know<00:02:24.400> it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
like super duper sensitive you know it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.880 
like super duper sensitive you know it
speeds<00:02:24.850> up<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.720> go<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:26.020> faster<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.770> so

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
speeds up you go a little faster and so

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.410 
speeds up you go a little faster and so
there's<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.340> also<00:02:27.610> pacing<00:02:28.090> for<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
there's this like also pacing for the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.600 
there's this like also pacing for the
game<00:02:28.570> so<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.810> almost<00:02:28.930> it's<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.610> half

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
game so it's almost it's like half

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:44.850 
game so it's almost it's like half
videogame<00:02:31.390> half<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:32.590> martial<00:02:33.190> art<00:02:43.860> worst

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
videogame half like martial art worst

match for me or anybody who's played um

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.870 
match for me or anybody who's played um
I<00:02:51.570> actually<00:02:52.570> I've<00:02:52.870> been<00:02:52.900> seeing<00:02:53.200> anything<00:02:53.880> too

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
I actually I've been seeing anything too

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.430 
I actually I've been seeing anything too
gory<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.270> mean<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.750> nice<00:02:55.900> thing<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.170> you're

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
gory I mean the nice thing is you're

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400 
gory I mean the nice thing is you're
often<00:02:56.860> moving<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:57.490> slow<00:02:58.180> motion<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:59.110> think

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
often moving in slow motion and I think

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.780 
often moving in slow motion and I think
that's<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.830> key<00:03:00.010> feedback<00:03:00.459> loop<00:03:00.760> so

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
that's like the key feedback loop so

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.780 
that's like the key feedback loop so
you're<00:03:01.240> not<00:03:01.360> like<00:03:01.660> like<00:03:02.410> tackling<00:03:03.250> each<00:03:03.610> other

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
you're not like like tackling each other

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.820 
you're not like like tackling each other
at<00:03:03.970> full-speed<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.090> window<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:08.500> know

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
at full-speed is that window you know

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.740 
at full-speed is that window you know
talk<00:03:09.040> about<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.400> incident<00:03:10.739> no<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.790> um<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.630> know

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
talk about the incident no I um you know

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.479 
talk about the incident no I um you know
like<00:03:13.900> occasionally<00:03:14.560> you'll<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:14.860> elbow

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
like occasionally you'll like elbow

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.699 
like occasionally you'll like elbow
somebody<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.420> little<00:03:16.630> too<00:03:16.870> hard<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:17.560> like

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
somebody a little too hard or like

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.140 
somebody a little too hard or like
there's<00:03:17.890> always<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.220> person<00:03:18.430> who<00:03:18.730> takes<00:03:18.910> it

like a little too seriously and is but
that's<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.910> guess<00:03:21.970> that's<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.360> point<00:03:22.600> that<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
that's I guess that's the point that the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.860 
that's I guess that's the point that the
computer's<00:03:24.040> not<00:03:24.390> regulating<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:25.780> like

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
computer's not regulating that it's like

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.960 
computer's not regulating that it's like
up<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.200> players<00:03:26.410> themselves<00:03:26.739> like<00:03:27.430> cuz<00:03:27.850> if

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
up to the players themselves like cuz if

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.550 
up to the players themselves like cuz if
I'm<00:03:28.090> playing<00:03:28.360> with<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.570> sports<00:03:28.840> friends<00:03:29.320> it's
