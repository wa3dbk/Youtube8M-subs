00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
font comp or something so the greatest

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550

thing<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.090> picture<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.140> fact

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
thing about this picture is the fact

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.140 
thing about this picture is the fact
that<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.770> use<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> resurrection<00:01:32.759> picture

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that they use the resurrection picture

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.920 
that they use the resurrection picture
in<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.689> background<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.320> doubt<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.700> will

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
in the background I doubt that they will

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
in the background I doubt that they will
remake<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.290> reuse<00:01:38.009> an<00:01:38.310> image<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> they<00:01:38.939> use

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
remake or reuse an image that they use

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.740 
remake or reuse an image that they use
in<00:01:39.299> black<00:01:39.479> ops<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.850> foreground
