00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hello today, a little movie about 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.120
 daytime running lights and now i would like 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.820
 tell at the same time show how much 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.700
 consumes a miracle from there first 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.920
 that looks all 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.920
 like this with a screw 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.290
 damn for us is 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.350
 is shining 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:33.080
 nice bright said and here and with me 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:38.410
 two LEDs here here is worth it 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:42.320
 one for 3 watts another for 9 but in total 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.440
 connecting for example the tester shows 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.900
 everywhere 013 milliamps ie 130 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.680
 milliampere consumption heats up 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:55.820
 decently that is it is due to the fact that 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.360
 me here voltage principle is as 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.860
 factory like a car now 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:08.390
 battery counting charged to full and 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:11.870
 and and to add something else but 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.300
 equal brightness they have different that is 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.300
 this here we have nines they shine more 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.430
 in such a blue tint to which leads 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.710
 to what kind of color it turns out more 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:33.170
 bright treshki shine warmer light 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:35.780
 in appearance there is no difference at all 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.370
 fine that is what is yellow here what 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:46.910
 here the yellow heats up they are very 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:49.040
 good heating in winter they are not visible on the odes 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.730
 summer I would still be in addition to 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.590
 it probably resistor in my car 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:01.310
 they cost winter that is about 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.380
 months 5 and basically feels 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.530
 not bad 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.069
 daytime running lights do not replace me 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.590
 just two LEDs i mean then in 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.950
 plans to deliver an additional 2 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.950
 couples 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.640
 in general , all I have are two 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.580
 nine and tonight I'll show you 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.110
 as well as not shining on the site 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.700
 additionality that I find 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.930
 photos for this topic deal 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.930
 I will additionally attach that is 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.850
 I do not even know what I would like to say but 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.780
 what i did homemade before the daytime 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.480
 running lights 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.670
 that is, they burned that is water 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.220
 got here all tight and 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.310
 pretty well done the only thing 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.860
 that here this wire is very thin then 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.430
 have got to be very careful when we 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.900
 we connect it not additionally better 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.310
 its somehow reinforcement if you vomit 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.830
 it will be bad tension better not to let it go 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.510
 that is, I could withstand the frost but I 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.300
 didn't yank it all missed neatly but 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.750
 so we have 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.820
 drill a hole like a dozen then 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.980
 inserted wire inserted into the minute 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.320
 would be fixed on the reverse side 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.120
 nut and some have a groove 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.180
 and here I had a groove here here 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.340
 the triangle here here is the groove just in 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.410
 plastic bumps it just 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.360
 attracted to plastic I think 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.760
 attracted when it is more convenient than 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.110
 by this because here it is necessary to drill 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.210
 larger hole if Che little 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.910
 happen she can 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:59.950
 ugly then being in the same plan and 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:03.010
 the holes are smaller and there is more light 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.470
 would be neaterness above so that 's it 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.400
 Thank you all for subscribing 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.400
 on the channel all bye
