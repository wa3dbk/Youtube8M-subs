00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
basically a stack of fifths and then

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.520 
basically a stack of fifths and then
another<00:01:38.090> stack<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.600> fifths<00:01:38.930> built<00:01:39.170> off<00:01:39.380> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
another stack of fifths built off the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.820 
another stack of fifths built off the
minor<00:01:39.770> third<00:01:41.890> so<00:01:42.890> that's<00:01:43.040> for<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.250> minor<00:01:43.490> 11

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
minor third so that's for a minor 11

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.870 
minor third so that's for a minor 11
then<00:01:45.830> I<00:01:45.979> go<00:01:46.190> upper<00:01:47.000> my<00:01:47.270> upper<00:01:47.720> third<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.880> do

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.110 
the same voicing but for a major 11
chord<00:01:54.400> another<00:01:55.400> stack<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.880> fifths

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
and then a b-minor 11 chords same chord

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:11.080 
and then a b-minor 11 chords same chord
again<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.630> then<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.740> go<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.100> major<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.820> then

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090

another major and then the minor 11 so

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:28.420 
another major and then the minor 11 so
it's<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.700> same<00:02:16.880> voicing<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:17.690> far<00:02:27.190> that's<00:02:28.190> all

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
it's the same voicing so far that's all

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.490 
it's the same voicing so far that's all
can<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.820> baron<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.750> next<00:02:30.110> chord<00:02:30.320> though

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
can you baron the next chord though

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.210 
can you baron the next chord though
changes<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:32.620> play<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:33.970> dominant<00:02:35.020> 7<00:02:36.020> chord<00:02:36.220> so

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
changes I play this dominant 7 chord so

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.890 
changes I play this dominant 7 chord so
this<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.520> kind<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.850> dominant<00:02:38.330> chord<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.810> it

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
this is a kind of dominant chord and it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.650 
this is a kind of dominant chord and it
resolves<00:02:39.850> down<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.880> semitone<00:02:42.970> -<00:02:43.970> II<00:02:44.300> might

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
resolves down a semitone - II might

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.750 
resolves down a semitone - II might
another<00:02:45.140> kenny<00:02:45.410> baron<00:02:45.770> starting<00:02:46.310> on<00:02:46.370> e<00:02:46.520> minor

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
another kenny baron starting on e minor

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.780 
another kenny baron starting on e minor
again<00:02:47.200> now<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.530> tritone<00:02:48.980> substitution

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
again now this is tritone substitution

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.290 
again now this is tritone substitution
because<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.240> dominant<00:02:50.750> chord

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
because this is a dominant chord

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.420 
because this is a dominant chord
resolving<00:02:53.300> down<00:02:53.840> one<00:02:54.440> semitone<00:02:54.860> if<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.280> want

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
resolving down one semitone if you want

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.220 
resolving down one semitone if you want
to<00:02:55.490> know<00:02:55.580> about<00:02:55.700> tritone<00:02:56.480> substitution<00:02:57.080> watch

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
to know about tritone substitution watch

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.940 
to know about tritone substitution watch
my<00:02:57.500> video<00:02:57.860> on<00:02:58.210> tritone<00:02:59.210> substitution<00:02:59.960> but

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
my video on tritone substitution but

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.199 
my video on tritone substitution but
basically<00:03:01.310> what<00:03:01.400> I've<00:03:01.490> done<00:03:01.640> instead<00:03:02.090> of

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
basically what I've done instead of

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.850 
basically what I've done instead of
having<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.630> new<00:03:03.020> dominant<00:03:03.530> 7<00:03:03.890> proceeding<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:05.060> a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
having a new dominant 7 proceeding the a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.250 
having a new dominant 7 proceeding the a
minor<00:03:06.860> 11<00:03:07.370> chord<00:03:07.610> I've<00:03:08.420> tried<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.200> in

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
minor 11 chord I've tried to in

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
chord on F which resolves nicely to E

minor

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.500 

and<00:03:23.420> then<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:25.070> kenny<00:03:25.430> baron<00:03:25.850> chords<00:03:26.150> repeat

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
and then the kenny baron chords repeat

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.780 
and then the kenny baron chords repeat
again<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:31.370> then<00:03:31.520> i<00:03:31.670> go<00:03:31.880> upwards<00:03:32.510> instead

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
again but then i go upwards instead

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.540 
again but then i go upwards instead
that's<00:03:34.790> not<00:03:35.120> really<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.830> core<00:03:36.830> that<00:03:37.010> has<00:03:37.070> theory

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
that's not really a core that has theory

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.270 
that's not really a core that has theory
behind<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:38.060> it's<00:03:38.210> just<00:03:38.390> sort<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:39.280> variation

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
behind it it's just sort of a variation

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.760 
behind it it's just sort of a variation
of<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.550> kenny<00:03:40.790> baron<00:03:44.320> just<00:03:45.320> because<00:03:45.500> i<00:03:45.560> want

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
of the kenny baron just because i want

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.790 
of the kenny baron just because i want
to<00:03:45.950> sort<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.340> separate<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.510> go<00:03:47.660> bigger<00:03:50.680> then<00:03:51.680> i

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
to sort of separate and go bigger then i

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.750 
to sort of separate and go bigger then i
start<00:03:52.100> coming<00:03:52.430> down<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.830> then<00:03:55.010> Kenny<00:03:55.370> baron

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
start coming down and then Kenny baron

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.410 
start coming down and then Kenny baron
minor<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.890> end<00:03:58.160> with<00:03:58.460> that's<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.150> sus

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
minor and to end with that's the sus

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.010 
minor and to end with that's the sus
chord<00:03:59.750> because<00:04:00.500> I've<00:04:00.710> got<00:04:00.890> G<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.430> bass

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
chord because I've got G in the bass

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.630 
chord because I've got G in the bass
basically<00:04:03.020> an<00:04:03.140> F<00:04:03.440> major<00:04:03.740> triad

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
basically an F major triad

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.980 
basically an F major triad
which<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:05.570> a<00:04:05.600> good<00:04:05.870> voicing<00:04:06.350> for<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.560> sus<00:04:06.800> chord

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
which is a good voicing for a sus chord

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.630 
which is a good voicing for a sus chord
got<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.080> seen<00:04:09.290> octaves<00:04:09.770> to<00:04:10.040> make<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.400> bigger

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
got the seen octaves to make it bigger

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.920 
got the seen octaves to make it bigger
and<00:04:11.800> then<00:04:12.800> sus<00:04:13.250> chords<00:04:13.760> form<00:04:14.330> of<00:04:14.480> dominant

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
and then sus chords form of dominant

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.750 
and then sus chords form of dominant
chord<00:04:15.170> if<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.070> want<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.280> know<00:04:16.370> about<00:04:16.459> them

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
chord if you want to know about them

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.800 
chord if you want to know about them
watch<00:04:17.000> my<00:04:17.269> video<00:04:17.540> on<00:04:17.600> suspended<00:04:18.560> chords<00:04:18.950> and

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
watch my video on suspended chords and

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.660 
watch my video on suspended chords and
they<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.470> dominant<00:04:22.070> chord<00:04:22.220> wants<00:04:22.550> to

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
they so a dominant chord wants to

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.350 
they so a dominant chord wants to
resolve<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.060> one<00:04:23.390> and<00:04:23.660> that's<00:04:24.050> what<00:04:24.170> it<00:04:24.380> does

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
resolve to one and that's what it does

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.200 
resolve to one and that's what it does
the<00:04:26.360> next<00:04:26.630> chord<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:28.550> C<00:04:28.850> major
