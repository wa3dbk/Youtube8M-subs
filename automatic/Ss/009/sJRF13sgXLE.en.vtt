00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.130 

I'm<00:03:21.320> just<00:03:21.470> going<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.620> mix<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.010> up

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.930 

wait<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.450> all<00:03:43.510> out<00:03:44.250> about<00:03:45.250> everything<00:03:45.519> weighed

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
wait it all out about everything weighed

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.080 
wait it all out about everything weighed
out<00:03:45.970> entered<00:03:46.870> into<00:03:47.170> My<00:03:47.290> Fitness<00:03:47.349> Pal<00:03:48.090> feels

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
out entered into My Fitness Pal feels

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.520 
out entered into My Fitness Pal feels
good<00:03:49.239> man<00:03:49.450> haven't<00:03:49.989> had<00:03:50.110> this<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.500> long<00:03:50.680> time

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
good man haven't had this in a long time

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410 
good man haven't had this in a long time
it's<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.190> lot<00:03:53.340> better<00:03:53.490> now<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.030> get<00:03:54.390> a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
it's a lot better now that you get a

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:06.880 
it's a lot better now that you get a
little<00:03:54.660> track<00:03:54.900> right<00:03:55.200> now

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.060 

so<00:04:07.850> we<00:04:07.940> weighed<00:04:08.120> out<00:04:08.270> everything

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
so we weighed out everything

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.990 
so we weighed out everything
individually<00:04:10.070> which<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:10.340> obviously<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.820> lot

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
individually which is obviously a lot

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.780 
individually which is obviously a lot
more<00:04:11.210> accurate<00:04:11.660> that<00:04:12.040> they're<00:04:13.040> scooping

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
more accurate that they're scooping

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.090 
more accurate that they're scooping
whatever<00:04:14.480> out<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.930> whoever<00:04:15.410> knows<00:04:15.740> how<00:04:15.920> many

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
whatever out and whoever knows how many

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.900 
whatever out and whoever knows how many
portions<00:04:17.320> but<00:04:18.320> now<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.340> just<00:04:19.400> obviously

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
portions but now it's just obviously

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.290 
portions but now it's just obviously
depends<00:04:20.329> on<00:04:20.480> whether<00:04:20.630> or<00:04:20.780> not<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:22.300> macros

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
depends on whether or not the macros

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.850 
depends on whether or not the macros
that<00:04:23.450> they<00:04:23.570> report<00:04:23.960> on<00:04:24.050> their<00:04:24.230> website<00:04:24.650> are

that they report on their website are

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.670 
that they report on their website are
accurate<00:04:25.340> but<00:04:25.640> definitely<00:04:26.270> much<00:04:26.680> more

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
accurate but definitely much more

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.040 
accurate but definitely much more

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
accurate than taking their word for it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:38.020 
accurate than taking their word for it
and<00:04:30.200> what<00:04:30.770> they<00:04:30.890> scoop<00:04:31.220> out<00:04:31.430> or<00:04:32.000> each<00:04:32.450> servant
