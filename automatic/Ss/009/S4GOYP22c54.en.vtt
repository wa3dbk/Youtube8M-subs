the<00:01:24.900> device<00:01:25.229> itself<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:26.070> course<00:01:26.310> we'll<00:01:26.820> get

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the device itself of course we'll get

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.969 
the device itself of course we'll get
that<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.420> moment<00:01:27.720> also<00:01:27.869> check<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.799> all<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that in a moment also check out all the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
that in a moment also check out all the
bits<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.759> need<00:01:29.909> we

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
bits we have in here that we need we

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.080 
bits we have in here that we need we
have<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:32.570> adapter<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.939> headset<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
have a adapter there for the headset I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.630 
have a adapter there for the headset I
guess<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.420> has<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> proprietary<00:01:37.079> port<00:01:37.350> then

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
guess this has a proprietary port then

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.740 
guess this has a proprietary port then
it<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:38.850> look<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> charger<00:01:39.840> indeed<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> has

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
it will look at a charger indeed it has

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
it will look at a charger indeed it has
a<00:01:42.750> mains<00:01:43.229> charger<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:46.909> pantech

we have a USB cable we have a battery

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:05.170 
we have a USB cable we have a battery
always<00:01:56.570> good<00:02:03.040> see<00:02:04.040> what<00:02:04.190> rating<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:04.700> has<00:02:04.940> let

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
always good see what rating that has let

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:16.270 
always good see what rating that has let
me<00:02:09.310> get<00:02:10.310> out<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.550> packet<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.670> rated<00:02:14.270> at<00:02:14.830> 13<00:02:15.830> 20

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
me get out a packet it is rated at 13 20

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.560 
me get out a packet it is rated at 13 20
milliamp<00:02:16.640> hour<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.270> should<00:02:17.420> have<00:02:17.510> a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
milliamp hour so it should have a

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.910 
milliamp hour so it should have a
probably<00:02:17.930> decent<00:02:18.230> battery<00:02:18.380> life<00:02:19.270> we<00:02:20.270> have<00:02:20.420> the

which was a nice feel to the keys and
then<00:03:54.200> we<00:03:54.320> have<00:03:54.970> 412<00:03:55.970> key<00:03:57.820> which<00:03:58.820> again<00:03:59.090> is<00:03:59.300> very

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
then we have 412 key which again is very

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.390 
then we have 412 key which again is very
nice<00:03:59.720> we've<00:04:00.590> got<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:00.800> volume<00:04:00.950> buttons
