00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
simplistic gives you the you know maybe

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
simplistic gives you the you know maybe
that<00:00:57.960> Windows<00:00:58.350> Phone<00:00:59.660> touch<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:01.430> something

that Windows Phone touch or something
like<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:06.590> anyways<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.760> here

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
like that so anyways what we can do here

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.870 
like that so anyways what we can do here
is<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.190> know<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.730> edit

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
anything you can edit here takes a the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
anything you can edit here takes a the
clock<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.320> example<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.370> can<00:01:17.520> move<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.790> around

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
clock for example you can move it around

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.399 
clock for example you can move it around
moving<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.050> bottom<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.870> hit<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
moving at the bottom you can hit this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.510 
moving at the bottom you can hit this
you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.070> change<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.460> title<00:01:23.909> name<00:01:25.310> change<00:01:26.310> the

you can change a title name change the
position<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:28.770> change<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.190> color<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.940> if<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
position you change the color so if you

expands it hit down and it goes gets

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.660 
expands it hit down and it goes gets
picked<00:01:49.229> up<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> top<00:01:50.190> very<00:01:50.549> awkwardly<00:01:52.670> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
picked up to the top very awkwardly you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.010 
picked up to the top very awkwardly you
slide<00:01:54.120> over<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.780> applications

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

here<00:01:56.420> it's<00:01:57.420> sorted<00:01:57.930> by<00:01:58.110> alphabetical<00:01:58.710> order

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
here it's sorted by alphabetical order

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
here it's sorted by alphabetical order
which<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.580> kind<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.850> strange<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.229> cool

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
which is kind of strange but it's cool

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.980 
which is kind of strange but it's cool
it<00:02:01.799> takes<00:02:02.460> true<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.060> Windows<00:02:03.420> Phone<00:02:03.960> 8<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it takes true to Windows Phone 8 so you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.389 
it takes true to Windows Phone 8 so you
know<00:02:07.080> depends<00:02:07.440> on<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.830> really<00:02:08.129> really
