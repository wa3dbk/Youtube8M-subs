00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.839
 We will perform the following operation 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.790
 combined for that we're going to have in 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.160
 account 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.830
 the parentheses then the first thing that 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.810
 let's develop are the parentheses and 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.390
 inside the parentheses you have to have 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.439
 consider the operation that we have 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.290
 within it in this case we have a 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.220
 a subtraction and a multiplication then 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.550
 by hierarchy we would have the first 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.920
 multiply these two fractions 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.559
 and to multiply it simply because 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:46.050
 let's simplify here we would have 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:47.750
 seventh 1 seventh 2 half of 63 nor caps 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.050
 one 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 tertium 1 third 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.540
 that is, our operation would be left 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.530
 from the way 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:08.580
 n equal to one third 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.380
 - inside the parentheses we would have two 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.289
 fifth 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:20.450
 minus 1 by 11 1 by 11 in the so-called 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.450
 we would be 1 on him 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.850
 all this is divided by 215 years that 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.940
 we are going to invest it taking into account 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.310
 that we change division operation 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.310
 will happen to a multiplication 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.010
 by then 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.159
 15 more media 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.600
 3. 4 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:53.920
 well once we have already reduced the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.820
 parentheses let's make this 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.600
 difference between these two fractions 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.200
 we would then have a third less to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.520
 to be able to resolve this difference we are going to 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:19.780
 get the minimum minimum between 5 and 1 that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:23.860
 we would have 55 between 51 by 22 minus 5 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.560
 between 15 by 15 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.210
 x 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.420
 15 more media 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:37.420
 3. 4 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:44.250
 then we would be equal to one third 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:47.430
 minus 25 minus 3 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.610
 we would then have minus three fifths 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.410
 be careful with the sign x 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.400
 15 more media 34 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.260
 here 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.260
 what you have to keep in mind 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.840
 it would be less for less 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.680
 plus 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:18.680
 plus three fifths with fifteen more media 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.150
 3. 4 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.599
 in multiplication let's simplify 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:33.489
 since the first thing we have to do 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:33.489
 have a fifth 3 then 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:48.850
 one third 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:51.569
 + 3 for 3 91 for 229 more media 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.329
 three quarters 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:59.730
 equal to be able to add these fractions 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:02.310
 we must take out their common minimum 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.490
 multiple of the denominators and 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.450
 we would have the minimum of 3 2 and 4 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:17.930
 12 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:32.230
 we divide then 12 between 34 by 14 + 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:37.060
 12 between 26 by 954 plus 12 between 43 x 39 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:39.759
 then we would have the sum we 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:46.879
 it would not matter 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:49.579
 67 and in the so-called 12 67 12 a 2 is the 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:52.179
 simplification of this operation 

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:52.179
 combined
