00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Well, here we are in the center of 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.779
 adoption of the shelter with curro there is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.880
 7 and now we're going to meet 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.450
 with the family that has not adopted well 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.450
 that we are going there 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:26.419
 this new family 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.469
 well, through a friend of a lot 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 time told us that when the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.850
 bones the kittens the legacies that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 we wanted to adopt a dog then we 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 He said to come here with you 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.440
 because that actually happened and we 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.690
 we put in your our mail 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.030
 and chance with the few days of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.940
 be me looking for a dogs and cats 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.960
 appears unique curro and how it gave us so much 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.360
 It's a shame to see him there in the portal 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.259
 we thought we went straight to the center 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 more to see it there and then we think it a 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:14.540
 little bit we came here we talked with Sara and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.540
 we said then 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.570
 because we consider that animals 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.520
 older people have the same right more than 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.900
 to live than those of the boys 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.240
 young people have like people 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.909
 a life ahead and instead the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.190
 older are less years younger 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.430
 opportunities then good so it 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:50.590
 can you lend a hand and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:52.960
 and adopt is rewarding 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.479
 let's hope it 's 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.840
 and then later if we adapt to 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.840
 March 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.670
 that's 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.209
 ah 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.209
 you
