 in this video and show how to 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.599
 change the increase the volume of the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.550
 loudspeaker speaker or the same 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.189
 headphones that we do connect in a 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.840
 tiny chip 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.970
 well first of all let's turn it off 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.339
 everything that can be sound all 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.130
 what can be sound turns it off 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:41.620
 let's go to the phone dialer 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:46.280
 and we're going to dial the number 38 45 numeral 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.950
 asterisk 500 numeral 500 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.030
 good good we have barcelÃ³ life of 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.640
 full description of the video for 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.980
 consolidate good once we are there 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.510
 let's enter is going to enter a 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.610
 Javier came automatically where 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.560
 we can configure a lot of things 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.550
 good in our case we are going to enter 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.840
 devis test 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 they are audio test calculation and subsist 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.780
 calibration 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.310
 once we are there 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.579
 we're going to have four squares the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.649
 first will be looking for there we will 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.510
 to show that what we want to create in 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.170
 this case the speaker speaker 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.240
 the second which channel are we going to calibrate in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.310
 this case as the mono bus command 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.830
 stopped with a single channel then not 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.130
 matter in case you calculate these models 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.800
 icc cabins without market in zp let's 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.370
 place the club pin number with the 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 way as I do and has calibrated 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.800
 number that moslehi restless is that of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.170
 deal we do not have to place ourselves 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.550
 the number of these placing little is going to 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.130
 grab the same number is not treated here 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.840
 they put it in lleida is good in the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.670
 case of the speakers let's leave 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.610
 explain half we will leave 00 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.229
 change the putting on gay tape does not 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.840
 lack to educate the councilors input 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.229
 volume or I like them and we have 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.970
 only a single channel and you need to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.190
 let's place the number that we 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.070
 it seems to me I recommend that they go 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.070
 testing the one after the 23 well 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.950
 because if it gets to saturate it could 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.270
 break the speaker good then not 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.630
 we have to get out or saturate the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.630
 talking 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.210
 I in my case I do saturated but not 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.450
 It's a lot 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:37.860
 4 is not that I recommend it to me 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.090
 liked like about 4 then he 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.850
 you bazÃ¡n trying and we put ok already 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.010
 I have a good current versions are 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.220
 grab the one it is about and what places it in 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.210
 get that and ready we must do now 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.120
 back to back which we place and equal 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.730
 to the fs and ok 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.020
 one of our six moments and we're going 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.220
 for one per second 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:09.140
 it's done and it's ready now it's done 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.030
 we have calibrated the speaker 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.340
 in case you want to upload the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.410
 volume on the handset tab is the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.209
 headset that focuses us that you're going to 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.500
 regret because they have to do is 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.600
 take out lies the same procedure 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:28.310
 they have to go to that crazy place 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:30.620
 the 0 3 0 0 3 stereo headset media east 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.750
 is for no hands-free and will be 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.790
 link as it came here exactly 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.739
 place in the number you want 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.550
 in this case he placed 3 for the question of 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.590
 that I have very good headphones and 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.480
 that they resist a lot but you are going to 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.690
 go testing exactly the same 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.780
 way we buy with the speaker 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.360
 good with writing probably do 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.630
 exactly the same and place ok but 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.400
 this time and now what they have to do 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.090
 is to put bng again 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.580
 of searching the channels has an input of 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.520
 volume because here we have two channels 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.750
 then make this mode stereo 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.480
 channels therefore we have to 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.010
 connect to make them android wine 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.710
 good placing again 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.989
 in the event that I want to put you for not 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.170
 put hands free 04 stereo headset 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.190
 whithout mic good is already exactly what 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.580
 same by the law and that puts in it and 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.240
 it is also the detail 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.509
 deputy volume you put the two 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.689
 channels is exactly the same volume 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:40.090
 good and the volley guada to the fs like 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:42.539
 exactly of life so that with 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.539
 the speaker 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.849
 as we can see it is very simple 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.309
 yes
