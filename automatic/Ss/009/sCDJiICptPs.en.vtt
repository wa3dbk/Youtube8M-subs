00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
screeching noises now the whole game is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.109 
screeching noises now the whole game is
linear<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.930> shit<00:01:10.260> even<00:01:10.799> though<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.280> might<00:01:11.939> not

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
linear as shit even though it might not

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
linear as shit even though it might not

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
seem that way all you just run through a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280 
seem that way all you just run through a
map<00:01:14.430> shoot<00:01:15.150> stuff<00:01:15.420> you're<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.780> giving<00:01:15.960> no

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
map shoot stuff you're just giving no

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960 
map shoot stuff you're just giving no
clue<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:17.100> where<00:01:17.340> you're<00:01:17.490> supposed<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.880> be

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
clue on where you're supposed to be

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.719 
clue on where you're supposed to be
going<00:01:18.470> you're<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.500> forced<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.340> anywhere

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going you're not forced to go anywhere

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.080 
going you're not forced to go anywhere
but<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.720> level<00:01:21.930> design<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.580> basically<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
but the level design is basically you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
but the level design is basically you
have<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> jump<00:01:24.570> around<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.200> certain<00:01:25.470> place

have to jump around in a certain place

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.499 
have to jump around in a certain place
because<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> whole<00:01:26.909> game<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> whole

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
because that's the whole game the whole

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.969 
because that's the whole game the whole
game<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.400> big<00:01:29.430> level<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
game is just one big level on you

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.940 
game is just one big level on you
shooting<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.700> enemies<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> game

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
shooting at enemies that is all the game

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.050 
shooting at enemies that is all the game
really<00:01:35.189> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
really is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.789 
really is
you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.570> look<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.899> walkthrough<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
you can look up a walkthrough of it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.490 
you can look up a walkthrough of it
though<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.460> there's<00:01:38.790> no<00:01:39.000> real<00:01:39.210> map<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
though because there's no real map and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.429 
though because there's no real map and
there's<00:01:40.920> no<00:01:41.220> rule<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> choices<00:01:42.000> he

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
there's no rule in the choices he

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.219 
there's no rule in the choices he
reckons<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.710> what<00:01:43.860> I've<00:01:43.979> seen<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:45.170> trust<00:01:46.170> me

reckons from what I've seen and trust me

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.039 
reckons from what I've seen and trust me
I<00:01:46.590> searched<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.610> Detroit<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.180> alpha<00:01:48.509> map<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
I searched in Detroit to alpha map the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.510 
I searched in Detroit to alpha map the
whole<00:01:49.200> game<00:01:49.500> came<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:49.950> because<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.340> whole

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
whole game came up because the whole

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.710 
whole game came up because the whole
thing<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.420> linear<00:01:52.049> map<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> about

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
thing is just a linear map so about

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.649 
thing is just a linear map so about
eight<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:56.399> gameplay<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:58.140> jump<00:01:58.979> around

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
eight the gameplay is just jump around

but you're hit detection sucks because

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520 
but you're hit detection sucks because
after<00:02:02.909> time<00:02:03.119> your<00:02:03.299> bullets<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.810> passed<00:02:04.140> on

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
after time your bullets little passed on

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.950 
after time your bullets little passed on
for<00:02:04.679> some<00:02:04.890> reason<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:06.329> half<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> time

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
for some reason and then half the time

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.499 
for some reason and then half the time
when<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.289> jump<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.190> won't<00:02:08.519> register<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.209> jump

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
when you jump it won't register the jump

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.150 
when you jump it won't register the jump
the<00:02:09.780> after<00:02:10.049> register<00:02:10.410> jump<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> certain

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the after register jump at a certain

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.120 
the after register jump at a certain
time<00:02:11.489> or<00:02:11.549> else<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.600> won't<00:02:12.870> register<00:02:13.130> treating

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
time or else it won't register treating

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.039 
time or else it won't register treating
down<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.580> awkward<00:02:14.970> because<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.720> jump

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
down is awkward because you have to jump

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.670 
down is awkward because you have to jump
and<00:02:16.230> then<00:02:16.350> look<00:02:16.560> down<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:17.220> kind<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.790> it

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
and then look down it's kind of a do it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.809 
and then look down it's kind of a do it
again<00:02:19.680> flame<00:02:19.980> right<00:02:20.160> that's<00:02:20.489> all<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.700> really
