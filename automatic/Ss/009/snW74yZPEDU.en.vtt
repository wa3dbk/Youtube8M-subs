along in this path right here decided to
speed<00:00:31.910> it<00:00:32.060> up<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:32.450> you<00:00:32.509> guys<00:00:32.720> don't<00:00:32.960> have<00:00:33.050> to

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
A to point B so much so hopefully it's

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.670 
A to point B so much so hopefully it's
still<00:00:37.820> easy<00:00:38.090> to<00:00:38.240> follow<00:00:38.570> once<00:00:39.320> you<00:00:39.410> get<00:00:39.560> to

slightly I guess know to you know notice

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.940 
slightly I guess know to you know notice
your<00:01:36.950> your<00:01:37.399> presence<00:01:38.079> just<00:01:39.079> follow<00:01:39.439> along<00:01:39.619> in

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
your your presence just follow along in

your your presence just follow along in
this<00:01:40.069> path<00:01:40.340> there<00:01:40.609> so<00:01:40.759> you're<00:01:40.909> going<00:01:41.030> around

this path there so you're going around
the<00:01:41.569> back<00:01:41.780> route<00:01:42.819> now<00:01:43.819> actually<00:01:44.329> I<00:01:44.359> think<00:01:44.479> this

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
the back route now actually I think this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.859 
the back route now actually I think this
also<00:01:45.649> is<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.219> way<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.240> can<00:01:47.420> get<00:01:47.569> one<00:01:47.749> of

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
also is a way that you can get one of

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.559 
also is a way that you can get one of
the<00:01:47.929> Easter<00:01:48.289> eggs<00:01:48.469> or<00:01:48.679> not<00:01:48.799> get<00:01:49.069> but<00:01:49.249> you<00:01:49.369> could

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
the Easter eggs or not get but you could

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.059 
the Easter eggs or not get but you could
you<00:01:50.569> know<00:01:50.659> discover<00:01:51.229> one<00:01:51.439> of<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:51.560> Easter<00:01:51.920> eggs

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
you know discover one of the Easter eggs

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.919 
you know discover one of the Easter eggs
in<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.310> game<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.639> I'll<00:01:52.700> talk<00:01:52.880> about<00:01:52.929> that

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
in the game and I'll talk about that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.709 
in the game and I'll talk about that
when<00:01:54.289> that<00:01:54.439> comes<00:01:54.740> up<00:01:55.329> so<00:01:56.329> pretty<00:01:56.479> much<00:01:56.659> just

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
when that comes up so pretty much just

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.480 
when that comes up so pretty much just
following<00:01:57.259> this<00:01:57.380> path<00:01:57.590> right<00:01:57.829> here<00:01:57.950> mind<00:01:58.310> all

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
following this path right here mind all

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.629 
following this path right here mind all
this<00:01:58.609> is<00:01:58.789> straightforward<00:01:59.450> I<00:02:00.639> figured

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
this is straightforward I figured

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.010 
this is straightforward I figured
hopefully<00:02:01.999> this<00:02:02.149> will<00:02:02.240> save<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.569> guys<00:02:02.749> some

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
hopefully this will save you guys some

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.870 
hopefully this will save you guys some
time<00:02:03.229> from<00:02:04.039> trying<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.369> figure<00:02:04.639> out<00:02:04.670> exactly

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
time from trying to figure out exactly

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.520 
time from trying to figure out exactly
where<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.450> hell<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.749> need<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.049> go<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.380> know<00:02:06.499> I

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
where the hell you need to go you know I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.520 
where the hell you need to go you know I
mean<00:02:08.440> walk<00:02:09.440> around<00:02:09.740> this<00:02:09.920> way<00:02:09.979> he'll<00:02:11.530> come

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
people below could elaborate anyway once

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.539 
people below could elaborate anyway once
you<00:03:02.410> get<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.739> point<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.220> can<00:03:03.340> see<00:03:03.459> this

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
you get to that point you can see this

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.759 
you get to that point you can see this
dude<00:03:03.790> right<00:03:04.030> here<00:03:04.090> run<00:03:04.540> off<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.840> his<00:03:04.989> ass<00:03:05.200> now<00:03:05.739> I

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
dude right here run off to his ass now I

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.350 
dude right here run off to his ass now I
decided<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.250> slow<00:03:06.459> things<00:03:06.670> back<00:03:06.880> at<00:03:07.030> normal

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
decided to slow things back at normal

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.120 
decided to slow things back at normal
speed<00:03:07.600> because<00:03:07.959> then<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:08.260> way<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.950> guys

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
speed because then that way you guys

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.970 
speed because then that way you guys
could<00:03:09.489> see<00:03:09.700> exactly<00:03:10.680> where<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.709> went<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:13.980> think

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
could see exactly where I went I think

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.530 
could see exactly where I went I think
it<00:03:15.190> was<00:03:15.280> just<00:03:15.430> much<00:03:15.580> easier<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.060> follow<00:03:16.239> like

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
it was just much easier to follow like

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.599 
it was just much easier to follow like
this<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.709> pretty<00:03:17.920> much<00:03:18.010> can<00:03:18.310> make<00:03:18.430> your

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
this so you pretty much can make your

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.370 
this so you pretty much can make your
way<00:03:18.700> back<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.239> where<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.540> essentially<00:03:20.140> came

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
way back to where you essentially came

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.039 
way back to where you essentially came
from<00:03:22.350> outside<00:03:23.350> right<00:03:23.769> here<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:25.329> grassy<00:03:25.750> area

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
from outside right here the grassy area

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.360 
from outside right here the grassy area
now<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.410> doing<00:03:26.680> here<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:26.920> course<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.250> need

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
now this doing here of course you need

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.069 
now this doing here of course you need
to<00:03:27.400> beat<00:03:27.609> his<00:03:27.730> ass<00:03:27.880> down<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:28.390> only<00:03:28.600> homeboys

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
to beat his ass down but only homeboys

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.020 
to beat his ass down but only homeboys
them<00:03:29.350> can<00:03:29.500> come<00:03:29.680> pretty<00:03:30.310> much<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.700> can't

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
them can come pretty much you can't

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.330 
them can come pretty much you can't
really<00:03:31.269> counter<00:03:31.810> defeat<00:03:32.320> him<00:03:32.530> from<00:03:33.130> what<00:03:33.310> I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
really counter defeat him from what I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.660 
really counter defeat him from what I
seen<00:03:33.670> so<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:35.200> could<00:03:35.350> just<00:03:35.500> parry<00:03:35.799> his<00:03:36.040> Astro

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
seen so you could just parry his Astro

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.930 
seen so you could just parry his Astro
his<00:03:36.880> ass<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:38.160> speed<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.190> up<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.459> little<00:03:39.489> bit<00:03:39.820> so

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
his ass I speed it up a little bit so

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.449 
his ass I speed it up a little bit so
they<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.180> look<00:03:40.239> like<00:03:40.299> damn<00:03:40.630> Jackie<00:03:40.959> Chan<00:03:41.459> but

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
they can look like damn Jackie Chan but

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.620 
they can look like damn Jackie Chan but
um<00:03:42.640> yeah<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:42.970> could<00:03:43.120> pretty<00:03:43.239> much<00:03:43.329> just

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
um yeah you could pretty much just

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.099 
um yeah you could pretty much just
counted<00:03:43.959> his<00:03:44.079> ass<00:03:45.600> show<00:03:46.600> him<00:03:46.720> around<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
giving me some little problems I had

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.199 
giving me some little problems I had
trouble<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.489> talking<00:03:51.760> him<00:03:51.850> when<00:03:51.940> he<00:03:52.000> was<00:03:52.120> on

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
the floor but don't worry keep pushing

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.289 
the floor but don't worry keep pushing
me<00:03:54.549> off<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:58.120> give<00:03:58.239> him<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.359> one-two<00:04:00.299> there

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
me off I can give him the one-two there

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.479 
me off I can give him the one-two there
we<00:04:01.420> go<00:04:01.600> then<00:04:02.019> once<00:04:02.260> that's<00:04:02.500> done<00:04:02.890> make<00:04:03.280> your

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
we go then once that's done make your

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:03.900 
we go then once that's done make your
way<00:04:03.670> out

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
way out

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.390 
way out
exit<00:04:04.690> stage<00:04:04.930> left<00:04:04.989> in<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:05.739> direction<00:04:05.950> right

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
exit stage left in this direction right

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.220 
exit stage left in this direction right
here<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.209> pretty<00:04:10.359> much<00:04:10.450> go<00:04:10.690> head<00:04:10.870> back<00:04:11.079> to

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
here and you pretty much go head back to

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.420 
here and you pretty much go head back to
the<00:04:11.319> beginning<00:04:11.739> where<00:04:11.920> we<00:04:11.950> essentially

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
the beginning where we essentially

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.610 
the beginning where we essentially
started<00:04:12.940> off<00:04:13.060> at<00:04:13.389> in<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.840> train<00:04:14.109> station<00:04:16.620> so

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
started off at in the train station so

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.319 
started off at in the train station so
just<00:04:17.919> catch<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.519> crane<00:04:18.789> out<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:19.120> there<00:04:19.239> and

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
just catch the crane out of there and

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.629 
just catch the crane out of there and
call<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.810> dumb<00:04:19.989> day<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:21.130> that's<00:04:21.280> pretty<00:04:21.459> much

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
call it a dumb day so that's pretty much

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.310 
call it a dumb day so that's pretty much
that<00:04:21.700> so<00:04:22.000> we<00:04:22.120> got<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.419> second<00:04:22.750> power<00:04:22.900> saw

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
that so we got the second power saw

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.500 
that so we got the second power saw
so<00:04:23.409> once<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.710> get<00:04:23.890> it<00:04:24.010> now<00:04:24.760> this<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.270> what<00:04:25.419> you

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
so once you get it now this is what you

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.570 
so once you get it now this is what you
need<00:04:25.659> to<00:04:25.780> do<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.650> use<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:27.070> you<00:04:27.159> could<00:04:27.310> use<00:04:27.430> it

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
need to do to use it you could use it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.930 
need to do to use it you could use it
immediately

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
immediately

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.100 
immediately
laughter<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:28.390> get<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:28.540> head<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:29.020> this

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
laughter you get it head in this

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.370 
laughter you get it head in this

we can cut them off right now we just

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.480 
we can cut them off right now we just
trying<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.530> get<00:04:44.620> from<00:04:44.800> point<00:04:44.950> A<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.130> point<00:04:45.250> B

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
trying to get from point A to point B

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.890

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
it wasn't until I was trying to figure

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.690 
it wasn't until I was trying to figure
out<00:04:59.290> where<00:04:59.620> you<00:04:59.800> need<00:04:59.830> to<00:05:00.040> go<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.190> use<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.520> damn

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
out where you need to go to use the damn

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.490 
out where you need to go to use the damn
second<00:05:01.150> power<00:05:01.270> source<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:01.930> I<00:05:01.960> found<00:05:02.290> out

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
second power source that I found out

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.790 
second power source that I found out
about<00:05:02.680> this<00:05:02.980> bad<00:05:03.160> boy<00:05:03.370> so<00:05:04.560> it's<00:05:05.560> pretty<00:05:05.680> much

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
then when you get to this point or last

then when you get to this point or last
straight<00:05:12.970> down<00:05:14.760> do<00:05:15.760> some<00:05:15.790> little<00:05:16.090> acrobatic

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
straight down do some little acrobatic

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.370 
straight down do some little acrobatic
