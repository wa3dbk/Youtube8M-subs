00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.060

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.430
 hearts of spectators and up in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.070
 the Regionalliga Nordost played the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.390
 Bak is a top team that I am 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.830
 always wants to improve 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.720
 But a coach is not satisfied 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.940
 the team is supported by trainer 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.380
 Close in Hanover by the numerous fans 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.649
 the course also in the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.420
 away games are always there 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.059
 an important basis of success is the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.370
 youth work of the club from the u9 to 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.719
 to u 23 are in moabit all 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.910
 represented age groups 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.829
 sometimes even several teams have to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.840
 be formed and next to the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.210
 footballing are also social 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.070
 skills like respect them clean and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.190
 Tolerance at the center of education 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.359
 Here at the berliner ak we value 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.730
 especially of course on the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.530
 footballing but of course the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.119
 The discipline is how to give oneself 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.479
 of course the players on and off the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.600
 space 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.159
 We are also interested in that and put it there 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.740
 Of course we also value a lot 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.979
 because of course they are the discipline 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.240
 the punctuality bring everything 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.040
 actually for football, of course 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 Of course you can do that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 do not forget the academic aspect 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.590
 and there we try the boys 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.479
 Of course, even further 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.520
 mediated at work with the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.229
 For children and adolescents lies the bak 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.450
 not only worth the sporty 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.460
 Success is at least as important 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.270
 The President also has the social aspect 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.350
 I joined this football the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.579
 to get children off the streets and with 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.280
 Soccer 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.710
 The leisure time deal is so 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.300
 to take away from the bad things 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.980
 to introduce a good thing in more detail 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.380
 The contractor has the club through 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.730
 His commitment was financially saved and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.890
 continuously athletic like 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.620
 socially led up without 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.260
 ali han, berlin ak would not be where 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.000
 he is and he would not be what he is 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.690
 to the success secrets of the association 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.880
 in all ages to the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.310
 professionals are the mixture of pace 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.990
 order and joy of playing everything on one 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.690
 high athletic and technical 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.280
 level and this bak typical style 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.530
 is also reflected in the first 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.270
 team again in the different 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.910
 nationalities like the German or 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.070
 Turkish their very own football culture 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.900
 bring in where else can be found 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.360
 former Turkish national player 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.820

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.100
 bak and as multicultural as the team 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.770
 is also the audience in the poststadion 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.990
 this is where the different nations meet 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.120
 cultures and religions to one another 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.460
 to have fun and play their game 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.210

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.920

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.350
 many cultures live here 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.440

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.360
 and who can miss you berlin and 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.640
 It reflects exactly this diversity 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.400
 Plurality of this living metropolis 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.709

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.470
 the games are also appropriate 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.670
 impulsive and successful but also in 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.130
