00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:42.550 
representing five minutes of that round
five<00:02:33.240> minutes<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:38.150> equal<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.240> five<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:41.190> around

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
five minutes of equal in five is around

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.370 
five minutes of equal in five is around
and<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.740> do<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:43.920> again<00:02:44.630> okay<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:46.170> is

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
and then you do it again okay so this is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.010 
and then you do it again okay so this is
simulating<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.460> every<00:02:47.730> sense<00:02:48.000> what<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> fighter

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
simulating in every sense what a fighter

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.820 
simulating in every sense what a fighter
has<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:53.150> doing<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.020> each<00:02:55.170> minute<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.710> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
has to doing so in each minute of the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:06.070 
has to doing so in each minute of the
rounds<00:02:56.930> okay<00:02:58.580> stop<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.610> okay

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.690 

this<00:03:06.380> is<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.590> last<00:03:06.770> one<00:03:07.070> this<00:03:07.400> would<00:03:07.520> be<00:03:07.550> the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
this is the last one this would be the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.090 
this is the last one this would be the
fifth<00:03:07.910> one<00:03:08.030> okay

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
fifth one okay

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.540 
fifth one okay
these<00:03:09.580> are<00:03:09.810> bitch<00:03:10.810> hops<00:03:11.080> much<00:03:11.590> fishing<00:03:12.370> hands

donors for that's the last one we do

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.150 
donors for that's the last one we do
after<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.390> one<00:03:20.540> correct<00:03:21.170> okay<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:21.950> about<00:03:22.130> a

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
then combined with some floor work at

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.540 
then combined with some floor work at
work<00:05:36.950> and<00:05:37.850> weight<00:05:38.060> training

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550

but<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:43.460> would<00:05:43.640> do<00:05:43.730> it<00:05:43.880> I<00:05:44.060> work<00:05:44.780> with

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
but I would do it I work with

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.410 
but I would do it I work with
kettlebells<00:05:45.200> and<00:05:45.590> work<00:05:45.740> with<00:05:46.180> Russian<00:05:47.180> get<00:05:47.330> at

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
kettlebells and work with Russian get at

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.440 
kettlebells and work with Russian get at
this<00:05:47.570> yes<00:05:48.290> ok<00:05:48.890> I<00:05:49.100> would<00:05:49.370> do<00:05:49.490> exercises<00:05:50.210> like

and how often would you change things up
is<00:06:08.330> it<00:06:08.660> always<00:06:08.870> this<00:06:09.200> kind<00:06:09.500> of<00:06:09.590> circuit<00:06:09.950> it<00:06:10.400> is

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
is it always this kind of circuit it is

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.570 
is it always this kind of circuit it is
kind<00:06:10.910> of<00:06:11.000> circuit<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.570> exercise<00:06:11.960> change<00:06:12.580> all
