 my father had been drinking though they were right in between 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.500
 currently learning from the home of the suspect 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.659
 after an hour 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.429
 around five o'clock was a euro 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.749

 armed men 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.050
 who would have thought that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.190
 were there last year 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.680
 what a big party 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.490
 naturally follows summer 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.970

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.970
 finally to throw with bronze 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.000
 you can hear it nicely at the fair in zurich 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.940
 9 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.820
 nobody hold to buy 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.690
 after a year earlier 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.780

 I did syria too 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.290
 kicking a ball on the road is also very disturbing 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.840

 We all know why do we continue to get more there 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.030
