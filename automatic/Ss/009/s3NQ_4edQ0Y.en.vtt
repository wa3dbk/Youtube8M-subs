00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.720
 you didnâ€™t even think about 2 more hands to decree 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.110
 what is it about whose career 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.150
 This is the period of 26 years when I came to 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.890
 theater and saw that a lot of young 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.050
 who breathe in the back 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.220
 it was very tragic for me 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.730
 let's say so i had such a single moment 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.730
 when I was at a performance where I was dancing 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.360
 my friend with whom I studied 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:36.290
 and then I envied this one 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.290
 smell the smell of Ulysses scene when I thereto 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.010
 I went there this atmosphere of course 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.300
 reminded 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.030
 nostalgie i felt like i'm 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.180
 on the wrong side of the scenes 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.430

 hanging it was a shot of some kind 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.590
 unconscious I probably thought that 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.810

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.750
