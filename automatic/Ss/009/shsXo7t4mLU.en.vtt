more structure than and that's good for

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.809 
more structure than and that's good for
you<00:03:19.870> because<00:03:20.019> it's<00:03:20.440> Andre<00:03:20.799> prone<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.610> not

one<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:25.960> joys<00:04:26.169> about<00:04:26.500> children<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.099> taking

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
one of the joys about children is taking

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.060 
one of the joys about children is taking
the<00:04:28.150> simple<00:04:28.510> things<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:29.050> life<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.740> being<00:04:29.979> able

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
whether it's you know going to a park or

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.589 
whether it's you know going to a park or
to<00:04:36.039> a<00:04:36.070> beach<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:36.880> see<00:04:37.090> their<00:04:37.300> excitement

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
to a beach and to see their excitement

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.029 
to a beach and to see their excitement
for<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.139> and<00:04:38.380> their<00:04:38.470> excitement<00:04:38.650> for<00:04:38.889> that

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
for this and their excitement for that

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.290 
for this and their excitement for that
but<00:04:39.220> when<00:04:39.340> you're<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.610> aware<00:04:39.880> of<00:04:39.970> what<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
but when you're so aware of what the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.050 
but when you're so aware of what the
next<00:04:41.139> sort<00:04:41.349> of<00:04:41.470> obstacles<00:04:42.310> gonna<00:04:42.490> be<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.789> just

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
next sort of obstacles gonna be I just

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.910 
next sort of obstacles gonna be I just
think<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.510> would<00:04:43.570> compromise<00:04:43.840> our<00:04:44.289> ability

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
think it would compromise our ability

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.470 
think it would compromise our ability
enjoy<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.400> ride<00:04:45.550> with<00:04:45.790> them<00:04:45.940> as<00:04:46.090> much<00:04:46.240> and

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
enjoy the ride with them as much and

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.510 
enjoy the ride with them as much and
it's<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:47.020> selfish<00:04:47.380> decision<00:04:47.530> but<00:04:47.980> I<00:04:48.040> wouldn't

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
it's a selfish decision but I wouldn't

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.100 
it's a selfish decision but I wouldn't
because<00:04:49.360> they<00:04:49.450> didn't<00:04:49.690> know<00:04:49.780> how<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:49.990> was

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
because they didn't know how it was

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.180 
because they didn't know how it was
gonna<00:04:50.200> unfold<00:04:50.650> okay

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
gonna unfold okay

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.440 
gonna unfold okay
so<00:04:51.310> they're<00:04:51.460> just<00:04:51.610> going<00:04:51.820> along<00:04:51.940> for<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.270> ride

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
so they're just going along for the ride

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.490 
so they're just going along for the ride
but<00:04:52.630> we<00:04:52.720> wouldn't<00:04:52.840> be<00:04:52.990> go<00:04:53.080> along<00:04:53.200> for<00:04:53.230> the<00:04:53.350> ride

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
but we wouldn't be go along for the ride

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.080 
but we wouldn't be go along for the ride
we'd<00:04:53.650> be<00:04:53.740> scared<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.190> death<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.670> what<00:04:54.820> they're

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
we'd be scared to death of what they're

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.470 
we'd be scared to death of what they're
in<00:04:55.180> for

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
in for

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.690 
in for
and<00:04:55.720> as<00:04:56.320> a<00:04:56.350> result<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.980> think<00:04:57.010> it's<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.340> selfish

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
and as a result I think it's a selfish

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.390 
and as a result I think it's a selfish
it<00:04:58.210> would<00:04:58.480> be<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.660> selfish<00:04:59.050> choice<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.560> not<00:04:59.740> sort

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
it would be a selfish choice to not sort

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.520 
it would be a selfish choice to not sort
of<00:05:00.520> I<00:05:00.790> wouldn't<00:05:01.750> say<00:05:01.900> we<00:05:01.990> wouldn't<00:05:02.110> let<00:05:02.290> him<00:05:02.470> if

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
of I wouldn't say we wouldn't let him if

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.410 
of I wouldn't say we wouldn't let him if
there<00:05:02.680> was<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:02.830> desire<00:05:03.790> that<00:05:03.820> they<00:05:04.120> had<00:05:04.300> to
