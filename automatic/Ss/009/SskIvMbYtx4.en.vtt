00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.240
 for the European school of management and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.190
 company is very important to maintain this 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.510
 type of relationships with universities of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 prestige as is this case the 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.450
 university sergio arboleda de bogotÃ¡ de 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.310
 Colombia as we narrow in our 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.500
 academic alliances mainly 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.699
 to our university the university of 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.880
 vejer by the one of that in Bogota Colombia 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.739
 It gives you the possibility that 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.780
 students can come and meet 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.239
 In addition to European culture culture 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.180
 Spanish the opportunity to open its 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.489
 mind on the subject of business in the subject 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.489
 of relationships on the economic issue 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.030
 many times I have listened to myself 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.380
 heard in my country colombia terms 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.130
 as innovation terms like 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.930
 competitiveness as globalization and it was 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.270
 interesting to hear them but when coming to 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.690
 europe and come to Spain in specific 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:11.370
 I can size and understand more this 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.990
 type of definitions 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.990
 and it gives us that possibility to have a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 really close to cultures 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.730
 different people who have done things 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.460
 different and go to our roots of 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.660
 history and good to learn things 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.660
 new from the academic point of view 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.549
 other experiences that teachers from 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.890
 this place have a very high quality 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.680
 not only are they very good at 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.450
 doctorates masters and so on but they are 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.940
 very good at the time of teaching it shows 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.900
 which is a passion and it shows that not 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.520
 they only want us 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.430
 learn information but to form 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.860
 as professionals we have had the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.659
 privilege to receive them here and good 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.800
 have enjoyed a master class 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.000
 from one of the dvd teachers we hope that 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.670
 this kind of activities we can 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.500
 do the inverse in the future and continue 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.619
 narrowing this type of ties 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.619
 academics
