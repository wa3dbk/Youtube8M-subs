 later cospedal 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.230
 the stein case 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.230
 passes gay culture poster 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.460
 all are words name names that sound like 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.760
 for example 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.910
 part of the garden universe 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.280
 in different tastes 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.680
 in the part 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.710
 quite a lot more fantastic work that they have fantasy payá 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.860
 maybe they are side 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670
 spiritual base of the motorcycle too 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.670
 that's why my PAN friends and lets them do not want to run 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.989
 and I understand what to do if you go contemplating everything around you to your 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.130
 idol ernesto peptico watchtower 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.720
 of the fine arts 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.690
 obviously what to eat 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.360
 so 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.270
 because before question is why do a driving course 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.100
 at this point of falling 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.070
 good has two fundamental reasons 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.020
 one of them the first 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.630
 since these bikes have characteristics that are known to make them 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.460
 some difficulties for crops love motorcycles easy to conti we are very long 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.580
 two very heavy bikes 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.030
 there are no roads that are difficult for beginners 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.750
 especially with complicated with we are 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.120
 I tell you that you need to do a course with us so that you can go with bread to 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.450
 any paved road of our country 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.320
 that can reach any corner 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.090
 sunk in the shrimp 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.440
 on the other hand 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.090
 because why come or 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.870
 do a course on how 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.740
 I understand that 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.750
 enjoying everything that surrounds you at that rhythm called "pineapple beads" 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.530
 but that it is also true that when it reaches the area of ​​curved vats 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.670
 closed tubs usually means a site to leave ready 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.440
 because he has to break his pleasant moment and start working with the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.259
 motorcycle 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.829
 with certain difficulties to get into two curves to get it in, get out it's 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:17.969
 and maneuver 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:25.129
 double a bit a delegation of a sun course by more than to act of embargo 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.850
 impractical 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.340
 so that when it arrives 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.709
 to an area I turned 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.349
 that is, your subconscious 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.010
 the one that I worked on, you have to put an end to the myths that you do not have why 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.989
 interrupt 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.489
 commented that people 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.689
 for the moment the laptop 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.989
