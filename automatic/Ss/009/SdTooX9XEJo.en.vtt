 It 's like a dream that you can be self-sufficient in a Yey situation 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:22.610
 I thought it was a house 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:22.610
 I hope you can live a healthy and comfortable life without temperature differences throughout the year 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 We have built g hair of the moment in Japan 8 buildings of the professional line 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:38.930
 It is similar between Nagano, Fukuoka 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:46.010
 Las Energy clan officer of Yokohama Nari 1 horses we have built in Wakayama heard near Tokyo 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:53.210
 Niigata store Las Energy House has a harsher natural environment than my previous pro-sesame house 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:56.420
 There is less sunshine time compared to other people, so a better building to cover it 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.920
 Build and is the fact that if this is possible in our 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.570
 There is now a big challenge 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:09.869
 + Anag House is a very good financially affordable home 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.590
 Minimizing energy consumption by creating high-precision housing 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:20.000
 By using solar panels 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:23.750
 Come back a lot of money than the 8 study dictionary companies that use them in the leading edge by drone 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.909
 This is a basic concept 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.480
 Self-sufficient energy when listening for the first time 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.909
 Be self-sufficient 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.030
 I do not think that I fell 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.890
 Self-sufficient energy 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.950
 To say 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.720
 Because it also leads to co2 reduction 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.960
 It is only one case but from there 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.090
 If small 2 reduction can be done, in the future 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.040
 To children 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.540
 Beautiful shame hill doka 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.630

 + A Dah g House we are allowed to visit the the Do not be my trip was very impressed 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.790
 It's warm and there is no energy cost 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.670
 We all who entered want to build 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.400
 outside 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.020
 I can not put cold air in

 Are you making secret? 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.420

 Plus Energy House is more than a typical home 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:46.120
 Very good tear and gold rate 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:54.209
 The insulation performance of the wall is different from the insulation performance of the opening 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.209
 The house is heated above 74.5 with air conditioning for 16 tatami 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.080

 We thought that we could do the most fixed lottery in the world by combining these 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.370
 Beneath it decided to challenge Te 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.630

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.890
 I can not economy 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.090
 Because the utility costs are not good either
