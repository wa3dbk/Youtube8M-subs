00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.889
 to make our arm orange 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 We are going to need 6 eggs 240 grams of 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.650
 sugar 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 the juice of two oranges 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.510
 the skin zest of those two 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.900
 oranges 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.689
 a spoonful of flour 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.689
 and 120 grams of butter 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.220
 apart we will need a little bit of 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.830
 butter to assemble the mold and a 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.830
 little sugar for the final disassembly 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.390
 and we have the source that will go to the oven in 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 this time we are going to use a source of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.030
 aluminum extras that we have 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 important role baking paper 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.420
 now the baking paper we have 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.180
 melted butter and we're going to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.280
 ride well commented with butter 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.280
 melted all over the surface 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.060
 when we have already extended it 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.060
 we have ready to throw the mixture 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.910
 we already have the games slightly 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.910
 shakes we add the sugar 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.330
 the orange zest 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.189
 and bugle 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.240
 this now we 're going to mix it 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.729
 all right 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.189
 and when it's well mixed everything 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.189
 well integrated we will add the rest 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.870
 we already have it well mixed and now 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.870
 we add the juice 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.900
 and we beat again 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.560
 and already everything well integrated last 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.560
 we add the melted butter 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.260
 we already have the hot oven the paper 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.790
 as you see smeared butter and now 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.790
 we only have to throw the mixture 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.299
 at the source 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.140
 and now we go directly to the furnace 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.140
 oven at 200 degrees about 25 minutes 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.600
 now the next step before taking out 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.600
 the cake of the oven is on a cloth 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.350
 clean cotton we are going to throw tien of 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.680
 sugar over unmold we have over 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.120
 this cloth and with the help of cloth 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.120
 we will go rolling 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.470
 and here we have our orange arm 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.300
 As you can see, you have to roll it carefully 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.540
 and in hot you have to be careful 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.310
 because it burns a lot we've put it in 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.190
 our source that we have lengthened a 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.660
 little with icing sugar now we're going to 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.940
 put some oranges then a little to 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.430
 make the photo a little decoration and then 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.660
 when it is cold at all we will try 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.700
 do 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.090
 we will try to cut it and take some pictures 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.160
 indoor to see how simple 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.730
 you already see a dessert very easy to make 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.310
 simple and it's great I hope that you 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.860
 have liked it and we are waiting for you here in 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.670
 next recipe 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.670
 and let's go
