00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
get to the left hand tower left hand

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.340 
get to the left hand tower left hand
town<00:06:36.490> right<00:06:36.850> and<00:06:37.030> then<00:06:37.240> climb<00:06:37.600> up<00:06:37.780> onto<00:06:38.020> the

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
town right and then climb up onto the

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.620 
town right and then climb up onto the
right<00:06:38.800> hand<00:06:38.860> tower<00:06:39.310> from<00:06:39.610> there<00:06:39.850> I<00:06:40.030> know<00:06:40.360> the

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
right hand tower from there I know the

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.540 
right hand tower from there I know the
idea<00:06:40.900> is<00:06:41.080> with<00:06:41.229> these<00:06:41.440> big<00:06:41.919> assassination

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
idea is with these big assassination

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.980 
idea is with these big assassination
missions<00:06:42.820> in<00:06:43.030> Assassin's<00:06:43.360> Creed<00:06:43.510> unity<00:06:43.660> that

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
missions in Assassin's Creed unity that

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.300 
missions in Assassin's Creed unity that
you<00:06:44.080> connect<00:06:44.320> you<00:06:44.590> can<00:06:44.740> approach<00:06:44.919> him<00:06:45.040> any<00:06:45.190> way

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
you connect you can approach him any way

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.850 
you connect you can approach him any way
you<00:06:45.370> like<00:06:45.700> yeah<00:06:46.479> but<00:06:46.900> you<00:06:47.110> definitely<00:06:47.350> seem

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
you like yeah but you definitely seem

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.000 
you like yeah but you definitely seem
directed<00:06:48.430> at<00:06:48.550> a<00:06:48.640> certain<00:06:49.030> like<00:06:49.240> canonical

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
directed at a certain like canonical

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.469 
directed at a certain like canonical
cinematic<00:06:51.010> assassination<00:06:52.000> yeah<00:06:52.180> I<00:06:52.210> mean

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 
cinematic assassination yeah I mean

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.210 
cinematic assassination yeah I mean
there<00:06:52.660> was<00:06:52.780> a<00:06:52.810> cutscene<00:06:53.289> for<00:06:53.710> that<00:06:53.830> one<00:06:53.979> which

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
there was a cutscene for that one which

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.010 
there was a cutscene for that one which
unless<00:06:54.880> there's<00:06:55.090> a<00:06:55.120> cutscene<00:06:55.300> for<00:06:55.510> everyone<00:06:55.840> I

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
unless there's a cutscene for everyone I

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.779 
unless there's a cutscene for everyone I
think<00:06:56.080> that<00:06:56.350> might<00:06:56.500> be<00:06:56.530> the<00:06:56.890> case<00:06:57.190> it<00:06:57.760> seems

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
think that might be the case it seems

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.610 
think that might be the case it seems
pretty<00:06:58.180> engineered<00:06:58.750> for<00:06:58.930> like<00:06:59.080> that<00:06:59.320> is<00:06:59.500> the

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
pretty engineered for like that is the

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.700 
pretty engineered for like that is the
coolest<00:07:00.010> way<00:07:00.160> to<00:07:00.190> do<00:07:00.430> that<00:07:00.960> yeah<00:07:01.960> ideally<00:07:02.530> it'd

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
coolest way to do that yeah ideally it'd

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.230 
coolest way to do that yeah ideally it'd
be<00:07:02.830> like<00:07:02.950> a<00:07:03.130> line<00:07:03.310> where<00:07:03.520> there's<00:07:03.700> like<00:07:03.850> a<00:07:03.880> load

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
be like a line where there's like a load

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.090 
be like a line where there's like a load
of<00:07:04.270> really<00:07:05.080> specific<00:07:05.260> ways<00:07:05.740> to<00:07:05.919> kill<00:07:06.070> people

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
of really specific ways to kill people
