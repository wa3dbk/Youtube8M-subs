another<00:01:28.200> thing<00:01:28.409> besides<00:01:28.530> Flair's<00:01:29.100> past<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
another thing besides Flair's past that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.190 
another thing besides Flair's past that
we<00:01:29.729> learned<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.390> chapter<00:01:30.840> was

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
we learned about in this chapter was

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
we learned about in this chapter was
that<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> ice<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.159> actual<00:01:32.610> mountain<00:01:33.030> has

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that the ice on this actual mountain has

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
that the ice on this actual mountain has
magical<00:01:33.960> properties<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.650> why<00:01:34.799> Peugeot

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
magical properties that's why Peugeot

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.890 
magical properties that's why Peugeot
couldn't<00:01:35.520> tunnel<00:01:35.820> into<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.780> was

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
couldn't tunnel into it and it was

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.210 
couldn't tunnel into it and it was
stopping<00:01:37.290> her<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:37.439> pretty<00:01:37.799> much<00:01:37.950> going

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
stopping her from pretty much going

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710 
stopping her from pretty much going
through<00:01:38.250> which<00:01:38.700> once<00:01:38.880> again<00:01:39.150> makes<00:01:39.360> me<00:01:39.420> think

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
through which once again makes me think

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.450 
through which once again makes me think
that<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.960> entire<00:01:40.259> mountain<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> eternal

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that this entire mountain is the eternal

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.980 
that this entire mountain is the eternal
flame<00:01:41.670> itself<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.750> makes<00:01:42.899> sense

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
flame itself and it kind of makes sense

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.420 
flame itself and it kind of makes sense
that<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> eternal<00:01:44.189> flame

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that that would be the eternal flame

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.130 
that that would be the eternal flame
because<00:01:44.759> arrows<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.450> turning<00:01:45.750> into<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.020> little

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
because arrows are turning into a little

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
because arrows are turning into a little
kid<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.710> still<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.340> buy<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
kid I still don't buy that that was that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.940 
kid I still don't buy that that was that
monster<00:01:48.600> thing<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.200> turned<00:01:49.439> her<00:01:49.530> into<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
monster thing that turned her into it I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.319 
monster thing that turned her into it I
think<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> eternal<00:01:51.090> flame

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
think it was really the eternal flame

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
think it was really the eternal flame
and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.689> something<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.020> flare<00:01:52.380> says<00:01:52.680> about

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and then something that flare says about

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.069 
and then something that flare says about
the<00:01:53.159> eternal<00:01:53.579> flame<00:01:53.820> blessing<00:01:54.540> her<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the eternal flame blessing her with that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.660 
the eternal flame blessing her with that
hair<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.680> makes<00:01:55.829> me<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> she<00:01:56.430> got<00:01:56.549> her

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
hair it makes me think that she got her

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.310 
hair it makes me think that she got her
magic<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.450> from<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> eternal<00:01:58.079> flame

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
magic actually from the eternal flame

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
magic actually from the eternal flame
for<00:01:58.770> her<00:01:58.920> hair<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.340> pretty<00:01:59.549> much<00:01:59.670> that's<00:01:59.820> how

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
for her hair and pretty much that's how

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.459 
for her hair and pretty much that's how
it<00:02:00.119> keeps<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.930> becoming<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it keeps on you know becoming like a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.929 
it keeps on you know becoming like a
weapon<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:02.009> her<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.430> made<00:02:02.549> me<00:02:02.640> think<00:02:02.790> does

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
weapon for her but it made me think does

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.429 
weapon for her but it made me think does
that<00:02:03.090> hair<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.420> keep<00:02:03.630> growing<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:04.049> because

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
that hair just keep growing back because

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.899 
that hair just keep growing back because
the<00:02:04.530> treasure<00:02:04.770> hunter<00:02:05.100> cut<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.549> twice

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the treasure hunter cut it like twice

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
the treasure hunter cut it like twice
and<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.479> kept<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.780> growing<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.350> gotta<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.710> some

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and it kept on growing I gotta be some

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
and it kept on growing I gotta be some
damn<00:02:08.280> magic<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.479> bit<00:02:09.660> confusing

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
damn magic it was a little bit confusing

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.460 
damn magic it was a little bit confusing
to<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.560> flare<00:02:10.830> came<00:02:11.069> from<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.459> actual

them because even though I exaggerated

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.010

and especially we got Flair now on their

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.800 
and especially we got Flair now on their
side<00:03:28.370> they<00:03:28.790> fitted<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.209> model<00:03:29.480> system<00:03:29.660> so

than them getting their asses kicked in

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.770 
than them getting their asses kicked in
the<00:03:34.610> end<00:03:34.760> which<00:03:35.000> made<00:03:35.209> things<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.510> little<00:03:35.630> less

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780
