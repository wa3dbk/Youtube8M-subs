time you spend there at all so really if

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.950 
time you spend there at all so really if
it's<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> matter<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.450> being<00:00:48.480> there

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it's just a matter of you being there

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.299 
it's just a matter of you being there
the<00:00:49.079> best<00:00:49.230> option<00:00:49.649> would<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.100> there

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the best option would just be there

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.040 
the best option would just be there
exist<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.940> space<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.600> little<00:00:51.899> while

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
exist in that space for a little while

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.200 
exist in that space for a little while
do<00:00:52.320> basically<00:00:52.860> nothing<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.670> paid<00:00:53.879> but

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
do basically nothing and get paid but

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
do basically nothing and get paid but
first<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> can't<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.440> nothing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
first you can't actually just do nothing

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.319 
first you can't actually just do nothing
because<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:56.399> you're<00:00:56.550> risk<00:00:56.730> losing<00:00:56.910> your<00:00:57.120> job

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
because then you're risk losing your job

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.520 
because then you're risk losing your job
and<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> won't<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.899> making<00:00:58.050> any<00:00:58.260> money

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and then you won't be making any money

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.650 
and then you won't be making any money
at<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> real<00:00:59.699> question<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.300> becomes

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
at all so the real question then becomes

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
at all so the real question then becomes
how<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.500> away<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:02.520> doing

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
how to get away with actually doing

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
how to get away with actually doing
nothing<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> greatest<00:01:03.870> amount<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.320> time

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
