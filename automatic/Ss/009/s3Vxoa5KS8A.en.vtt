for my cabin in the woods or storage
building<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:22.040> video<00:00:22.279> is<00:00:22.369> a<00:00:22.430> little<00:00:22.700> bit

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
building the video is a little bit

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.300 
building the video is a little bit
choppy<00:00:23.060> because<00:00:23.390> it<00:00:24.349> was<00:00:24.500> shot<00:00:24.710> over<00:00:25.010> several

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
choppy because it was shot over several

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.120 
choppy because it was shot over several
days<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.939> it's<00:00:26.900> hard<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.230> film<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.800> video<00:00:27.919> and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
days and it's hard to film a video and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.839 
days and it's hard to film a video and
work<00:00:28.489> this<00:00:28.880> hard<00:00:29.150> at<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.079> same<00:00:30.320> time<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.070> hope

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
work this hard at the same time so hope

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.200

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
are currently standing in my future

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.720 
are currently standing in my future
storage<00:00:39.260> building<00:00:39.680> spot<00:00:40.870> we've<00:00:41.870> got<00:00:42.079> the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
storage building spot we've got the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.200 
storage building spot we've got the
wooden<00:00:43.730> frame<00:00:44.120> set<00:00:44.750> up<00:00:44.899> here<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:46.000> this<00:00:47.000> is<00:00:47.090> my

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
wooden frame set up here and this is my

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.020 
wooden frame set up here and this is my
first<00:00:47.480> attempt<00:00:47.899> with<00:00:48.019> concrete<00:00:48.469> ever<00:00:49.000> as<00:00:50.000> far

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
first attempt with concrete ever as far

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.590 
first attempt with concrete ever as far
as<00:00:50.329> making<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.690> pad<00:00:50.929> goes<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:51.670> I've<00:00:52.670> got<00:00:52.940> my<00:00:53.239> wire

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
as making a pad goes so I've got my wire

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.299 
as making a pad goes so I've got my wire
mesh<00:00:54.250> my<00:00:55.250> moisture<00:00:55.969> barrier<00:00:56.359> and<00:00:57.160> then<00:00:58.160> I've

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
mesh my moisture barrier and then I've

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.660 
mesh my moisture barrier and then I've
got<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.789> truck<00:00:59.059> over<00:00:59.390> here<00:00:59.679> with<00:01:00.679> gravel<00:01:01.249> so

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
got to truck over here with gravel so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.810 
got to truck over here with gravel so
I'm<00:01:02.480> going<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.690> put<00:01:02.899> down<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.190> base<00:01:04.190> of<00:01:04.430> gravel

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
I'm going to put down a base of gravel

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.840 
I'm going to put down a base of gravel
first<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.110> can<00:01:06.290> see<00:01:06.550> I've<00:01:07.550> got<00:01:07.790> a

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
first and you can see I've got a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.600 
first and you can see I've got a
difference<00:01:08.330> in<00:01:08.480> height<00:01:08.750> from<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.470> here<00:01:09.860> versus

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
difference in height from in here versus

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.030 
difference in height from in here versus
up<00:01:10.790> here<00:01:11.409> so<00:01:12.409> it'll<00:01:12.500> be<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.620> little<00:01:12.770> bit<00:01:12.860> thicker

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
up here so it'll be a little bit thicker

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.390 
up here so it'll be a little bit thicker
concrete<00:01:13.550> down<00:01:13.700> there<00:01:14.380> but<00:01:15.380> let's<00:01:15.980> get<00:01:16.220> to

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
concrete down there but let's get to

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.670 
concrete down there but let's get to
work<00:01:16.550> putting<00:01:16.880> some<00:01:17.390> rock<00:01:17.720> down<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.350> here

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
work putting some rock down in here

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.110 
work putting some rock down in here
here's<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.430> look<00:01:19.670> at<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.270> foundation<00:01:20.960> with<00:01:21.140> the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
here's a look at the foundation with the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.720 
here's a look at the foundation with the
bedrock<00:01:23.120> on<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.660> I<00:01:24.340> suppose<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.490> call<00:01:25.610> it

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
bedrock on it I suppose you call it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.270 
bedrock on it I suppose you call it
bedrock<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:27.350> next<00:01:27.620> I'm<00:01:27.710> going<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.860> put<00:01:28.010> the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
bedrock so next I'm going to put the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.460 
bedrock so next I'm going to put the
plastic<00:01:28.880> down<00:01:29.060> for<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.540> vapor<00:01:29.810> barrier<00:01:29.990> and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
plastic down for the vapor barrier and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.610 
plastic down for the vapor barrier and
then<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.610> metal<00:01:32.120> mesh<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.570> keep<00:01:32.750> concrete

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
then the metal mesh to keep concrete

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.010 
then the metal mesh to keep concrete
together<00:01:33.950> now<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:34.610> have<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.180> black<00:01:35.390> plastic

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
together now I have the black plastic

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.770 
together now I have the black plastic
vapor<00:01:36.290> barrier<00:01:36.890> down<00:01:38.200> looking<00:01:39.200> good<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.770> hope

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
vapor barrier down looking good I hope

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.900 
vapor barrier down looking good I hope
never<00:01:41.780> done<00:01:41.960> one<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.110> these<00:01:42.200> before<00:01:42.410> so<00:01:42.910> not

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
never done one of these before so not

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.790 
never done one of these before so not
sure<00:01:44.180> how<00:01:44.690> much<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.020> supposed<00:01:45.260> to<00:01:45.320> be<00:01:45.500> on<00:01:45.620> the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
sure how much is supposed to be on the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.310 
sure how much is supposed to be on the
sides<00:01:46.040> but<00:01:46.370> I'm<00:01:47.210> sure<00:01:47.450> whatever<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:47.810> concrete

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
sides but I'm sure whatever it concrete

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.200 
sides but I'm sure whatever it concrete
gets<00:01:48.410> on<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.680> it'll<00:01:48.830> pack<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.340> down<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.490> lot<00:01:49.760> so

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
gets on it it'll pack it down a lot so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.140 
gets on it it'll pack it down a lot so
alright<00:01:51.200> now<00:01:51.500> on<00:01:51.740> for<00:01:51.980> the<00:01:52.040> metal<00:01:52.340> now<00:01:52.970> I've

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
alright now on for the metal now I've

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.920 
alright now on for the metal now I've
got<00:01:53.330> some<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.690> this<00:01:53.750> wire<00:01:54.080> mesh<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:55.940> top<00:01:56.720> of<00:01:56.870> the

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
got some of this wire mesh on top of the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.050 
got some of this wire mesh on top of the
plastic<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.880> hopes<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.270> will<00:02:01.060> hold

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
plastic and hopes that that will hold

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.820 
plastic and hopes that that will hold
the<00:02:02.270> concrete<00:02:02.690> together<00:02:02.840> some<00:02:03.320> whatever<00:02:03.500> it's

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
the concrete together some whatever it's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.460 
the concrete together some whatever it's
board<00:02:04.190> well<00:02:04.790> in<00:02:05.030> preparation<00:02:05.780> for<00:02:05.810> pouring<00:02:06.320> my

94 pounds in cement plus two busted bags
that<00:02:24.830> were<00:02:24.950> free<00:02:25.280> I'm<00:02:25.490> hoping<00:02:26.450> that's<00:02:26.660> enough

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
that were free I'm hoping that's enough

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.040 
that were free I'm hoping that's enough
so<00:02:27.320> basically<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.860> makes<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.190> three<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:29.390> two<00:02:29.750> to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
so basically it makes a three to two to

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.440 
so basically it makes a three to two to
one<00:02:30.830> part<00:02:31.220> mix<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.840> now<00:02:33.050> it's<00:02:33.620> time<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:35.300> begin

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
one part mix so now it's time to begin

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.160 
one part mix so now it's time to begin
pouring<00:02:36.010> I've<00:02:37.010> got<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:37.640> cement<00:02:38.360> mixer<00:02:38.780> for

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
pouring I've got this cement mixer for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:50.130 
pouring I've got this cement mixer for
the<00:02:39.320> day<00:02:46.660> all<00:02:47.660> right<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.110> he<00:02:48.200> says<00:02:48.440> turn<00:02:49.040> on

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
the day all right so he says turn on

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:59.160 
the day all right so he says turn on
fuel<00:02:51.140> line<00:02:53.290> okay<00:02:54.760> push<00:02:55.760> choke<00:02:56.120> all<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.660> way

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:07.620 

make<00:03:00.170> sure<00:03:00.470> your<00:03:00.680> cutoff<00:03:01.010> switches<00:03:01.580> are<00:03:02.000> on

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.390 

let<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.810> bead<00:03:09.800> indicator<00:03:11.500> interesting<00:03:12.500> all

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
let this bead indicator interesting all

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:32.979 
let this bead indicator interesting all
right<00:03:13.489> let's<00:03:13.850> see<00:03:14.030> what<00:03:14.150> happens<00:03:14.510> now

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.270 

okay<00:03:33.989> stop<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.530> machine<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.920> show<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.159> my

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
okay stop the machine to show you my

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.959 
okay stop the machine to show you my
first<00:03:35.609> batch<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:37.099> it's<00:03:38.099> looking<00:03:38.280> pretty

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:38.969 
first batch here it's looking pretty

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.910 
first batch here it's looking pretty
good<00:03:40.069> but<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.099> did<00:03:41.659> get<00:03:42.659> a<00:03:42.689> one<00:03:43.109> bucket<00:03:43.530> of

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
good but I did get a one bucket of

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.140 
good but I did get a one bucket of
Portland<00:03:44.430> cement<00:03:45.049> three<00:03:46.049> shovel<00:03:46.560> fulls<00:03:46.859> of

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
Portland cement three shovel fulls of

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.740 
Portland cement three shovel fulls of
gravel<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.409> shovel<00:03:49.409> fulls<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.829> sand<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.909> we'll

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
gravel to shovel fulls of sand and we'll

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.780 
gravel to shovel fulls of sand and we'll
see<00:03:52.019> what<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.439> looks<00:03:52.739> like<00:03:52.920> I'm<00:03:53.340> pretty<00:03:53.579> sure

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
see what this looks like I'm pretty sure

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.369 
see what this looks like I'm pretty sure
this<00:03:53.969> stuff<00:03:54.239> pours<00:03:54.599> out<00:03:54.780> better<00:03:55.109> when<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
this stuff pours out better when the

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.860 
this stuff pours out better when the
machine<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.829> running<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.430> for<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.569> first

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
machine is running but for this first

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:11.349 
machine is running but for this first
attempt<00:03:58.409> I<00:03:58.469> just<00:03:58.650> want<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:58.859> see<00:03:59.010> what<00:03:59.159> happens

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:29.750 

yep<00:04:12.389> it's<00:04:12.569> got<00:04:12.689> to<00:04:12.780> be<00:04:12.810> running

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.170 

hmm<00:04:31.080> interesting

hmm interesting

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.610 
hmm interesting
apparently<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.270> gears<00:04:34.600> on<00:04:34.810> my<00:04:34.930> rental<00:04:35.320> don't

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
apparently the gears on my rental don't

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.490 
apparently the gears on my rental don't
like<00:04:35.890> to<00:04:36.100> be<00:04:36.220> turned<00:04:36.520> upside<00:04:36.910> down<00:04:37.320> which<00:04:38.320> is

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
like to be turned upside down which is

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.310 
like to be turned upside down which is
strange<00:04:38.830> well<00:04:39.510> here's<00:04:40.510> my<00:04:40.690> first<00:04:40.930> load

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.640 

looks<00:04:47.710> kind<00:04:47.920> of<00:04:48.070> rocky<00:04:48.840> but

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
looks kind of rocky but

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.400 
looks kind of rocky but
I<00:04:51.680> don't<00:04:52.340> know<00:04:52.660> we'll<00:04:53.660> just<00:04:53.690> play<00:04:54.050> around<00:04:54.170> with

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
I don't know we'll just play around with

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:04.460 
I don't know we'll just play around with
this<00:04:54.650> dude<00:04:55.070> happen

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.590 

if<00:05:05.010> anybody<00:05:05.460> ever<00:05:05.700> tells<00:05:05.820> you<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.450> can

if anybody ever tells you that you can

pour your own pad by yourself the small

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.660 
pour your own pad by yourself the small

mixer I give you permission to punch

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.720 
mixer I give you permission to punch
them<00:05:11.850> in<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.000> face<00:05:12.860> it's<00:05:13.860> been<00:05:14.010> five<00:05:14.310> hours

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
them in the face it's been five hours

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.970 
them in the face it's been five hours
now<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.990> I'm<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.110> little<00:05:16.320> bit<00:05:16.440> over<00:05:16.740> halfway

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
now and I'm a little bit over halfway

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.210 
now and I'm a little bit over halfway
done<00:05:17.550> so<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:18.560> guess<00:05:19.560> I'm<00:05:19.680> gonna<00:05:19.800> have<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.040> come

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
done so I guess I'm gonna have to come

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.110 
done so I guess I'm gonna have to come
back<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.700> do<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:20.790> topcoat<00:05:21.150> on<00:05:21.660> this<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.260> hope

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
back and do a topcoat on this I hope

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.350 
back and do a topcoat on this I hope
because<00:05:24.120> it's<00:05:24.390> very<00:05:24.540> rough<00:05:24.930> well<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.560> put<00:05:26.360> 14

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
because it's very rough well I put 14

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.320 
because it's very rough well I put 14
bags<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:27.900> Portland<00:05:28.260> cement<00:05:28.550> two<00:05:29.550> tons<00:05:29.910> of<00:05:30.120> rock

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
bags of Portland cement two tons of rock

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.820 
bags of Portland cement two tons of rock
and<00:05:30.570> one<00:05:30.720> ton<00:05:30.960> of<00:05:30.990> sand<00:05:31.380> in<00:05:31.680> here<00:05:32.610> so<00:05:32.880> far<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.990> I

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
and one ton of sand in here so far and I

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.370 
and one ton of sand in here so far and I
don't<00:05:35.160> know<00:05:35.460> if<00:05:35.580> this<00:05:35.730> is<00:05:35.760> doable<00:05:36.750> or<00:05:36.930> not<00:05:37.110> but

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
don't know if this is doable or not but

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.410 
don't know if this is doable or not but
I'm<00:05:37.530> certainly<00:05:37.800> going<00:05:37.950> to<00:05:38.010> try

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
I'm certainly going to try

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.320 
I'm certainly going to try
got<00:05:39.870> this<00:05:40.050> first<00:05:40.470> layer<00:05:40.710> in<00:05:40.980> so<00:05:41.940> today<00:05:42.210> I'm

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
got this first layer in so today I'm

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.350 
got this first layer in so today I'm
going<00:05:42.450> to<00:05:42.510> come<00:05:42.660> back<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.460> get<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.790> next

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
going to come back and get the next

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.870 
going to come back and get the next
layer<00:05:45.600> in<00:05:46.280> which<00:05:47.280> hopefully<00:05:47.520> will<00:05:47.760> be<00:05:47.850> the

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
layer in which hopefully will be the

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.920 
layer in which hopefully will be the
last<00:05:48.180> one<00:05:48.620> but<00:05:50.150> never<00:05:51.150> done<00:05:51.300> this<00:05:51.360> before<00:05:51.510> so

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
last one but never done this before so

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:00.719 
last one but never done this before so
just<00:05:52.890> giving<00:05:53.100> it<00:05:53.190> a<00:05:53.250> try

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:10.260 

I<00:06:07.979> know<00:06:08.979> this<00:06:09.189> video<00:06:09.430> is<00:06:09.580> a<00:06:09.639> little<00:06:09.819> scattered

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
I know this video is a little scattered

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.689 
I know this video is a little scattered
because<00:06:10.559> it's<00:06:11.559> hard<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:11.889> work<00:06:12.069> in<00:06:12.249> film<00:06:12.490> at<00:06:12.610> the

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
because it's hard to work in film at the

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.869 
because it's hard to work in film at the
same<00:06:12.909> time<00:06:13.289> then<00:06:14.289> using<00:06:14.589> the<00:06:14.680> bull<00:06:14.860> float<00:06:15.189> to

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
same time then using the bull float to

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.129 
same time then using the bull float to
get<00:06:16.059> the<00:06:16.270> pad<00:06:17.460> smooth<00:06:18.460> and<00:06:18.789> it's<00:06:19.749> getting

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
get the pad smooth and it's getting

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.519 
get the pad smooth and it's getting
there<00:06:20.319> it's<00:06:21.219> looking<00:06:21.370> real<00:06:21.699> nice<00:06:22.020> this<00:06:23.020> lab<00:06:23.289> is

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
there it's looking real nice this lab is

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:24.809 
there it's looking real nice this lab is
as<00:06:23.740> complete<00:06:24.039> as<00:06:24.249> I'm<00:06:24.339> going<00:06:24.460> to<00:06:24.580> be<00:06:24.639> able<00:06:24.729> to

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
as complete as I'm going to be able to

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.779 
as complete as I'm going to be able to
make<00:06:24.999> it<00:06:25.180> a<00:06:25.680> couple<00:06:26.680> little<00:06:26.919> bubbles<00:06:27.339> in<00:06:27.460> there

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
make it a couple little bubbles in there

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.959 
make it a couple little bubbles in there
and<00:06:28.629> like<00:06:29.319> right<00:06:29.469> in<00:06:29.589> there<00:06:29.800> but<00:06:30.069> and<00:06:30.309> that

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:30.969 
and like right in there but and that

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:32.820 
and like right in there but and that
spot<00:06:31.240> it's<00:06:31.389> not<00:06:31.539> very<00:06:31.870> appealing<00:06:31.990> if<00:06:32.710> I'm

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
spot it's not very appealing if I'm

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.929 
spot it's not very appealing if I'm
gonna<00:06:32.919> put<00:06:33.099> some<00:06:33.389> tile<00:06:34.389> over<00:06:34.719> that<00:06:34.870> anyway<00:06:35.289> so

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:35.939 
gonna put some tile over that anyway so

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:38.700 
gonna put some tile over that anyway so
that's<00:06:36.939> the<00:06:37.180> final<00:06:37.509> there's<00:06:38.349> a<00:06:38.409> little<00:06:38.589> low

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
that's the final there's a little low

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.110 
that's the final there's a little low
spot<00:06:39.009> there<00:06:39.339> but<00:06:39.999> I<00:06:40.379> like<00:06:41.379> it<00:06:41.559> this<00:06:42.460> is<00:06:42.729> the<00:06:42.909> day

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
spot there but I like it this is the day

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.589 
spot there but I like it this is the day
after<00:06:43.419> the<00:06:43.899> pad<00:06:44.139> is<00:06:44.349> finished<00:06:44.800> I'm<00:06:45.399> come<00:06:46.389> back

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
after the pad is finished I'm come back

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:50.010 
after the pad is finished I'm come back
out<00:06:46.839> here<00:06:46.870> to<00:06:47.969> sprinkle<00:06:48.969> water<00:06:49.180> on<00:06:49.389> the<00:06:49.779> pad

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
out here to sprinkle water on the pad

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.439 
out here to sprinkle water on the pad
because<00:06:50.439> I've<00:06:51.430> heard<00:06:51.789> that<00:06:51.969> you're<00:06:52.120> supposed

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.449 
because I've heard that you're supposed

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.329 
because I've heard that you're supposed
to<00:06:52.949> let<00:06:53.949> it<00:06:54.009> cure<00:06:54.520> over<00:06:55.180> time<00:06:55.479> and<00:06:56.069> it<00:06:57.069> needs<00:06:57.219> to

00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:57.339 
to let it cure over time and it needs to

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:00.209 
to let it cure over time and it needs to
be<00:06:57.460> wet<00:06:57.699> to<00:06:57.909> prevent<00:06:58.270> cracking<00:06:58.659> so<00:06:59.259> that's

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:00.219 
be wet to prevent cracking so that's

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:05.309 
be wet to prevent cracking so that's
what<00:07:00.399> I've<00:07:00.490> done<00:07:02.399> but<00:07:03.399> it<00:07:03.520> is<00:07:03.639> a<00:07:03.899> fairly<00:07:04.899> smooth

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
what I've done but it is a fairly smooth

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.179 
what I've done but it is a fairly smooth
I'm<00:07:06.099> very<00:07:06.550> pleased<00:07:07.139> my<00:07:08.139> first<00:07:08.529> time<00:07:08.830> to<00:07:09.069> ever

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:09.189 
I'm very pleased my first time to ever

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:13.139 
I'm very pleased my first time to ever
work<00:07:09.459> with<00:07:09.490> concrete<00:07:10.419> at<00:07:10.870> this<00:07:11.249> magnitude<00:07:12.249> you

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:13.149 
work with concrete at this magnitude you

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:15.649 
work with concrete at this magnitude you
can<00:07:13.330> see<00:07:13.509> the<00:07:13.659> low<00:07:13.839> spots<00:07:14.259> pretty<00:07:14.529> good<00:07:14.860> here

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:15.659 
can see the low spots pretty good here

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:19.199 
can see the low spots pretty good here
this<00:07:16.659> one<00:07:16.870> holds<00:07:17.229> a<00:07:17.289> little<00:07:17.439> bit<00:07:17.620> of<00:07:17.740> water<00:07:18.209> and

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:19.209

this one holds a little bit of water and
then<00:07:19.740> this<00:07:20.740> one<00:07:20.919> right<00:07:20.949> here<00:07:21.569> is<00:07:22.569> also<00:07:23.110> holding

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:23.409 
then this one right here is also holding

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:27.420 
then this one right here is also holding
a<00:07:23.649> bit<00:07:23.800> of<00:07:23.919> water<00:07:24.779> other<00:07:25.779> than<00:07:25.870> that<00:07:26.169> the<00:07:27.129> pad

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
a bit of water other than that the pad

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.800 
a bit of water other than that the pad
looks<00:07:27.759> great
