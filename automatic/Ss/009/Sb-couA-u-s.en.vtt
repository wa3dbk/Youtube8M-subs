00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
this entire piece and then oh yeah this

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.800 
this entire piece and then oh yeah this
this<00:03:03.159> would<00:03:03.370> just<00:03:03.519> sometimes<00:03:04.030> come<00:03:04.269> off<00:03:04.419> if

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
this would just sometimes come off if

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.149 
this would just sometimes come off if
you<00:03:05.280> by<00:03:06.280> force<00:03:08.189> let's<00:03:09.189> put<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:09.879> like<00:03:10.659> that

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
you by force let's put you like that

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.000 
you by force let's put you like that
after<00:03:12.159> you<00:03:12.549> rotated<00:03:13.169> there's<00:03:14.169> this<00:03:14.409> space

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
after you rotated there's this space

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.990 
after you rotated there's this space
