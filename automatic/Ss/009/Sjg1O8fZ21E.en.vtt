oil<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:25.079> little<00:03:25.500> bit<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:25.950> salt<00:03:26.430> now<00:03:27.150> do<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.480> know

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
oil a little bit of salt now do you know

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.819 
oil a little bit of salt now do you know
that<00:03:27.720> most<00:03:27.959> salt<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.970> heated<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.000> about<00:03:30.829> 1,400

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
that most salt is heated to about 1,400

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.129 
that most salt is heated to about 1,400
degrees<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.850> then<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.209> minerals<00:03:33.720> removed

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
degrees and then the minerals removed

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.129 
degrees and then the minerals removed
from<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.500> salt<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.579> I<00:03:35.910> prefer<00:03:36.180> using<00:03:36.660> salt

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
from the salt so I prefer using salt

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.599 
from the salt so I prefer using salt
that<00:03:37.530> has<00:03:37.650> not<00:03:37.889> been<00:03:38.120> heated<00:03:39.120> or<00:03:39.410> even<00:03:40.609> turned

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
that has not been heated or even turned

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.910 
that has not been heated or even turned
white<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.540> either<00:03:42.720> Himalayan<00:03:43.380> salt<00:03:43.680> or

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
white so I like either Himalayan salt or

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.839 
white so I like either Himalayan salt or
Celtic<00:03:44.370> salt<00:03:44.639> you<00:03:45.389> mix<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.989> all<00:03:46.170> together<00:03:48.560> and

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
Celtic salt you mix it all together and

00:03:49.849 --> 00:04:00.800
