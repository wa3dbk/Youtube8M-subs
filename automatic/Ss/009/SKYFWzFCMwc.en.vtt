00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.390
 romantic I want to tell you that for me 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.970
 best gift on these dates is something that 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.189
 you do with your own hands not something 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:37.960
 that you go to the store and buy it but 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:41.170
 something that you put time and I love a book 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.720
 it's like an album with photos this is one 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.580
 I did it in my boyfriend 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.320
 now I'm going to show you the photos 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.750
 quickly this is an idea from an album 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.760
 what can you do not exactly have 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.420
 It has to be like this but this is a 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.300
 idea of ​​something you can do 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.509
 and maybe also for your anniversary 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.720
 stereo I did it for an anniversary this 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.540
 another one that I have here is still a little 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.909
 bigger and still have things 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.920
 many very detailed photos 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:23.319
 ideas this the truth to the men them 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.429
 well my boyfriend loved this 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:29.380
 gift that I said and if you are 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.409

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.899
 I also swear to your girlfriend that you 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.149
 retired girlfriend will be super happy 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.149
 we kids love the photos 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:45.570
 there is a concern 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.969
 a container like this can be 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.039
 any glass that you have 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:56.100
 get this is this have the cover 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:59.170
 acronyms we will need a photo 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.649
 olive oil that we have to paste the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.649
 inside our container 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.950
 I put a little tea behind you 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.800
 can use tea or resistol accommodate the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.900
 photo where you want me I want it 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.420
 there 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.930
 and what we have to do is that we're going to 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.469
 fill in 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.269
 with oil all the bottle the photos and 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.219
 the poses if you choose it in 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.549
 Black and white are also admired 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:32.530
 very much it looks very very father is going to 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.819
 be better blank but this is a 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.010
 idea also father to give a photo 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.700
 was to give a picture and this is a 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.739
 original way here nothing else anymore 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.120
 you can use as decorations the can 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.430
 put in your bedroom or in the living room but 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.310
 they are very very parents look at the photos 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.239
 as old hope you like this idea 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.969
 and it is already optional as you want 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.740
 decorate as they want to decorate what 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:05.530
 you can put them 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.170
 a carcamo or ace but you would look 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.370
 many more parents who were around 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.370
 inside that out 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.230
 as many and many already know me in this 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.260
 little notebook on all the pages I'm going to 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.540
 write something that I like to read or a 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.390
 history that we have lived together I'm going to 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.840
 put pictures too and this is another idea 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.230
 if you want nothing more to write to him 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.080
 you love her so much 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.600
 you can do it just like I bought about 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.550
 Fifths also like you can 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.070
 write him love letters 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.120
 and this also letters do not you 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.880
 Give your friends to your friends to this day 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.440
 it's about being very romantic the cndh 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.840
 not all of us love the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:09.240
 flowers we love balloons 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:11.760
 they love the stuffed animals that they are going to make 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.430
 that this goes like this this bottle that can 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.560
 to do is that it is inscribed in a letter and 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.709
 is super romantic this is like a 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.049
 a messenger bottle of those bottles 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.900
 that carry a message inside because the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.540
 bottle is empty to write a letter 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.070
 Well, the paper that you like is the one you put 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.750
 Here you use the card in the closing and 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.660
 ways out you can remove all 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.270
 these things the label you can 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.790
 decorate 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.010
 with carcamo, so you can not put 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.290
 all parts of hearts can you 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.510
 describe him responsible coins I love the 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.560
 name your partner or your friend in 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.530
 you want to give your 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.780
 you can hit more decal 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.320
 this makes me a very fatherly way and 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:05.390
 different to give to make a gift 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:07.849
 Only you can also buy one of 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.509
 these boxes 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:14.029
 that opens and in here you can put 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:17.240
