00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:10.230
 in this video a very short technique 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.120
 analysis what the crosses only movement as 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.790
 also the knee bridge is here with 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.340
 michel in the pc hour before after 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.439
 pictures and thus the excerpt yes what 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.220
 really immediate in his pc hour 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.220
 can be achieved 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 I like it better 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.859
 Much better ever now 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.809
 is important that his knee does not have 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.610
 that's exactly how it's done right 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.750
 and that was really what I suspected 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.399
 just have the increase of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.960
 position looks very correct 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.280
 and not at all wrong 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.010
 calm down to warm up a few more 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.320
 five to six still really that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 your muscles warmed up a bit 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 and then we work properly 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.180
 high but as already explained Michael 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.180
 the problem that he has very long legs 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.000
 and according to the barbell even 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.590
 can not lead as it actually does 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 Of course he has to work very well 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.860
 be flexible in both flexor area 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.049
 and here we see his second sentence 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.950
 to tell you here after three 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.049
 corrections has found his position 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 the optimal tension was down in the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.659
 quadriceps has achieved as well 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.189
 more directly on the shin bone 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.310
 We still have one 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.170
 slight restrictions on the flexor 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.430
 Area that means the flexibility is 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.509
 here a bit limited so far 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.229
 we are still a bit high gone 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.700
 and important here is that now 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.740
 I just music is we said 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 Let's see what really happens 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.040
 when the weight gets a bit higher 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.479
 how the body behaves where 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.259
 Now the focus is on and that 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.259
 look at us now 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.080
 you can see the focus is on 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.880
 he definitely backs it up 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.709
 In any case correct shoulder straps 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.170
 At the front we stay close to the shin bone 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.070
 guided so that the fulcrum always 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.410
 the same remains he pulls over his feet 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.610
 because accordingly, most of the force 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.620
 about the wine share should also come 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.630
 who with such a slight movement because 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.489
 I just said it and otherwise 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.250
 is is I just noticed that stop 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.690
 the finger heating still not 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.070
 closed at the end we are here 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.540
 Michel at his first set 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.430
 of course not yet have that 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.050
 footwear attends but we give 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.140
 have come to certain points like 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.090
 once arm keeping in motion that 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.310
 according to the neck muscles 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.590
 weight hold can not stand so 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.209
 that we stop wild at the beginning of the breast 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.310
 should cooperate at least with the 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.040
 edition of the long hand will then have 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.660
 we paid attention to how the accordingly 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.209
 movement is so eccentric and 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.820
 concentric phase and more 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.170
 Corrections would be the same now 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.640
 as we said we are now at the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.680
 bends have arrived 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.450
 entered once between health 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.410
 and performance-oriented so the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.989
 movement between the knee angle and 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.810
 between the year between the lot where 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.780
 actually the toes 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.609
 one to be led forward so 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.709
 then we took care of it right away 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.909
 as now the foot position looks then 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.569
 we are on the shoe work on it 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.849
 received 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.609
 we have the position of the barbell 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:41.099
 behind the stop under the goal 7 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:43.470
 runs and otherwise you can see now 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.209
 that 's a lot more elegant 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.870
 and much more accurate down at least 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.569
 in the lowest position so where 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.389
 just set up the maximum voltage 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.980
 is watching us now to the 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.620
 already looks much better than on 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.060
 at the beginning and to this we are watching right now 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.340
 hold the weight gone up 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.340
 just watch how it behaves 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.620
 so we pay attention to the next sentence 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.209
 that we really the 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.459
 open up complete rom 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.500
 that means I will say when he will 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.880
 the full movement has if I 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.639
 the sage stops then you have the 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.430
 imagination movement achieved 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:29.039
 stops that is his full now 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:35.820
 movement stock due to his 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:39.750
 Flexibility is very good and the same 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:43.199
 further we are on 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.300
 that of course the technology is very 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.300
 it is crucial to just that 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.699
 Potential not in the next few years 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.139
 in which I am increasingly the weight 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.409
 so again increase the intensity 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.409
 elevated 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:03.270
 used or not exhaust 60 kilo 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.550
 Once received 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.650
 now in the shoulder straps because we have 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.120
 worked all the time downstairs 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.250
 that is, they have responded to it 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.650
 how to be the position of the barbell 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:19.289
 must and of course also responsible 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:21.389
 for that is the depth of the knee and the 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.970
 Of course, also the deeper the prey share 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.949
 I the barbell also a hinfÃ¼hre 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.710
 easy weight can move up 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.960
 that is the angle in the knee joint 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.490
 just great and that's how it strikes me 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.029
 easier to squat again 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.029
 get up 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.730
 emotion next video i hope again 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.900
 a basic video therefore costs 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.290
 here just something under it 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.370
 from now on you will be interested in instagram 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.850
 facebook and of course a good channel 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.940
 Subscribe in this sense runs like her 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.310
 from other side just like 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.260
 important for many in recreational sports 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.280
 easy is i want to get closer to you 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.650
 factually bring a study to me 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.420
 just right to think 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.540
 and I just wanted it with you 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.540
 divide
