00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the location of your pac-man as he's

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.279 
the location of your pac-man as he's
going<00:00:26.189> around<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.550> outside<00:00:27.230> corresponds<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
going around the outside corresponds to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.169 
going around the outside corresponds to
where<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> second<00:00:29.250> hand<00:00:29.429> would<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.000> if

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
where the second hand would be so if

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.400 
where the second hand would be so if
he's<00:00:30.300> at<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.480> very<00:00:30.720> bottom<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.289> know

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
he's at the very bottom then you know

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
he's at the very bottom then you know
you're<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> 30-second<00:00:32.430> mark<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.880> then<00:00:33.450> in

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you're at the 30-second mark and then in

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000 
you're at the 30-second mark and then in
the<00:00:33.719> center<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> hours<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the center you have the hours and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880 
the center you have the hours and
minutes<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.719> I<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.440> very<00:00:37.590> easy<00:00:37.800> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
minutes and I think it's very easy to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.119 
minutes and I think it's very easy to
read<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.670> also<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.600> kind<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.170> nifty<00:00:40.469> cool

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
might also want to check out the program
