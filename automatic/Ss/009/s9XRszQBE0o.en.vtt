00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:11.020 
in case the top one feels it's a good
idea<00:07:09.440> to<00:07:09.620> have<00:07:09.770> multiple<00:07:10.160> water<00:07:10.280> bottles<00:07:10.699> just

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
in case one of them does stop working so

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.830 
in case one of them does stop working so
