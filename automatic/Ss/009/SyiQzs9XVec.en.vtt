a<00:00:00.560> few<00:00:01.560> days<00:00:01.680> ago<00:00:01.740> I<00:00:02.310> posted<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.570> video<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.529> a

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
a few days ago I posted a video of a

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.320 
a few days ago I posted a video of a
script<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.370> wrote<00:00:05.400> from<00:00:05.700> nokia<00:00:06.029> n900

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
script that I wrote from nokia n900

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.940 
script that I wrote from nokia n900
using<00:00:07.080> pi<00:00:07.379> game<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.200> fake<00:00:10.200> 3d<00:00:10.679> cube

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
using pi game and it was a fake 3d cube

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.429 
using pi game and it was a fake 3d cube
and<00:00:11.280> if<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.150> were<00:00:12.679> John<00:00:15.139> 8107<00:00:16.139> ate<00:00:16.710> at

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
and if you were John 8107 ate at

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.800 
and if you were John 8107 ate at
suggested<00:00:19.439> doing<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.390> globe<00:00:21.390> instead

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
suggested doing it with a globe instead

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.429 
suggested doing it with a globe instead
of<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.960> 3d<00:00:22.289> cube<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.369> did<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.439> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
of a 3d cube so that's what I did and so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.410 
of a 3d cube so that's what I did and so
basically<00:00:25.740> i'm<00:00:25.830> using<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.160> same<00:00:26.400> code<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.090> i

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
basically i'm using the same code and i

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.029 
basically i'm using the same code and i
just<00:00:27.660> replaced<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.230> images<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.800> i<00:00:28.830> had

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
just replaced the images that i had

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.620 
just replaced the images that i had
rendered<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.910> blender<00:00:30.539> before<00:00:32.450> here<00:00:33.450> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
rendered out with blender before here is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
rendered out with blender before here is
the<00:00:33.960> new<00:00:34.649> globe<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.809> as<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.440> move<00:00:38.190> my

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the new globe here and as I move my

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.400 
the new globe here and as I move my
finger<00:00:38.850> across<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> screen<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.899> rotate

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
finger across the screen I can rotate

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
finger across the screen I can rotate
the<00:00:40.770> globe<00:00:41.040> left<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.239> right<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:44.270> then<00:00:45.270> also

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the globe left and right and then also

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.760 
the globe left and right and then also
of<00:00:45.899> course<00:00:46.079> since<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
of course since we have the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.250 
of course since we have the
accelerometer<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.000> nokia<00:00:48.539> n900<00:00:49.500> i<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
accelerometer in the nokia n900 i have a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.490 
accelerometer in the nokia n900 i have a
accelerometer<00:00:52.260> version<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:54.199> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
accelerometer version and this is the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840 
accelerometer version and this is the
same<00:00:55.680> code<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.070> cube<00:00:56.309> except<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.640> made<00:00:56.670> one

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
same code as a cube except I made one

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
same code as a cube except I made one
modification<00:00:57.480> before<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> tilt<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.859> when

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
modification before if you tilt it when

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.740 
modification before if you tilt it when
we<00:00:59.100> eventually<00:00:59.280> would<00:00:59.670> hit<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> end<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.449> stop

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
we eventually would hit the end and stop

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.880 
we eventually would hit the end and stop
rotating<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.530> same<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> other

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
rotating and same with the other

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.850 
rotating and same with the other
direction<00:01:02.239> I<00:01:03.239> made<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> continuous<00:01:04.530> loop

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
direction I made this a continuous loop

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.000 
direction I made this a continuous loop
so<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> tilt<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.960> phone<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
so if you tilt the phone like so to the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.200 
so if you tilt the phone like so to the
right<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.610> rotate<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.119> right

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
right it will rotate to the right

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.140 
right it will rotate to the right
forever<00:01:10.400> until<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.549> tilt<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.820> back<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> other

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
forever until you tilt it back the other

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.880 
forever until you tilt it back the other
way<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.290> will<00:01:13.380> rotate<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.799> left

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
way and then it will rotate to the left

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.480 
way and then it will rotate to the left
forever<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:16.340> just<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
forever so it was just like just a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.130 
forever so it was just like just a
little<00:01:17.850> bit<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.540> statement<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.020> add

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
little bit more if then statement I add

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
little bit more if then statement I add
to<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> code<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.580> loop<00:01:20.880> around

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to the code just to get to loop around

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
to the code just to get to loop around
like<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.310> basically<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> same<00:01:23.400> clothes

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
like that so basically the same clothes

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580 
like that so basically the same clothes
before<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:25.049> easy<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
before but you can see it's very easy to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.130 
before but you can see it's very easy to
replace<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.790> images<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.750> did<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> with

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
replace the images that I did it with

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.620 
replace the images that I did it with
and<00:01:28.610> also<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.210> look<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> description

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and also if you look in the description

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.190 
and also if you look in the description
you'll<00:01:31.079> see<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> link<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.909> package<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you'll see the link to the package that

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.830 
you'll see the link to the package that
has<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.650> code<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.189> has<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> images<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
has this code in it has the images and I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.130 
has this code in it has the images and I
also<00:01:36.990> included<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.090> blender<00:01:39.090> file<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
also included the blender file that I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.149 
also included the blender file that I
created<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.979> 3d<00:01:41.460> globe<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:44.070> ahead

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
created the 3d globe with so go ahead

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.620 
created the 3d globe with so go ahead
