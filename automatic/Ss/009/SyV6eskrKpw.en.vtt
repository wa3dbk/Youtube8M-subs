explain what how it was that I did the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.320 
explain what how it was that I did the
conversion<00:00:09.889> well<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.370> free<00:00:11.610> sky<00:00:11.849> module

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
conversion well with the free sky module

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.650 
conversion well with the free sky module
I'm<00:00:12.420> gonna<00:00:12.599> try<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.410> clear<00:00:13.830> as<00:00:14.070> possible

questions I'll explain it here well this
is<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> best<00:00:21.210> camera<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.340> but

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
is not the best camera to do this but

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.359 
is not the best camera to do this but
even<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.510> I'm<00:00:24.900> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> try<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.619> explain<00:00:26.160> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
comes with a PCB that has a little

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.729 
comes with a PCB that has a little
switch<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:53.219> you're<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
switch and this you're going to have to

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.779 
switch and this you're going to have to
find<00:00:55.739> anywhere<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.910> put<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.539> put<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.899> line

find anywhere to put it I put it line

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.200 
find anywhere to put it I put it line
back<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.870> has<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.910> press<00:01:02.910> switch

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
back here it has a little press switch

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
back here it has a little press switch
that<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.780> used<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> bind<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.489> three

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that you used to bind and then three

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.380 
that you used to bind and then three
three<00:01:06.750> other<00:01:06.960> cables<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.939> yellow

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
three other cables that are this yellow

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.679 
three other cables that are this yellow
one<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.439> signal<00:01:11.720> ppm<00:01:12.720> signal<00:01:14.390> be<00:01:15.390> aware

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
one that is signal ppm signal be aware

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.030 
one that is signal ppm signal be aware
this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.080> ppm

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this is ppm

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.080 
this is ppm
this<00:01:18.020> module<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.290> only<00:01:19.770> accept<00:01:20.310> ppm<00:01:20.939> signals

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
this module will only accept ppm signals

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
this module will only accept ppm signals
and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.869> power<00:01:25.850> red<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.890> power<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and then a power red one with power and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.649 
and then a power red one with power and
a<00:01:30.030> black<00:01:30.810> point<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.590> ground<00:01:33.049> what<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:35.659> main

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
a black point is ground what the main

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.469 
a black point is ground what the main
thing<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.229> did<00:01:37.500> over<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
thing that I did over here was make it

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
thing that I did over here was make it
it<00:01:39.900> has<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.560> connected<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> trainer

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it has to be connected to the trainer

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.950 
it has to be connected to the trainer
port<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.869> signal<00:01:43.409> coming<00:01:43.710> from<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:45.119> main<00:01:45.390> PCB

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
port the signal coming from the main PCB

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.240 
port the signal coming from the main PCB
board<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.820> ppm<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:49.250> thus

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
board it will not be ppm then thus

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.999 
board it will not be ppm then thus
making<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.210> work<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:52.500> only<00:01:52.680> work

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
making it not work it will only work

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.370 
making it not work it will only work
with<00:01:53.189> two<00:01:53.399> channels<00:01:53.970> will<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.360> work<00:01:54.630> with

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
with two channels will not work with

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.010 
with two channels will not work with
another<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.219> rest<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> channels<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.840> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
another the rest of the channels so you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.859 
another the rest of the channels so you
need<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.649> real<00:01:59.579> ppm<00:02:00.180> signal<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
need to get real ppm signal so the

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.160 
need to get real ppm signal so the
yellow<00:02:03.869> wire<00:02:04.399> will<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.899> that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
yellow wire will you have to get that

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.880 
yellow wire will you have to get that
ppm<00:02:07.740> signal<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> train

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
ppm signal from the train

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.540 
ppm signal from the train
port<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:10.119> right<00:02:10.149> here<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.069> yellow<00:02:12.220> wire

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
port is right here so the yellow wire

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.770 
port is right here so the yellow wire
will<00:02:13.360> be<00:02:13.390> connected<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.920> pens<00:02:15.250> three<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.180> six

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
will be connected to pens three and six

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.650 
will be connected to pens three and six
on<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.319> trainer<00:02:17.620> port<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.580> needs<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.360> bridge

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
on the trainer port it needs to bridge

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.370 
on the trainer port it needs to bridge
both<00:02:20.230> pens<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:21.400> needs<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.510> note<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.810> this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
both pens it needs to and note that this

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.830 
both pens it needs to and note that this
camera<00:02:23.680> woman<00:02:24.040> will<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.550> focus<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.510> close

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
camera woman will not focus this close

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.030 
camera woman will not focus this close
but<00:02:26.709> over<00:02:27.040> here<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.510> spins<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.890> have

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
but over here you have spins you have

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.230 
but over here you have spins you have
pins<00:02:30.340> three<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.209> six<00:02:32.280> over<00:02:33.280> there<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:34.209> are

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
pins three and six over there that are

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.830 
pins three and six over there that are
bridged<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.709> through<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.400> yellow<00:02:37.300> cable

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
bridged to the through this yellow cable

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.260 
bridged to the through this yellow cable
it's<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.200> signal<00:02:38.650> cable<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.580> goes<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
it's the signal cable that goes to the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.460 
it's the signal cable that goes to the
module<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:41.080> one<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:43.540> will<00:02:43.959> be<00:02:44.170> soldered

here<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:59.489> little<00:03:00.489> switch<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.360> got<00:03:01.600> here

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
here this little switch that I got here

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:10.640 
here this little switch that I got here
what<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.190> does<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.790> I'm<00:03:04.950> getting<00:03:09.060> from<00:03:10.060> this

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
what this does is I'm getting from this

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.470 
what this does is I'm getting from this
wire<00:03:11.650> over<00:03:12.010> here<00:03:12.400> let<00:03:12.670> me<00:03:12.700> see<00:03:12.970> if<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.180> can<00:03:13.360> be

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
wire over here let me see if I can be

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.020 
wire over here let me see if I can be
clear<00:03:13.750> about<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:15.070> those<00:03:15.220> guys<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.519> did

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
clear about this for those guys that did

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.890 
clear about this for those guys that did
not<00:03:16.150> understand<00:03:16.860> electronics<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:19.329> wire

not understand electronics this wire
over<00:03:20.530> here<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.360> getting<00:03:22.709> power<00:03:23.709> from<00:03:24.700> where

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
over here is getting power from where

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.509 
over here is getting power from where
from<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.110> main<00:03:26.350> PCB<00:03:27.450> board<00:03:28.500> over<00:03:29.500> here<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:30.400> the

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
from the main PCB board over here to the

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.240 
from the main PCB board over here to the
plus<00:03:30.790> pin<00:03:31.090> there's<00:03:31.840> two<00:03:32.260> pins<00:03:32.560> where<00:03:33.040> the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
plus pin there's two pins where the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.300 
plus pin there's two pins where the
battery<00:03:33.579> connects<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.329> plus<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.620> minus<00:03:35.650> so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
battery connects a plus and a minus so

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.180 
battery connects a plus and a minus so
this<00:03:36.549> is<00:03:36.730> getting<00:03:37.120> power<00:03:37.810> from<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.440> plus<00:03:38.739> pin

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
this is getting power from the plus pin

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.110 
this is getting power from the plus pin
and<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.630> powering<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.959> middle<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
and this is powering the the middle the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.770 
and this is powering the the middle the
both<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.930> middle<00:03:47.290> pins<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.700> switch<00:03:48.970> so

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
both the middle pins on the switch so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.160 
both the middle pins on the switch so
the<00:03:49.810> switch<00:03:50.170> has<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:52.000> doesn't<00:03:52.269> need<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.720> be<00:03:52.900> a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
the switch has it doesn't need to be a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.069 
the switch has it doesn't need to be a
six<00:03:53.920> well<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:55.299> two<00:03:56.170> four<00:03:56.980> six<00:03:57.280> pins<00:03:57.760> switch<00:03:58.420> only

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
six well a two four six pins switch only

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.680 
six well a two four six pins switch only
needs<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.470> be<00:03:59.590> forward<00:04:00.160> pin<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.700> switch<00:04:00.970> so

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
needs to be forward pin the switch so

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.729 
needs to be forward pin the switch so
what<00:04:02.079> would<00:04:02.320> what<00:04:02.829> this<00:04:03.070> does<00:04:03.340> well<00:04:04.530> I'm<00:04:05.530> sorry

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
what would what this does well I'm sorry

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.680 
what would what this does well I'm sorry
that<00:04:05.920> was<00:04:06.130> mistaken<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.730> needs<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.150> be<00:04:07.329> a<00:04:07.359> six

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
that was mistaken it needs to be a six

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.960 
that was mistaken it needs to be a six
pins<00:04:08.530> switch<00:04:09.340> why<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:11.140> I'm<00:04:11.530> powering<00:04:12.130> the

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
pins switch why so I'm powering the

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.279 
pins switch why so I'm powering the
middle<00:04:13.709> pins<00:04:14.709> both<00:04:15.579> mill<00:04:15.970> pins<00:04:16.299> with<00:04:16.989> power

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
middle pins both mill pins with power

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.789 
middle pins both mill pins with power
I'm<00:04:18.280> giving

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
I'm giving

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.610 
I'm giving
then<00:04:18.949> power<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.940> in<00:04:20.060> this<00:04:20.209> position<00:04:20.449> it<00:04:21.019> is<00:04:21.259> off

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
then power so in this position it is off

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.080 
then power so in this position it is off
why<00:04:22.039> because<00:04:22.610> it's<00:04:23.180> connecting<00:04:23.750> those<00:04:24.229> two

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
why because it's connecting those two

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.760 
why because it's connecting those two
other<00:04:26.090> pins<00:04:26.599> that<00:04:26.840> I'm<00:04:27.020> not<00:04:27.169> connected<00:04:27.650> to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
other pins that I'm not connected to

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.110 
other pins that I'm not connected to
anything<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:30.199> power<00:04:30.550> when<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.729> flip<00:04:31.970> at

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
anything and the power when I flip at

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.689 
anything and the power when I flip at
the<00:04:32.270> other<00:04:32.449> side<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:33.379> will<00:04:33.650> connect<00:04:33.979> these<00:04:34.220> two

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
the other side it will connect these two

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.460 
the other side it will connect these two
pins<00:04:36.069> and<00:04:37.069> the<00:04:37.669> middle<00:04:37.940> ones<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:38.539> power<00:04:39.020> will

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
pins and the middle ones so power will

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.420 
pins and the middle ones so power will
come<00:04:39.680> through<00:04:39.979> this<00:04:40.400> one<00:04:40.729> and<00:04:40.940> out<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:42.800> these

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
come through this one and out to these

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.430 
come through this one and out to these
two<00:04:44.560> cables<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:46.280> where<00:04:47.180> do<00:04:47.449> these<00:04:47.629> cables<00:04:48.259> go

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440

powering the hack module and the other

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.119 
powering the hack module and the other
one<00:05:06.409> will<00:05:07.190> go<00:05:07.219> to<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.360> trainer<00:05:08.719> port<00:05:09.229> but<00:05:09.889> this

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
one will go to the trainer port but this

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.149 
one will go to the trainer port but this
does<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.210> pin<00:05:11.509> five<00:05:11.870> from<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.710> trainer

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
does to the pin five from the trainer

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.290 
does to the pin five from the trainer
port<00:05:13.639> this<00:05:14.150> will<00:05:14.389> activate<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.530> radio<00:05:16.300> okay

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
port this will activate the radio okay

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.969 
port this will activate the radio okay
so<00:05:17.960> if<00:05:18.770> you<00:05:19.129> power<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.639> pin<00:05:20.300> five<00:05:20.569> on<00:05:21.289> on<00:05:21.770> the

so if you power the pin five on on the

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.519 
so if you power the pin five on on the
radio<00:05:22.370> on<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.610> radio<00:05:23.060> if<00:05:23.150> you<00:05:23.240> power<00:05:23.509> it<00:05:23.719> up<00:05:23.930> it

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529 
radio on the radio if you power it up it

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.260 
radio on the radio if you power it up it
will<00:05:24.770> activate<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.969> main<00:05:26.180> PCB<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.159> transmit

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
will activate the main PCB and transmit

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.779 
will activate the main PCB and transmit
PPM<00:05:29.270> say<00:05:29.539> go<00:05:29.719> from<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.259> train<00:05:30.500> report<00:05:30.889> this<00:05:31.580> is

okay<00:05:34.669> guys

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
okay guys

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.040 
okay guys
so<00:05:36.169> remember<00:05:36.849> power<00:05:37.849> the<00:05:38.180> switch<00:05:40.000> Milton's

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
so remember power the switch Milton's

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.140 
so remember power the switch Milton's
main<00:05:42.050> power<00:05:42.349> it<00:05:42.860> comes<00:05:43.099> from<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.520> main<00:05:43.729> PCB

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
main power it comes from the main PCB

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.269 
main power it comes from the main PCB
board<00:05:44.830> okay<00:05:46.029> then<00:05:47.029> two<00:05:47.629> switches<00:05:47.960> one<00:05:48.560> to<00:05:49.039> the

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:49.279 
board okay then two switches one to the

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.839 
board okay then two switches one to the
PAC<00:05:49.819> module<00:05:50.360> power<00:05:51.289> to<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:51.979> magic<00:05:52.219> hat<00:05:52.400> module

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
and the other one power to the five

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.769 
and the other one power to the five
number<00:05:56.389> five<00:05:56.419> pin<00:05:57.139> on<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.949> trainer<00:05:58.219> port<00:05:58.779> okay

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779 
number five pin on the trainer port okay

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.140 
number five pin on the trainer port okay
and<00:06:00.289> when<00:06:00.529> you<00:06:00.560> flip<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:00.949> switch<00:06:01.069> the<00:06:01.819> train
