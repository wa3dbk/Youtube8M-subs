track paying attention after it got so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.970 
track paying attention after it got so
many<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.670> them<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.170> he's<00:02:37.170> got<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.530> metal<00:02:37.800> and

reason<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.600> have<00:03:30.750> him<00:03:30.840> standing<00:03:31.080> with<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.320> is

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
reason I have him standing with that is

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.920 
reason I have him standing with that is
because<00:03:31.760> he<00:03:32.760> can't<00:03:32.970> hold<00:03:33.150> any<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.480> his<00:03:33.600> weapons

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
because he can't hold any of his weapons

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.930 
because he can't hold any of his weapons
properly<00:03:34.500> he<00:03:35.040> does<00:03:35.190> have<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.400> nice<00:03:35.519> painting

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
properly he does have a nice painting

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.430 
properly he does have a nice painting
it's<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> little<00:03:36.480> glossy<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.049> he<00:03:37.140> does<00:03:37.290> have

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
it's a little glossy and he does have

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.229 
it's a little glossy and he does have
that<00:03:37.500> ugly<00:03:38.010> macaroni-and-cheese<00:03:38.489> colored

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
that ugly macaroni-and-cheese colored

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.780 
that ugly macaroni-and-cheese colored
stripe<00:03:39.709> but<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.890> gray<00:03:41.070> looks<00:03:41.340> pretty<00:03:41.580> good

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
stripe but the gray looks pretty good

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.410 
stripe but the gray looks pretty good
and<00:03:42.000> then<00:03:42.930> lastly<00:03:43.350> we<00:03:43.620> have<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:45.090> think<00:03:45.299> it's

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
and then lastly we have the I think it's

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.830 
and then lastly we have the I think it's
it<00:03:45.690> was<00:03:45.810> San<00:03:45.959> Diego<00:03:46.260> comic-con<00:03:47.330> 2009<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.660> want

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
it was San Diego comic-con 2009 I want

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.650 
it was San Diego comic-con 2009 I want
to<00:03:48.900> say<00:03:49.019> nine<00:03:49.260> could<00:03:50.130> be<00:03:50.280> wrong<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.700> mm

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
to say nine could be wrong on that mm

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.100 
to say nine could be wrong on that mm
whatever<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.170> was<00:03:52.320> recon<00:03:53.239> Grifball<00:03:54.239> variant

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
whatever it was recon Grifball variant

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.800 
whatever it was recon Grifball variant
so<00:03:55.799> he<00:03:56.010> came<00:03:56.250> with<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.940> actual<00:03:57.299> Grif<00:03:57.570> ball

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
so he came with the actual Grif ball

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.090 
so he came with the actual Grif ball
right<00:03:58.380> there<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.100> a<00:04:00.290> hand<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.470> hold<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.799> Grif

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
right there and a hand to hold the Grif

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.250 
right there and a hand to hold the Grif
ball<00:04:02.370> which<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:03.030> very<00:04:03.570> surprising<00:04:03.750> because

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
ball which is very surprising because

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.199 
ball which is very surprising because
usually<00:04:04.560> tor<00:04:05.010> doesn't<00:04:05.430> do<00:04:05.549> stuff<00:04:05.790> like<00:04:05.880> that

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
usually tor doesn't do stuff like that

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.380 
usually tor doesn't do stuff like that
cheap<00:04:07.140> but<00:04:07.890> he<00:04:08.459> does<00:04:08.640> have<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.209> that's

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
cheap but he does have that so that's

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.850 
cheap but he does have that so that's
pretty<00:04:09.570> good<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.079> he<00:04:10.140> came<00:04:10.320> with<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.620> sword

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
pretty good and he came with the sword

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.949 
pretty good and he came with the sword
hilt<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.549> hammer<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:12.120> know<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.690> wouldn't

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
hilt and the hammer I know you wouldn't

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.319 
hilt and the hammer I know you wouldn't
hold<00:04:13.049> all<00:04:13.290> three<00:04:13.650> at<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.799> same<00:04:14.100> time<00:04:14.489> being

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
hold all three at the same time being

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.080 
hold all three at the same time being
that<00:04:15.810> Grifball<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.530> don't<00:04:16.739> do<00:04:16.890> that<00:04:17.100> but<00:04:17.579> he

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
that Grifball you don't do that but he

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.069 
that Grifball you don't do that but he
came<00:04:18.269> with<00:04:18.419> all<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.630> good<00:04:18.810> stuff

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
came with all that good stuff

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.830 
came with all that good stuff
decent<00:04:19.799> paint<00:04:20.010> scheme<00:04:20.310> not<00:04:20.609> not<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.660> best

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
decent paint scheme not not the best

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.230 
decent paint scheme not not the best
it's<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.079> little<00:04:22.320> glossy<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:23.610> dark<00:04:24.060> blue

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
it's a little glossy the dark blue

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.520 
it's a little glossy the dark blue
stripe<00:04:24.510> goes<00:04:24.720> well<00:04:24.930> with<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.169> orange<00:04:25.380> throw

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
stripe goes well with the orange throw

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.409 
stripe goes well with the orange throw
so<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.740> looks<00:04:25.919> good<00:04:25.979> and<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.790> do<00:04:26.850> like<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.240> so

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
so it looks good and I do like it so

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.650 
so it looks good and I do like it so
that<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.890> rundown<00:04:29.340> on<00:04:29.400> all<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.120> Recon

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.080 
that is the rundown on all of the Recon
armors<00:04:31.289> they're<00:04:31.590> pretty<00:04:31.919> good<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.460> think<00:04:32.880> if<00:04:33.000> I

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
armors they're pretty good I think if I

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.940 
armors they're pretty good I think if I
was<00:04:33.240> gonna<00:04:33.419> pick<00:04:33.720> any<00:04:33.930> I<00:04:34.050> would<00:04:34.380> try<00:04:34.620> to

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
was gonna pick any I would try to

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.390 
was gonna pick any I would try to
hunt<00:04:35.100> down<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:37.230> reward<00:04:37.560> exclusives<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
hunt down the the reward exclusives the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.130 
hunt down the the reward exclusives the
original<00:04:38.790> dark<00:04:39.030> blue<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.480> dark<00:04:39.690> red<00:04:39.900> I

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
original dark blue and the dark red I

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.230 
original dark blue and the dark red I
think<00:04:40.170> are<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.770> best<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:41.940> point<00:04:42.090> out

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
think are the best and just to point out

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.210 
think are the best and just to point out
that<00:04:42.480> dark<00:04:42.780> blue<00:04:43.080> it's<00:04:43.380> really<00:04:43.800> hard<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.070> tell

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
that dark blue it's really hard to tell

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.560 
that dark blue it's really hard to tell
you<00:04:44.400> probably<00:04:44.550> won't<00:04:44.940> be<00:04:45.060> able<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.210> tell<00:04:45.390> on

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
you probably won't be able to tell on

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.480 
you probably won't be able to tell on
camera<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.620> dark<00:04:46.860> blue<00:04:47.130> is

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
camera but the dark blue is

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.210 
camera but the dark blue is
semi-metallic<00:04:48.480> so<00:04:49.380> that's<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.680> really<00:04:50.040> nice

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
semi-metallic so that's a really nice

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.170 
semi-metallic so that's a really nice
looking<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:50.670> person

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
looking in person

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.030 
looking in person
the<00:04:51.450> light<00:04:51.630> blue<00:04:51.810> looks<00:04:52.110> okay<00:04:52.470> but<00:04:52.500> it's<00:04:52.920> not

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
the light blue looks okay but it's not

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.040 
the light blue looks okay but it's not
accurate<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.760> don't<00:04:54.240> think<00:04:54.390> that<00:04:54.510> color<00:04:54.720> was<00:04:54.900> in

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
accurate I don't think that color was in

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.690 
accurate I don't think that color was in
the<00:04:55.140> game<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.590> then<00:04:56.010> same<00:04:56.250> thing<00:04:56.430> for<00:04:56.610> the

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
the game and then same thing for the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.310 
the game and then same thing for the
Reds<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.090> Reds<00:04:57.390> not<00:04:57.570> metallic<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:58.200> my

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
Reds the Reds not metallic to my

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.590 
Reds the Reds not metallic to my
knowledge<00:04:58.580> maybe<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.760> hasn't<00:04:59.940> hint<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.360> there

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
knowledge maybe it hasn't hint in there

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.650 
knowledge maybe it hasn't hint in there
but<00:05:01.170> even<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.130> light<00:05:02.580> red<00:05:02.820> isn't<00:05:03.360> quite<00:05:03.540> as

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
but even so the light red isn't quite as

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.790 
but even so the light red isn't quite as
accurate<00:05:03.870> even<00:05:04.260> though<00:05:04.320> they<00:05:04.410> did<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.590> good<00:05:04.740> job

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
accurate even though they did a good job

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.620 
accurate even though they did a good job
with<00:05:04.980> it<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:05.640> either<00:05:06.000> way<00:05:06.180> it's<00:05:06.300> up<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.510> you<00:05:06.600> you

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
with it so either way it's up to you you

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.270 
with it so either way it's up to you you
know<00:05:06.900> pick<00:05:07.110> whatever<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.440> like<00:05:07.500> personally

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280
