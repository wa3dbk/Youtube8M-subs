00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.979 
to speak Owen six at this point in time
right<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.760> if<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:45.690> look<00:03:45.870> at<00:03:45.959> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
right now and if you just look at it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.290 
right now and if you just look at it
from<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.470> one-loss<00:03:46.830> standpoint<00:03:47.459> not<00:03:47.700> very

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
from a one-loss standpoint not very

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.850 
from a one-loss standpoint not very
impressive<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:48.840> does<00:03:49.050> that<00:03:49.200> make<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.380> doubly

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
impressive but does that make it doubly

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.979 
impressive but does that make it doubly
harder<00:03:50.130> for<00:03:50.310> them<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.459> get<00:03:50.790> blue<00:03:51.420> chip<00:03:51.630> talent

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
harder for them to get blue chip talent

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.449 
harder for them to get blue chip talent
to<00:03:52.050> come<00:03:52.200> into<00:03:52.320> boulder<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.769> think<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.160> makes<00:03:53.310> it

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
to come into boulder I think it makes it

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.250 
to come into boulder I think it makes it
really<00:03:53.670> hard<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.120> get<00:03:54.239> blue<00:03:54.510> chip<00:03:54.750> talent<00:03:55.170> you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
really hard to get blue chip talent you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.680 
really hard to get blue chip talent you
can<00:03:55.440> get<00:03:55.590> blue<00:03:55.769> chip<00:03:56.010> talent<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.519> Idaho<00:03:57.180> but

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
can get blue chip talent in Idaho but

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.660 
can get blue chip talent in Idaho but
that's<00:03:57.870> not<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.320> same<00:03:58.590> as<00:03:58.890> getting<00:03:59.070> guys<00:03:59.400> from

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
that's not the same as getting guys from

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.420 
that's not the same as getting guys from
Texas<00:03:59.880> California<00:04:00.709> Florida<00:04:01.709> that's<00:04:02.100> where
