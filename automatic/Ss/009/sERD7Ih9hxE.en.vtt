00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.960
 handcrafted when we speak 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.589
 these delicious basic lemons 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.080
 crystallized provincialized fillings 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.850
 of coconut let's answer first 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.850
 we need lemons that are big of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.470
 big size like this which is what 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.970
 we have to do is break it in half 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.930
 but before that we did not want to do 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.090
 candy for if we have said it 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.729
 We used to make our girl nervous 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 he hopes it 's water water because we carry 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.140
 how much of bad water is a liter of water 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.940
 Conagua and half a kilo of sugar can be 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.189
 Brown sugar will take place very currency 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.920
 okay if perfect normal that they know by 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.470
 example, brown sugar has much more 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.510
 sugar is much more sugar than the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.680
 refined sugar to make a step that 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.720
 sugar retination 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.910
 in sugars but it is also for example 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.910
 I like more to ask my waters 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.440
 if they call me sugar muscovado because 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.440
 dietitian and nothing refined 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.729
 It is very good 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.490
 Now we have to add this 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.610
 green vegetable paint to give us a 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.229
 pretty tone 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.630
