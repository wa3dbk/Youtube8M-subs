00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.859
 hello to all friendly amio ticos 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.990
 l'oréal paris and I'm here to 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.969
 teach you in an easy and simple way 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.309
 to get the most out of your 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.199
 illuminator let's use this 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.150
 Illuminator has a super texture 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.099
 moisturizing and long-lasting is 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.230
 perfect to illuminate our skin 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.630
 a prolonged way so that we can 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.730
 use the illuminator to create light in the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.949
 look and create volumes on the face 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.070
 let's start with the look we'll mark 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.810
 the points of light strategically these 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.440
 points are the tear 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.690
 the arch of the eyebrow 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.450
 and a little bit between the lacrimal and the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.640
 basin here in the middle 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.180
 let's apply with light touches and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.180
 we blur 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.750
 with this we can give light in an area 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.489
 located making the most of your 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.489
 makeup and widening the look 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.850
 you see now my look look more marked and 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.040
 with much more light now let's highlight 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.780
 the volumes of the face we can do it 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 before or after applying the base of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.520
 makeup let's start with the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.830
 cheekbones a trick smile to highlight 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.720
 the entire upper cheek area like this 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.720
 we give points of light throughout the area 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.860
 now we give small touches and with the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.650
 fingers we are gradually blurring 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.840
 Be careful in extending it. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.330
 blur it at the top of the cheekbone and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.680
 download it or upload it never get to the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.780
 dark circles 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.090
 after highlighting the cheekbones we will fine tune 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.500
 a little nose 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.570
 we create a vertical line throughout the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.880
 bridge of the nose and we are giving 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.410
 little touches we want the line to be 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.260
 quite marked but at the same time 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.000
 blurred last to mark 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.830
 completely the face we go to the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.560
 areas that we lack the front of the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.260
 chin we locate the points of light 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.960
 in the lower center of the forehead just 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.460
