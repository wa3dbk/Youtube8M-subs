00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.170
 welcome you to the channel i need 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.789
 space with you Vlad and today I will show 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.820
 how to make such a fountain with a wave 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.560
 buy from such a wave 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.329
 I think as many have guessed here 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.600
 ordinary closed system with this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.050
 piston 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.130
 let's build our fountain repeaters 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.060
 our will be arranged 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.079
 this order and 4s both sides of the dream with 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.600
 this side 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.409
 here on these 2 repeaters chloe there on 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.510
 really 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:06.030
 how come we set our delay and 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.369
 connecting then this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.630
 closed network when we already run 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.310
 will need to connect to our 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.250
 piston me this piston will stand 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.810
 here you need to go juice was always 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.630
 operating ie closed state and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.020
 when our here in this state when 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 here is our our chain will serve him 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.830
 signal 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.200
 it will interrupt the pre torch signal and 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.470
 the piston will open holy water 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.350
 will flow just look at it we 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.700
 from the first time or not run the fetus at 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.549
 we have flowed now we have to close 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.350
 here is a copy of the water poured but we have it 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.450
 poured with little hands but not 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.030
 looks very nice so you can 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:59.220
 just boost here here thats we 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.890
 put there how many two here 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.920
 one and here we get here 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.060
 so interesting 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.940
 wave fountain itself if it is such a fountain 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.430
 already did that sorry i didn't know not 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.590
 saw therefore decided to lay out his mink 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.069
 ideas 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.590
 now if you like such a fountain and 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.500
 generally would like to see on my channel 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.800
 more interesting mechanisms or 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.470
 buildings then put huskies write about it 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.600
 comments subscribe to the channel 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.130
 bet skip these videos 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.130
 probably this is all bye
