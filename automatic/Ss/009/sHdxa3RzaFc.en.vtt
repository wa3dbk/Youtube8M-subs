actually booted up into this wrong yet

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.619 
actually booted up into this wrong yet
even<00:00:43.469> though<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.739> flashed<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.300> this

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
even though I just flashed it so this

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.040 
even though I just flashed it so this
was<00:00:45.899> actually<00:00:46.469> came<00:00:47.100> available<00:00:47.399> yesterday

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
was actually came available yesterday

but it's been available on the galaxy s4

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.819 
but it's been available on the galaxy s4
for<00:00:51.989> about<00:00:52.140> two<00:00:52.710> weeks<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.590> let's<00:00:55.590> take<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
for about two weeks now so let's take a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.119 
for about two weeks now so let's take a
look<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.789> changes<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.690> Android<00:00:58.260> 4.3<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
look at the changes in Android 4.3 and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.500 
look at the changes in Android 4.3 and
all<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.390> jazz<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:02.059> obviously<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.329> take

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
all that jazz so obviously it will take

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
all that jazz so obviously it will take
a<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:04.350> longer<00:01:04.619> than<00:01:04.920> usual<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.430> boot<00:01:05.820> up

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
a bit bit longer than usual to boot up

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
a bit bit longer than usual to boot up
as<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> first<00:01:07.439> boot<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.220> it'll<00:01:08.400> be

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
as this is the first boot and it'll be

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
as this is the first boot and it'll be
setting<00:01:08.909> everything<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
setting everything up so you can see the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.570 
setting everything up so you can see the
boot<00:01:10.320> animation<00:01:10.890> hasn't<00:01:11.220> actually<00:01:11.369> changed

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
boot animation hasn't actually changed

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.800 
boot animation hasn't actually changed
it's<00:01:12.479> still<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.990> same<00:01:13.610> Nexus<00:01:14.610> boot<00:01:15.150> animation

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it's still the same Nexus boot animation

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's still the same Nexus boot animation
with<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> x<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.060> glowing<00:01:19.070> colors<00:01:20.070> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
with the x and the glowing colors I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.039 
with the x and the glowing colors I
guess<00:01:20.600> yeah<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.320> um<00:01:22.939> Android<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:23.970> upgrading<00:01:24.780> so

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
my google account apparently it can take

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.420 
my google account apparently it can take
a<00:02:31.750> few<00:02:31.840> minutes<00:02:32.260> bail<00:02:32.590> probably<00:02:33.010> only<00:02:33.160> take<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
a few minutes bail probably only take a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.790 
a few minutes bail probably only take a
few<00:02:33.700> seconds<00:02:34.209> as<00:02:34.540> i<00:02:34.569> am<00:02:34.840> connected<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.590> Wi-Fi

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
few seconds as i am connected to Wi-Fi

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.059 
few seconds as i am connected to Wi-Fi
and<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.910> route<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.209> very<00:02:37.450> close<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.739> there<00:02:38.950> we

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
and the route is very close so there we

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.270 
and the route is very close so there we
go<00:02:39.450> asking<00:02:40.450> me<00:02:40.480> what<00:02:40.930> google<00:02:41.410> serves<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.100> to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
go asking me what google serves so on to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.220 
go asking me what google serves so on to
this<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.610> all<00:02:42.760> familiar<00:02:42.940> stuff<00:02:43.569> although<00:02:44.080> i

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
this is all familiar stuff although i

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.860 
this is all familiar stuff although i
don't<00:02:44.440> think<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.610> previous<00:02:46.269> versions<00:02:46.450> there

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
don't think in previous versions there

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.039 
don't think in previous versions there
was<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.080> communication<00:02:47.709> service<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:49.600> let's

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
was this communication service but let's

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.550 
was this communication service but let's
go<00:02:51.040> for<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.370> restoring<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.440> apparently<00:02:53.440> this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
go for the restoring and apparently this

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.979 
go for the restoring and apparently this
could<00:02:53.799> take<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.069> while<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.580> i'll<00:02:55.330> be<00:02:55.510> back<00:02:55.690> when

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
could take a while so i'll be back when

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.970 
could take a while so i'll be back when
it's<00:02:56.019> done<00:02:56.470> right<00:02:57.099> so<00:02:58.470> already<00:02:59.470> knows<00:02:59.709> my<00:02:59.920> name

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
it's done right so already knows my name

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.009 
it's done right so already knows my name
that's<00:03:00.459> from<00:03:00.610> my<00:03:00.760> google<00:03:00.940> account<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.569> setup

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
that's from my google account and setup

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.390 
that's from my google account and setup
complete<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.860> let's<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.670> look<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
complete so let's have a look so the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.259 
complete so let's have a look so the
background<00:03:07.049> seems<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.440> be<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.920> original<00:03:09.269> 4.1

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
background seems to be the original 4.1

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.690 
background seems to be the original 4.1
jelly<00:03:10.630> bean<00:03:10.720> background<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.739> let's<00:03:12.430> take<00:03:12.640> a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
jelly bean background so let's take a

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.810 
jelly bean background so let's take a
look<00:03:13.000> at<00:03:13.120> any<00:03:13.299> wallpapers<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.340> seems<00:03:15.549> to<00:03:15.790> be

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
look at any wallpapers so it seems to be

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.990 
look at any wallpapers so it seems to be
a<00:03:16.180> similar<00:03:16.750> array<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.140> wallpapers<00:03:18.070> most<00:03:18.820> of

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
a similar array of wallpapers most of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.120 
a similar array of wallpapers most of
these<00:03:19.120> are<00:03:19.329> pretty<00:03:19.690> familiar<00:03:20.019> if<00:03:20.650> not<00:03:20.859> all<00:03:21.100> of

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
these are pretty familiar if not all of

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.720 
these are pretty familiar if not all of
them<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.690> um<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.470> don't<00:03:23.709> know<00:03:24.070> if<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.489> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
them so um I don't know if in the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.860 
them so um I don't know if in the
official<00:03:25.269> version<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:26.730> Android<00:03:27.730> 4.3<00:03:28.269> there

official version of Android 4.3 there
will<00:03:29.049> be<00:03:29.260> new<00:03:29.950> wallpapers<00:03:30.640> but<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.930> doesn't

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
will be new wallpapers but it doesn't

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.410 
will be new wallpapers but it doesn't
look<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.620> right<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.549> look<00:03:33.880> the

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
it actually says 4.3 there so let's take

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.479 
it actually says 4.3 there so let's take
a<00:03:43.299> look<00:03:43.569> at<00:03:43.720> some<00:03:43.900> new<00:03:43.959> features<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:45.220> one<00:03:45.459> of

a look at some new features so one of
the<00:03:45.670> main<00:03:45.850> features<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.540> i<00:03:46.600> meant<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.959> be<00:03:47.049> in

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
the main features that i meant to be in

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.009 
the main features that i meant to be in
this<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.500> better<00:03:47.709> performance<00:03:48.310> now<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:49.630> nexus

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
this is better performance now the nexus

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.629 
this is better performance now the nexus
floor<00:03:50.260> has<00:03:50.380> always<00:03:50.590> been<00:03:50.739> pretty<00:03:51.010> snappy<00:03:51.430> i

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
floor has always been pretty snappy i

floor has always been pretty snappy i
can't<00:03:51.940> really<00:03:52.180> notice<00:03:52.480> any<00:03:52.930> performance

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
can't really notice any performance

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.770 
can't really notice any performance
increase<00:03:54.069> apart<00:03:54.819> from<00:03:54.970> those<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.150> little<00:03:55.630> bit

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
increase apart from those a little bit

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.599 
increase apart from those a little bit
of<00:03:55.870> lag<00:03:56.079> there<00:03:56.319> that's<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:56.950> we're

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
of lag there that's because we're

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.670 
of lag there that's because we're
showing<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:58.000> tutorial<00:03:58.660> does<00:03:59.139> seem<00:03:59.350> very

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
showing the tutorial does seem very

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.680 
showing the tutorial does seem very
smooth<00:04:00.130> but<00:04:00.819> it's<00:04:00.940> not<00:04:01.090> like<00:04:01.269> it<00:04:01.420> wasn't

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
smooth but it's not like it wasn't

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.790 
smooth but it's not like it wasn't
smooth<00:04:01.930> before

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.230 

another<00:04:08.800> thing<00:04:09.100> that's<00:04:09.340> meant<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.760> added

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
another thing that's meant to be added

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.410 
another thing that's meant to be added
is<00:04:10.450> dialer<00:04:11.050> autocomplete<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:12.610> if<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:12.940> go<00:04:12.970> into

the<00:04:13.720> dialer<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.770> UI<00:04:14.950> seems<00:04:15.400> pre<00:04:15.810> similar

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
the dialer the UI seems pre similar

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.020 
the dialer the UI seems pre similar
