I've<00:00:14.910> already<00:00:15.089> got<00:00:15.240> my<00:00:15.509> virtual<00:00:15.570> machine

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
I've already got my virtual machine

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.580 
I've already got my virtual machine
started<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:17.690> I'm<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.140> ahead<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
started up I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.450 
started up I'm going to go ahead and
login<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.619> think<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.039> installment

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
login and I think in this installment

what<00:00:26.730> we're<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.630> install<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.410> web

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
what we're going to do is install a web

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.910 
what we're going to do is install a web
browser<00:00:29.390> on<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.689> particular<00:00:31.230> system<00:00:31.500> all

ain't<00:00:32.759> no<00:00:32.820> find<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.120> pretty<00:00:33.270> easy<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.930> it's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
ain't no find is pretty easy to do it's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.600 
ain't no find is pretty easy to do it's
not<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.160> hard

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.560 

naturally<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> start<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
naturally I'm going to start up a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.049 
naturally I'm going to start up a
terminal<00:00:42.960> window<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:44.309> because<00:00:44.579> I'm<00:00:44.700> doing<00:00:44.820> a

I'm logged in as the root and what I've

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.189 
I'm logged in as the root and what I've
chosen<00:00:59.760> for<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.120> particular<00:01:00.600> system<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
chosen for this particular system is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.399 
chosen for this particular system is
I've<00:01:02.129> chosen<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.609> install<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.270> Chrome<00:01:03.690> web

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
I've chosen to install the Chrome web

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.789 
I've chosen to install the Chrome web
browser<00:01:05.119> there<00:01:06.119> are<00:01:06.240> many<00:01:06.420> reasons<00:01:09.799> probably

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
browser there are many reasons probably

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.800 
browser there are many reasons probably
one<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> more<00:01:11.340> compelling<00:01:12.000> reasons<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
one of the more compelling reasons to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.800 
one of the more compelling reasons to
install<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:14.540> chromium<00:01:15.540> web<00:01:16.080> browser<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
install the chromium web browser is that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.340 
install the chromium web browser is that
using<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> package<00:01:19.110> install<00:01:19.680> method<00:01:21.350> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
using the package install method is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.120 
using the package install method is
quick<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.280> easy<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.710> when<00:01:25.710> chrome<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
quick it's easy and when chrome is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.109 
quick it's easy and when chrome is
installed<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.939> already<00:01:27.000> has<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> Flash<00:01:28.229> Player

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
installed it already has a Flash Player

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.460 
installed it already has a Flash Player
included<00:01:30.119> with<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.320> that's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
included with it and I think that's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:43.030 
included with it and I think that's
pretty<00:01:31.619> pretty<00:01:32.280> neat

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.190 

and<00:01:43.640> we'll<00:01:43.790> just<00:01:43.970> let<00:01:44.120> this<00:01:44.270> work<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.960> won't

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
and we'll just let this work it won't

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.730 
and we'll just let this work it won't
take<00:01:45.380> very<00:01:45.410> long<00:01:45.680> at<00:01:46.010> all<00:01:46.420> okay<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.320> there<00:01:48.590> we

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
take very long at all okay so there we

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.690 
take very long at all okay so there we
have<00:01:48.980> it

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.360 

so<00:01:58.150> my<00:01:58.300> work<00:01:58.450> as<00:01:59.080> route<00:01:59.440> looks<00:01:59.740> like<00:01:59.920> it's<00:02:00.130> done

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
about that it seems to have worked now

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.850 
about that it seems to have worked now
as<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.090> mentioned<00:02:19.480> earlier<00:02:19.840> as<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.500> mentioned

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
as I mentioned earlier as I mentioned

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.030 
as I mentioned earlier as I mentioned
earlier<00:02:21.220> um<00:02:22.140> when<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.230> do<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.470> install<00:02:23.590> that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
earlier um when you do the install that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.790 
earlier um when you do the install that
way<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.400> chromium<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:27.930> Flash<00:02:28.930> Player<00:02:29.290> comes

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
way with chromium the Flash Player comes

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.040 
way with chromium the Flash Player comes
pre-installed<00:02:30.220> which<00:02:30.880> i<00:02:31.030> think<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> pretty

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
pre-installed which i think is a pretty

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.970 
pre-installed which i think is a pretty
cool<00:02:35.310> kind<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.900> pretty<00:02:37.900> cool<00:02:38.140> setup<00:02:38.470> all

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
cool kind of a pretty cool setup all

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.740 
cool kind of a pretty cool setup all
right<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:42.010> let's<00:02:42.190> go<00:02:42.310> ahead<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.580> test<00:02:43.540> that

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
right so let's go ahead and test that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:58.180 
right so let's go ahead and test that
out<00:02:43.810> all<00:02:44.320> right

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.370 

here<00:02:58.850> we<00:02:59.060> go<00:02:59.240> and<00:02:59.720> this<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.020> one<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.320> the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
here we go and this is one of the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
here we go and this is one of the
previous<00:03:01.450> one<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.630> previous<00:03:03.140> videos<00:03:06.400> that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
previous one of the previous videos that

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.360 
previous one of the previous videos that
I<00:03:07.610> did<00:03:07.910> earlier<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:09.320> plays<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:09.890> fine<00:03:10.250> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
I did earlier and it plays just fine the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.440 
I did earlier and it plays just fine the
sound<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.640> just<00:03:13.670> fine

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.880 

looks<00:03:17.450> like<00:03:17.630> it'll<00:03:17.810> scale<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.380> full<00:03:18.590> screen
