00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
colorful and it has beads on it so I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.780 
colorful and it has beads on it so I
thought<00:01:04.080> that'd<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.350> really<00:01:04.589> cute<00:01:05.010> looks<00:01:05.580> like

likes these very much since I just got
him<00:01:17.070> he<00:01:17.250> might<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.580> bit<00:01:17.850> scared<00:01:18.689> or

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
him he might be a little bit scared or

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
him he might be a little bit scared or
skittish<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.409> whatnot<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.070> maybe<00:01:20.729> he'll<00:01:20.970> warm

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
skittish and whatnot so maybe he'll warm

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.940 
skittish and whatnot so maybe he'll warm
up<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.049> put<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> couple<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.860> these

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
up to these but I put a couple of these

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.550 
up to these but I put a couple of these
in<00:01:23.189> his<00:01:23.310> bowl<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> he<00:01:23.909> didn't<00:01:24.810> eat<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.170> since

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
in his bowl and he didn't eat them since

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.270 
in his bowl and he didn't eat them since
last<00:01:25.740> night

I would never put a parrot on this this

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.480 
I would never put a parrot on this this
would<00:05:25.930> be<00:05:26.050> way<00:05:26.320> too<00:05:26.350> small<00:05:26.740> they<00:05:27.130> could<00:05:27.190> take

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
would be way too small they could take

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.940 
would be way too small they could take
like<00:05:27.670> one<00:05:28.030> step<00:05:28.360> but<00:05:29.050> it<00:05:29.140> is<00:05:29.290> purple<00:05:29.800> and

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
like one step but it is purple and

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.520 
like one step but it is purple and
instead<00:05:30.820> of<00:05:30.880> being<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.300> sanded<00:05:31.690> perch<00:05:31.930> it

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
instead of being a sanded perch it

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.070 
instead of being a sanded perch it
pumice<00:05:32.980> so<00:05:33.730> I'm<00:05:34.300> hoping<00:05:34.600> that'd<00:05:34.750> be<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:34.930> little

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
pumice so I'm hoping that'd be a little

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.450 
pumice so I'm hoping that'd be a little
bit<00:05:35.320> better<00:05:36.690> but<00:05:37.740> supposedly<00:05:38.740> this<00:05:39.070> is<00:05:39.220> saying

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
bit better but supposedly this is saying

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.570 
bit better but supposedly this is saying
that<00:05:40.110> it's<00:05:41.110> safer<00:05:41.590> than<00:05:41.710> sand<00:05:42.040> I<00:05:42.310> don't<00:05:42.460> know

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
that it's safer than sand I don't know

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.120 
that it's safer than sand I don't know
how<00:05:42.760> but<00:05:43.180> whatever<00:05:43.600> I<00:05:43.930> got<00:05:44.290> some<00:05:44.500> sanded<00:05:44.920> perch
