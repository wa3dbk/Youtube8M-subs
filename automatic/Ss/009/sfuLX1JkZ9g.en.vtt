00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.150
 and now it has come to my mind too 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.810
 a method 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.300
 to make an adjustable ring type e 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.820
 I want to do it with you in another 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.820
 color 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:31.980
 once I will use copper wire from 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:36.760
 a millimeter thick and let's see some 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:41.949
 so my idea is that the thread is 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:46.629
 fold in the back so I'm going to take me 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:49.989
 the thread in this world is ok and this will be 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.890
 no longer the front but the back of mine 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.690
 ring 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.879
 so now I'm going to go back 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.909
 back filosia talent 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:02.949
 on the other hand, leaving one 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:07.900
 overlapping part and I will do in 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:12.939
 this way i'm working with everything 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:16.570
 the thread I have of this thickness because 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:21.700
 I really don't know how much wire I'll need 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:28.680
 for the finished work now this is the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:30.909
 the back of my ring I carry in front of me 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:38.320
 in processing 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:44.380
 ok i go then tangier my son 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 from the base to the front 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.320
 bull to go and create that two curls 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.830
 on this other side I am not obliged 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.280
 to do the same design but I can also 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.220
 make a completely different drawing e 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.220
 so I can go other weapons 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.200
 but s 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.810
 and then the spiral 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.970
 I cut a small piece of thread 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:47.040
 thinner than the thickness 04 with which 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.760
 I'm going to lock the ring in this one 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.760
 point 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.769
 this should be my base 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.769
 proposal for an adjustable base here it is 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.610
 here now to give him some 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.950
 consistency 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.110
 I will try to hammer it here 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.870
 around it I went to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.610
 hammer the ring around mine 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.440
 support 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.830
 first of all it was a good thing 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.980
 use this marker and not the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.840
 plastic spindle because if you were 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.069
 broken plastic baby not 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.599
 I had another instead of Anas and dna 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:43.470
 rally I had as many as I wanted of the side 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:47.670
 around the support the round part 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.400
 of the ring the circular part 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.150
 of the ring the base that goes around the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.450
 finger the hammer but not flatten it 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.319
 this part therefore lloyd rigidity 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.190
 slightly but I did not go 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.069
 flatten it, then I removed it from the support 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:10.650
 and placing it on the anvil are 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:15.060
 went to crush this other one 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:20.910
 curl and the two ends on the back 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:27.180
 now I'm going to give the water curve again 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:32.450
 end through the pliers and behold 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:39.110
 here my ring base can pass 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:44.520
 to my work to weave mine 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:48.630
 processing to tangle but leave the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.760
 neither spirals nor discoveries I go to get 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.310
 my thinnest son in this case 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.849
 I want to use 103 so I do 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.659
 to see 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.409
 also with another credit line thickness 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.409
 what is the result 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.680
 and here the procedure I used 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.400
 it's the same one you saw in the video 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.450
 previous I will review it for you 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.450
 very quickly 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.180
 I want to leave these two uncovered 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.720
 then spiral with the return thread 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:14.440
 back on my feet and go instead to 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.430
 reach sedans in the center of the 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.430
 processing 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:23.610
 so this is my tangle ring 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.610
 with adjustable base finished I hope that 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.110
 this tutorial is also useful and there 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.110
 see you soon hi bye
