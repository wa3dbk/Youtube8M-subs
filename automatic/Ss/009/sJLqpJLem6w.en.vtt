00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello hello youtube friends what's up 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.420
 they are here he talks to them another base day of 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.119
 bass asks with a new video and we arrived 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.730
 Well man now that now what is the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.480
 question and now that we are over the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.560
 world already after this great month that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.960
 we had football every day now 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.820
 we go back to normal and it's weird is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 the good question and now what are we going to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.309
 do they still lack as 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 a month and a half or something like this or two months 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.170
 so that a month and a half I think so that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.110
 start the leagues then we're going to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 be with football abstention which 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.059
 it's bad for health the truth that's 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 bad for the health we will be wrong badly 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.500
 but good for that we have the fish and the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.320
 fifa and well then man I do not detour 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.909
 of the subject now we are going to what we come 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.510
 good is the world champion 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:06.479
 germany second argentina and good then 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.160
 yes sure many of those who see 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.640
 many of the Argentines who will see me 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.520
 suddenly they will be angry because 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 they see us in the end suddenly something controversial 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 but in my opinion germany is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.690
 deserved champion deserved germany what 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.240
 deserved Germany made merits for 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.460
 to be champion there was a final out 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.520
 end I would say plagued by inaccuracies 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.800
 by one and failures by the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 another germany was very inaccurate in the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.670
 last quarter of court could not generate 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 very clear occasions only until the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.659
 last that of götze with a 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.760
 defensive deconcentration 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.310
 she and argentina diego and argentina 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.490
 I miss three very clear occasions three 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.740
 very clear goal opportunities and 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.830
 they annulled a goal that was well annulled 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.180
 but failed failed some clear occasions 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.860
 that could have meant the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.840
 title so good was a game the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.550
 truth I would say not very good not very 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.260
 well we had to go again to the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.530
 long is a very seasoned party very 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.750
 fought again very tactical 0 to 0 at 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.720
 final is defined in the last 5 minutes 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.180
 for that goal of götze but nothing what 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.070
 I mean, I think that more than 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.510
 all well- deserved positions in the 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.660
 that were left for most of the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.760
 equipment for others not for example is 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.950
 interesting to note that of course it was 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.750
 first germany as we see champion 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.730
 obviously second argentina third 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.490
 holland fourth brazil for me brazil not 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.780
 I had come so far I think that good 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.060
 one of the problems was that Brazil 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.090
 we had a negative representative 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.310
 we had Brazil in the ones in the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.110
 semifinals to see if he had not 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.880
 last first of all before chile I 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.650
 I think Chile and Colombia had a lot 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.590
 more soccer than Brazil 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.560
 that's something else and we saw what it was 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.450
 what happened and then the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.010
 positions 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.540
 if you arrive at the page of the viva 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.480
 they are going to see all that I am more 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.819
 or less looking there from the classification 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.250
 the table of all the positions of how 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.260
 is this world very happy the truth 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.909
 the personal because Colombia was fifth 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.090
 that is our best participation in a 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.700
 world is really amazing but something 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.659
 that for example they were commenting is 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.670
 that the draw favored us not us 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.420
 favored for nothing because it touched us 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.459
 play against brazil and well we saw what 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.290
 what happened I think we had equipment to 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.299
 go further as the 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.459
 selection of chile that touched him the same 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.349
 Chileans must be feeling what 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.629
 same that we touched them the same 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.340
 exactly the same story left them with 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.810
 the host selection with the selection 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.450
 in that instance he was not could 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.370
 win then the chile and colombia 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.200
 they are unfairly eliminated for me 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.290
 for my chile and colombia they will easily go 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.510
 could be among the first four 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.030
 and it would have been a 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.730
 final part much more South American but 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.230
 good at the end so all the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.030
 conditions of the personal I very happy 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.250
 with the Colombian team very grateful 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.780
 with this with this insurance team 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.370
 many of you will also be 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.590
 grateful with their selections that 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.930
 they showed great game the selection of 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.840
 mexico the selection of costa rica the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.690
 chile selection the selection of 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.199
 Uruguay that also played well enough 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.169
 well the selection of argentina itself 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.270
 runner-up is should we all be 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.330
 very very happy with our choices 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.460
 because they did not leave us high on 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.039
 South America represented us quite 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.979
 well in this world and I think this we 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.800
 says leave us to wait in russia 2018 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.710
 another tremendously impressive world 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.680
 another world quite good with many 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.660
 expectations 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.370
 for what you see in the American Cup 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.320
 be the america cup that I think is the 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.389
 next year in two years I am very 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.070
 aware but but for what is coming 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.229
 it's like america is going to be great 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:00.169
 to be great is going to be awesome 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.169
 also comment suddenly how they were 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.549
 the tables of the prizes that were given 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:09.039
 the prizes for the best player would win 

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:11.799
 one month and quite controversial prize for 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.229
 my month and I did not deserve this award I think that 

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:16.599
 messi although he did a very good first round 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.149
 good in these last matches where he 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.769
 he needed them did not appear then for 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:22.149
 me messi should not have won this 

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:23.949
 prize I think there were players that 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:24.939
 they played much better throughout the 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.349
 tournament 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.629
 if we talk about Argentina we could 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.699
 talk about mascherano we could talk 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.949
 of the bird yes he did a very good match 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.569
 in the final and logically for me what 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.029
 You sail out at halftime for me 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.279
 He must not have done that but they are good 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:41.049
 decisions already it's all too 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.929
 very happy because it never stayed 

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:47.430
 top scorer then even though 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:49.950
 there were 23 games less 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.840
 he managed to keep the golden boot something 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.210
 really amazing a lot of future you will 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.940
 go to hamed the golden glove ends 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.040
 gaining noyer the great goalie keeper 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.110
 they are oier is a crack a true 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.570
 porterazo for me the best goalkeeper 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.580
 world not yesterday and the prize player the 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.680
 youthful player took it paul pogba 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.380
 cardiff man cardin sites 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.720
 yes sir have the ones of the card and good 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.970
 because this world cup left us many things 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.830
 like one day the good world cool 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.850
 everything that has to do with football is 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.650
 cool 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.600
 another thing is that suddenly many will say 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.640
 well I got his hand there match 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.890
 that's why we lost and if that happened 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.710
 unfortunate in this world I think that has 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.780
 been one of the world that has counted 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.200
 with an arbitration with one of the worst 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:38.070
 arbitrations that I've seen but well I think 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.430
 that apart from it was spectacular 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.230
 I quite enjoy that joy quite this 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.780
 month we kept it totally 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.740
 plugged into football and that's the cool thing 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.389
 is the important thing and then 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.449
 let's see what happens next for 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.520
 russia 2018 let's hope we enjoy it 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:59.990
 enough already got four years now 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.720
 start the countdown left 48 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.970
 accounts are months I say 48 months so that 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.949
 start russia 2018 and I'm going to tell you 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.449

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:10.520
 start the countdown and now 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:14.690
 we started now we can now that we 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.400
 let's see in russia and then nothing and also 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.050
 in your comments obviously this video 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.490
 It's not too long I do not have that much 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.259
 I have been talking for seven minutes 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.949
 talking about the insurance cart is 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:26.419
 pure cart this video but but nothing 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:27.650

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.900
 worldwide if they are happy with their 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.740
 selection 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:37.520
 I imagine that everyone will be happy and 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.230
 well as I say we will see ourselves in russia 2018 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.300

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.670
 to play again another world cup 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.320
