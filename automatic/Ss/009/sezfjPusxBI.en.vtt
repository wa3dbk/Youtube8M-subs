other<00:03:15.800> nails<00:03:16.040> but<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.730> really<00:03:17.060> did<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.630> rest<00:03:17.810> so

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
other nails but I really did the rest so

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.320 
other nails but I really did the rest so
you<00:03:18.530> can<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:18.710> use<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.520> same<00:03:19.700> sponge<00:03:19.970> without

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
you can just use the same sponge without

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.260 
you can just use the same sponge without
having<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.780> redo<00:03:21.140> just<00:03:21.739> do<00:03:21.890> one<00:03:22.100> layer<00:03:22.340> over

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
having to redo just do one layer over

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.180 
having to redo just do one layer over
all<00:03:23.450> your<00:03:23.630> nails<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.260> let<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.650> dry<00:03:24.890> and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
all your nails that let that dry and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.820 
all your nails that let that dry and
then<00:03:25.700> after<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.209> I'll<00:03:26.500> reload<00:03:27.500> up<00:03:27.680> your

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
then after that I'll reload up your

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.330 
then after that I'll reload up your
sponge<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.370> then<00:03:28.520> do<00:03:28.640> another<00:03:28.760> layer<00:03:30.340> alright

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
sponge and then do another layer alright

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.570 
sponge and then do another layer alright
so<00:03:31.670> basically<00:03:31.910> that's<00:03:32.360> done<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:34.100> now<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.400> just

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
so basically that's done so now I just

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:43.110 
so basically that's done so now I just
carefully<00:03:35.450> peel<00:03:36.110> off<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.320> tape

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.600 

so<00:03:43.690> now<00:03:43.959> I'm<00:03:44.319> just<00:03:44.590> going<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.890> finish<00:03:45.129> it<00:03:45.310> off

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
so now I'm just going to finish it off

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.330 
so now I'm just going to finish it off
with<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:46.330> tough<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.810> top<00:03:47.110> coat<00:03:48.510> i'm<00:03:49.510> using<00:03:49.750> this

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
with a tough a top coat i'm using this

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.479

my<00:03:54.610> opinion<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.209> best<00:03:55.420> one<00:03:55.870> out<00:03:55.930> there

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.330 

I<00:04:09.220> would<00:04:09.910> recommend<00:04:10.030> like<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.980> two<00:04:11.980> coats<00:04:12.220> of

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
I would recommend like a two coats of

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.120 
I would recommend like a two coats of
this<00:04:12.550> usually<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:14.460> would<00:04:15.460> just<00:04:15.760> clean<00:04:15.970> up<00:04:16.000> the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
this usually I would just clean up the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.460 
this usually I would just clean up the
what<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.370> excess<00:04:18.700> from<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.209> cuticles<00:04:19.720> with<00:04:19.840> a

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
what the excess from the cuticles with a

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.050 
what the excess from the cuticles with a
dotting<00:04:21.100> tool<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.730> can<00:04:22.660> use<00:04:23.430> tweezers<00:04:24.430> or<00:04:24.700> some

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
dotting tool I can use tweezers or some

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.340 
dotting tool I can use tweezers or some
or<00:04:25.240> anything<00:04:25.630> pointy<00:04:28.020> just<00:04:29.020> don't<00:04:29.200> cut

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
or anything pointy just don't cut

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.910 
or anything pointy just don't cut
yourself<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:31.080> then<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.230> rest<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.890> can

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
yourself and then the rest you can

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.420 
yourself and then the rest you can
scrape<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.400> off<00:04:33.520> later<00:04:33.670> when<00:04:33.940> it<00:04:34.060> dries<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
scrape it off later when it dries and

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.280 
scrape it off later when it dries and
basically<00:04:36.430> you're<00:04:36.940> done<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:37.720> if<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.110> want<00:04:38.260> to
