this is to say de san dimas halfway and
the<00:03:43.830> game<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.370> halfway<00:03:44.580> over<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:45.240> that

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
the game is halfway over to that

I<00:03:46.459> don't<00:03:47.239> even<00:03:47.299> know<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.750> just<00:03:47.930> looks<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
I don't even know it just looks like the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.789 
I don't even know it just looks like the
time<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.860> faster<00:03:49.430> than<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.640> gameplay<00:03:50.120> I

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
time is faster than the gameplay I

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.229 
time is faster than the gameplay I
haven't<00:03:51.799> really<00:03:51.980> watched<00:03:52.430> over<00:03:52.640> this<00:03:52.819> much

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
but it probably goes it sped it up
