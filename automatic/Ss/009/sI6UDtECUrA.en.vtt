now there's two different types the
dense<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> then<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> regular<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.360> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600

and now this is spreading very quickly

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.699 
and now this is spreading very quickly
faster<00:02:11.910> than<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> imagined<00:02:12.690> because<00:02:13.440> once<00:02:13.620> it

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
faster than I imagined because once it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.670 
faster than I imagined because once it
gets<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:15.090> goes<00:02:15.209> even<00:02:15.480> faster<00:02:15.680> so

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
gets going it just goes even faster so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.260 
gets going it just goes even faster so
let's<00:02:16.860> go<00:02:16.920> over<00:02:17.040> here<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> hospital

so you just use the break oh you should
use<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.710> regular<00:03:10.860> dense<00:03:11.280> virus<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.850> where

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
use the regular dense virus and where

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.290 
use the regular dense virus and where
your<00:03:12.210> virus<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.410> find<00:03:13.970> when<00:03:14.970> mining

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
your virus that you find when mining

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.700 
your virus that you find when mining
those<00:03:15.390> blocks<00:03:15.690> up<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:16.350> if<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.590> were<00:03:16.680> to

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.280 
those blocks up now if you were to
right-click<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.430> an<00:03:18.120> area<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.630> will<00:03:18.810> infect<00:03:19.080> it

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
right-click on an area it will infect it

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.980 
right-click on an area it will infect it
and<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:20.640> will<00:03:20.850> just<00:03:21.030> oh<00:03:21.240> this<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:21.840> doesn't

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
and it will just oh this one doesn't

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.730 
and it will just oh this one doesn't
seem<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.380> working

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
seem to be working

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.520 
seem to be working
um<00:03:23.210> but<00:03:24.210> yeah<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:24.900> use<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.200> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
um but yeah you can just use it to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.770 
um but yeah you can just use it to
infect<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.010> block<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.460> then<00:03:27.210> it<00:03:27.450> will<00:03:27.600> start

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
infect a block and then it will start

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.960 
infect a block and then it will start
spreading<00:03:28.260> very<00:03:28.530> quickly<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.670> we<00:03:29.760> get<00:03:29.880> that

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
spreading very quickly so we get that

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.230 
spreading very quickly so we get that
one<00:03:30.150> there<00:03:30.300> that<00:03:30.780> one's<00:03:31.020> no<00:03:31.410> fun<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:32.580> gives<00:03:33.150> you

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
one there that one's no fun it gives you

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.990 
one there that one's no fun it gives you
a<00:03:33.270> lot<00:03:33.540> more<00:03:33.810> worse<00:03:34.800> effects<00:03:35.370> when<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.790> walk

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
a lot more worse effects when you walk

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.330 
a lot more worse effects when you walk
over<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:36.300> but<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:37.290> let's<00:03:37.440> head<00:03:37.560> over<00:03:37.740> here<00:03:38.160> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
over it but now let's head over here and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.530 
over it but now let's head over here and
let's<00:03:38.580> take<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> look<00:03:38.850> at<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.000> few<00:03:39.150> more<00:03:39.270> things

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
let's take a look at a few more things

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.290 
let's take a look at a few more things
so<00:03:40.530> we<00:03:40.620> check<00:03:40.770> that<00:03:40.920> chest<00:03:41.160> out<00:03:41.310> now<00:03:41.940> we<00:03:42.000> have

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
so we check that chest out now we have

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.140 
so we check that chest out now we have
dig<00:03:42.720> decontaminate<00:03:43.530> err<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.490> is<00:03:44.730> secure

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
dig decontaminate err so this is secure

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.020 
dig decontaminate err so this is secure
this<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.840> cure<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.290> save<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.770> world<00:03:47.030> from

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
this is the cure to save the world from

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.800 
this is the cure to save the world from
devastation

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
devastation

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.920 
devastation
quoting<00:03:49.770> Pokemon<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.400> don't<00:03:50.640> know<00:03:50.790> oh<00:03:51.000> yeah

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
quoting Pokemon I don't know oh yeah

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.960 
quoting Pokemon I don't know oh yeah
right<00:03:52.050> here<00:03:52.110> with<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> dense<00:03:52.620> virus<00:03:53.010> test

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
right here with the dense virus test

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.790 
right here with the dense virus test
tubes<00:03:54.240> so<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.660> need<00:03:54.840> four<00:03:55.110> test<00:03:55.560> tubes

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
tubes so you need four test tubes

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.890 
tubes so you need four test tubes
regular<00:03:56.400> virus<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.300> four<00:03:57.450> test<00:03:57.690> tubes

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
regular virus and then four test tubes

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.530 
regular virus and then four test tubes
dense<00:03:58.650> virus<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.460> machine<00:03:59.670> block<00:03:59.940> which<00:04:00.510> is

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
dense virus and a machine block which is

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.320 
dense virus and a machine block which is
crafted<00:04:01.140> with<00:04:01.290> eight<00:04:02.160> iron<00:04:02.520> ingots<00:04:02.820> in<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.120> coal

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
crafted with eight iron ingots in a coal

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.790 
crafted with eight iron ingots in a coal
block<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.750> then<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.560> get<00:04:04.650> this

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
block and then you get this

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.370 
block and then you get this
decontaminate<00:04:05.490> err<00:04:05.520> so<00:04:06.060> I'll<00:04:06.960> show<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.230> what

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
decontaminate err so I'll show you what

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.140 
decontaminate err so I'll show you what
that's<00:04:07.560> used<00:04:07.800> for<00:04:07.890> in<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.190> minute<00:04:08.490> let's<00:04:08.970> just

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
that's used for in a minute let's just

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.720 
that's used for in a minute let's just
use<00:04:09.300> for<00:04:09.660> decontaminating<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.560> certain<00:04:11.040> area<00:04:11.520> I

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
use for decontaminating a certain area I

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.210 
use for decontaminating a certain area I
think<00:04:11.940> 10<00:04:12.350> 10<00:04:13.350> by<00:04:13.470> 10<00:04:13.710> or<00:04:13.770> something<00:04:14.100> like<00:04:14.160> that

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
think 10 10 by 10 or something like that

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.160 
think 10 10 by 10 or something like that
let's<00:04:14.970> head<00:04:15.120> down<00:04:15.300> in<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.510> secret<00:04:15.780> lab<00:04:15.930> and

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
let's head down in the secret lab and

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.400 
let's head down in the secret lab and
now<00:04:16.739> let's<00:04:16.980> take<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> look<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:17.820> we<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.210> a<00:04:18.450> virus

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
now let's take a look so we have a virus

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.530 
now let's take a look so we have a virus
breeder<00:04:19.680> this<00:04:20.310> is<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:20.700> actually<00:04:21.090> breeding<00:04:21.450> a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
breeder this is for actually breeding a

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.980 
breeder this is for actually breeding a
virus<00:04:21.960> so<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:22.980> need<00:04:23.130> some<00:04:23.280> rotten<00:04:23.700> flesh<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.240> I

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
virus so we need some rotten flesh and I

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.870 
virus so we need some rotten flesh and I
think<00:04:25.170> it<00:04:25.230> takes<00:04:25.350> two<00:04:25.710> days<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.950> go<00:04:26.280> across<00:04:26.490> and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
think it takes two days to go across and

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.690 
think it takes two days to go across and
then<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:27.570> can<00:04:27.690> get<00:04:27.810> yourself<00:04:28.140> a<00:04:28.200> virus<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.770> just

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
then you can get yourself a virus I just

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.610 
then you can get yourself a virus I just
oh<00:04:29.850> my<00:04:30.150> god<00:04:30.180> I'm<00:04:30.450> scared<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.960> virus<00:04:31.230> is<00:04:31.380> gonna

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
oh my god I'm scared the virus is gonna

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.260 
oh my god I'm scared the virus is gonna
come<00:04:31.800> in<00:04:31.920> here<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.460> fact<00:04:32.490> everything<00:04:32.910> so

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
come in here and in fact everything so

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.930 
come in here and in fact everything so
it<00:04:33.390> does<00:04:33.540> take<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.750> lot<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.290> rotten<00:04:34.530> flesh<00:04:34.800> um<00:04:35.070> to

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
it does take a lot of rotten flesh um to

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.490 
it does take a lot of rotten flesh um to
get<00:04:36.090> this<00:04:36.240> thing<00:04:36.450> done<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.169> need<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.380> keep

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
get this thing done so you need to keep

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.490 
get this thing done so you need to keep
refueling<00:04:38.040> it<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.400> get<00:04:38.580> this<00:04:38.729> virus<00:04:39.120> and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
refueling it to get this virus and

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.210 
refueling it to get this virus and
potentially<00:04:40.500> save<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> world

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
potentially save the world

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.420 
potentially save the world
also<00:04:42.120> over<00:04:42.390> here<00:04:42.420> we<00:04:42.720> have<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.140> D<00:04:43.830> contaminator

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
also over here we have a D contaminator

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.910 
also over here we have a D contaminator
which<00:04:44.760> will<00:04:44.940> give<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.150> regular<00:04:45.330> steak

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
which will give you regular steak

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.860 
which will give you regular steak
because<00:04:46.920> your<00:04:47.100> state<00:04:47.310> gets<00:04:47.550> infected<00:04:47.880> so<00:04:48.780> you

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
because your state gets infected so you

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.540 
because your state gets infected so you
need<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.050> decontaminate<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.010> make<00:04:50.520> sure

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
need to decontaminate it and make sure

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.960 
need to decontaminate it and make sure
you<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:50.970> eat<00:04:51.420> it<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:52.620> craft<00:04:52.920> this<00:04:53.370> virus

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
you can eat it and to craft this virus

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.670 
you can eat it and to craft this virus
breeder<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.360> need<00:04:54.540> eight<00:04:54.750> rotten<00:04:55.170> flesh<00:04:55.380> and

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
breeder you need eight rotten flesh and

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.400 
breeder you need eight rotten flesh and
a<00:04:56.340> basic<00:04:56.610> machine<00:04:56.880> block<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.990> craft<00:04:58.230> this

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
a basic machine block and to craft this

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.680 
a basic machine block and to craft this
decontaminate<00:04:59.310> er<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.610> need<00:04:59.790> wait<00:05:00.450> what<00:05:00.600> is

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
decontaminate er you need wait what is

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.950 
decontaminate er you need wait what is
it

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
it

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.710 
it
dig<00:05:01.230> contaminator<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:03.000> need<00:05:03.180> three<00:05:03.510> thick

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
dig contaminator you need three thick

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.930 
dig contaminator you need three thick
contaminate<00:05:04.560> is<00:05:04.680> okay<00:05:05.100> you<00:05:05.160> need<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.460> really

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
contaminate is okay you need to really

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.600 
contaminate is okay you need to really
reword<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:06.920> but<00:05:07.920> yeah<00:05:08.040> then<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.490> need

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
reword that but yeah then you just need

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.070 
reword that but yeah then you just need
six<00:05:08.880> iron<00:05:09.120> ingots<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.450> you're<00:05:09.720> good<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:10.050> go

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
six iron ingots and you're good to go

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.200 
six iron ingots and you're good to go
and<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:11.130> can<00:05:11.250> start<00:05:11.430> making<00:05:11.700> some<00:05:11.880> steaks<00:05:12.120> so

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
and you can start making some steaks so

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.690 
and you can start making some steaks so
you<00:05:12.270> can<00:05:12.390> eat<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.840> survive<00:05:13.460> over<00:05:14.460> here<00:05:14.610> we

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
you can eat and survive over here we

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.330 
you can eat and survive over here we
have<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.850> furnace<00:05:15.240> we<00:05:15.570> have<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:16.350> furnace<00:05:17.040> that<00:05:17.070> is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
have a furnace we have a furnace that is

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.220 
have a furnace we have a furnace that is
made<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.390> what<00:05:18.780> is<00:05:18.870> it

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
made of what is it

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.280 
made of what is it
let<00:05:19.770> me<00:05:19.860> see<00:05:20.010> eight<00:05:20.910> rotten<00:05:21.390> flesh<00:05:21.660> blocks<00:05:22.020> and

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
let me see eight rotten flesh blocks and

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.260 
let me see eight rotten flesh blocks and
a<00:05:22.560> furnace<00:05:22.890> and<00:05:23.040> it<00:05:23.580> doesn't<00:05:23.850> require<00:05:23.970> any

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
a furnace and it doesn't require any

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.990 
a furnace and it doesn't require any
coal<00:05:24.600> so<00:05:24.990> that's<00:05:25.530> very<00:05:25.770> useful<00:05:25.920> and<00:05:26.520> then<00:05:26.910> we

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
coal so that's very useful and then we

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.420 
coal so that's very useful and then we
also<00:05:27.120> have<00:05:27.360> something<00:05:27.690> for<00:05:28.250> industrial<00:05:29.250> craft

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
also have something for industrial craft

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.560 
also have something for industrial craft
because<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:29.880> does<00:05:30.000> work<00:05:30.150> with<00:05:30.300> industrial

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
because it does work with industrial

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.440 
because it does work with industrial
craft<00:05:30.960> if<00:05:31.170> you<00:05:31.290> need<00:05:31.980> your<00:05:32.160> machine<00:05:32.460> needs<00:05:32.790> so

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
craft if you need your machine needs so

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.990 
craft if you need your machine needs so
over<00:05:33.660> here<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.380> craft<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:34.770> bad<00:05:34.920> boy<00:05:35.130> actually

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
over here to craft this bad boy actually

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.760 
over here to craft this bad boy actually
what<00:05:36.270> it<00:05:36.360> does<00:05:36.510> is<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:37.080> put<00:05:37.110> one<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:37.410> flush<00:05:37.650> in

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
what it does is you put one a flush in

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.560 
what it does is you put one a flush in
there<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:38.070> it<00:05:38.310> will<00:05:38.400> disperse<00:05:38.700> energy<00:05:38.970> which

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
there and it will disperse energy which

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.050 
there and it will disperse energy which
is<00:05:39.720> pretty<00:05:39.960> cool<00:05:40.230> you<00:05:41.160> just<00:05:41.310> need<00:05:41.430> six<00:05:41.880> one

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
is pretty cool you just need six one

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.290 
is pretty cool you just need six one
flush<00:05:42.960> blocks<00:05:43.260> two<00:05:43.890> electronic<00:05:44.700> circuits<00:05:45.090> and

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
flush blocks two electronic circuits and

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.690 
flush blocks two electronic circuits and
then<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:45.960> fermenting<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.710> furnace<00:05:47.070> which<00:05:47.370> is<00:05:47.550> the

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
then a fermenting a furnace which is the

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.760 
then a fermenting a furnace which is the
thing<00:05:47.850> over<00:05:47.970> here<00:05:48.240> but<00:05:49.080> let's<00:05:49.260> head<00:05:49.380> up<00:05:49.500> top

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
thing over here but let's head up top

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.010 
thing over here but let's head up top
because<00:05:50.070> let's<00:05:51.000> get<00:05:51.120> out<00:05:51.210> GM<00:05:51.510> -<00:05:51.660> let's<00:05:51.870> try<00:05:51.960> to

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
because let's get out GM - let's try to

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.950 
because let's get out GM - let's try to
fight<00:05:52.590> this<00:05:52.710> virus<00:05:53.100> here<00:05:53.310> let's<00:05:54.090> try<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.330> save

decontaminated<00:06:10.350> tree<00:06:10.650> this<00:06:11.520> is<00:06:11.580> so<00:06:11.910> epic

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
decontaminated tree this is so epic

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.810 
decontaminated tree this is so epic
all<00:06:13.260> this<00:06:13.350> time<00:06:13.500> says<00:06:13.740> zero<00:06:13.980> and<00:06:14.310> let's

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
all this time says zero and let's

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.150 
all this time says zero and let's
actually<00:06:14.880> take<00:06:15.120> a<00:06:15.180> look<00:06:15.270> here<00:06:15.650> above<00:06:16.650> get<00:06:17.100> an

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
actually take a look here above get an

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.490 
actually take a look here above get an
aerial<00:06:17.520> view<00:06:17.550> if<00:06:18.360> I<00:06:18.450> can<00:06:18.600> type<00:06:18.780> in<00:06:18.900> GM<00:06:19.640> this<00:06:20.640> is

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
aerial view if I can type in GM this is

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.540 
aerial view if I can type in GM this is
epic<00:06:22.500> I'm<00:06:22.830> going<00:06:23.040> to<00:06:23.100> wait<00:06:23.220> a<00:06:23.250> few<00:06:23.460> more

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
epic I'm going to wait a few more

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.730 
epic I'm going to wait a few more
minutes<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:23.970> see<00:06:24.419> like<00:06:24.720> what<00:06:25.169> it<00:06:25.260> does<00:06:25.470> and

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
minutes and see like what it does and

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.350 
minutes and see like what it does and
like<00:06:26.250> how<00:06:26.430> fast<00:06:26.669> it<00:06:26.910> spreads

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
like how fast it spreads

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.970 
like how fast it spreads
I<00:06:27.390> guess<00:06:27.840> we're<00:06:28.050> waiting<00:06:28.290> about<00:06:28.380> five<00:06:28.770> more

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
I guess we're waiting about five more

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.520 
I guess we're waiting about five more
minutes<00:06:29.160> and<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:30.210> is<00:06:30.270> just<00:06:30.630> going<00:06:30.750> crazy<00:06:31.200> I

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
minutes and it is just going crazy I

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.980 
minutes and it is just going crazy I
cannot<00:06:31.950> wait<00:06:32.280> to<00:06:32.430> use<00:06:32.550> this<00:06:32.760> against<00:06:33.090> you<00:06:33.270> so

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
cannot wait to use this against you so

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.659 
cannot wait to use this against you so
let's<00:06:34.110> hit<00:06:34.169> the<00:06:34.290> three<00:06:34.470> thousand<00:06:34.770> likes<00:06:34.919> and<00:06:35.130> I

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
let's hit the three thousand likes and I

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.450 
let's hit the three thousand likes and I
could<00:06:35.820> attempt<00:06:36.300> to<00:06:36.560> troll<00:06:37.560> Gio<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:38.010> think<00:06:38.340> we

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
could attempt to troll Gio I think we

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.600 
could attempt to troll Gio I think we
can<00:06:38.580> do<00:06:38.730> it<00:06:38.870> this<00:06:39.870> is<00:06:40.080> so<00:06:40.290> epic<00:06:40.530> I<00:06:40.919> could<00:06:41.520> be

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
can do it this is so epic I could be

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.620
