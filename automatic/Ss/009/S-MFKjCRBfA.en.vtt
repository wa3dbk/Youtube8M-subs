00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
but it's not like amazing where it's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
but it's not like amazing where it's
like<00:01:30.810> really<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.259> shines<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
what it is it's like I think this is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.700 
what it is it's like I think this is
about<00:01:35.189> 999<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.150> thought<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.680> good

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
about 999 but thought it is it's so good

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.140 
about 999 but thought it is it's so good

have always had this brush for like a
long<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> year<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.990> think<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.470> some

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
long time of the year I think of some

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.350

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
really use it much easier for a powder

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.080 
really use it much easier for a powder
because<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.979> didn't<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.579> think<00:01:53.909> it

brush it's so good

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.270 
brush it's so good
like<00:02:14.409> initially<00:02:15.409> like<00:02:15.650> blender<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.129> end

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
like initially like blender in the end

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.729 
like initially like blender in the end
and<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.549> looks<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.269> thin<00:02:17.749> but<00:02:18.530> then<00:02:18.650> it

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
and it looks so like thin but then it

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.929 
and it looks so like thin but then it
gives<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.099> like<00:02:19.219> really<00:02:19.430> full-coverage<00:02:19.609> I
