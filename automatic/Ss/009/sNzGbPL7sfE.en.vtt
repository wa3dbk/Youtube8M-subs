00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
you want its reverse sorry first world

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.290 
you want its reverse sorry first world
turn<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:52.230> off<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.890> scroll<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:54.030> reverse<00:03:56.300> but

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
turn is is off and scroll is reverse but

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.980 
turn is is off and scroll is reverse but
this<00:03:57.480> does<00:03:57.840> work<00:03:57.870> very<00:03:58.230> well<00:03:58.800> oh<00:03:59.540> I<00:04:00.540> have<00:04:00.780> not

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
this does work very well oh I have not

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.380 
this does work very well oh I have not
had<00:04:01.140> like<00:04:01.440> any<00:04:01.740> problems<00:04:02.220> with<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.460> if<00:04:03.180> you're

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
had like any problems with it if you're

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.690 
had like any problems with it if you're
wrong<00:04:03.600> sets<00:04:03.930> broken<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.860> course<00:04:05.100> it's<00:04:05.460> going

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
wrong sets broken of course it's going

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
wrong sets broken of course it's going
to<00:04:05.760> be<00:04:05.850> broken<00:04:06.210> in<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:06.480> too

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.030 

this<00:04:57.720> is<00:04:57.900> basically<00:04:58.850> all<00:04:59.850> there<00:05:00.120> is<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.690> it

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
this is basically all there is to it

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.970 
this is basically all there is to it
there<00:05:02.040> are<00:05:02.160> some<00:05:02.400> stuff<00:05:03.150> I<00:05:03.540> guess<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.860> can

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
there are some stuff I guess you can

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:14.260 
there are some stuff I guess you can
gotta<00:05:05.160> do<00:05:05.340> some<00:05:05.490> really<00:05:05.670> crazy<00:05:05.970> stuff<00:05:06.210> Daniel

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:40.550 

that's<00:05:15.270> all<00:05:15.510> over<00:05:15.750> your<00:05:15.900> choice

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.059 

you<00:05:41.560> can<00:05:41.740> get<00:05:41.919> stepmania<00:05:43.800> basically<00:05:44.800> from

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
you can get stepmania basically from

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:51.120 
you can get stepmania basically from
stepmania<00:05:45.520> calm<00:05:48.389> but<00:05:49.389> that's<00:05:50.319> basically<00:05:50.590> just

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
stepmania calm but that's basically just

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:58.409 
stepmania calm but that's basically just
the<00:05:51.280> mechanics<00:05:51.400> of<00:05:51.970> this<00:05:54.720> so<00:05:57.000> that's<00:05:58.000> all

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
the mechanics of this so that's all

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:08.219 
the mechanics of this so that's all
there<00:05:58.630> is<00:05:58.660> to<00:05:59.580> do<00:06:00.580> about<00:06:00.819> this<00:06:01.979> so<00:06:03.900> yeah<00:06:07.199> try<00:06:08.199> it

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
there is to do about this so yeah try it

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.409 
there is to do about this so yeah try it
if<00:06:08.440> you<00:06:08.560> want<00:06:08.800> it<00:06:09.360> is<00:06:10.770> it's<00:06:11.770> not<00:06:12.250> too<00:06:12.909> hard<00:06:13.210> to

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
if you want it is it's not too hard to

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.939 
if you want it is it's not too hard to
get<00:06:14.139> used<00:06:14.349> to<00:06:15.750> you<00:06:16.750> could<00:06:16.960> try<00:06:17.229> different

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
get used to you could try different

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.850 
get used to you could try different
effects<00:06:18.400> to<00:06:18.610> see<00:06:18.849> if<00:06:18.909> you<00:06:19.030> like<00:06:19.210> them<00:06:19.389> better

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
effects to see if you like them better

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.920 
effects to see if you like them better
but<00:06:20.860> if<00:06:21.099> you<00:06:21.580> want<00:06:21.759> it<00:06:21.880> like<00:06:22.000> rock<00:06:22.300> band<00:06:22.630> then

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
but if you want it like rock band then

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.260 
but if you want it like rock band then
just<00:06:23.530> set<00:06:24.400> it<00:06:24.430> on<00:06:24.610> a<00:06:24.669> reverse<00:06:26.729> and<00:06:27.729> that's

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
just set it on a reverse and that's

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.409 
just set it on a reverse and that's
basically<00:06:28.599> all<00:06:28.870> you<00:06:29.080> got<00:06:29.199> to<00:06:29.289> do
