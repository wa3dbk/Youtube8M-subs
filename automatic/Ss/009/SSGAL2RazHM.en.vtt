for so many reasons and I'm just gonna
go<00:00:43.050> through<00:00:43.379> why<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.160> white<00:00:44.670> potato<00:00:45.440> get<00:00:46.440> such

a<00:00:46.710> bad<00:00:47.010> rap<00:00:47.329> but<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
a bad rap but actually it's one of the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
a bad rap but actually it's one of the
healthiest<00:00:50.789> foods<00:00:51.210> white<00:00:51.809> potatoes

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
healthiest foods white potatoes

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.160 
healthiest foods white potatoes
basically<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.550> bad<00:00:53.789> rap<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.360> they're

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
basically go bad rap because they're

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.549 
basically go bad rap because they're
high<00:00:55.410> glycemic<00:00:55.860> index<00:00:56.579> carbs<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
high glycemic index carbs so what that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.990 
high glycemic index carbs so what that
means<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> they<00:00:59.399> raise<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.820> blood

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
means is that they raise your blood

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
means is that they raise your blood
sugar<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.260> don't<00:01:01.410> tell<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
sugar but what they don't tell you is

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.039 
sugar but what they don't tell you is
that<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.820> blood<00:01:03.090> sugar<00:01:03.359> actually<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that that blood sugar actually get to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.399 
that that blood sugar actually get to
see<00:01:04.199> yourselves<00:01:04.559> very<00:01:04.710> quickly<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.409> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
see yourselves very quickly so the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
see yourselves very quickly so the
actual<00:01:07.740> overall<00:01:08.640> effect<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> good<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
actual overall effect is a good one the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750 
actual overall effect is a good one the
other<00:01:10.080> reason<00:01:10.260> potatoes<00:01:11.189> tend<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> bad

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
other reason potatoes tend to get a bad

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.179 
other reason potatoes tend to get a bad
rap<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.680> people<00:01:13.680> associated

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
rap is because people associated

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.999 
rap is because people associated
potatoes<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.790> fried<00:01:15.119> potatoes<00:01:15.470> fried<00:01:16.470> in

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
potatoes with fried potatoes fried in

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.300 
potatoes with fried potatoes fried in
oil<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.110> they<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.470> 50%<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
oil and they can have 50% of the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.929 
oil and they can have 50% of the
calories<00:01:20.700> coming<00:01:20.939> from<00:01:21.180> fat<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.140> actually

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
calories coming from fat but actually

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.620 
calories coming from fat but actually
potatoes<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.979> low<00:01:26.280> fat<00:01:26.610> food<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.180> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
potatoes are a very low fat food and in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.950 
potatoes are a very low fat food and in
fact<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:29.270> 0.2<00:01:30.270> grams<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.780> saturated

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
fact they have 0.2 grams of saturated

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.399 
fact they have 0.2 grams of saturated
fat<00:01:31.650> per<00:01:32.000> hundred<00:01:33.000> grams<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> would

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
fat per hundred grams so if you would

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.550 
fat per hundred grams so if you would
eat<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.799> kilo<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.250> potatoes<00:01:35.579> say<00:01:36.420> 2<00:01:36.930> grams<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
eat a kilo of potatoes say 2 grams of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.390 
eat a kilo of potatoes say 2 grams of
saturated<00:01:37.799> fat<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> day<00:01:38.970> which<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:39.960> crazy

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
saturated fat for the day which is crazy

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.090 
saturated fat for the day which is crazy
a<00:01:41.400> lot<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.079> were<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> put<00:01:43.500> oil<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.950> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a lot of if you were to put oil in that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.310 
a lot of if you were to put oil in that
of<00:01:44.250> course<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.640> finish<00:01:45.509> from<00:01:45.659> fat<00:01:45.899> will<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.200> up

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
of course the finish from fat will go up

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.260 
of course the finish from fat will go up
in<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.590> saturated<00:01:47.100> fat<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.399> go<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.640> but

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
in your saturated fat would go up but

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840 
in your saturated fat would go up but
the<00:01:48.390> potato<00:01:48.750> itself<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> baked<00:01:49.979> potato<00:01:50.189> or

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the potato itself like a baked potato or

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210 
the potato itself like a baked potato or
steamed<00:01:51.630> potato<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.619> very<00:01:52.920> healthy

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
steamed potato is actually very healthy

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.950 
steamed potato is actually very healthy
so<00:01:53.759> that's<00:01:53.939> why<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.270> bad<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:54.750> why<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
so that's why it's bad that's why it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
so that's why it's bad that's why it
gets<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> bad<00:01:55.439> rap<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> has<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> high<00:01:56.430> GI<00:01:56.729> of

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
gets a bad rap it has a high GI of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.280 
gets a bad rap it has a high GI of
potatoes<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> best<00:01:58.770> sources<00:01:59.549> of

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
potatoes are one of the best sources of

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.740 
potatoes are one of the best sources of
potassium<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.360> actually<00:02:03.439> 99%<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
potassium and actually 99% of the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.490 
potassium and actually 99% of the
American<00:02:07.009> population<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.989> testing<00:02:09.989> deficient

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
American population is testing deficient

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.070 
American population is testing deficient
so<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> cut<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.760> staple<00:02:12.690> food<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
so to cut out a staple food that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.650 
so to cut out a staple food that
provides<00:02:13.410> a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
provides a

very<00:03:52.510> high<00:03:52.750> association<00:03:53.590> factor<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.700> that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
very high association factor so that

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.360 
very high association factor so that

highest satiating foods so basically

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.990 
highest satiating foods so basically
that<00:04:01.270> means<00:04:01.570> that<00:04:01.900> they<00:04:02.080> keep<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.470> fuller

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
that means that they keep you fuller

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.180 
that means that they keep you fuller
than<00:04:04.000> many<00:04:04.270> other<00:04:04.540> foods<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.590> they're<00:04:06.040> even

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
than many other foods so they're even

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.340 
than many other foods so they're even
more<00:04:06.459> filling<00:04:06.910> than<00:04:06.940> oatmeal<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:07.989> instance

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
more filling than oatmeal for instance

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.830 
more filling than oatmeal for instance
which<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.580> second<00:04:09.970> highest<00:04:11.040> foods<00:04:12.040> like

which is the second highest foods like

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.300 
which is the second highest foods like
proteins<00:04:13.840> cheeses<00:04:15.900> fruits<00:04:16.900> even<00:04:17.410> don't<00:04:18.220> even

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
proteins cheeses fruits even don't even

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.060 
proteins cheeses fruits even don't even
come<00:04:18.730> close<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.140> power<00:04:20.410> for<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.650> potato

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
come close to the power for the potato

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.640

glucose<00:06:01.840> metabolism<00:06:02.729> so<00:06:03.729> all<00:06:04.600> in<00:06:04.750> all<00:06:04.840> I<00:06:05.080> think

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
glucose metabolism so all in all I think

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.409 
glucose metabolism so all in all I think
it's<00:06:05.590> just<00:06:05.680> a<00:06:05.830> crazy<00:06:06.100> thing<00:06:07.000> that<00:06:07.150> Michelle
