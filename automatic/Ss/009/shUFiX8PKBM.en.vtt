come<00:01:54.099> to<00:01:54.219> your<00:01:54.340> swarm<00:01:54.639> trap<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.209> install

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
come to your swarm trap and install

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.929 
come to your swarm trap and install
themselves<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:57.189> you<00:01:57.340> take<00:01:57.520> them<00:01:57.700> out<00:01:57.819> of<00:01:57.849> the

themselves then you take them out of the

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.639 
themselves then you take them out of the
swarm<00:01:58.149> trap<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.689> put<00:01:58.929> them<00:01:59.079> into<00:01:59.319> your<00:01:59.409> own

to<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.659> hive<00:02:34.140> there's<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.159> lot<00:02:35.610> more<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
to your hive there's a lot more to it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.300 
to your hive there's a lot more to it
even<00:02:36.420> beyond<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:36.659> but<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.560> cover<00:02:37.890> all<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.069> in

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
even beyond that but I cover all that in

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.569 
even beyond that but I cover all that in
the<00:02:38.370> book<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:38.700> don't<00:02:38.879> worry<00:02:39.799> now<00:02:40.799> I<00:02:40.829> have<00:02:41.190> spent

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
the book so don't worry now I have spent

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.660 
the book so don't worry now I have spent
a<00:02:41.730> lot<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.540> time<00:02:42.780> researching<00:02:43.560> swarm<00:02:44.220> trapping

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
a lot of time researching swarm trapping

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.690 
a lot of time researching swarm trapping
and<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:45.629> spent<00:02:46.049> several<00:02:46.470> years<00:02:46.700> experimenting

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and I spent several years experimenting

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.170 
and I spent several years experimenting
and<00:02:49.010> old-timers<00:02:50.010> used<00:02:50.159> to<00:02:50.340> use<00:02:50.519> swarm<00:02:50.879> traps

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
and old-timers used to use swarm traps

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.110 
and old-timers used to use swarm traps
and<00:02:51.420> bait<00:02:51.450> hives<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.079> catch<00:02:52.290> their<00:02:52.560> freebies

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
and bait hives to catch their freebies

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.970 
and bait hives to catch their freebies
but<00:02:54.120> some<00:02:54.420> modern<00:02:54.959> advances<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.769> our

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
but some modern advances in our

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.449 
but some modern advances in our
understanding<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.700> bee<00:02:57.299> swarm<00:02:57.840> behavior<00:02:58.459> has

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
understanding of bee swarm behavior has

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.759 
understanding of bee swarm behavior has
now<00:02:59.819> made<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.209> revolution<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.019> swarm<00:03:01.319> traffic

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
now made a revolution in swarm traffic

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.089 
now made a revolution in swarm traffic
and<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.940> mean<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.359> doubled<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.170> almost<00:03:04.470> tripled

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
and I mean it doubled to almost tripled

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.640 
and I mean it doubled to almost tripled
the<00:03:05.400> occupancy<00:03:06.030> rate<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:07.079> swarm<00:03:07.379> trap

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
the occupancy rate of a swarm trap

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
the occupancy rate of a swarm trap
versus<00:03:08.250> days<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.670> old<00:03:09.680> now<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.709> cover<00:03:11.159> this<00:03:11.430> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
versus days of old now I cover this and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.660 
versus days of old now I cover this and
the<00:03:12.269> research<00:03:12.599> done<00:03:12.870> by<00:03:13.069> dr.<00:03:14.069> Seeley<00:03:14.430> and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the research done by dr. Seeley and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.460 
the research done by dr. Seeley and
other<00:03:14.970> researchers<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.900> put<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.319> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
other researchers and I put it and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.069 
other researchers and I put it and
applied<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:17.099> in<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:18.180> book<00:03:18.389> so<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.750> don't<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
applied it in the book so you don't the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.289 
applied it in the book so you don't the
look<00:03:19.260> at<00:03:19.440> theory<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.099> wonder<00:03:20.730> how<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:20.909> use<00:03:21.120> it

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
look at theory and wonder how to use it

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.449 
look at theory and wonder how to use it
already<00:03:22.079> been<00:03:22.230> done<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.680> swarm<00:03:23.040> trapping

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.610 
design and in the swarm trapping program
I've<00:03:26.639> had<00:03:27.060> wonderful<00:03:27.629> success<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.410> recent

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
I've had wonderful success in recent

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.629 
I've had wonderful success in recent
years<00:03:28.859> both<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:30.199> good<00:03:31.199> years<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.799> in<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
years both in good years and in the

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.400 
years both in good years and in the
terrible<00:03:33.090> drought<00:03:33.329> year<00:03:33.629> we<00:03:33.780> had<00:03:33.989> last<00:03:34.169> year

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
terrible drought year we had last year

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.729 
terrible drought year we had last year
and<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.370> caught<00:03:35.639> bees<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.150> all<00:03:36.419> years<00:03:36.810> swarm

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and I caught bees in all years swarm

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.610 
and I caught bees in all years swarm
trapping<00:03:38.280> works<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:39.269> works<00:03:39.540> for<00:03:39.840> me<00:03:39.989> it'll

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
trapping works it works for me it'll

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.789 
trapping works it works for me it'll
work<00:03:40.919> for<00:03:41.129> you<00:03:41.280> it's<00:03:41.910> almost<00:03:42.419> a<00:03:42.720> sport<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.500> and

work for you it's almost a sport in and
of<00:03:43.919> itself<00:03:44.129> I<00:03:44.730> mean<00:03:45.569> it's<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:45.900> fishing<00:03:46.199> it's

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
of itself I mean it's like fishing it's
