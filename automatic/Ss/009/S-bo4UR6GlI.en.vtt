00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
lipstick it kind of has a tendency to
bleed<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.390> sure<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.780> you

have<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> solid<00:00:37.440> base<00:00:38.010> underneath<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
have a solid base underneath it so it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.670

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.449 
me crazy and now we're going to go in
with<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> red<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.439> so<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.980> red<00:02:29.189> and<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
with a red and so the red and the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.520 
with a red and so the red and the
burgundy<00:02:29.879> lip<00:02:30.060> liner<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.659> give<00:02:31.290> us<00:02:31.409> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
burgundy lip liner is going to give us a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:41.300 
burgundy lip liner is going to give us a
really<00:02:31.709> nice<00:02:32.599> colored<00:02:33.599> lipstick<00:02:40.189> so<00:02:41.189> I'm

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
really nice colored lipstick so I'm

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.679 
really nice colored lipstick so I'm
using<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.639> lip<00:02:41.849> brush<00:02:41.969> because<00:02:42.269> it's<00:02:42.510> just

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
using a lip brush because it's just

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.949 
using a lip brush because it's just
easier<00:02:43.169> to<00:02:43.290> control<00:02:44.480> red<00:02:45.480> lipstick

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
easier to control red lipstick

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.839 
easier to control red lipstick
application<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:47.129> a<00:02:47.400> lip<00:02:48.239> brush<00:02:48.450> instead<00:02:49.260> of

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
application with a lip brush instead of

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.110 
application with a lip brush instead of
the<00:02:50.900> actual<00:02:51.900> stick<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:53.310> kind<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.639> hard<00:02:53.849> to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the actual stick it's kind of hard to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.909 
the actual stick it's kind of hard to
use<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.540> stick<00:02:54.750> because<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.109> could<00:02:55.260> go<00:02:55.379> out<00:02:55.590> of

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
use the stick because it could go out of

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.709 
use the stick because it could go out of
the<00:02:56.099> lines<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.699> then<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:56.909> hard<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.150> fix<00:02:57.419> it

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
the lines and then it's hard to fix it

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.170 
the lines and then it's hard to fix it
and<00:02:58.129> so<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.219> want<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.430> start<00:02:59.699> with<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.939> inner

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and so you want to start with the inner

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.449 
and so you want to start with the inner
part<00:03:00.599> of<00:03:00.689> the<00:03:00.750> lips<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.199> work<00:03:01.500> your<00:03:01.709> way<00:03:01.769> out

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.800 

start<00:03:08.459> with<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.699> inner<00:03:08.849> part<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.419> open<00:03:09.689> your

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
start with the inner part and open your

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.689 
start with the inner part and open your
mouth<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> little<00:03:10.230> bit<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.650> don't<00:03:11.430> forget

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:11.699 
mouth a little bit and don't forget

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:17.170 
mouth a little bit and don't forget
those<00:03:11.939> corners<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.689> there<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:15.530> if<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.650> smudge

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
those corners in there and if you smudge

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.939 
those corners in there and if you smudge
outside<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.509> lips<00:03:18.720> at<00:03:18.959> all<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:19.620> can<00:03:19.769> take

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
outside of the lips at all you can take

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:25.219 
outside of the lips at all you can take
a<00:03:19.979> q-tip<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.759> just<00:03:20.970> wipe<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.900> off<00:03:22.759> or<00:03:24.229> makeup

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
on the edge then that kind of helps keep
