now it's not confirmed but I think
everyone<00:00:37.260> feels<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.980> very<00:00:38.250> very

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
everyone feels that it's a very very

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.729

strong<00:00:38.780> possibility<00:00:39.780> i<00:00:40.260> think<00:00:40.469> everyone

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
strong possibility i think everyone

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.350 
strong possibility i think everyone
would<00:00:40.800> fed<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.399> say<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:41.879> kind<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> been

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
would fed to say it's just kind of been

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990 
would fed to say it's just kind of been
you<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.230> unconfirmed<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.820> know

you know it's unconfirmed but you know
it<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:46.170> basically<00:00:46.410> there<00:00:47.160> I'm<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.180> sort

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
it it's basically there I'm really sort

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.580

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
of thinking about what this is going to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799

think it's me great to have just that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.240 
think it's me great to have just that
general<00:00:54.270> level<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.629> consistency<00:00:55.079> across<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
general level of consistency across the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
general level of consistency across the
whole<00:00:56.430> board<00:00:56.690> something<00:00:57.690> that's<00:00:57.809> been

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
whole board something that's been

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.650 
whole board something that's been
regularly<00:00:58.350> stated<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.070> me<00:00:59.270> not<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.420> time

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660

general media is going to be so much
more<00:01:26.610> consistent<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.540> means<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.869> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
more consistent which means that it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.170 
more consistent which means that it
means<00:01:28.229> everybody<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.310> enjoy<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.759> across<00:01:30.119> the

really<00:01:36.659> excellent<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.979> fact<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
really excellent is the fact that the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.700 
really excellent is the fact that the
new<00:01:39.000> consoles<00:01:39.540> both<00:01:39.930> laughing<00:01:40.170> xbox<00:01:40.560> and

within<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.630> whole<00:02:26.870> area<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.560> I've<00:02:27.770> got<00:02:27.920> to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
within that whole area and I've got to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.010 
within that whole area and I've got to
tell<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.670> know<00:02:28.790> I've<00:02:29.330> said<00:02:29.630> before<00:02:29.690> I

used to be a call of duty player it's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.740 
used to be a call of duty player it's
obvious<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.000> you've<00:02:32.210> got<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.390> compare<00:02:32.720> that

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
obvious that you've got to compare that

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.630 
obvious that you've got to compare that
really<00:02:33.290> because<00:02:33.800> they're<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.100> two<00:02:34.340> major

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
really because they're the two major

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.060 
really because they're the two major
players<00:02:35.150> within<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.350> sort<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.590> arena<00:02:36.920> a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
players within that sort of arena a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.580 
players within that sort of arena a
first-person<00:02:37.850> shooter<00:02:38.360> for<00:02:38.600> consoles<00:02:39.200> anyway

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
first-person shooter for consoles anyway

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.650 
first-person shooter for consoles anyway
obviously<00:02:40.460> there's<00:02:40.610> other<00:02:40.760> titles<00:02:41.210> floating

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
obviously there's other titles floating

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.750 
obviously there's other titles floating
around<00:02:41.780> which<00:02:42.170> refer<00:02:42.740> specifically<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.310> PC

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
around which refer specifically to PC

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.130 
around which refer specifically to PC
but<00:02:43.910> again<00:02:44.120> when<00:02:44.300> we're<00:02:44.420> thinking<00:02:44.750> about<00:02:44.960> next

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
but again when we're thinking about next

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.270 
but again when we're thinking about next
generation<00:02:45.590> consoles<00:02:46.010> they<00:02:46.070> don't<00:02:46.190> really

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
generation consoles they don't really

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.700 
generation consoles they don't really
come<00:02:46.490> into<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.790> fray<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.410> but<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.620> know

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
come into the fray and but you know

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.890 
come into the fray and but you know
battlefield<00:02:49.040> continues<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.760> grow<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.270> it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
battlefield continues to grow and it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.630 
battlefield continues to grow and it
sort<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.200> builds<00:02:51.440> on<00:02:51.830> what<00:02:51.890> has<00:02:52.190> already<00:02:52.340> been

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
sort of builds on what has already been

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.700 
sort of builds on what has already been
there<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.060> think<00:02:53.270> that's<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.510> good<00:02:53.750> lesson<00:02:54.410> as

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
there I think that's a good lesson as

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.320 
there I think that's a good lesson as
well<00:02:54.740> throughout<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.760> whole<00:02:55.940> series<00:02:56.180> of

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
well throughout the whole series of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330 
well throughout the whole series of
battlefield<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.020> that<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.500> always<00:02:57.680> has<00:02:58.040> grown

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
battlefield is that it always has grown

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.100 
battlefield is that it always has grown
built<00:02:58.820> strongly<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.660> what<00:02:59.750> was<00:02:59.900> already

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
built strongly and what was already

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.070 
built strongly and what was already
there<00:03:00.320> unlike<00:03:01.310> some<00:03:01.520> others<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.630> say<00:03:02.900> not

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
there unlike some others and I say not

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.600 
there unlike some others and I say not
specific<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.530> any<00:03:03.650> one<00:03:03.950> there's<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.400> lot<00:03:04.580> of

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
specific to any one there's a lot of

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.670 
specific to any one there's a lot of
series<00:03:05.030> which<00:03:05.180> often<00:03:05.480> don't<00:03:05.660> do<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.380> I'm<00:03:06.500> not

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
series which often don't do and I'm not

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.370 
talking specifically about first-person
shooters<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.540> either<00:03:08.690> there's<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.200> lot<00:03:09.350> of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
shooters here either there's a lot of

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.230 
shooters here either there's a lot of
series<00:03:09.830> in<00:03:09.980> general<00:03:10.190> which<00:03:10.790> maybe<00:03:10.970> don't

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
series in general which maybe don't

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.430 
series in general which maybe don't
really<00:03:11.420> build<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.810> best<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.230> what<00:03:12.320> they

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
really build the best of what they

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.800 
really build the best of what they
already<00:03:12.560> had<00:03:12.860> they<00:03:13.040> sort<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.370> they<00:03:14.210> rehash

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
already had they sort of they rehash

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.260 
already had they sort of they rehash
rather<00:03:15.620> than<00:03:15.860> actually<00:03:16.280> sort<00:03:16.550> of<00:03:16.610> objectively

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
rather than actually sort of objectively

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.180 
rather than actually sort of objectively
build<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.840> what<00:03:17.989> they<00:03:18.080> had<00:03:18.320> there<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.770> think

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
build on what they had there I think

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.010 
build on what they had there I think
battlefield<00:03:19.670> really<00:03:19.910> do<00:03:20.120> build<00:03:20.720> on<00:03:20.840> what<00:03:20.930> they

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
battlefield really do build on what they

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.120 
battlefield really do build on what they
have<00:03:21.170> there<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:21.440> another<00:03:21.620> reason<00:03:21.830> why<00:03:22.070> I'm

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
have there it's another reason why I'm

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.590 
have there it's another reason why I'm
not<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.489> concerned<00:03:22.700> people<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.300> said<00:03:23.480> out

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
not so concerned people have said out

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.360 
not so concerned people have said out
while<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.140> Frostbite<00:03:24.500> 3<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.830> hasn't<00:03:25.130> really

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
while the Frostbite 3 it hasn't really

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.850 
while the Frostbite 3 it hasn't really
evolved<00:03:26.270> greatly<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:27.320> know<00:03:27.410> again<00:03:27.650> I

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
evolved greatly and you know again I

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.920 
evolved greatly and you know again I
think<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.459> be<00:03:28.640> kind<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.930> open-minded

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
think you have to be kind of open-minded

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.180 
think you have to be kind of open-minded
and<00:03:30.020> objective<00:03:30.470> there<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.800> sort<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:30.980> think

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
and objective there and sort of think

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.830 
and objective there and sort of think
well<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.489> know<00:03:31.520> they<00:03:31.850> can't<00:03:32.120> completely

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
well you know they can't completely

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.620 
well you know they can't completely
evolve<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.920> entire<00:03:34.430> engine<00:03:34.880> every<00:03:35.270> single

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
evolve the entire engine every single

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.780 
evolve the entire engine every single
time<00:03:35.870> but<00:03:36.739> from<00:03:36.890> what<00:03:37.010> we've<00:03:37.190> seen<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.430> if<00:03:37.670> you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
consoles it's not just a case of making

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.920 
consoles it's not just a case of making
the<00:04:07.190> game<00:04:07.370> better<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:08.420> it's<00:04:08.540> making<00:04:08.690> it

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
the game better but it's making it

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.750 
the game better but it's making it
better<00:04:09.110> for<00:04:09.410> everyone<00:04:09.950> it's<00:04:10.250> building<00:04:10.670> that

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
better for everyone it's building that

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.820 
better for everyone it's building that
experience<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.840> means<00:04:11.989> that<00:04:12.140> people's

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
experience and it means that people's

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.720 
experience and it means that people's
experience<00:04:13.250> is<00:04:13.340> going<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.550> be<00:04:13.610> more

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730

comparable<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.810> know<00:04:14.930> console<00:04:15.320> players<00:04:15.440> will

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
comparable you know console players will

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.470 
comparable you know console players will
be<00:04:15.680> able<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:15.890> actually<00:04:16.040> now<00:04:16.400> talk<00:04:16.790> to<00:04:17.180> PC

players<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.930> have<00:04:18.169> comparable<00:04:18.680> experiences

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
players and have comparable experiences

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.650 
players and have comparable experiences
which<00:04:19.730> means<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.060> everybody<00:04:20.359> can<00:04:20.630> learn

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
which means that everybody can learn

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.779

overall I think it will help strengthen
the<00:04:24.650> community<00:04:24.830> because<00:04:25.430> I

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
the community because I

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.260 
the community because I

do feel like the battlefield community
has<00:04:28.450> slipped<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.960> slided<00:04:29.560> kind<00:04:30.250> of<00:04:30.340> here<00:04:30.520> and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700
