00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.140
 a lot has happened since then the first 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.040
 diesel in germany in a passenger car 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.779
 was built 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.550
 Let's take a look at what's modern 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.539
 They do and what in the future of the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.240
 this is waiting for us 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.930
 hammer as audi 25 years ago on the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.920
 iaa in frankfurt the audi 100 with a 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.650
 25 liters turbodiesel direct injection 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 and full electronic regulation from the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.970
 hat conjured the first tdi in the house audi 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 was born 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.110
 Now we are here from the beginnings 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.239
 the tdi at audi that's 25 years 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.089
 History of the car here is from 1989 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.659
 an audi 100 five-cylinder diesel with 120 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.449
 ps 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.220
 Now look how he almost drives 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.220
 it is a time travel if you are 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.989
 in the day tg place takes optics 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.970
 equipment and also driving behavior 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.790
 nothing more with modern self-igniters 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.019
 meant because the 140 of course completely 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.720
 unlike a modern car 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.000
 the diesel does not accelerate 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.350
 compare with a modern vehicle 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.720
 Interior noise is completely different 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.570
 hear this tractor still in front 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.150
 under the hood blanc but still one 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.450
 diesel needs little with 120 ps one was 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.100
 at the time good 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.930
 since then, the Ingolstadt have become natural 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.050
 not slept but this terror 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.520
 constantly tilled and expanded 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.140
 today are auto-ignition with the four 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.240
 wrestle a synonym for running culture 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.310
 sportiness and technological 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.800
 know-how at the highest level as it is 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.620
 example of the three-liter a7 sportback tdi 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.300
 competition is united when it comes to 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.100
 the current models at audi on the topic 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.350
 tdi works then this is almost like 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.310
 spearhead this is the new audi a7 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.110
 competition the vehicle has 326 hp 650 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.650
 newtonmeter and just consumes 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.170
 6.1 liters and when it comes to performance 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.000
 we are allowed to go audis a6 tdi concept 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.630
 electronic turbo not unmentioned 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.530
 let the a 6 tdi concept uses in the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.380
 principle the mono turbo engine v6 tdi us 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.340
 currently in the a7 in series goes with 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.620
 200 kw miss this 200 kw unit 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.810
 times a larger turbocharger with this 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.190
 bigger turbocharger no more power 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.260
 we can show more performance 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.110
 pose as you are in series today 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.519
 represent the biturbo aggregate 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.890
 but then combine around the turbo lag 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.180
 not so big downstairs so that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.620
 start the performance again 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.360
 balance an electric 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.040
 driven compressor with this 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.959
 Aggregate and thus have if you like that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.410
 want two charging components you 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.150
 combine a motor thanks to the way 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.100
 designed tourbus stands the sheer 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.019
 inexhaustible power even 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.310
 at low speeds, so to speak, from the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.049
 was available 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.220
 then let's see how ours 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.220
 new a6 concept accelerates 3 2 1 go 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.310
 70 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.810
 90 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.900
 100 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.330
 liter diesel already damn fast the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.360
 electric motor where helps the v6 tdi 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.209
 to stately 326 ps and one 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.020
 torque of up to 650 newton meters 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.340
 a driving experience of the extra class 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.290
 That was with this new turbocharger 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.060
 make fun of the vague concept 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.060
 much direct attack pulls off 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.099
 Immediately go through the power letter 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.170
 the way to today's tdi clean diesel 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.840
 was long but also impressive in 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.380
 his technological progress for 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.280
 in the past 25 years the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.170
 Pollutant emissions by 98 percent 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 be reduced while the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.400
 power and torque with respect to 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.040
 displacement doubles since the year 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.310
 2000 approves audis tdi family 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.810
 a third less fuel in 25 years 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.430
 history has happened a lot 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.569
 the cars of today are with those of 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.110
 then no longer at all 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.910
 to compare 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.630
 there is still a lot of new and on it are 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.630
 we are very excited
