perfectly<00:02:30.049> good<00:02:30.260> 50ml<00:02:30.860> lens<00:02:31.099> for<00:02:31.640> about<00:02:31.819> $100

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
perfectly good 50ml lens for about $100

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.119 
perfectly good 50ml lens for about $100
so<00:02:33.739> what<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.159> gain<00:02:34.400> from<00:02:34.909> a<00:02:34.970> prime<00:02:35.299> lens<00:02:35.599> a

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
so what you gain from a prime lens a

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.149 
so what you gain from a prime lens a
prime<00:02:37.129> lens<00:02:37.340> tends<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.180> have<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.390> wide<00:02:38.780> aperture

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
prime lens tends to have a wide aperture

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.449 
prime lens tends to have a wide aperture
maybe<00:02:40.159> f2f1<00:02:41.090> point<00:02:41.810> 8<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:43.010> gives<00:02:43.310> you

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
maybe f2f1 point 8 and that gives you

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.080 
maybe f2f1 point 8 and that gives you
that<00:02:43.849> beautiful<00:02:44.120> shallow<00:02:44.840> depth<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.440> focus

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
that beautiful shallow depth of focus

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.349 
that beautiful shallow depth of focus
lovely<00:02:47.090> blurry<00:02:47.390> background<00:02:48.069> very<00:02:49.069> nice<00:02:49.359> you

lovely blurry background very nice you

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.119 
lovely blurry background very nice you
also<00:02:50.390> get<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.780> sharpness<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.500> an<00:02:51.799> image

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
also get a sharpness and an image

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.849 
also get a sharpness and an image
quality<00:02:52.579> that<00:02:53.329> is<00:02:53.450> difficult<00:02:54.079> to<00:02:54.230> get<00:02:54.440> with

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
quality that is difficult to get with

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.940

the<00:02:54.980> zoom<00:02:55.220> lens<00:02:55.459> can<00:02:56.420> be<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.629> bit<00:02:56.870> subtle<00:02:57.319> but<00:02:57.829> as

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
the zoom lens can be a bit subtle but as

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.770 
the zoom lens can be a bit subtle but as
you<00:02:58.129> develop<00:02:58.549> as<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.670> photographer<00:02:59.329> you'll

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
you develop as a photographer you'll

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.470 
you develop as a photographer you'll
really<00:03:00.049> be<00:03:00.230> able<00:03:00.319> to<00:03:00.500> see<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.799> difference<00:03:01.480> 6

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
use the aperture sweet spot now if your

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.979 
use the aperture sweet spot now if your
lens<00:03:07.159> isn't<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.670> great<00:03:08.000> perhaps<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:08.900> a

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
lens isn't that great perhaps it's a

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.509 
lens isn't that great perhaps it's a

cheap zoom lens try using it between f/8

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
and f/11 now that's really the sweet

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.140 
and f/11 now that's really the sweet
spot<00:03:17.569> in<00:03:17.780> terms<00:03:18.079> of<00:03:18.260> sharpness<00:03:18.910> now<00:03:19.910> without

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
going into lens optics f/8 to f/11 it's

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.530 
going into lens optics f/8 to f/11 it's
sort<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.590> mid-range<00:03:25.579> of<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.150> aperture

sort of the mid-range of the aperture

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.599 
sort of the mid-range of the aperture
and<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.980> gives<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.519> really<00:03:29.209> sharp<00:03:29.870> shots<00:03:30.680> so

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
and it gives you really sharp shots so

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.390 
and it gives you really sharp shots so
if<00:03:31.730> your<00:03:31.849> lens<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.299> bit<00:03:32.450> soft<00:03:33.040> go<00:03:34.040> for<00:03:34.310> the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
if your lens is a bit soft go for the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.000 
if your lens is a bit soft go for the

most<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.609> images<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.000> love<00:03:41.329> particularly

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
most of the images I love particularly

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.770 
most of the images I love particularly
images<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.620> people<00:03:43.010> were<00:03:43.579> shot<00:03:43.910> close<00:03:44.449> to<00:03:44.660> the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
images of people were shot close to the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.710 
images of people were shot close to the
subject<00:03:45.260> if<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:46.069> photographer<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.790> close<00:03:47.090> the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
subject if the photographer is close the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.939 
subject if the photographer is close the
viewer<00:03:48.049> feels<00:03:48.680> close<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:50.650> 8

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949

don't<00:03:52.519> let<00:03:52.819> your<00:03:52.940> zoom<00:03:53.329> replace<00:03:53.959> your<00:03:54.169> legs

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
don't let your zoom replace your legs

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.369 
don't let your zoom replace your legs
now<00:03:55.549> your<00:03:55.699> decision<00:03:56.239> on<00:03:56.389> what<00:03:56.750> focal<00:03:57.230> length

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
now your decision on what focal length

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.710 
now your decision on what focal length
to<00:03:57.590> use<00:03:57.859> should<00:03:58.549> depend<00:03:58.940> on<00:03:59.090> what's<00:03:59.329> best<00:03:59.599> for

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
to use should depend on what's best for

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.369 
to use should depend on what's best for
the<00:03:59.840> shot

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
the shot

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.369 
the shot
so<00:04:01.069> don't<00:04:01.730> zoom<00:04:02.090> in<00:04:02.299> when<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.019> can<00:04:03.199> get<00:04:03.349> a

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
so don't zoom in when you can get a

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.869 
so don't zoom in when you can get a
better<00:04:03.650> shot<00:04:03.799> by<00:04:04.639> just<00:04:04.879> moving<00:04:05.359> closer<00:04:05.919> 9<00:04:06.919> get

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
better shot by just moving closer 9 get

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.530 
better shot by just moving closer 9 get
dirty<00:04:08.739> now<00:04:09.739> be<00:04:09.919> prepared<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.519> do<00:04:10.699> physically

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
whatever it takes to get the shot you

whatever it takes to get the shot you
want<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.930> might<00:04:15.260> mean<00:04:15.500> crawling<00:04:15.859> around<00:04:15.980> on

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
want it might mean crawling around on

want it might mean crawling around on
the<00:04:16.250> floor<00:04:16.340> might<00:04:17.239> mean<00:04:17.419> climbing<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.840> tree

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
the floor might mean climbing a tree

the floor might mean climbing a tree

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
deep in muddy water it was the only way

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.440 
deep in muddy water it was the only way
to<00:04:24.979> get<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.370> image<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.669> wanted

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
to get the image I wanted

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.360 
to get the image I wanted
and<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.960> was<00:04:27.080> also<00:04:27.230> really<00:04:27.560> fun<00:04:29.110> 10<00:04:30.370> organize

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
and it was also really fun 10 organize

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.210 
and it was also really fun 10 organize
your<00:04:31.640> archive<00:04:32.260> now<00:04:33.260> when<00:04:33.440> I<00:04:33.470> started<00:04:33.950> out<00:04:34.070> as<00:04:34.190> a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
your archive now when I started out as a

your archive now when I started out as a
photographer<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.150> was<00:04:35.780> very<00:04:35.990> impatient<00:04:36.350> all<00:04:36.950> I

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
photographer I was very impatient all I

photographer I was very impatient all I
wanted<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.460> do<00:04:37.700> was<00:04:37.970> go<00:04:38.180> out<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.540> shoot<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:39.650> I

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
wanted to do was go out and shoot so I

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.070 
wanted to do was go out and shoot so I
come<00:04:39.980> home<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.940> dump<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.690> photos
