bit sick of the gigabyte layout lately

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.990 
bit sick of the gigabyte layout lately
why<00:01:01.610> they<00:01:01.730> have<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.120> many<00:01:02.149> different<00:01:02.480> colors

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000

just hope this is not going to be

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.200 
just hope this is not going to be
another<00:01:27.310> strike<00:01:28.310> another<00:01:28.490> board<00:01:28.880> because

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
another strike another board because

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.179 
another strike another board because
it's<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.479> little<00:01:29.720> bit<00:01:29.810> too<00:01:29.960> fancy<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.530> wanted<00:01:31.100> a

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
it's a little bit too fancy I wanted a

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.760 
it's a little bit too fancy I wanted a
nice<00:01:31.340> cross<00:01:31.580> fire<00:01:31.850> system<00:01:32.180> at<00:01:32.299> nothing

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
nice cross fire system at nothing

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.170 
nice cross fire system at nothing
nothing<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:33.920> extravagant<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.759> mean<00:01:35.000> look<00:01:35.090> at

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
nothing this extravagant I mean look at

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.469 
nothing this extravagant I mean look at
that<00:01:35.360> is<00:01:36.110> if<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:36.380> need<00:01:36.560> water<00:01:36.710> cooling<00:01:37.070> on<00:01:37.220> my

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
that is if I need water cooling on my

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.370 
that is if I need water cooling on my
Northbridge<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:38.509> look<00:01:38.750> at<00:01:38.840> look<00:01:38.990> at<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.170> size

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
Northbridge and look at look at the size

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.980 
Northbridge and look at look at the size
of<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.560> barbs<00:01:39.830> anyway<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:40.549> small<00:01:40.990> we'd

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
of the barbs anyway this so small we'd

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.050 
of the barbs anyway this so small we'd
have<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.200> put<00:01:42.290> like<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.560> trap<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.060> thermaltake

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
have to put like a trap you thermaltake

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.340 
have to put like a trap you thermaltake
water<00:01:44.570> cooling<00:01:44.900> setup<00:01:45.079> on<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:47.170> I'll<00:01:48.170> just

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
water cooling setup on that I'll just

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.319 
water cooling setup on that I'll just
hope<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.740> reliable<00:01:49.189> motherboard<00:01:49.610> and

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
hope it's a reliable motherboard and

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.700 
hope it's a reliable motherboard and
i'll<00:01:50.479> probably<00:01:50.659> be<00:01:50.840> using<00:01:51.079> this<00:01:51.170> for<00:01:51.409> my<00:01:51.500> main

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
i'll probably be using this for my main

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.880 
i'll probably be using this for my main
computer<00:01:52.659> like<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:53.810> said<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.200> 780<00:01:54.650> died

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
computer like I said the 780 died

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.960 
computer like I said the 780 died
earlier<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:57.009> finally<00:01:58.009> got<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.340> packaging<00:01:58.820> up

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
earlier I finally got the packaging up

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.469 
earlier I finally got the packaging up
its<00:01:59.390> seriously<00:02:00.340> it's<00:02:01.340> packaged<00:02:01.790> very<00:02:02.060> similar

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
its seriously it's packaged very similar

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.600 
its seriously it's packaged very similar
to<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.689> striker<00:02:03.409> motherboard<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.399> also

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
to the striker motherboard which also

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.370 
to the striker motherboard which also
strikes<00:02:05.060> fear<00:02:05.299> into<00:02:05.450> my<00:02:05.659> heart<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.200> hope

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
strikes fear into my heart so I hope

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.610 
strikes fear into my heart so I hope
it's<00:02:06.560> nothing<00:02:06.740> like<00:02:07.070> that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.759 

yes<00:02:12.280> we<00:02:12.519> have<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:15.120> very<00:02:16.120> nice<00:02:16.360> layout<00:02:16.769> the

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
yes we have on this very nice layout the

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.699 
yes we have on this very nice layout the
heatsinks<00:02:18.220> going<00:02:18.430> right<00:02:18.610> around<00:02:18.730> there<00:02:19.709> we

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
heatsinks going right around there we

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.530
