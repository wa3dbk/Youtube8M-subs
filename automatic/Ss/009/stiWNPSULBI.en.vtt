00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:06.629 

okay<00:00:05.709> guys<00:00:05.830> we're<00:00:06.040> gonna<00:00:06.129> have<00:00:06.309> a<00:00:06.339> look<00:00:06.430> at<00:00:06.549> an

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:06.639 
okay guys we're gonna have a look at an

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.520 
okay guys we're gonna have a look at an
example<00:00:06.879> here<00:00:07.149> of<00:00:07.469> sex-linked<00:00:08.469> inheritance

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
example here of sex-linked inheritance

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.500 
example here of sex-linked inheritance
the<00:00:09.190> example<00:00:09.730> we're<00:00:09.849> gonna<00:00:09.940> have<00:00:10.119> a<00:00:10.150> look<00:00:10.269> at

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
the example we're gonna have a look at

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.820 
the example we're gonna have a look at
is<00:00:10.869> a<00:00:10.930> really<00:00:11.799> common<00:00:12.869> example<00:00:13.869> and<00:00:14.559> it's<00:00:14.680> for

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
is a really common example and it's for

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.800 
is a really common example and it's for
hemophilia<00:00:15.400> and<00:00:18.300> haemophilia<00:00:19.300> is<00:00:19.720> a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
hemophilia and haemophilia is a

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.700 
hemophilia and haemophilia is a
recessive<00:00:20.530> gene<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:24.570> dominant<00:00:25.570> gene<00:00:25.780> is

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
recessive gene and the dominant gene is

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.390 
recessive gene and the dominant gene is
the<00:00:27.310> normal<00:00:27.760> condition<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.830> just<00:00:29.980> so<00:00:30.070> happens

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
the normal condition it just so happens

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.950 
the normal condition it just so happens
that<00:00:30.430> this<00:00:30.699> gene<00:00:31.029> is<00:00:31.240> carried<00:00:31.720> on<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.869> X

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
that this gene is carried on the X

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.639 
that this gene is carried on the X
chromosome<00:00:32.619> so<00:00:32.980> you<00:00:33.640> can<00:00:33.789> imagine<00:00:34.390> if<00:00:35.199> we<00:00:35.440> draw

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
chromosome so you can imagine if we draw

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.700 
chromosome so you can imagine if we draw
the<00:00:35.760> chromosomes<00:00:36.760> here<00:00:37.149> this<00:00:38.079> is<00:00:38.260> that<00:00:38.559> the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
the chromosomes here this is that the

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.590 
the chromosomes here this is that the
female<00:00:39.159> x<00:00:39.729> chromosome<00:00:40.479> and<00:00:42.149> next<00:00:43.149> up<00:00:43.269> we<00:00:43.420> might

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
female x chromosome and next up we might

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.910 
female x chromosome and next up we might
just<00:00:43.690> draw<00:00:43.899> it<00:00:43.960> while<00:00:44.199> we<00:00:44.379> have<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.559> piddly

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
just draw it while we have a piddly

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.849 
just draw it while we have a piddly
little<00:00:44.949> Y<00:00:45.909> chromosome<00:00:46.569> it's<00:00:47.109> the<00:00:47.440> gene<00:00:47.710> is

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
little Y chromosome it's the gene is

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.930 
little Y chromosome it's the gene is
carried<00:00:48.339> on<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.960> X<00:00:50.170> chromosome<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.549> that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
carried on the X chromosome and that

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.939 
carried on the X chromosome and that
that's<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.359> gene<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:52.719> we<00:00:52.870> see<00:00:53.350> there<00:00:55.949> so

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
that's the gene that we see there so

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.879 
that's the gene that we see there so
that's<00:00:57.789> situation<00:00:58.659> with<00:00:59.229> a<00:00:59.260> male<00:00:59.589> who

00:00:59.879 --> 00:00:59.889 
that's situation with a male who

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:04.500 
that's situation with a male who
obviously<00:01:00.219> has<00:01:00.699> hemophilia<00:01:01.329> now<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.229> have<00:01:03.510> an

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
obviously has hemophilia now we have an

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.410 
obviously has hemophilia now we have an
x<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.170> y<00:01:05.979> james<00:01:06.340> which<00:01:06.610> are<00:01:06.820> used<00:01:07.060> for<00:01:07.210> sex

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
x and y james which are used for sex

conditions if we we started out writing
in<00:01:26.290> here<00:01:26.620> and<00:01:26.770> said<00:01:26.890> okay<00:01:27.160> this<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.370> what<00:01:27.520> some

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
in here and said okay this is what some

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.120 
in here and said okay this is what some
normal<00:01:28.300> individuals<00:01:28.780> might<00:01:28.960> look<00:01:29.140> like<00:01:30.270> with

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
normal individuals might look like with

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.040 
normal individuals might look like with
their<00:01:33.130> chains<00:01:33.490> no<00:01:34.000> their<00:01:34.210> carriers<00:01:34.810> were

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
their chains no their carriers were

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.010 
their chains no their carriers were
affected<00:01:35.470> by<00:01:35.590> hemophilia<00:01:36.630> let's<00:01:37.630> have<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.870> look

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
affected by hemophilia let's have a look

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.380 
affected by hemophilia let's have a look
at<00:01:38.140> some<00:01:38.380> different<00:01:38.980> scenarios<00:01:39.370> here<00:01:39.880> I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
at some different scenarios here I

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.320 
at some different scenarios here I
already<00:01:41.200> have<00:01:41.320> for<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.490> male<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:44.200> male<00:01:45.330> could

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
already have for the male the male could

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.820 
already have for the male the male could
be<00:01:47.730> affected<00:01:48.730> by<00:01:48.850> hemophilia<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:50.230> this

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
be affected by hemophilia and this

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.000 
be affected by hemophilia and this
individual<00:01:51.400> here<00:01:51.730> would<00:01:52.330> have<00:01:52.510> hemophilia

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
individual here would have hemophilia

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.320 
individual here would have hemophilia
they<00:01:54.010> carry<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.490> gene<00:01:54.670> for<00:01:54.880> him<00:01:55.000> at<00:01:55.120> Pima

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
they carry the gene for him at Pima

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.370 
they carry the gene for him at Pima
philia<00:01:55.659> this<00:01:56.320> male<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:57.450> hasn't<00:01:58.450> gained<00:01:59.110> fat

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
philia this male here hasn't gained fat

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.090 
philia this male here hasn't gained fat
for<00:01:59.800> the<00:02:00.159> normal<00:02:00.460> condition<00:02:01.890> okay<00:02:02.890> let's<00:02:03.040> have

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
for the normal condition okay let's have

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.830 
for the normal condition okay let's have
a<00:02:03.159> look<00:02:03.280> at<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.400> female<00:02:04.030> here<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:04.420> female

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
a look at the female here this female

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.869 
a look at the female here this female
will<00:02:05.200> be<00:02:05.380> heterozygous<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:08.310> will<00:02:09.310> have<00:02:09.519> one

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
will be heterozygous and will have one

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.510 
will be heterozygous and will have one
of<00:02:10.030> each<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:12.340> genes<00:02:12.609> and<00:02:12.879> the

other only other alternative for a
female<00:02:16.070> is<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.480> female<00:02:17.480> who<00:02:18.140> has<00:02:18.410> two<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
female is a female who has two of the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.240 
female is a female who has two of the
heme<00:02:19.370> affiliate<00:02:19.930> genes<00:02:20.930> now<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.680> individual

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
heme affiliate genes now this individual

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.630 
heme affiliate genes now this individual
here<00:02:22.960> would<00:02:23.960> be<00:02:24.110> affected<00:02:24.500> by<00:02:24.620> hemophilia<00:02:25.250> has

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
here would be affected by hemophilia has

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.330 
here would be affected by hemophilia has
a<00:02:25.670> two<00:02:25.940> recessive<00:02:26.240> hemophilic<00:02:27.020> James<00:02:27.470> so

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
a two recessive hemophilic James so

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.800 
a two recessive hemophilic James so
they're<00:02:28.520> going<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.910> disease<00:02:29.300> this

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
they're going to have the disease this

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.480 
they're going to have the disease this
individual<00:02:30.410> here<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> bit<00:02:30.890> interesting

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
individual here is a bit interesting

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.850 
individual here is a bit interesting
this<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.790> what<00:02:31.940> we<00:02:32.060> call<00:02:32.320> an<00:02:33.320> individual<00:02:33.740> who's

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
this is what we call an individual who's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.640 
this is what we call an individual who's
heterozygous<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.880> case<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.270> diseases<00:02:35.750> we

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
heterozygous and the case of diseases we

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.170 
heterozygous and the case of diseases we
often<00:02:36.890> call<00:02:37.070> them<00:02:37.160> carriers<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.030> should

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
often call them carriers so this should

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.210 
often call them carriers so this should
carry<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.870> individual<00:02:39.500> would<00:02:39.590> carry<00:02:39.980> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
carry the individual would carry the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.730 
carry the individual would carry the
gene<00:02:40.490> for<00:02:41.210> hemophilia<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:42.170> possible<00:02:42.680> they

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
gene for hemophilia it's possible they

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.820 
gene for hemophilia it's possible they
could<00:02:42.770> pass<00:02:43.190> on<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:45.050> gene<00:02:45.410> without

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
could pass on this gene without

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.040 
could pass on this gene without
expressing<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.790> than<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.060> themselves<00:02:47.870> and

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
expressing it than the themselves and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.960 
expressing it than the themselves and
therefore<00:02:48.890> being<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.310> carrier<00:02:49.760> for<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
therefore being a carrier for the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.190 
therefore being a carrier for the
disease<00:02:51.220> now<00:02:52.220> let's<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.940> look<00:02:53.690> at<00:02:53.840> an

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
disease now let's have a look at an

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.920 
disease now let's have a look at an
example<00:02:54.560> here<00:02:54.770> with<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.070> punnett<00:02:55.430> square

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
example here with a punnett square

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.450 
example here with a punnett square
let's<00:02:57.350> have<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.530> look<00:02:57.680> here<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:57.980> an<00:02:58.100> example

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
let's have a look here in an example

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.860 
let's have a look here in an example
let's<00:02:59.270> cross<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.960> my<00:03:00.740> aunt<00:03:01.510> who<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:03.520> normal<00:03:04.870> that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
let's cross a my aunt who is normal that

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.530 
let's cross a my aunt who is normal that
is<00:03:06.050> infected<00:03:06.560> by<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.740> disease<00:03:06.890> with<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.240> female

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
is infected by the disease with a female

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.250 
is infected by the disease with a female
carrier<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.780> see<00:03:12.440> what<00:03:12.620> we<00:03:12.740> get<00:03:12.980> okay<00:03:13.970> now<00:03:14.870> we

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
carrier and see what we get okay now we

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.340 
carrier and see what we get okay now we
go<00:03:15.410> through<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.710> same<00:03:15.890> process

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
go through the same process

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.190 
go through the same process
Mao<00:03:18.350> has<00:03:18.950> these<00:03:19.400> gametes<00:03:21.310> female<00:03:22.930> can<00:03:23.930> either

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
Mao has these gametes female can either

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.730 
Mao has these gametes female can either
supply<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.790> dominant<00:03:26.300> or<00:03:26.420> recessive<00:03:26.740> gamete

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
supply the dominant or recessive gamete

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.860 
supply the dominant or recessive gamete
and<00:03:27.950> it's<00:03:28.760> important<00:03:29.180> we<00:03:29.270> write<00:03:29.450> these<00:03:29.600> out

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
and it's important we write these out

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.840 
and it's important we write these out
here<00:03:30.050> our<00:03:30.650> planet<00:03:30.920> square<00:03:31.160> hasn't<00:03:31.430> changed

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
here our planet square hasn't changed

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.320 
here our planet square hasn't changed
the<00:03:32.540> sides<00:03:32.840> represent<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.440> gametes<00:03:33.800> the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
the sides represent the gametes the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.970 
the sides represent the gametes the
squares<00:03:35.330> in<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.570> middle<00:03:35.870> are<00:03:36.620> going<00:03:36.830> to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
squares in the middle are going to

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.100 
squares in the middle are going to
represent<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:38.050> genotypes<00:03:39.050> of<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.440> offspring

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
represent the genotypes of the offspring

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.420 
represent the genotypes of the offspring
so<00:03:42.110> I've<00:03:42.290> written<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.590> female<00:03:42.920> down<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.220> side

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
so I've written the female down the side

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.330 
so I've written the female down the side
there<00:03:43.670> let's<00:03:44.450> write<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.020> male<00:03:45.680> up<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.130> top

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
there let's write the male up the top

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.910 
there let's write the male up the top
here<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.900> doesn't<00:03:48.110> really<00:03:48.320> matter<00:03:48.560> which<00:03:48.710> one

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
here it doesn't really matter which one

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.970 
here it doesn't really matter which one
goes<00:03:49.070> in<00:03:49.250> which<00:03:49.370> spot<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.090> we<00:03:50.870> fill<00:03:51.260> these<00:03:51.590> out

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
goes in which spot and we fill these out

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.920 
goes in which spot and we fill these out
here

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.730 

okay<00:03:59.960> again<00:04:00.860> one<00:04:01.310> Jane<00:04:01.550> from<00:04:01.760> one<00:04:02.450> parent<00:04:02.780> one

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
okay again one Jane from one parent one

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.870 
okay again one Jane from one parent one
generally<00:04:04.550> Oh<00:04:04.580> from<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.850> other<00:04:05.060> parent<00:04:05.450> and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
generally Oh from the other parent and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.520 
generally Oh from the other parent and
one<00:04:07.880> thing<00:04:08.060> will<00:04:08.210> well<00:04:08.810> obviously<00:04:08.960> not<00:04:09.350> with

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
one thing will well obviously not with

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.680 
one thing will well obviously not with
is<00:04:09.710> is<00:04:10.190> fifty<00:04:10.580> percent<00:04:10.820> male<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.330> fifty

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
is is fifty percent male and fifty

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.650 
is is fifty percent male and fifty
percent<00:04:11.960> female<00:04:12.610> but<00:04:13.610> it's<00:04:13.820> now<00:04:14.270> also

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
percent female but it's now also

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.780 
percent female but it's now also
important<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.740> pay<00:04:15.890> attention<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:18.670> what<00:04:19.670> the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
important to pay attention to what the

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.240 
important to pay attention to what the
offspring<00:04:20.209> are<00:04:20.239> going<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.600> be<00:04:20.780> now<00:04:21.739> let's<00:04:22.130> have

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
offspring are going to be now let's have

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.650 
offspring are going to be now let's have
a<00:04:22.340> look<00:04:22.460> at<00:04:22.610> these<00:04:22.790> here<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:24.040> male<00:04:25.040> here

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
a look at these here so this male here

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.180 
a look at these here so this male here
will<00:04:26.660> be<00:04:26.780> affected<00:04:27.200> by<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.410> disease

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
will be affected by the disease

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.080 
will be affected by the disease
this<00:04:29.180> male<00:04:29.480> won't<00:04:29.780> be<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.770> two<00:04:31.010> females<00:04:31.790> being

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
this male won't be the two females being

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.530 
this male won't be the two females being
normal

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
normal

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.160 
normal
this<00:04:32.750> female<00:04:33.020> here<00:04:34.060> being<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.150> carrier<00:04:35.420> as<00:04:35.960> we

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
this female here being a carrier as we

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.860 
this female here being a carrier as we
discussed<00:04:36.530> before<00:04:36.760> so<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:38.270> guys<00:04:38.450> can<00:04:38.600> go<00:04:38.750> and

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
discussed before so you guys can go and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.600 
discussed before so you guys can go and
write<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.020> genotype<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.770> phenotype<00:04:40.040> ratios

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
write the genotype and phenotype ratios

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.940 
write the genotype and phenotype ratios
out<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:41.750> important<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.260> do<00:04:42.440> both<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.680> them

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
out it's important to do both of them

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.450 
out it's important to do both of them
but<00:04:43.460> we<00:04:43.640> did<00:04:44.000> end<00:04:44.090> up<00:04:44.270> with<00:04:47.320> two<00:04:48.460> normal

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
but we did end up with two normal

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.220 
but we did end up with two normal
females<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:50.150> fifty<00:04:50.510> percent<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.990> males

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
females and fifty percent of the males

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.640 
females and fifty percent of the males
having<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.310> disease
