00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.890
 congratulations on winning how much was not 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.200
 just today it seems to me any game in 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 Away is not a simple game that doctors 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.599
 tribune playing against an opponent well 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.510
 ok that all guys didn't play 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.500
 worked well big would go to bed 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.570
 have seen something that even 100 injuries 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.289
 some guys so thank you all 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.429
 who told you can say that such a game 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 she was different from the ones we played 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.680
 at home pangolin repeat that what games on 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.620
 away home is different here and stands 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.390
 they are helped in this the difficulty that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.140
 all away games what 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 and stands against you their rival at home 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.289
 can we say that we are defensive 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.550
 hockey played two periods empty when 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.370
 one led can't say so I honestly 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 somehow in tactics in the end I do not understand 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.360
 but we always seem to be playing actively 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 seeks to impose his game on his opponent 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 can't tell what we will be from 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.290
 defensive ralf what moments when here 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.050
 blueberries rush fallen where the price 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.980
 actually injuries many other moments 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.900
 they are valuable for raising the team spirit 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.260
 it first but for 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.390
 inside the team spirit what guys 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.250
 believes that someone is wrong 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.590
 another fixed a mistake 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.680
 the most difficult for you 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.880
 I can remember the match many times already 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.560
 said that there is no 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.869
 a certain of its own each throw 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 its dangerous to this here it will leave 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.450
 dressing room mood you got a helmet 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 best player and captain's cheese then 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.360
 how honorable it was to you all 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.700
 as any 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.350
 either attention is nice then guys 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.229
 how would you rate the game but once again 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.759
 we have those guys who go to bed 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.910
 washers that fix mistakes friend 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.310
 other well, this victory would be his last and 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.310
 how to pump skill calm 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.420
 I think the calm experience comes with 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.350
 games and the more you gonna 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.350
 more that will be calm
