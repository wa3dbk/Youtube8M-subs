00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
hi Hiram here I want to try out a little

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.390 
hi Hiram here I want to try out a little
idea<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.940> was<00:00:15.059> wondering<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:16.070> on<00:00:17.070> this

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
idea that I was wondering about on this

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.529 
idea that I was wondering about on this
a<00:00:17.820> lock<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:19.199> Alex<00:00:19.650> seven<00:00:20.550> piece<00:00:20.730> camping<00:00:21.270> cook

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
a lock for Alex seven piece camping cook

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.730 
a lock for Alex seven piece camping cook
set<00:00:22.039> you<00:00:23.039> know<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.279> have<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:24.080> pot<00:00:25.080> stand<00:00:25.439> ring

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
set you know we have this pot stand ring

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.089 
set you know we have this pot stand ring
that<00:00:25.920> goes<00:00:26.099> inside<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.970> windscreen<00:00:28.099> well

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
that goes inside the windscreen well

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.630 
that goes inside the windscreen well
what<00:00:29.250> happens<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.359> pot<00:00:31.369> sits<00:00:32.369> right<00:00:32.579> on

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
what happens is the pot sits right on

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
what happens is the pot sits right on
top<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.070> then<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.280> happens<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.260> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
top of this and then what happens is the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.280 
top of this and then what happens is the
only<00:00:37.530> opening<00:00:38.280> air<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:39.149> around<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.750> outside

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
only opening air is around the outside

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.700 
only opening air is around the outside
edge<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:41.129> there's<00:00:41.370> about<00:00:42.170> what<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> quarter

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
edge here there's about what a quarter

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.729 
edge here there's about what a quarter
of<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:43.950> inch<00:00:44.780> everything<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.899> flat<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> pot

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
of an inch everything is flat on the pot

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.069 
of an inch everything is flat on the pot
but<00:00:47.399> maybe<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> heat<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.329> come<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> side

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
but maybe the heat can come up the side

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.380 
but maybe the heat can come up the side
here<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.730> wondering<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.210> what

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
here so what I was wondering is what

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.889 
here so what I was wondering is what
would<00:00:51.510> happen<00:00:52.820> if<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.000> would<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> couple<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
would happen if I would take a couple of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.250 
would happen if I would take a couple of
wires<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.649> put<00:00:56.550> them<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
wires and put them on here so that it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.340 
wires and put them on here so that it
raised<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.739> pot<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.550> off<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.390> plate<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
raised the pot up off of the plate a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.070 
raised the pot up off of the plate a
little<00:01:01.559> bit<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.609> maybe<00:01:02.820> then<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.840> heat

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
little bit that maybe then the heat

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
little bit that maybe then the heat
would<00:01:04.260> come<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> flames<00:01:05.100> would<00:01:05.339> come<00:01:05.489> up

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
would come up the flames would come up

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.660 
would come up the flames would come up
the<00:01:05.729> center<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:07.260> able<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.740> go<00:01:07.950> across<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the center and be able to go across the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.350 
the center and be able to go across the
bottom<00:01:08.869> up<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.140> side<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.860> out<00:01:11.360> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
bottom up the side and then out that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.840 
bottom up the side and then out that
that<00:01:12.540> might<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.950> increase<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> heat

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that might you know increase the heat

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.330 
that might you know increase the heat
flow<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:16.380> by<00:01:16.560> making<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.070> set

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
flow a little bit just by making it set

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.140 
flow a little bit just by making it set
off<00:01:18.049> now<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.350> works<00:01:19.710> could<00:01:20.670> maybe<00:01:20.850> just

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
off now if this works could maybe just

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.260 
off now if this works could maybe just
take<00:01:21.360> these<00:01:21.570> tabs<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.610> bend<00:01:23.610> them<00:01:23.850> up<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
take these tabs and bend them up a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.020 
take these tabs and bend them up a
little<00:01:24.390> bit<00:01:25.100> but<00:01:26.100> first<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.520> want<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.850> see

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
little bit but first I just want to see

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.270 
little bit but first I just want to see
what<00:01:27.210> would<00:01:27.330> happen<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.979> placing<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> couple

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
what would happen with placing a couple

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.370 
what would happen with placing a couple
of<00:01:29.460> wires<00:01:29.640> across<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.509> top<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> plate

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
of wires across the top of the plate

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.300 
of wires across the top of the plate
like<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:33.570> what<00:01:33.720> I'll<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.710> I'll<00:01:35.009> go<00:01:35.130> get

like this so what I'll do is I'll go get

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.539 
like this so what I'll do is I'll go get
my<00:01:35.460> water<00:01:35.970> prep<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.689> temperature<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.369> I'll

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
my water prep for temperature and I'll

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.649 
my water prep for temperature and I'll
be<00:01:38.729> right<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:40.280> okay<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.460> my<00:01:41.610> water<00:01:41.850> prepped

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.260 

let<00:01:45.659> me<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:46.020> this

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.280 

wait<00:01:52.270> for<00:01:52.479> that<00:01:52.540> comfortable<00:01:53.290> bloom

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.440 

okay<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:59.250> problem<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.850> had<00:02:00.090> here

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
okay now one problem that I had here

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
okay now one problem that I had here
there's<00:02:01.230> plates<00:02:01.500> getting<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> little<00:02:02.070> warped

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
there's plates getting a little warped

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.210 
there's plates getting a little warped
so<00:02:03.300> when<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> put<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.780> wires<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> they<00:02:04.980> kept

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
so when I put the wires on it they kept

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.160 
so when I put the wires on it they kept
wanting<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.610> roll<00:02:05.940> away<00:02:08.180> but<00:02:09.180> I<00:02:09.479> got<00:02:09.960> them<00:02:10.080> on

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
wanting to roll away but I got them on

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.730 
wanting to roll away but I got them on
the<00:02:10.260> outside<00:02:10.710> edge<00:02:11.040> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> opening<00:02:12.740> and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the outside edge of the opening and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.180 
the outside edge of the opening and
we'll<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.550> happens<00:02:14.940> with<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:16.190> it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
we'll see what happens with that it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.410 
we'll see what happens with that it
looks<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.850> bloom

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
looks like I have a bloom

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.620 
looks like I have a bloom
I<00:02:19.100> have<00:02:20.100> two<00:02:20.250> cups<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.640> water<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:21.120> setting<00:02:21.510> at

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I have two cups of water here setting at

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.700 
I have two cups of water here setting at
60<00:02:22.050> degrees<00:02:23.540> just<00:02:24.540> set<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.900> there<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.350> wire

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.480 

put<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.860> handles<00:02:30.590> okay<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.650> that's<00:02:31.980> 2<00:02:32.130> cups<00:02:32.160> of

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
put the handles okay so that's 2 cups of

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.810 
put the handles okay so that's 2 cups of
water<00:02:32.670> sitting<00:02:33.060> at<00:02:33.180> 60<00:02:33.600> degrees<00:02:34.640> rolls<00:02:35.640> around

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
water sitting at 60 degrees rolls around

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.150 
water sitting at 60 degrees rolls around
real<00:02:36.210> easy<00:02:36.420> let's<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.560> where<00:02:37.740> this<00:02:37.890> goes

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
real easy let's see where this goes

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.350 
real easy let's see where this goes
okay<00:02:41.160> we're<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:41.520> past<00:02:41.820> two<00:02:42.210> minutes

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
okay we're a little past two minutes

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.470 
okay we're a little past two minutes
into<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.990> test<00:02:43.250> water<00:02:44.250> temperature<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.240> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
into the test water temperature is up to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.040 
into the test water temperature is up to
a<00:02:45.510> hundred<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.170> six<00:02:46.410> degrees<00:02:47.660> while<00:02:48.660> doing

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
a hundred and six degrees while doing

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.020 
a hundred and six degrees while doing
this<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.800> same<00:02:50.010> position<00:02:50.520> as<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.730> last

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
this in the same position as the last

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.810 
this in the same position as the last
test<00:02:51.420> where<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.870> burner<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> LOX<00:02:53.490> burner

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
test where the burner the a LOX burner

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.500 
test where the burner the a LOX burner
is<00:02:54.060> down<00:02:54.330> into<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.500> base<00:02:55.770> not<00:02:56.610> raised<00:02:56.940> up<00:02:57.270> I

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
is down into the base not raised up I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.870 
is down into the base not raised up I
just<00:02:58.260> want<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.680> if<00:02:58.830> these<00:02:59.010> wires<00:02:59.400> make<00:02:59.730> any

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
just want to see if these wires make any

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.720 
just want to see if these wires make any
difference<00:03:00.300> in<00:03:00.480> time<00:03:00.920> what<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:01.950> did<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.400> test

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
difference in time what I did this test

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.270 
difference in time what I did this test
yesterday<00:03:03.500> can't<00:03:04.500> par<00:03:05.480> boil<00:03:06.480> time<00:03:06.780> was<00:03:07.020> about

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
yesterday can't par boil time was about

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
yesterday can't par boil time was about
seven<00:03:08.280> minutes<00:03:08.430> six<00:03:08.970> minutes<00:03:09.410> 53<00:03:10.410> seconds<00:03:11.300> so

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
seven minutes six minutes 53 seconds so

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.790 
seven minutes six minutes 53 seconds so
I'm<00:03:12.420> hoping<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.900> will<00:03:13.050> speed<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.470> up<00:03:13.680> a

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
I'm hoping this will speed it up a

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.280 
I'm hoping this will speed it up a
little<00:03:13.890> bit<00:03:14.480> okay<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.600> wanted<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.110> show

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
little bit okay I just wanted to show

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.720 
little bit okay I just wanted to show
you<00:03:16.320> something<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.890> hope<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.190> will<00:03:17.370> show<00:03:17.610> up

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
you something I hope this will show up

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.540 
you something I hope this will show up
on<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.000> camera<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:19.350> inside<00:03:19.800> ring<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.340> that

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
on this camera the inside ring of that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.880 
on this camera the inside ring of that
plate<00:03:21.019> looks<00:03:22.019> like<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.380> getting<00:03:22.530> red-hot

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
plate looks like it's getting red-hot

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.080 
plate looks like it's getting red-hot
now<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:25.220> don't<00:03:26.220> know<00:03:26.400> if<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.610> did<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.790> before

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
now I don't know if it did that before

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.949 
now I don't know if it did that before
I've<00:03:27.480> never<00:03:27.660> noticed<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.400> but<00:03:29.400> maybe<00:03:30.209> because

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
I've never noticed it but maybe because

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.840 
I've never noticed it but maybe because
it<00:03:31.380> doesn't<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.830> water<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
it doesn't have the water and the in the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.870 
it doesn't have the water and the in the
pot<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.720> keep<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.050> cool<00:03:34.290> now<00:03:34.700> that's<00:03:35.700> getting

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
pot to keep it cool now that's getting

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.610 
pot to keep it cool now that's getting
red-hot<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:37.050> wasting<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.769> heat<00:03:42.500> are<00:03:43.500> we

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
red-hot and just wasting the heat are we

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.380 
red-hot and just wasting the heat are we
up<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.739> ten

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
up to ten

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:07.880 
to eleven to twelve in five minutes 56
seconds<00:03:58.040> okay<00:03:59.040> let<00:03:59.340> me<00:03:59.459> put<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.930> out<00:04:06.890> okay

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
seconds okay let me put this out okay

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.800 
seconds okay let me put this out okay
this<00:04:08.160> time<00:04:08.400> two<00:04:08.700> cups<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.060> water<00:04:09.240> starting<00:04:09.720> at

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
this time two cups of water starting at

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.770 
this time two cups of water starting at
sixty<00:04:10.200> degrees<00:04:10.760> which<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.790> one<00:04:12.209> degree<00:04:12.360> colder

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
sixty degrees which is one degree colder

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.650 
sixty degrees which is one degree colder
than<00:04:13.140> what<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.440> was<00:04:13.560> yesterday<00:04:14.480> came<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.630> a

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
than what it was yesterday came to a

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.729 
than what it was yesterday came to a
boil<00:04:15.930> in<00:04:16.109> five<00:04:16.410> minutes<00:04:16.799> 56<00:04:17.370> seconds<00:04:18.739> using

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
boil in five minutes 56 seconds using

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.390 
boil in five minutes 56 seconds using
the<00:04:20.040> same<00:04:20.280> set<00:04:20.669> up<00:04:21.650> yesterday<00:04:22.650> at<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.190> time

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
the same set up yesterday at the time

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.210 
the same set up yesterday at the time
was<00:04:23.610> six<00:04:23.850> minutes<00:04:24.180> 53<00:04:24.570> seconds<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.590> three

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
was six minutes 53 seconds so three

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.180 
was six minutes 53 seconds so three
seconds<00:04:26.669> difference<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:27.800> one<00:04:28.800> thing<00:04:29.010> that<00:04:29.160> I

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
seconds difference but one thing that I

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.400 
seconds difference but one thing that I
think<00:04:29.310> happened

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
think happened

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.980 
think happened
it's<00:04:31.410> like<00:04:32.570> 68<00:04:33.570> percent<00:04:34.200> humidity<00:04:34.500> in<00:04:34.830> here

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
it's like 68 percent humidity in here

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.140 
it's like 68 percent humidity in here
Moisture<00:04:36.990> formed<00:04:37.500> on<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.680> pot<00:04:38.100> I<00:04:38.430> mean<00:04:38.580> heavy

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
Moisture formed on the pot I mean heavy

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.840 
Moisture formed on the pot I mean heavy
and<00:04:39.560> it<00:04:40.560> took<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.740> while<00:04:40.860> before<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.550> burned

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
and it took a while before that burned

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.210 
and it took a while before that burned
off<00:04:42.120> so<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.320> would<00:04:43.680> lower<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.160> time<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.990> plus

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.800 

this<00:04:50.220> inner<00:04:50.580> ring<00:04:51.440> on<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.710> plate<00:04:53.720> let<00:04:54.720> me

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
this inner ring on this plate let me

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.280 
this inner ring on this plate let me
show<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.320> other<00:04:55.410> one<00:04:56.810> remember<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
show you on the other one remember the

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.380 
show you on the other one remember the
video<00:04:58.440> yesterday<00:04:58.860> I<00:04:59.130> showed<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.669> this

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
video yesterday I showed you that this

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.140 
video yesterday I showed you that this
inner<00:05:00.660> ring<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.229> same<00:05:01.490> plate<00:05:02.490> used<00:05:02.880> in

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
inner ring is the same plate used in

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.409 
inner ring is the same plate used in
this<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.780> lakh<00:05:04.380> burner<00:05:05.040> for<00:05:05.700> our<00:05:05.850> stove<00:05:06.120> rather

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
this a lakh burner for our stove rather

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.600 
this a lakh burner for our stove rather
that<00:05:07.290> uses<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.860> same<00:05:08.040> burner<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.400> one

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
that uses the same burner and this one

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.730 
that uses the same burner and this one
no<00:05:11.700> they<00:05:11.880> bent<00:05:12.120> up<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.390> tabs<00:05:12.660> put<00:05:13.080> feet<00:05:13.380> on<00:05:13.410> it

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
no they bent up the tabs put feet on it

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.860 
no they bent up the tabs put feet on it
and<00:05:13.860> then<00:05:14.490> used<00:05:14.729> it<00:05:14.910> for<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.120> burner<00:05:15.360> so<00:05:15.600> I<00:05:15.660> guess

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
and then used it for a burner so I guess

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.140 
and then used it for a burner so I guess
waste<00:05:16.169> not<00:05:16.380> want<00:05:16.440> not

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
waste not want not

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.170 
waste not want not
but<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:18.479> inner<00:05:18.750> ring<00:05:19.820> hopefully<00:05:20.820> it'll<00:05:20.970> show

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
but this inner ring hopefully it'll show

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.610 
but this inner ring hopefully it'll show
up<00:05:21.330> on<00:05:21.479> camera<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:22.490> was<00:05:23.490> red<00:05:23.940> hot<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:25.440> can

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
up on camera to was red hot and you can

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:33.290 
up on camera to was red hot and you can
see<00:05:25.830> tempering<00:05:26.490> marks<00:05:27.510> on<00:05:27.720> this<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:32.150> don't<00:05:33.150> know

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
see tempering marks on this I don't know

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.360 
see tempering marks on this I don't know
too<00:05:33.900> many<00:05:34.020> variables<00:05:34.289> here<00:05:34.950> I<00:05:37.190> think<00:05:38.190> what<00:05:38.340> I

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
too many variables here I think what I

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.580 
too many variables here I think what I
really<00:05:38.430> have<00:05:38.760> to<00:05:38.880> do<00:05:39.030> is<00:05:39.240> get<00:05:40.140> rid<00:05:40.320> of<00:05:40.380> the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
really have to do is get rid of the

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.460 
really have to do is get rid of the
plate<00:05:40.830> completely<00:05:41.720> punched<00:05:42.720> some<00:05:42.900> holes<00:05:42.930> and

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
plate completely punched some holes and

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.490 
plate completely punched some holes and
just<00:05:43.560> use<00:05:43.950> two<00:05:44.310> wires<00:05:44.810> going<00:05:45.810> across<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.350> if

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
just use two wires going across this if

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.610 
just use two wires going across this if
I<00:05:46.650> punch<00:05:46.950> holes<00:05:47.220> at<00:05:47.490> different<00:05:47.880> heights<00:05:48.150> I

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
I punch holes at different heights I

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.440 
I punch holes at different heights I
could<00:05:49.620> change<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.130> height<00:05:50.340> of<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.820> pot<00:05:51.090> in

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
could change the height of the pot in

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.350 
could change the height of the pot in
this<00:05:51.710> windscreen<00:05:52.880> really<00:05:53.880> easy

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
this windscreen really easy

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.149 
this windscreen really easy
so<00:05:55.960> anyway<00:05:56.319> I<00:05:56.560> don't<00:05:56.979> that<00:05:58.620> this<00:05:59.620> didn't<00:05:59.949> prove

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
so anyway I don't that this didn't prove

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:05.279 
so anyway I don't that this didn't prove
or<00:06:00.370> disprove<00:06:00.400> anything<00:06:03.599> but<00:06:04.599> like<00:06:04.810> Edison

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
or disprove anything but like Edison

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.689 
or disprove anything but like Edison
