00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.099 

when<00:00:05.319> many<00:00:05.500> people<00:00:05.589> think<00:00:06.160> of<00:00:06.700> cell<00:00:07.660> therapy

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:08.109 
when many people think of cell therapy

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.299 
when many people think of cell therapy
so<00:00:08.410> therapy<00:00:09.100> from<00:00:09.959> from<00:00:10.959> stem<00:00:11.260> cells<00:00:11.309> people

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
so therapy from from stem cells people

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.529 
so therapy from from stem cells people
think<00:00:12.490> about<00:00:12.610> cells<00:00:13.180> which<00:00:13.869> are<00:00:14.139> going<00:00:14.860> to<00:00:14.980> be

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
think about cells which are going to be

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.779 
think about cells which are going to be
directly<00:00:16.539> from<00:00:16.750> them<00:00:17.109> turned<00:00:17.949> into<00:00:18.250> say<00:00:18.580> for

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
directly from them turned into say for

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.670 
directly from them turned into say for
instance<00:00:18.880> their<00:00:19.240> heart<00:00:19.480> cells<00:00:19.720> or<00:00:20.050> for

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
instance their heart cells or for

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.590 
instance their heart cells or for
instance<00:00:20.800> their<00:00:21.280> retinal<00:00:22.240> cells<00:00:22.420> or

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
instance their retinal cells or

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.500 
instance their retinal cells or
something<00:00:22.930> like<00:00:23.020> that<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:24.220> is<00:00:24.520> in<00:00:25.120> fact

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
something like that and that is in fact

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.590 
something like that and that is in fact
how<00:00:26.350> some<00:00:26.650> of<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.800> first

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
how some of the first

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.220 
how some of the first
trials<00:00:28.600> are<00:00:28.840> are<00:00:29.289> going<00:00:29.680> to<00:00:29.800> be<00:00:30.100> done<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:31.230> but

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
trials are are going to be done and but

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.479 
trials are are going to be done and but
in<00:00:32.379> fact<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.969> not<00:00:34.449> the<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.530> kind<00:00:35.860> of<00:00:35.980> of

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
in fact that's not the the kind of of

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.149 
in fact that's not the the kind of of
cell<00:00:37.089> therapy<00:00:37.600> which<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:38.079> most<00:00:38.499> likely<00:00:38.800> going

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.159 
cell therapy which is most likely going

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.759 
cell therapy which is most likely going
to<00:00:39.280> happen<00:00:39.579> for<00:00:40.300> large<00:00:40.809> groups<00:00:41.289> of<00:00:41.409> people

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
to happen for large groups of people

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.489 
to happen for large groups of people
it's<00:00:42.249> much<00:00:42.579> more<00:00:42.789> likely<00:00:43.149> in<00:00:43.539> fact<00:00:43.809> that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
it's much more likely in fact that

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.189 
it's much more likely in fact that
people<00:00:45.399> will<00:00:45.609> be<00:00:45.760> able<00:00:45.969> to<00:00:46.329> get<00:00:46.600> cell

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
people will be able to get cell

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.259 
people will be able to get cell
therapies<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:49.120> stem<00:00:49.600> cells<00:00:49.679> that<00:00:50.679> are

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
therapies from stem cells that are

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.180 
therapies from stem cells that are
essentially<00:00:52.269> off-the-shelf<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.620> we<00:00:54.010> have

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
essentially off-the-shelf so we have

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.509 
essentially off-the-shelf so we have
banks<00:00:54.670> of<00:00:54.850> cells<00:00:55.149> which<00:00:55.899> have<00:00:56.260> been<00:00:56.519> carefully

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
banks of cells which have been carefully

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.660 
banks of cells which have been carefully
selected<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.719> that<00:00:58.749> there's<00:00:59.260> quality<00:00:59.979> control

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
selected so that there's quality control

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.270 
selected so that there's quality control
so<00:01:01.299> that<00:01:01.329> they<00:01:01.690> have<00:01:01.929> so<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:02.589> they<00:01:02.889> for

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
so that they have so that they for

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.090 
so that they have so that they for
instance<00:01:03.309> don't<00:01:04.089> have<00:01:04.269> any<00:01:04.710> genes<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:05.950> would

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
instance don't have any genes that would

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.090 
instance don't have any genes that would
cause<00:01:06.370> tumors<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.090> also<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.590> they<00:01:08.799> have

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
cause tumors and also that they have

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.520 
cause tumors and also that they have
been<00:01:09.310> selected<00:01:09.520> because<00:01:10.180> they<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.869> immune

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
been selected because they have immune

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.770 
been selected because they have immune
characteristics<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.939> make<00:01:13.180> them<00:01:13.210> more

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
characteristics that make them more

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.279 
characteristics that make them more
likely<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.289> be<00:01:14.710> accepted<00:01:15.579> by<00:01:15.789> by<00:01:16.240> somebody<00:01:16.689> it

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
likely to be accepted by by somebody it

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.109 
likely to be accepted by by somebody it
would<00:01:17.439> be<00:01:17.590> very<00:01:17.770> inefficient<00:01:18.280> for<00:01:18.850> instance

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
would be very inefficient for instance

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.980 
would be very inefficient for instance
to<00:01:19.299> make<00:01:19.710> twenty<00:01:20.710> or<00:01:20.859> thirty<00:01:21.159> thousand

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to make twenty or thirty thousand

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.810 
to make twenty or thirty thousand
embryonic<00:01:22.990> stem<00:01:23.380> cells<00:01:23.649> for<00:01:24.280> which<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.579> don't

know what the genetic background is or

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.069 
know what the genetic background is or
we<00:01:28.780> almost<00:01:29.439> difficult<00:01:29.799> ooh<00:01:30.759> make<00:01:31.030> IPS<00:01:31.869> cells

human genetic diversity does play a role
in<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.780> now<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:11.290> Japan<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.610> Shinya<00:02:13.150> Yamanaka

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
in this now so Japan and Shinya Yamanaka

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.520 
in this now so Japan and Shinya Yamanaka
in<00:02:13.990> in<00:02:14.740> his<00:02:15.040> lab<00:02:15.670> in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
in in his lab in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.250 
in in his lab in
and<00:02:16.709> has<00:02:17.250> actually<00:02:17.490> moved<00:02:17.760> forward<00:02:18.330> very<00:02:18.690> very

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and has actually moved forward very very

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.220

quickly<00:02:20.069> on<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.760> Japan<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.900> actually

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
quickly on this and Japan is is actually

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.370 
quickly on this and Japan is is actually
very<00:02:22.650> well<00:02:22.860> suited<00:02:23.630> essentially<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.810> pioneer

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
very well suited essentially to pioneer

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.860 
very well suited essentially to pioneer
this<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.980> new<00:02:26.160> technology<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:27.060> these

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
this this new technology of these

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.430 
this this new technology of these
Universal<00:02:28.709> donor<00:02:29.069> cell<00:02:29.910> banks<00:02:30.270> because<00:02:30.840> Japan

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
Universal donor cell banks because Japan

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.750 
Universal donor cell banks because Japan
is<00:02:31.620> actually<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:32.010> relatively<00:02:32.459> homogeneous

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
is actually a relatively homogeneous

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.150 
is actually a relatively homogeneous
population<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:34.050> essentially<00:02:34.410> one<00:02:34.650> island

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
population it's essentially one island

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.280 
population it's essentially one island
with<00:02:35.340> 100<00:02:35.700> or<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.209> set<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.840> islands<00:02:37.110> with<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
their genetic background and so these so

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.400 
their genetic background and so these so
it's<00:02:44.880> it's<00:02:45.150> actually<00:02:45.480> estimated<00:02:46.080> that

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
it's it's actually estimated that

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.590 
it's it's actually estimated that
they'll<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.800> able<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.130> make<00:02:47.700> one<00:02:48.000> bank<00:02:48.300> that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
they'll be able to make one bank that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.380 
they'll be able to make one bank that
could<00:02:48.780> potentially<00:02:49.200> cover<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.459> 80<00:02:50.700> or<00:02:51.000> 90

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
could potentially cover in the 80 or 90

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.040 
could potentially cover in the 80 or 90
percent<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.620> Japanese<00:02:52.800> population<00:02:54.050> it's

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
percent of the Japanese population it's

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.600 
percent of the Japanese population it's
going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> bigger<00:02:55.800> challenge<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.400> course

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
going to be a bigger challenge of course

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.610 
going to be a bigger challenge of course
for<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.480> rest<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> world<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.350> for<00:02:58.560> the

United<00:02:58.860> States<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.400> particular<00:02:59.700> because<00:03:00.600> we

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
United States in particular because we

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.390 
United States in particular because we
are<00:03:01.110> much<00:03:01.350> more<00:03:01.380> genetically<00:03:02.010> diverse

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
are much more genetically diverse

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.420 
are much more genetically diverse
however<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.780> if<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:04.500> can<00:03:04.680> learn<00:03:04.860> from<00:03:05.190> what

they've learned in Japan and we can do

they've learned in Japan and we can do
it<00:03:07.500> say<00:03:07.739> for<00:03:07.800> instance<00:03:08.250> more<00:03:08.400> efficiently

it say for instance more efficiently
there's<00:03:09.060> no<00:03:09.209> reason<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.780> we<00:03:09.900> can't<00:03:10.019> have<00:03:10.380> a
