00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone today we bring you the review of 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.790
 a new model of samsung galaxy 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.100
 drop 5 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.780
 Well, here we have a new model of 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.620
 samsung family j 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.000
 specifically the galaxy j 5 this phone 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.279
 it comes to compete in the range 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.950
 intermediate thanks to the features 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.810
 that I am going to tell you next for 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.470
 start we have a pretty design 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 attractive 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.480
 with a totally plastic back 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.590
 smooth that leaves a nice touch when 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.160
 we take the phone 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.410
 metal and rounded edges give 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.440
 a nice touch in addition to protection 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.690
 to possible falls of the telephone and in 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.360
 the front the characteristic of samsung 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.780
 with the center button and buttons 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.910
 recoil and multitasking on both sides in 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.949
 set we have a pretty design 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 care but grows a success on the part 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.289
 from sanz solo 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.289
 also if we remove the back cover 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.330
 we found the card slots 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 micro sim and micro sd up to 128 gb 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.390
 we also see that the battery is 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.190
 removable so we can change to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.300
 ourselves and even have another 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.300
 for your punctual 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.210
 the mounting screen is j5 is a 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.200
 model Super AMOLED 5 inch 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.259
 hd resolution 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.619
 as we see it gives us a pretty result 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.619
 optimum 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.280
 Y 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.010
 if we go into the technical part 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.280
 this samsung j5 incorporates a processor 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.000
 from four cores to 12 gigahertz 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.440
 specifically the model snapdragon 410 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 next to the processor, a 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.729
 ram memory from 1 to 5 gigs so it 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.680
 we can run the applications and 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.890
 move between them with enough 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.350
 fluency 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.979
 As we can see, we will move through the menu 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.420
 of the applications open some open 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.140
 multitasking and switching between 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.120
 Applications 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.360
 everything pretty fluid 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.500
 the memory of the terminal is 8 gb if 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.159
 we go to the settings of 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.159
 storage 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.010
 storage 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.439
 we can verify that the system together 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.499
 pre-installed applications consume 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.389
 half of the memory approximately 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:43.269
 leaving us free about 4 gigas to 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:46.700
 our photos videos apps 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.280
 etc. this will be enough or not 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.290
 depending on each user but thanks 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.620
 in addition to the possibility of using cards 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.879
 microsd as we have already commented before 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.819
 we should have problems of 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.999
 storage the operating system that 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 uses this model is version 5.1 1 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:06.439
 from android also called lollipop that 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.870
 brings characteristics such as 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.109
 floating notifications on the screen 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.109
 blocking 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.840
 in the photo section samsung has 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.840
 chosen a 13-megapixel camera 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.950
 with autofocus and flash to be able to do 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.870
 photos in dark places or at night 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.690
 We can configure several modes of 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.970
 photography we focus here in the section 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.500
 so we have a pro mode for 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.000
 example where we can configure 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.030
 more advanced features 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.280
 photographs as smooth or zero brightness 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.830
 in auto mode which is the standard mode 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.920
 from the camera other different modes like 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.610
 panoramic bursts and so on 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.460
 also if we enter the settings 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.010
 we see that we can record videos in full 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.010
 hd in hd or in vga 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.780
 the front camera is 5 megapixels 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.190
 perfect to perform the fis and 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.600
 capture videos with the same 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.310
 qualities that the rear camera 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.620
 the software that controls the camera 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.270
 It is also very well implemented and we 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.750
 It gives a lot of shooting speed and 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.750
 transition between the camera and the gallery 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.400
 as we see we can take photos 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.699
 continue and we have access to the gallery 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.830
 quickly and rewind to the camera all 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.260
 pretty fluid 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.760
 another interesting feature that is 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.460
 adding samsung in some of his 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.880
 terminals is the smart application 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.880
 manager 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.380
 This application 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.420
 it works as a manager of different 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.070
 configurations 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.070
 we can access the battery 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.140
 and we see that we have here the types of 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.540
 energy savings and a standard savings 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.490
 a saving module from which 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.470
 we can configure from here 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.840
 we also have direct access to 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.120
 storage will also make us a 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.690
 analysis of the terminal and view the files 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.039
 that we can eliminate etcetera consumption 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.830
 which is having between the telephone of 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.830
 ram memory close tasks from here 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.440
 and a security mode that has 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.830
 different functions like a desk 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.020
 they call mica knox where you can 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.060
 configure some applications so that 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.060
 can only access you 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.939
 nothing to finish commenting that this 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.949
 model includes with various activities 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:47.610
 Like 4g wifi bluetooth nfc and radio one 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.650
 quality that is always well received 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.620
 if you liked this samsung model 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.509
 On j 5 you can go through any of 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.780
 our phone house stores or enter 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.780
