00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello Matthew yesterday you explained the good 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.810
 school the country we are the students 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.820
 who mobilized on 5 May 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.349
 last along with their teachers i 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.160
 own parents and the whole world 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.440
 education 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 then in recent days we have been 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.190
 summoned but facing our own 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.270
 critical issues and our concerns on 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.010
 this bill 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.260
 the openings were only for the facade 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 and there was no real listening because 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.250
 obviously the real problems with this 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.650
 bill do not want to discuss them for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.150
 we are the first problems 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.279
 all but called nominative of the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.200
 teachers who see the freedom of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.430
 teaching creates six- year schools e 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.050
 series schools d 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.920
 and there is a strong risk that it creates 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.469
 clientelarism therefore reads freedom 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.030
 of learning and creates inequality 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.899
 for us students it is a problem a 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.180
 serious problem 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.100
 the second theme is the theme of law 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.590
 to the study and resources they need 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.320
 to be guaranteed this to today in 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.079
 2015 in Italy a vibo student 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.250
 valentia does not have the same possibility 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.649
 economic to remain in the channels 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.149
 formative of a student of Treviso the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.850
 national law is a condition 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.409
 necessary but not sufficient and for 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.689
 to be such must be adequately 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.110
 funded is a shame that in this 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.760
 country 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 in the face of rising interest rates 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.460
 school dropout was not one 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 real priority 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.090
 so far the third theme is the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.460
 rating 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.320
 we want to evaluate why we believe 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 that evaluating means finding the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.500
 weaknesses within ours 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 schools and improve the quality of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.869
 didactics 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 we want to do it together with all 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.259
 actors in the school world 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.939
 our teachers the technicians of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.920
 Lab our parents 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.229
 the prices we believe the evaluation 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.659
 he was about to improve and not to punish 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.549
 that's why we don't want to decide 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 salary of our professors or not 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.380
 we don't even want the tools to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.210
 to do it 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.549
 however, it leaves us very perplexed 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.009
 that a single person maybe in prices 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.229
 they can do it arbitrarily 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.310
 the fourth point is the privatization of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.079
 funding 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.360
 we believe that public school is 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.079
 public and should rival republic e 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.189
 we reject the idea that this must be 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.570
 co-financed by private funding 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.290
 such as 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.240
 happens in the case of the school bonus 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.350
 this creates inequality compromises 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.360
 freedom of teaching e 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.940
 learning and above all lite 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.370
 school autonomy the fifth theme 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.340
 tools second to themselves 5 per 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.620
 a thousand for example will make them rich are 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.570
 legal schools and poor more and more 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.580
 poor and lonely the poorest schools 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.160
 those that are already in this moment 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.080
 the alternation made in this way does not give 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.840
 the same possibilities for a student of 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.970
 power and a student from Milan the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.890
 called nominative law school bonus no 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.810
 finance the right to study everything 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.070
 the bill is based on an idea 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.070
 which creates inequality
