00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:02.740
 mertens and wine estate 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.040
 she still started on the couch 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.040
 psv checks as you might expect 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.809
 if it plays a match in the team from the first division 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.609
 psv has the ball 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.260
 and look for an opening that apparently it's a nice toivonen a friend 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.589
 people at the second pole, naturally, every runner comes by hand 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:24.329
 played 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.369
 is human 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.319
 this project youth player of psv 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.319
 then with the hand against the ball 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.650
 Bakkal was difficult enough for Kantelberg 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.850
 therefore here toivonen group bakkal given 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 not very tasty already taken and therefore our chances 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.610
 with what art and flight work comes 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.610
 fc eindhoven 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.990
 who still tamata 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
 a good classification 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.180
 possibility for sea fish 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.610
 open the score 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.290
 there the bank with 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 clean task 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.310
 perfect speed all given law 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.310
 but this too little with it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.630
 Kantelberg is going to release well 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.020
 and that comes face to face with casillas ramos diagonally opposite 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.140
 excellent opportunity for FC 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.410
 Ronald to take the lead 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.910
 rossum is not selfish what that might be 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.390
 you see how promising 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.390
 Ramos Castle is good to come from its members 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 the left back of it comes across a lot more 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.740
 first 34 minutes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.200
 Chief of police the device from an unclear who give this pass and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.449
 therein lies 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.629
 for rc 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.629
 rob van boekel 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.630
 two the real good option for the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.579
 one of them is father 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.819
 psv stands with defeats 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.819
 well played out 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
 who finished in twelfth place in the first division last season 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.949
 ten minutes later what is the best design in the second half 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.949
 their return 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.879
 the ceulaer about the task 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.539
 and from csm 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.539
 not all can see exactly how that happens 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.979
 very unsporting of a marcelo 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.979
 striker pain hit target since 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.509
 georginio wijnaldum that will make its debut in the shirt of 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:05.549
 this week 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.620
 derailed ola toivonen one within the lines dries mertens is the replacement for 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.889
 man is this park one of the first saxons is a resident of the castle 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.349
 ramos 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.409
 finally mertens 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.419
 Wijnaldum close to a goal 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
 it is at least his first goal attempt in the shirt of psv 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.759
 three fresh powers 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.829
 after ten minutes in the second half 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.099
 in a free kick 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.099
 psv and stroman is pushed in the back 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.449
 mertens takes care of the ball 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.809
 they demanded a free kick 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:50.019
 two-man wall 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.959
 mertens the difficult ball over the keeper 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.959
 hapimag turned by zaari 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.259
 wine estate 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.319
 virtually no one has two men got two men 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:11.329
 febiac sees 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.619
 around ten young men 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.439
 I have him there once 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.439
 jasper waalkens cold in the field 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.129
 with a flaming shot 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.719
 there is paloma with a good head butt 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:34.029
 or was it a marcelleke towered above everything and everyone 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.870
 cut the tomatoes 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.599
 already kept indoors by mertens 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.849
 I can suffice 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.849
 then it is immediately an unfriendly red-light district marcello road roma interferes 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.099
 agree with it 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.939
 this has nothing to do with a friendly game 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.069
 reactions in the psv players recovery 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.819
 be tackled as a newcomer 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.710
 yellow for alfaport 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.819
 furthermore that is indeed one 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.870
 serious offense 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.879
 orange over the freezer 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.879
 from mertens 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.039
 looking for wine balance 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.039
 assumption with the breast 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.509
 acrobatic newspaper 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.020
 only in the last ten minutes 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.280
 when the equalizer from psv is that in the market hilversum anp 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.469
 after good preparatory work from manolev 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.990
 was the chance of a win 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.219
 no more 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.779
 tamata 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.889
 ritzmaier 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.139
 are popular with rosette with a detective in the short corner 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.229
 but still no goal for PSV 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.650
 Sea-fish again long played by Manolev who cannot shoot himself and 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.229
 can score 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.330
 and so it says 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.990
 nine minutes before time 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.110
 9 in the Jan Louwers stadium 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.879
 by one 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.050
 hoekstra that punishment 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.210
 somewhat fortunate, he gets the ball in his feet again 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.030
 through the opponent in a paridan way but hit him with the tip of his shoe 

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.289
 are four next to zaari 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.199
 The keeper of FC Eindhoven 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.830
 and so it is right 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.180
 the public now also knows that penalties are taken at a 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.069
 possibly 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.069
 tie after 90 minutes 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.610
 wine estate close by 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.419
 and there is continued in the belief that I believe that marcellis scores 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:20.750
 that is how the water is 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.699
 he follows lord c 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.749
 and so goes vsv 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:26.800
 just win this match in the final phase 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.300
 aerts wine balance 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.300
 and then marcello completely free the fire will jan 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:35.919
 the city of lights that is won by psv resound 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.449
 from manolev and 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:41.449
 I think he will be there Ernest Faber the coach of FC Eindhoven 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:45.869
 they feel better about this competition 

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:49.609
 Fred Rutten who undoubtedly learned a lot from the transactions 

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.379
 from his team 

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:54.899
 there is the city of lights cup 

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:57.899
 not so just like last season, it is difficult 

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:01.840
 just fell into the prize box in the psv stadium
