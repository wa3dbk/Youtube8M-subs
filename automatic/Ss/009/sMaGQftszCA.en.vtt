00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.130
 Brier makes you that 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.130
 okay then come down exactly 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.889
 Aid 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.960
 "Did you see that? 4 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.739
 what to do 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:17.869
 her child does not even return from the 2 1 2 the theater backbencher 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.800
 not twice what he wants 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.210
 I was always here 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.770
 to get the feeling 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.699
 Celebration Maureen 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.759
 we are not that bad at all 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.759
 the Waldhof Scriptor Layer Pence 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.040
 book rapid-i 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.050
 Christopher Zeller said pollster is ready to go 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.640
 Kampe the bows 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.600
 l if someone is not understood now the recording has that percent 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.750
 there is such a car examine 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.830
 "There are dogs 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.790
 she animates that or something 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.910
 Red cars so yellow car 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.930
 and that means banks the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.980
 and warned the BoE 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.059
 u-bhf the recording to and sure think 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.720
 Prefer not to say that someone now 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.950
 somehow, there are only 12 duels at once 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.790
 the one who gives maybe people who have not seen the feeling in theirs 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.510
 childhood 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.890
 the 15 o'clock Jung for that 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.190
 there's everything 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.250
 I may condemn 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.460
 was not really inspiring me now would say 'I am proud of it 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.110
 that I survived 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.600
 but also car was in itself quite the Hinserie 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.250
 after clarification 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.770
 and so 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.590
 Now we continue 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.600
 clear 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.720
 Görtz Lyon the classification 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 and now Ireland Saar pulled proceedings 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.370
 11 this does not matter 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.370
 I say that now a case creates what decided for a limited time 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.680
 noted and written down 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.870
 I knew now 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.650
 Marx looks funny when Christa Wolf 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.530
 and if I did that then Wolfangel will test victory consequences 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.580
 Picture depending on what percentage 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.580
 Popstar Power absolutely 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.509
 it does not work 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.509
 So let measure 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.159
 The beautiful bat comes flying 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.159
 did you bring nothing? 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.719
 her Erhard energies 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.609
 Nobody can do energy 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.609
 let's see what else for weapons wars and above all 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.859
 which of them 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.669
 Fight enemies 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.779
 Peter, who owns their own, which they do not drink 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.819
 especially high consumption 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.819
 these weapons points that mean even more 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.419
 Although consumption of watchmen would have gone 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.839
 For example, band already a weapon by itself no idea 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.819
 8 sone weapons he uses energy then you can imagine 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.989
 maybe he is very fast 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.669
 Jak Clooster 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.439
 so and Hopp 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.349
 yes yes you can BMX 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.739
 and Paul can you stress with the Cloud Vin? 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.509
 I should not taste that up then 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.179
 there is still a kick ass 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.370
 Cath I am I said you should not 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.219
 Bartelt 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.539
 nothing is going according to plan we play 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.359
 nobody will notice 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.359
 you have to do everything yourself 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.989
 from then on 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.239
 Warns 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.979
 yes the SV Queck okay 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.459
 we drive too 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.189
 and here again the age-old Mrs. Mohr with whom we are not so far this time 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.189
 come as it looks 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.129
 there is the water there 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.129
 the agency 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.629
 so I was still room 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.629
 and not just out of boredom 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:00.449
 OTC life 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.449
 4 I have not seen that in the snow 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.749
 Well, I have to do it fast 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.119
 I have to do more 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.269
 Text and picture of the apostles 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.269
 the something from her 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:16.739
 Verbier 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.359
 Oh, leave something 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.659
 does not bring anyway so Prof Pop 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.979
 now healed dangerously tight I calle me so well 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.090
 Swimming penguins 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.789
 KGAL is based 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.729
 Tallinn is a «dirty penguin CEO with them 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.939
 always do it like that 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.139
 Holzer 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.139
 with closing in the face 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.300
 Navas vom 6 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.559
 OK 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:46.559
 this is often a win duty 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.039
 nearly 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.050
 that's probably not reassured 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.659
 UL 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.990
 there again the whole nice 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.089
 I ask again 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.169
 if we like it that way 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.569
 okay then do not stop 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.690
 I'm worried I'll make myself mature 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.030
 Rollin now you can see you can hardly tell me anything else 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.469
 I do not live by a hit 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:27.669
 Next I hold you I would have even tasted victory 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.279
 and they paint 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:31.779
 who wins 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.430
 only one 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.420
 Hakkari 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.880
 yes, these laughing 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.569
 Ha 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.589
 and that does 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:43.350
 on the nice so 2 the bosses defeated 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.219
 the Dr 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.519
 Togo's commod but delos dominate Spock 

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:50.529
 Menzel out 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.659
 Yes, it brings the Irish and benevolently won year 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.059
 or where Marco Wanderwitz he just the CIS 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:59.099
 Lehmann with the 1 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.059
 Speaking of Viridis percent 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:05.120
 Yota she also traveled though only in the American 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.509
 Cicero demanded 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.620
 Percent bio in the 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.069
 Japanese means that was in advance 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.509
 Pilgrimage was how to get there 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.619
 I do not want to know it though 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:21.969
 he is just going to introduce this quite well since child was born in Japan 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.139
 and Paramount as later 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.819
 said Seipp Serious word that was not normal 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.029
 it was not there 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:29.469
 it was Warber 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.939
 Problems with that I say goodbye that was it for today and 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:35.879
 he was on the
