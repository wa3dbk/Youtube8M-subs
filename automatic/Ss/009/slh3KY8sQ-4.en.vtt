better<00:00:35.450> than<00:00:35.960> thousand<00:00:36.410> year<00:00:36.530> door<00:00:36.680> I<00:00:38.829> would

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
better than thousand year door I would

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.430 
better than thousand year door I would
I<00:00:41.680> take<00:00:42.680> back<00:00:42.920> what<00:00:42.980> I<00:00:43.280> said<00:00:43.370> about<00:00:44.440> newer
