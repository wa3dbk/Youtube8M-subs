 federer in the most important game of the 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.579
 year that was considered that way by the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.649

 This San Antonio Spurs we see that you 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.440
 I won at Miami Heat in a global 4 to 1 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.360
 tony parker tim duncan and manu ginobili 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.860
 players of the spurs were the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.740
 most outstanding figures 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.200
 lebron james of the heat could not do anything 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.149
 let's go with these three we continue with what 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.340
 what happened yesterday removal of images with 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.470
 what happened last May with the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.110
 longed for 30 star for the colocolinos 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.729
 they beat as we are seeing 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.770
 santiago in three for the minimum account 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.259
 with a goal by felipe flores in the minute 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.149
 44 since 2009 that was being 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.710
 doing elusive 30 star stay 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.630
 the popular picture 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.409
 we see the images because we are going to pass 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.280
 the nasty top 4 for all 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:57.020
 in the pool club this happened on 28 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.119
 June this year in a match 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.470
 against neighbors in the framework of 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.660
 eighth of the end of the test 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.610
 where we lost 3-2 in penalties after 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.390
 have tied 1 to 1 of the regular time 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.390
 nice 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.600
 with what happened in the top 5 with germany 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.610
 world champion there we see where the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.010
 German box beat for the account 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.500
 minimum to the Argentines in the final 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.700
 disputed in maracaná with golio goal 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.520
 götze in the minute 113 added the elongate 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.100
 obviously with this the German table 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.620
 crowned for the fourth time world champion 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.420
 we go with the top 6 that will be here appears 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.910
 Swiss since he was the champion of the cup 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.950
 davis won the final he won the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.260
 final to france for a global 3 to 1 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.380
 in the city of federer would jump lynn 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.720
 they were the heroes so is this with me 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.820
 will keen tsonga and richard gasquet no 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.550
 they could do nothing before the Swiss army 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.990
 we went through what happens in the top 7 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.850
 which are the three most signings 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.010
 important one of the most important 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.660
 of the world soccer 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.120
 alexis sanchez that today worked and jaime 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.040
 rodríguez alexis who passed from barcelona 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.990
 to the arsenal claudio degree of the real 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.830
 society to barcelona and james what 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.070
 we see on screen 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.040
 from monaco to real madrid but we're leaving 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.900
 to top 8 to formula 1 since lewis 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 hamilton was the champion 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.250
 of Mercedes at the end-to-end ratio in 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.709
 this year's season won 11 of the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.310
 19 races adding up guess how many 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.400
 points how many points 384 points very 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.560

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.659
 we went with the top 9 there we are seeing 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.159
 the images of hamilton here we passed 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.489
 with the top 9 with what happened in 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.510
 Spain last June with the championship 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.430
 of adult global basketball where usa 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.799

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.319
 won in the final to serbia percent 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:53.900
 1895 in a game free of rivalry 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.620
 you can say and finally our top 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.680
 10 is new zealand song in rugby 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.900

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.549
 Argentina springboks from south africa and the 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.650
 australia wallabies these images 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.590

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.539
 the new Dutch by 27-25 in a 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.910
 party that was declared as the best 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.430
