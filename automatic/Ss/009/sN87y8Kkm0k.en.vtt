because if they're piloting this they

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
the time or something like I don't know

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.529 
the time or something like I don't know
that's<00:00:29.890> kind<00:00:30.099> of<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.249> big<00:00:30.669> open<00:00:31.060> ended<00:00:31.210> question

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
that's kind of a big open ended question

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.330 
that's kind of a big open ended question
here<00:00:31.720> it's<00:00:31.960> it's<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.529> huge<00:00:32.740> ship<00:00:32.980> they<00:00:33.190> need<00:00:33.310> a

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
here it's it's a huge ship they need a

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.890 
here it's it's a huge ship they need a
lot<00:00:33.490> of<00:00:33.550> people<00:00:33.820> demand<00:00:34.150> it<00:00:34.240> it<00:00:34.360> can't<00:00:34.540> be<00:00:34.600> the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
lot of people demand it it can't be the

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.510 
lot of people demand it it can't be the
two<00:00:35.020> of<00:00:35.050> them<00:00:35.320> right<00:00:35.470> that's<00:00:35.829> you<00:00:36.010> I<00:00:36.190> think<00:00:36.430> the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
two of them right that's you I think the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.830 
two of them right that's you I think the
bigger<00:00:36.670> question<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:37.180> how<00:00:37.360> does<00:00:37.420> this<00:00:37.600> fit

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
bigger question is how does this fit

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.690 
bigger question is how does this fit
into<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:38.170> context<00:00:38.650> of<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.829> story<00:00:39.070> so<00:00:39.490> it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
into the context of the story so it

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.940 
into the context of the story so it
seems<00:00:40.390> like<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:41.020> Rebel<00:00:41.320> Alliance<00:00:41.410> is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
seems like the Rebel Alliance is

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.450 
seems like the Rebel Alliance is
capturing<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.030> repurposing<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.950> Imperial

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
capturing and repurposing the Imperial

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.720 
capturing and repurposing the Imperial
fleet<00:00:45.490> for<00:00:46.030> their<00:00:46.150> own<00:00:46.920> uses<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.190> even<00:00:48.640> the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
fleet for their own uses and even the

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.280 
fleet for their own uses and even the
only<00:00:48.850> turn<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.180> Jenna<00:00:49.390> they<00:00:49.600> captured<00:00:50.050> that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
only turn the Jenna they captured that

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.080 
only turn the Jenna they captured that
the<00:00:50.590> shuttle<00:00:50.890> tydirium<00:00:51.310> and<00:00:51.700> used<00:00:51.910> it<00:00:52.060> to

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
the shuttle tydirium and used it to

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.060 
the shuttle tydirium and used it to
sneak<00:00:52.390> in<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.600> end<00:00:52.750> or<00:00:52.960> yeah<00:00:53.320> but<00:00:53.560> I<00:00:53.590> don't

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
sneak in the end or yeah but I don't

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.990 
sneak in the end or yeah but I don't
know<00:00:54.220> if<00:00:54.280> they're<00:00:54.400> going<00:00:54.490> to<00:00:54.580> be<00:00:54.640> fooling

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
know if they're going to be fooling

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.210 
know if they're going to be fooling
anyone<00:00:55.180> with<00:00:55.330> a<00:00:55.450> superstar<00:00:55.930> yeah<00:00:56.500> Adam<00:00:57.070> could

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
anyone with a superstar yeah Adam could

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.370 
anyone with a superstar yeah Adam could
there<00:00:57.310> be<00:00:57.340> but<00:00:57.940> maybe<00:00:58.090> it's<00:00:58.390> like<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.660> huge

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
there be but maybe it's like a huge

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.470 
there be but maybe it's like a huge
weapon<00:00:59.800> right<00:01:00.190> now<00:01:00.580> so<00:01:00.760> maybe<00:01:00.880> they're<00:01:01.120> using

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
weapon right now so maybe they're using

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.970 
weapon right now so maybe they're using
it<00:01:01.600> as<00:01:01.750> like<00:01:02.020> it's<00:01:02.230> like<00:01:02.410> capturing<00:01:02.830> a

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
it as like it's like capturing a

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.920 
it as like it's like capturing a
battleship<00:01:03.370> yeah<00:01:03.970> in<00:01:04.180> World<00:01:04.479> War<00:01:04.540> two<00:01:04.689> and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
battleship yeah in World War two and

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.429 
battleship yeah in World War two and
then<00:01:05.259> you<00:01:05.590> know<00:01:06.360> Kappa<00:01:07.360> taking<00:01:08.170> everyone

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
then you know Kappa taking everyone

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.899 
then you know Kappa taking everyone
prisoner<00:01:08.799> and<00:01:08.920> then<00:01:09.040> using<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:09.549> for<00:01:09.700> your<00:01:09.790> own

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
prisoner and then using it for your own

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.940 
prisoner and then using it for your own
purposes<00:01:10.150> yeah<00:01:10.810> use<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.289> against<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.679> enemy

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
purposes yeah use it against the enemy

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.160 
purposes yeah use it against the enemy
well<00:01:12.399> another<00:01:12.700> idea<00:01:13.030> too<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.570> like<00:01:13.840> maybe

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
well another idea too is that like maybe

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.169 
well another idea too is that like maybe
because<00:01:15.100> we're<00:01:15.249> surprised<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.670> Empire<00:01:15.909> still

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
because we're surprised the Empire still

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.819 
because we're surprised the Empire still
around<00:01:16.420> maybe<00:01:16.689> there's<00:01:17.140> factions<00:01:17.619> that<00:01:17.679> have

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
around maybe there's factions that have

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.620 
around maybe there's factions that have
joined<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.280> rebels<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.060> like<00:01:19.210> these

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
joined the rebels and like these

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.090 
joined the rebels and like these
factions<00:01:19.990> have<00:01:20.170> taken<00:01:20.469> some<00:01:20.649> of<00:01:20.679> the<00:01:20.859> the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
factions have taken some of the the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.529 
factions have taken some of the the

with like the the rebels now well that's
actually<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:28.450> just<00:01:28.810> occurred<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.079> me<00:01:29.170> that's

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
actually this just occurred to me that's

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.529 
actually this just occurred to me that's
quite<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.069> premise<00:01:30.909> of<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.119> original

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
quite the premise of the original

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.569 
quite the premise of the original
trilogy<00:01:31.749> because<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.890> Empire<00:01:33.249> is<00:01:33.549> the

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
trilogy because the Empire is the

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
that's why how do we end up with Mon

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.709 
that's why how do we end up with Mon
Calamari<00:01:48.189> cruisers<00:01:48.880> in<00:01:49.030> return<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.509> judge

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
Calamari cruisers in return the judge

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.389 
Calamari cruisers in return the judge
just<00:01:49.899> as<00:01:50.109> an<00:01:50.229> example<00:01:50.319> of<00:01:50.740> something<00:01:51.219> like

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
just as an example of something like

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.429 
just as an example of something like
that<00:01:51.459> so<00:01:51.909> maybe<00:01:52.420> that's<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.869> shore<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.170> next

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
that so maybe that's the shore the next

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.719 
that so maybe that's the shore the next
step<00:01:53.679> yeah<00:01:54.009> is<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:54.189> they're<00:01:54.399> getting<00:01:54.490> like

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
step yeah is that they're getting like

step yeah is that they're getting like
larger<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.359> more<00:01:55.479> tillery<00:01:55.959> from<00:01:56.170> these
