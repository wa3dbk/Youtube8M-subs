00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 hello everyone this video is dedicated to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.730
 home tools topics and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.309
 indirectly to electronics or 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.400
 how to attach a wiring to a component 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.750
 and that it is resistant 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.119
 following the steps of our friend and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.050
 comrade commanded the pilgrims of the canal 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.439
 without qualifications tv in did a rap and nador or 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.410
 collided with a lollipop stick yo 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.080
 I followed his steps and choose one with a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 rivet and do it by showing a video 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.739
 previous, since nothing is going to gratinate a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.290
 element and I'm going to present you another 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.610
 tool that I used then nothing 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.450
 we walk the leg of a component and 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.330
 now we will see what I want to show you 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.190
 nothing we use the walker as we already 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.010
 You have seen in a previous video how 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.310
 this and nothing there we have the component 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.830
 subject with the good cable what I want 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.110
 show you now in this video is the same 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.800
 you saw a recorder I want you with 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.040
 show a sheller or like 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.690
 we would remove the component cable already 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.960
 that the same once it has been 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.640
 subject is quite complicated when 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.470
 can you do with pliers you will tell me 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.330
 but good with the help of a small 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.880
 screwdriver but hey there's a 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.710
 specific tool is a tear 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.810
 comber when we buy one 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.119
 commercially because it has tips 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.400
 interchangeable in a tip we have the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.380
 great computer and in the other we take it out 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.650
 the turn we have the disagreement opinion 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.260
 I made a cassette 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.500
 to make a good home one let's see 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.270
 how does it work? 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.859
 component 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.350
 we started spinning until we got 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.270
 hold the man little by little until 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.530
 we reach a point that the wire like 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.409
 You see is loose does not work 100% with a 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.750
 gratitude commercial gratin there 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.569
 recognize it but good the task of 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.209
 laminar us solves nothing because we 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.649
 to see how we would give to do it as 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.899
 base as for the other tool 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.349
 of the refiner we are going to use a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.700
 rivet one of the small size of 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.700
 about three millimeters 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.460
 inside tip if getting really is 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.100
 even finer very much better 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.250
 what we do is 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.210
 as in the previous case we will remove the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.080
 inner tip 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.480
 to 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.150
 and what I have done has been to undo the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.790
 tip because it 's pretty 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.120
 wide I have tried different ways and the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.220
 more effective is pulling the tip 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.240
 of the rivet 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.210
 with the help of pliers 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.230
 we leave the same in this case 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.630
 I've slightly spent a little bit but 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.730
 good 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.320
 the base that wants to explain you is how 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.120
 we would give and then already if you have to do 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.660
 tests as nothing is being done 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.610
 we hold 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.640
 the tip on the rivet 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.890
 and in the part where it is plugged in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.350
 little by little with the help of a lime 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.920
 we are retouching 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.920
 We are filing the tip of the rivet 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.780
 I already say this is only from 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.830
 demonstrations we would be filing the and what 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.080
 what we would do would be to file the oblique 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.750
 slightly and only one lateral 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.780
 only one part the other part does not 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.330
 I would greatly encourage you to see the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.840
 toe how it has been 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.840
 As you can see, it is lightly filed by a 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.270
 lateral and the other side is not 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.130
 animated is made for the same 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.200
 as we have seen 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.160
 and I 've said it only animated by a 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.980
 lateral as something for the remains of 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.290
 for the tool as you see 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.160
 used the handle of a razor 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.120
 shaving is a tool an element 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.190
 recycling 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.050
 very used by me in many of my 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.330
 You've seen videos and more videos than 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.030
 you are going to see on this subject nothing I have 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.600
 removed the part of the cutout blade 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.600
 the toe 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.819
 the rivet will slightly limamos 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.340
 side that we have not lowered if we have 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:28.220
 made the recess on this side 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.830
 We will take this other 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.550
 we made a small recess to them in order 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.630
 that the rivet is perfectly 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.690
 adapted to the handle of the razor with 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.120
 Two component glue we make 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.020
 the mix of these instant dsk's 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.629
 dried in 20 minutes 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.240
 we put the glue put the 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:55.060
 We will place the rivet of the rivet in order 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.139
 that the recess is on our face 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.530
 view and we will have finished our 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.669
 demining tool as you see not 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.500
 has used the whole step because 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.930
 It really is to dedicate a little bit of 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.630
 time to do it and the mechanics that it has 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.350
 it is very simple very simple 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.970
 crush the rivet slightly 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.680
 even with a big plier better than 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.330
 Do me the first thing I did with a 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.630
 smaller pliers costs a little more 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.360
 but the crushing that we give is more 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.480
 small and much smaller therefore the 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.740
 tip is more appropriate we filed a 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.500
 little bit and stick the rivet of the rivet 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.120
 to the handle of the razor and 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.530
 we will have made our tool 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.500
 homemade gratin wiring such 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.090
 as it was shown earlier hope for nothing 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.820
 that this little video helps you 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.640
 that the topic of homemade tools 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.130
 we are strengthening it every day more and 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.060
 nothing I hope you liked 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.010
 approximately then we will see some that 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.590
 another tool a greeting and that you follow 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.920
 visiting the website of the videos for the 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.920
 same
