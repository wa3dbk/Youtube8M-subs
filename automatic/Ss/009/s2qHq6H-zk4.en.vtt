00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello my name is kevin a lot of numbers 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.790
 and probably many who once in childhood 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.420
 i max payne 1 and max payne 2 on my 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.710
 retirement mi-2 and retirement miter 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.010
 they wanted to play him he his new 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.630
 computers with intel core i5 they are the seventh 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.220
 but there is such a problem the game engine 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.730
 not calculated then multicore 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 rendering 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.460
 and because of this if if the computer 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 works in run mode multiple 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.469
 cores then it just doesn't start then 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.469
 is there if you are trying to run and 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.930
 the computer thinks for a while and 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:58.489
 forgets it going on in the processes and I 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:01:01.170
 need to kill in order to run it 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.909
 we need to do the next dance with 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 tambourine create a text document 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:15.930
 call it business as well as enter 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 here it is with the next command here 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.799
 this team does so in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.439
 only one computer was used 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:29.400
 CPU core for computing means 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.210
 game.exe is what you should write 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 What is the name of your review ? 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.140
 to this game but I called it a game 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.439
 exo you may be called max payne 2 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.710
 or copies of Max Payne but something like this is 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:48.810
 I understand how to work 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.810
 then click file so if as 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.950
 do not change the name of the text to 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.740
 go that is what bi shvat say it 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:08.580
 case you close the notebook you do not need 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:12.120
 can remove run batch file all 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.010
 you started max payne with you was 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.740
 Kevin multi digits I will explain how 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.280
 launch max payne 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.260
 well and max payne 2 most likely it will be 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.810
 work with other games because it 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.190
 not sharpened by max payne is where 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.200
 water most likely on all games in general 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.950
 okay bye everyone 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 I hope that you
