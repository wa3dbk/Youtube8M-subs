00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
extensive quality control testing before

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.250 
extensive quality control testing before
they<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.550> into<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.030> field<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:49.050> sure

they go out into the field to make sure
you<00:00:49.469> know<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.680> sized<00:00:49.950> them<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> traps

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
you know we sized them for the traps

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
you know we sized them for the traps
okay<00:00:52.050> yeah<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.070> make<00:00:53.250> sure<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.520> gaps

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
okay yeah you know make sure the gaps

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.630 
okay yeah you know make sure the gaps
are<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:55.219> check<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.430> any<00:00:56.579> loose<00:00:56.910> throughs

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
are right check for any loose throughs

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.930 
are right check for any loose throughs
quality<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.820> know<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.550> way<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.910> works

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
quality you know so the way it works

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.509 
quality you know so the way it works
here<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.140> traps<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
here is the traps it's in the in the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.500 
here is the traps it's in the in the
open<00:01:05.939> end<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> V<00:01:07.909> yep<00:01:10.580> okay<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.270> what's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
open end of the V yep okay and what's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
open end of the V yep okay and what's
how<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.110> work<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.590> what's<00:01:13.799> why<00:01:14.159> this

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
how does this work like what's why this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
how does this work like what's why this
what<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.310> well<00:01:17.750> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.170> good

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
what is it for well this is really good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830 
what is it for well this is really good
in<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.710> river<00:01:20.040> or<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> creek<00:01:20.909> situation<00:01:21.659> where

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
in a river or a creek situation where

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
in a river or a creek situation where
you<00:01:21.900> got<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> fluctuating<00:01:22.680> water<00:01:23.220> levels

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you got the fluctuating water levels

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.280 
you got the fluctuating water levels
uh-huh

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
uh-huh

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.550 
uh-huh
so<00:01:25.410> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.710> walking<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.050> front<00:01:28.380> end

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
so this is walking so the front end

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.000 
so this is walking so the front end
would<00:01:28.770> float<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.640> before<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.420> front<00:01:30.750> end<00:01:31.020> antrum

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
would float up before a front end antrum

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:49.130 
would float up before a front end antrum
by<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> front<00:01:32.820> end<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.900> top

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
by the front end so just on the top

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
by the front end so just on the top
there<00:01:49.440> on<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.980> top<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.790> put<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.120> cast

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
there on the top here you put the cast

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.690 
there on the top here you put the cast
around<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.620> could<00:01:52.800> screw<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.340> some

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
around or or you could screw in some

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.790 
around or or you could screw in some
bait<00:01:54.240> sticks<00:01:54.660> like<00:01:54.870> some<00:01:55.050> freshly<00:01:55.350> peeled

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
bait sticks like some freshly peeled

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.960 
bait sticks like some freshly peeled
back<00:01:56.190> poplar<00:01:56.970> poeple<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:01.440> can<00:02:02.160> say<00:02:02.430> poeple
