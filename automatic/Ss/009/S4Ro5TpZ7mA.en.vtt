00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.230
 Well, that's all it's all gone 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.089
 welcome tutorial in this new 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.620
 video today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.880
 to optimize your battery on 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.429
 smartphone 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.800
 here is android I think it works 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.439
 also on iphone but I do not know if 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 this application there is in any case 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:26.730
 I will record this video with this 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 shout I do not know what we're going to be 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.489
 find on my phone so in 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.989
 of a 3 2 1 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.770
 so here we are going to throw the ball to 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.840
 battery doctor software which so you 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.590
 help optimize your battery so 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.770
 there we see that I am in search 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.200
 because I was 5% that time in 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.219
 speaking of that it was more than five 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.539
 days that I did not have to change and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.690
 so here's here I click on 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.120
 diagnose and we can see the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 executed applications and that is I 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.570
 can optimize then what we do 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.160
 is that I activate the wifi and the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.070
 bluetooth because there's nothing really 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.140
 optimized one can see mahmoud behind 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.060
 so I remake the game click on the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.770
 button and we can see that I can 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.740
 optimized to gain 11 minutes 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.270
 I click on optimizing so here it is 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.979
 I won 11 minutes of my battery 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.119
 so that's not very consistent 11 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.979
 minutes we say it's good but a 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.240
 no one must first know that 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.060
 usually it's a lot longer 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.780
 that we can win and in addition 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.130
 young Czech at 5% and therefore inevitably I 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.960
 will hold much longer if I 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.530
 am 100% and I will win some 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.930
 thing like I do not know an hour like 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.939
 it then here we can see that can be closed 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.079
 applications that will also 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.990
 optimize the battery so here I have 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.369
 finished so for the video the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.729
 presentation on android I apologize 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.170
 she's a little fast and it's hard to follow 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.760
 finally here I hope that kind of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.110
 enjoy your videos 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.950
 for blaise pardon is obviously so 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.960
 you want to learn you for example 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.670
 save your your android down 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.620
 it's possible and if you want 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.140
 other tutorial on one on android 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.899
