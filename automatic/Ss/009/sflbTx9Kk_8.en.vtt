00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:24.449
 I love leaving the rehearsal. 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 completely on top I was going to be 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:36.420
 another place receives at home the passage 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.640
 sound and wondered how 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.790
 it would be your attention I know of my 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790
 responsibility 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 goose 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.469
 Botafogo 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.600
 I'll talk a little bit about the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.710
 goal difference of judgment of 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:29.910
 state of grace 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:39.119
 Only then I want to talk discuss the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:43.550
 scenario is the presence always awaiting 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.550
 authorization of the young voice is aggravated 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.070
 Let's get people to kaká. 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.060
 good night rio de janeiro 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:12.160
 the decoration for what happens to the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:16.470
 people I'm going to send that voice from beyond 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:24.120
 from Italy 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:26.600
 is a coconut factor has someone outside 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.600
 rhythm of play 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:45.930
 again what he was doing 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:53.700
 the attacker already cried a lot Fado 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:57.990
 joló heart coming out of the mouth 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.360
 the preparations for this week of rehearsal 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.620
 so the days were really very 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.360
 exciting 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.270
 I wondered what it would be like to 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.250
 reaction maybe happen 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.880
 I think it's practically like generating a 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.030
 teenage son 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.070

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.740
 there was this voice in these eight thousand people 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.880

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.890

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.560
 Today I invite everyone for a trip. 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:41.690

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:41.690
