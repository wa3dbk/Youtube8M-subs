00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 was tested in four different 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.670
 Scenarios with a standing pedestrian 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.830
 a child walking behind 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.719
 a vehicle runs out and one 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.430
 pedestrian who enters the street 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.609
 but then the result remains 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.320
 can convince that even if the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.779
 systems still have potential upwards 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.670
 the overall result is consistently positive 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 with the pedestrian protection assistant 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.869
 can really still live saved 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.480
 are best cut in the test 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.030
 have the systems of lexus and follow 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 you can be the only candidate for the test 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.840
 accidents in the most difficult 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.329
 test situation with the covert in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.329
 Running child determined I avoid 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.250
 when suddenly stopping adult 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.410
 but lexus reacted over and krems for 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.010
 the driver something frightening almost until 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.010
 to the stand 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.930
 Although the Mercedes crew is safe brake 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.020
 with stereo camera and several radars 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.730
 technically on a high end stood the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.220
 However, braking remains behind 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.720
 back from volvo and lexus 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.240
 for example, an accident with the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.960
 adult walking only up to 20 km / h 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.000
 be avoided bmw offers one 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.070
 cheap system and indeed nationwide 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.350
 over almost the entire product range 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.490
 Unfortunately, that can not be complete until the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.230
 standstill brakes 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.970
 But the driver is after the warning 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.680
 when braked comes one 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.280
 reaction is the braking effect a lot 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.560
 faster than usual that was 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.390
 retrofit system mobileye is at 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.110
 pedestrian protection, however, no real 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.630
 alternative 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.170
 The driver is here only acoustically 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.330
 warned 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.080
 That can be about a second before the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.420
 Impact is just too late 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.580
 the assistant systems of the tested 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.970
 Automobile manufacturers were able to get the adac 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.140
 however, it is convincing for that 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.119
 Desired vehicle such a system 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.460
 you should definitely be able to get it 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.840
 order it because you avoid it 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.470
 an accident has happened several times 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.470
 paid for
