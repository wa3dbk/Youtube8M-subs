 50 to fahrenheit 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.250
 as 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.250
 what a first coup 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:46.480
 this place is for my bread a little bit 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.480
 fry will be generally plague 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.319
 we can keep open too 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.859
 as they say with smoke everything was history 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.129

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.980

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:08.060

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.180
 family such an event here but in the summer and 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.180

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.180

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.419

 made squirrels with such good 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:30.109
 Tomatoes give of course the plague because 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:33.669
 coup one more and the condition of this 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:36.230
 bacon well degree roasted sti 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:39.349
 I like something to be a little bit 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.349

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.440
 they black screen is still in English 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.379

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:56.409
 then what the doctor ordered 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:56.409

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.500

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.410
 blue eyes a little bit 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.720
 so if you get something a little bit 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:18.170
 burned too good but small 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:20.630

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.850
 stand for five minutes you can collect proteins 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:43.010

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:50.090
 mayonnaise is the most important thing to be sharp 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:51.440
 I always make a knife on two sides 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.820
 the stoves 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:07.380
 people do everything differently to the cashier 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:09.510

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.970

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:36.600
