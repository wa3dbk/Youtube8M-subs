00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
and if anybody know what this random

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.600 
and if anybody know what this random
noise<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.319> sounds<00:03:12.590> like<00:03:12.739> air<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.340> don't<00:03:13.519> know

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
noise is it sounds like air I don't know

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.300 
noise is it sounds like air I don't know
what<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.849> is<00:03:13.909> maybe<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.480> built<00:03:15.159> but<00:03:16.159> it

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
what it is maybe it's the built but it

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.339 
what it is maybe it's the built but it
sounds<00:03:16.549> like<00:03:16.700> not<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.480> built<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.900> sounds<00:03:18.230> like

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
sounds like not the built it sounds like

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.720 
sounds like not the built it sounds like
it's<00:03:18.500> actually<00:03:18.799> coming<00:03:18.980> from<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.310> right<00:03:19.489> side

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
it's actually coming from the right side

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.530 
it's actually coming from the right side
of<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:19.970> car

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.760 

possibly<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.569> think<00:03:27.720> they<00:03:28.080> can<00:03:28.260> give<00:03:28.440> us<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.560> tune

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
possibly I think they can give us a tune

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:37.820 
possibly I think they can give us a tune
up<00:03:31.940> when<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> go<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.239> step<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.720> my<00:03:33.840> brakes<00:03:36.830> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
up when I go to step on my brakes the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.140 
up when I go to step on my brakes the
car<00:03:37.860> actually<00:03:40.010> moves<00:03:41.010> around<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.550> lot<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:44.150> you

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
car actually moves around a lot so you

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.650 
car actually moves around a lot so you
see<00:03:45.300> that<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:46.370> step<00:03:47.370> off<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.730> brakes<00:03:47.970> at<00:03:48.300> idles

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
see that I step off the brakes at idles

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.720 
see that I step off the brakes at idles
fine

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
fine

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.820 
fine
step<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.000> brakes<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.599> engine<00:03:51.989> starts

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
step on the brakes the engine starts

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.800 
step on the brakes the engine starts
doing<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.430> weird<00:03:53.700> noise<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.090> jumping<00:03:54.720> up

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
