00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.430
 hey we are with qualcomm on the ifa 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.590
 Be under the top smart watch in 2013 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.930
 interesting concept for the device has 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.360
 no normal led lcd or amoled 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.619
 display but a so-called mirasol 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.300
 This is a kind of ink 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.980
 Technology, however, with 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.420
 color representation and the whole 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.619
 also works in the sun without 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.000
 problems without one 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.730
 backlight is used 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.220
 because occurrences are based on a concept 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.070
 which is also true for butterflies 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.979
 example has already perfected nature 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.589
 because the light is from so to speak of 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:47.110
 Air can be reflected so that it 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.940
 seems bright or at least similar 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.470
 of course not quite as bright but come 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.879
 quite similar to the whole thing 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.479
 as in a wing of the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.190
 butterfly 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.540
 the advantage is as I said it is 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.909
 also read in the super bright sun 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.699
 You can do that with leds and amulets 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.960
 and lcds not so good 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.489
 another advantage is that too 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.799
 color can be represented and 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.000
 moving pictures open the animations 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.979
 Of course, not quite as fluid as on 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.040
 the led displays or others 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.330
 liquid displays we watch us 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.430
 the device more closely markus 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.930
 we are now in the so-called 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.469
 in the standby, so to speak, and there are still 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.600
 a whole series of different watch 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.740
 faces so watches variations that is here 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.850
 now in version da is the top 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.619
 time of day display plus there's 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.329
 calendar dates and when we go back over 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.840
 second touch this touch 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.789
 we let show further variants 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.360
 for example, the weather and the 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.190
 calendars and share prices 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.030
 there come with the choir share price 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.130
 For example, we go to the menu in the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.330
 we're treading down here are off 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.250
 sensors in it yet another 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.440
 specialty of choir come see which 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.150
 the color representation again clearly 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.740
 better and there are a bunch of apps 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.479
 for example to through five in 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.860
 Phone calls everything works 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.950
 of course only did with the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.570
 smartphone via bluetooth 4.0 so that you 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.920
 including short messages 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.010
 there can be a bunch of 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.660
 in front of defined messages one can 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.790
 also read messages status updates and 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.679
 so on we go back 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.640
 here the calendar including all 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.959
 appointments of the colleagues of qualcomm and it 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.370
 will always go back down here 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.350
 typed and otherwise you move 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.310
 by wiping on the touchscreen 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.290
 of course back and forth 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.640
 There is simply a music player only 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.680
 Unfortunately bluetooth works 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.870
 There are 24 GB memory integrated 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.370
 but they are just for caching 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.050
 Data used by the smartphone 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.580
 but not to listening to music that will 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.580
 So as with the galaxy, for example 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.400
 a bluetooth connection to the smartphone 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.739
 Of course, there is still need 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.170
 A weather app that picks up your data 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.450
 also from the smartphone via bluetooth and 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.709
 more apps are also on board 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.780
 because in between just now 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.989
 we would try it 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.989
 once again 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.170
 they will make it clear again 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.460
 then again eg in deep as I said it 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 are also settings and everything 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.970
 possible to set among others that 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.950
 The clock just does not work 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.690
 radio should communicate if you eg 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.890
 sits just airborne let's go 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.720
 very briefly in the shade and there sees 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.520
 one then that the display despite his 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.410
 technology is still easy to read 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.940
 you should be in the bunker 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.100
 You can just go to the top of the clock 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.610
 tap twice and it will be the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.920
 Backlight activates the 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.690
 now hopefully there we have the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.190
 backlight and so can 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.020
 you then read the clock in the dark 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.880
 without any problems with the hardware is to say 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.860
 there is a arm in there an arm 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.600
 cortex m3 it is an embedded processor 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.880
 with well below 300 megahertz 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.980
 works a lot gigabyte flash as I said 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.800
 The display has a resolution or a 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.180
 pixel density of 240 pixels per inch so 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.070
 very high resolution but that is because 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.510
 That's just it's supposed to be that's one 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.280
 works a little differently than at 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.950
 normal leds to the top sensors like 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.720
 said they are in the bracelet 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.130
 even down here have the touch 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.260
 strip the touchscreen will 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.580
 deactivated if one is the standby and 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.200
 otherwise there is one down here 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.489
 special feature that is the battery because of 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.290
 Battery is not above the clock 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.010
 even so they built something thinner 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.840
 can be 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.820
 so you do not make for great grief 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.250
 but has the battery in it 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.769
 lower part and the clock should be soon 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.970
 be available in the usa quad come 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.859
 we complete the sales ourselves 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.440
 take over if should be novum for 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.090
 be the company you want some 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.530
 10,000 pieces for sale at a price 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.620
 from about 300 dollars 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.729
 yes that's the comcom talk on the ifa 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.150
 2013 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.150
 Thank you very much
