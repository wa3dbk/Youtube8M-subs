basically no restrictions the design

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.910 
basically no restrictions the design
processes<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.660> very<00:01:18.660> similar<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.440> way<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
processes is very similar to the way you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.969 
processes is very similar to the way you
would<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:21.110> designing<00:01:22.110> anything<00:01:22.680> else

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
would go about designing anything else

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
would go about designing anything else
