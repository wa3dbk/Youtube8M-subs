00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
breaking out that much lately so that

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.910 
breaking out that much lately so that
just<00:02:31.030> goes<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.420> show<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.959> for<00:02:32.590> me<00:02:32.739> at<00:02:32.890> least

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
scrub was really nice too because it

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.800 
scrub was really nice too because it
just<00:02:38.920> had<00:02:39.129> more<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.549> tingling<00:02:39.970> effect<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.569> I

just had more of a tingling effect and I

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.660 
just had more of a tingling effect and I
like<00:02:41.409> that<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.069> nivea<00:02:42.430> body<00:02:42.569> lotion<00:02:43.569> bath

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
swash thing was completely gone within

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.390 
swash thing was completely gone within
like<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.750> first<00:02:49.840> week<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.440> us<00:02:50.590> having<00:02:51.069> it<00:02:51.220> I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
like the first week of us having it I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.979 
like the first week of us having it I
wouldn't<00:02:51.700> say<00:02:51.849> it's<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.299> magical

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
wouldn't say it's like this magical

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.410 
wouldn't say it's like this magical
thing<00:02:53.049> because<00:02:53.889> there's<00:02:54.609> probably<00:02:55.030> shaving

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
thing because there's probably shaving

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.759

the<00:02:56.920> same<00:02:57.159> thing<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.359> just<00:02:58.629> thought<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.840> was

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
the same thing but I just thought it was
