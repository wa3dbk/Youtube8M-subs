00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.280 

okay<00:00:07.000> the<00:00:07.150> most<00:00:07.300> common<00:00:07.780> problem<00:00:08.170> you're

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
okay the most common problem you're

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.320 
okay the most common problem you're
gonna<00:00:08.350> run<00:00:08.470> into<00:00:09.040> with<00:00:09.220> this<00:00:09.400> type<00:00:09.670> of<00:00:09.880> furnace

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
gonna run into with this type of furnace

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.780 
gonna run into with this type of furnace
is<00:00:10.540> you<00:00:10.660> come<00:00:10.900> up<00:00:11.200> to<00:00:11.650> it<00:00:11.980> and<00:00:12.070> the<00:00:12.190> inducers

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
is you come up to it and the inducers

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.920 
is you come up to it and the inducers
running<00:00:13.300> but<00:00:13.690> there's<00:00:14.230> no<00:00:14.500> flame<00:00:15.390> so<00:00:16.390> you<00:00:16.450> shut

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
running but there's no flame so you shut

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.890 
running but there's no flame so you shut
it<00:00:16.960> down<00:00:17.260> and<00:00:18.210> then<00:00:19.210> you<00:00:19.360> turn<00:00:19.570> it<00:00:19.600> back<00:00:19.720> on

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
it down and then you turn it back on

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.960 
it down and then you turn it back on
again<00:00:20.170> and<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.510> burner<00:00:22.750> lights<00:00:23.790> but<00:00:24.790> then

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
again and the burner lights but then

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.750 
again and the burner lights but then
it's<00:00:25.120> safeties<00:00:25.600> out<00:00:26.100> after<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:27.220> trial<00:00:27.520> for

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
it's safeties out after the trial for

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.360 
it's safeties out after the trial for
ignition<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:29.320> very<00:00:29.560> common<00:00:30.160> with<00:00:30.970> these

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.370 
ignition it's very common with these

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.160 
ignition it's very common with these
these<00:00:33.370> furnaces<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.739> they<00:00:36.190> sensed<00:00:36.850> flame

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
these furnaces because they sensed flame

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.619 
these furnaces because they sensed flame
with<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.739> hot<00:00:38.949> surface<00:00:39.429> igniter

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.040 

now<00:00:43.530> that's<00:00:43.769> your<00:00:44.070> ignition<00:00:44.370> control<00:00:45.050> it's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
now that's your ignition control it's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.459 
now that's your ignition control it's
usually<00:00:47.899> it's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.079> problem<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:50.089> the<00:00:51.469> flame

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
usually it's a problem with the flame

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.899 
usually it's a problem with the flame
safety<00:00:52.920> control<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:53.519> that's<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
safety control because that's what that

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.000 
safety control because that's what that
actually<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> flame<00:00:55.019> safety<00:00:55.440> control<00:00:55.800> we

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
actually is the flame safety control we

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.759 
actually is the flame safety control we
call<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> control<00:00:56.760> box<00:00:57.059> or<00:00:57.559> ignition<00:00:58.559> control

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
call the control box or ignition control

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.399 
call the control box or ignition control
and<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.430> but<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.540> is<00:01:00.659> a<00:01:00.690> flame<00:01:00.989> safety

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
and so on but it is a flame safety

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.920 
and so on but it is a flame safety
control<00:01:02.089> because<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.210> turns<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> gas

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
control because it turns on the gas

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.190 
control because it turns on the gas
valve<00:01:04.259> make<00:01:04.500> sure<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> gas<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:06.200> burning

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
valve make sure the gas is burning

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.050 
valve make sure the gas is burning
inside<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.399> heat<00:01:08.909> exchanger<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.840> proves<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
inside the heat exchanger and proves it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.749 
inside the heat exchanger and proves it
because<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.180> proves<00:01:12.509> with<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.590> hot<00:01:14.340> surface

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
because it proves with the hot surface

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.059 
because it proves with the hot surface
igniter<00:01:15.590> there<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.679> been<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> lot<00:01:16.979> of

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
igniter there have been a lot of

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.380 
igniter there have been a lot of
problems<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:20.000> what<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.179> going<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
problems with and what you're going to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
problems with and what you're going to
have<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.899> you're<00:01:22.050> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> come<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
have is you're going to come to this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.290 
have is you're going to come to this
thing<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.399> no<00:01:23.550> lights<00:01:23.819> on<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.179> or

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
thing there's no lights on it or

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.240 
thing there's no lights on it or
anything<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.659> shut<00:01:24.929> it<00:01:24.960> off<00:01:25.140> turn<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> back<00:01:25.710> on

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
anything you shut it off turn it back on

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
anything you shut it off turn it back on
it'll<00:01:26.729> attempt<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.119> start<00:01:27.360> again<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.840> may

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it'll attempt to start again it may

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
it'll attempt to start again it may
start<00:01:28.289> normally<00:01:28.800> then<00:01:30.590> if<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.909> more

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
start normally then if you have more

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210 
start normally then if you have more
failures<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:34.890> gonna<00:01:34.950> have

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
failures with it then you're gonna have

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.749 
failures with it then you're gonna have
to<00:01:35.340> figure<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.700> what<00:01:36.210> has<00:01:36.330> happened<00:01:36.950> on<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to figure out what has happened on this

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.570 
to figure out what has happened on this
machine<00:01:39.350> if<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.440> doesn't<00:01:40.740> light<00:01:40.890> at<00:01:41.039> all<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
machine if it doesn't light at all you

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.940 
machine if it doesn't light at all you
got<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> pretty<00:01:42.659> good<00:01:42.780> chance<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.649> there's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
got a pretty good chance if there's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.569 
got a pretty good chance if there's
power<00:01:44.190> coming<00:01:44.520> pins<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.240> board<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:46.579> if

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
power coming pins in this board and if

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.870 
power coming pins in this board and if
there<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> no<00:01:48.299> flame<00:01:48.659> or<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:49.950> flame<00:01:50.189> comes<00:01:50.549> on

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
there is no flame or the flame comes on

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.080 
there is no flame or the flame comes on
and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:52.020> shuts<00:01:52.380> down<00:01:52.680> after<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.490> trial<00:01:53.789> for

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and then shuts down after the trial for

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.830 
and then shuts down after the trial for
ignition<00:01:54.590> then<00:01:55.590> you've<00:01:55.920> got<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> problem<00:01:56.840> with

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
ignition then you've got a problem with

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.609 
ignition then you've got a problem with
that<00:01:58.049> board<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> you'll<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.039> replace<00:01:59.310> it
