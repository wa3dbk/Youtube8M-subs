and what you do about it because let's
start<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> age<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.609> these<00:00:29.789> trees<00:00:30.060> these

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
start with the age of these trees these

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.340 
start with the age of these trees these
trees<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:31.080> six<00:00:31.589> years<00:00:31.800> old<00:00:33.350> typically

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
trees are about six years old typically

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.600 
trees are about six years old typically
they<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:34.950> bit<00:00:35.100> bigger<00:00:35.310> than<00:00:35.490> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
they be a little bit bigger than this

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.250 
they be a little bit bigger than this
even<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.060> we<00:00:36.150> initially<00:00:36.750> had<00:00:36.810> some<00:00:37.080> deer

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
even but we initially had some deer

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.840 
even but we initially had some deer
damage<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.890> particular<00:00:38.040> orchard<00:00:38.640> which

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
damage in this particular orchard which

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.560 
damage in this particular orchard which
can<00:00:39.660> happen<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:40.200> young<00:00:40.530> tender<00:00:41.130> trees<00:00:41.570> but

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
can happen with young tender trees but

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.530 
can happen with young tender trees but
these<00:00:42.750> trees<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.200> very<00:00:43.860> mature<00:00:44.610> they're

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
these trees are very mature they're

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.260 
these trees are very mature they're
starting<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> bear<00:00:46.170> some<00:00:46.380> fruit<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
starting to bear some fruit the the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270 
starting to bear some fruit the the
trees<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.900> in<00:00:49.200> California<00:00:49.740> typically<00:00:50.130> they

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
trees here in California typically they

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.460 
trees here in California typically they
would<00:00:50.460> bear<00:00:50.670> much<00:00:50.910> earlier<00:00:51.360> janna<00:00:51.870> life<00:00:52.050> cycle

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
would bear much earlier janna life cycle

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.950 
would bear much earlier janna life cycle
but<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.040> in<00:00:53.130> Oregon<00:00:53.490> it's<00:00:53.610> about<00:00:53.820> double<00:00:54.240> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
but here in Oregon it's about double so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.750 
but here in Oregon it's about double so
right<00:00:55.140> around<00:00:55.290> four<00:00:55.860> years<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.580> we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
right around four years is when we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.280 
right around four years is when we
started<00:00:57.090> seeing<00:00:57.240> some<00:00:57.480> fruit<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.810> these<00:00:57.960> trees

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
started seeing some fruit on these trees

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
modern processing for olives it's more

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.180 
modern processing for olives it's more
of<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.420> mill<00:01:53.690> there<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:54.290> isn't<00:01:54.590> real<00:01:54.710> pressing

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
of a mill there just isn't real pressing

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.730 
of a mill there just isn't real pressing
that<00:01:55.280> happens<00:01:55.640> these<00:01:55.760> days<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:57.560> is

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
that happens these days and this this is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.840 
that happens these days and this this is
the<00:01:57.800> only<00:01:57.890> one<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.160> Oregon<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:58.520> came<00:01:58.730> from

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the only one in Oregon this came from

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.060 
the only one in Oregon this came from
Italy<00:01:59.030> this<00:01:59.390> came<00:01:59.570> from<00:01:59.690> Italy<00:01:59.900> it's<00:02:00.830> the

Italy this came from Italy it's the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.980 
Italy this came from Italy it's the
largest<00:02:01.400> commercial<00:02:01.880> mill<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.450> really<00:02:02.900> in

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
largest commercial mill and really in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.830 
largest commercial mill and really in
the<00:02:03.140> entire<00:02:03.770> Northwest<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.670> it's<00:02:05.600> really

the entire Northwest and it's really

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.180 
the entire Northwest and it's really
just<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.080> state<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.470> art<00:02:06.530> for<00:02:06.920> making

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
just a state of the art for making

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.490 
just a state of the art for making
incredibly<00:02:07.940> fine<00:02:08.119> although<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:08.990> take<00:02:09.470> us

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
incredibly fine although so take us

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.170 
incredibly fine although so take us
through<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.890> quick<00:02:10.280> walkthrough<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.940> what

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
through a quick walkthrough of what

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.910 
through a quick walkthrough of what
happens<00:02:11.930> with<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> olives<00:02:12.560> once<00:02:12.740> they're

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
happens with the olives once they're

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.280 
happens with the olives once they're
picked<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.340> here<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.060> first<00:02:14.420> step<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:15.080> want

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
picked in here so first step is we want

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.290 
picked in here so first step is we want
to<00:02:15.320> wash<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.800> fruit<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:16.940> important

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
to wash the fruit it's really important

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.060 
to wash the fruit it's really important
that<00:02:17.360> we<00:02:17.480> get<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.750> as<00:02:17.870> clean<00:02:18.140> as<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:18.890> any

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
that we get it as clean as we can so any

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.280 
that we get it as clean as we can so any
sort<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.370> impurities<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.210> know<00:02:20.330> imparted<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
sort of impurities you know imparted to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.470 
sort of impurities you know imparted to
the<00:02:21.410> oils<00:02:21.709> can<00:02:22.040> be<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> real<00:02:22.490> problem<00:02:22.640> from

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
the oils can be a real problem from

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.310 
the oils can be a real problem from
there<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:24.320> basically<00:02:25.220> hammer<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.480> olive<00:02:26.959> pit

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
there we basically hammer the olive pit

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.010 
there we basically hammer the olive pit
skin<00:02:28.010> everything<00:02:28.850> into<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> paste<00:02:29.420> oh<00:02:29.690> it's

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
skin everything into a paste oh it's

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.650 
skin everything into a paste oh it's
interesting<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.440> lot<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.860> good<00:02:31.100> oil

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
interesting a lot of the good oil

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.150 
interesting a lot of the good oil
characteristics<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.810> flavor<00:02:33.050> come<00:02:33.620> out<00:02:33.890> of

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
characteristics and flavor come out of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.490 
characteristics and flavor come out of
the<00:02:34.310> pit<00:02:34.550> really<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:35.390> we<00:02:35.540> fit<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.870> put<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.290> pit

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the pit really so we fit to put the pit

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.310 
the pit really so we fit to put the pit
and<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.920> paste<00:02:37.190> into<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.790> tank<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.450> slowly<00:02:38.810> turn

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
and the paste into a tank we slowly turn

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.490 
and the paste into a tank we slowly turn
that<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:39.920> about<00:02:40.010> an<00:02:40.610> hour<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.900> heat<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.110> up<00:02:42.320> to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
that for about an hour we heat it up to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.590 
that for about an hour we heat it up to
about<00:02:42.590> 80<00:02:42.950> degrees<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.730> that's<00:02:44.330> where<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
about 80 degrees and that's where the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.750 
about 80 degrees and that's where the
real<00:02:44.630> separation<00:02:45.110> occurs<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.040> from<00:02:46.459> there<00:02:46.610> we

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
real separation occurs and from there we

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.540 
real separation occurs and from there we
go<00:02:46.910> through<00:02:47.150> two<00:02:48.160> centrifuges<00:02:49.160> first

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
go through two centrifuges first

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.790 
go through two centrifuges first
centrifuge<00:02:50.090> removes<00:02:50.540> solids<00:02:51.350> from<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.769> oil

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
centrifuge removes solids from the oil

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.530 
centrifuge removes solids from the oil
in<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.190> water<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.640> then<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.330> last

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
in the water and then the last

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.210 
in the water and then the last
centrifuge<00:02:54.140> removes<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.709> water<00:02:54.890> from<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
centrifuge removes the water from the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.580 
centrifuge removes the water from the
oil<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.670> then<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.330> have<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:57.170> know<00:02:57.260> really

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
we'll sell that oil but it only has a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.140 
we'll sell that oil but it only has a
shelf<00:03:23.860> life<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.129> about<00:03:24.190> 90<00:03:24.610> days<00:03:24.790> because<00:03:25.120> of

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
shelf life of about 90 days because of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.539 
shelf life of about 90 days because of
the<00:03:25.330> high<00:03:25.450> sediment<00:03:25.750> load<00:03:26.140> so<00:03:26.890> what<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.430> do

with the rest of that oil so we let it

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.949 
with the rest of that oil so we let it
set<00:03:29.319> over<00:03:29.650> time<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.370> oil<00:03:31.120> will<00:03:31.450> clarify

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
set over time and that oil will clarify

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
thing about that is that you know the

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.270 
thing about that is that you know the
climate<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.410> soil<00:04:02.620> conditions<00:04:03.129> here

climate and the soil conditions here

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.819 
climate and the soil conditions here
really<00:04:03.579> lends<00:04:03.849> itself<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.299> intense<00:04:04.930> oils<00:04:05.500> yeah

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
really lends itself to intense oils yeah

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.380 
and so you know we'll blend in organelle
but<00:04:08.769> it's<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.010> gives<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.310> really<00:04:09.549> strong<00:04:10.030> flavor

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390
