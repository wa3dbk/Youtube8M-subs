00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 4 we are here in time and everything is 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 is saying the typical nonsense of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.330
 you always know that these dialogues do not 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.730
 I like you know how important is the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.570
 history and the cinematics and we arrived 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.600
 to the temple to channel my weapons where 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.630
 There was my great dragonball chamuco and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 he got the trabuco apiqroo I think 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.500
 that first face sale of migra because 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.560
 It makes me much weaker than itch or 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.469
 in this fight and tron I still have it seems that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 that the clown charged them are already more 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.950
 dead that all I'm going all are 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.570
 dead is already more dead than creel and 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.329
 generally crime is always dead 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.980
 even in spirit and they are wrong 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.910
 fighting against this if they get not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.530
 they had the same level but good here yes 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.020
 What's up 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.899
 and he gets like crazy this is also he 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.450
 put the devil and explode the earth in a 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.059
 cachito 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:07.159
 the earth that is the worst imitation of 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.690
 gokhan in history 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.610
 and exploits the weasel 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.060
 and it ends there 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.200
 and well , the white background is already 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.200
 it is the earth 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 yes yes yes blah blah yah I know that I do not 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.970

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.810
 videos and remember to comment because the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.170

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.070
 is giving advice behind what 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.479
 more obvious wii then defeat the bastard if 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.700
 You want me to let you make assholes 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.979
 defeat the obviously thrones that you 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.680

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.950
 true that we are going to face peak in 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.420
 scorched 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.750
 and well these before I 'm in 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.729
 the beating of his life they had to merge 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.270
 before not what 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.050
 I already knew the bastard peak 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.930
 the real enemy itching or hypnotized or 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.120
 be the hypnotized trolley that's a 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.970
 tinted sign of when chalk sign 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.950
 they put you to sit and stop you they put you 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
 as well as in two chairs is an entity believe 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.990
 that is not a planchita speaks 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.530
 I 'm never nuanced and I think it's not 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.570
 I know I do not believe in those things but who knows 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.330
 you take two million pretty weak for 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.610
 be that woman or dragon that is very weak 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.250
 or the best are already more strong 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.390
 I know it is the most powerful in the universe 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.280
 They do not bother telling me what's good 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.700
 similar combo is not mentally 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.390
 increased ten times more go go go 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.300
 that that palm tree is strong I do it in your 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.430
 mega camera has increased ten times but 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.380
 it was destroyed by krillin also that is 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.120
 Do not miss realism 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.630
 but good as they found us this 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.030
 piccolo in scorched there is 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.100
 he is running from here to there fleeing 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.270
 and cowardly let's start with the 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.610
 deadly combos 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.810
 already started with his pinche tricks of 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.730
 July- ok or if you write it I do not understand 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.010
 how the hell did it hit me to hit 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.420
 we get serious and I transform his 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.610
 character takes the evanescent web 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.010
 it hurt me the one who remembered 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.260
 the characters that suddenly without excuse 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.590
 some can cover the ball 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.370
 evanescent another failure recalls that in 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.830

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.530

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.480

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.930
 his training is not supposed to be what 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.419

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.060

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.580

 typical, I am the insect 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.370
 because it's going to take my guard off another 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.610
