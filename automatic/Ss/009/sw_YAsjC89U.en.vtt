 that she is extraordinary but such a 1 2 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.930
 the next two carcasses 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:58.120
 but from the company lancome here that is the first 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.720
 mascara that is almost over by me 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:06.370

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.720
 I think I like her so much 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.669
 further there are such sparkles for 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.299

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:34.100

 such here are bright shiny shadows to me 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.680
 like it but you are rarely honest 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.160
 used because they are too 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.230
 bright and that is just a date 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.560
