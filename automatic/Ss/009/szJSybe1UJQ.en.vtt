Fuse is a mobile app that allows you to send images and videos from your mobile devices directly to the TechSmith products you love.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.733
First, you need to install Fuse on your Android or iOS device, or on your Windows tablet.

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:24.633
The app is available from Google Play, the App Store, and the Windows Store.

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:29.166
In this tutorial, we’ll cover connecting from an Android or iOS device.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:34.999
If you’re using a Windows tablet, you may want to check out this tutorial instead.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.600
Next, make sure your mobile device and computer are connected to the same network.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:50.633
Otherwise, Fuse may be unable to send content to Camtasia. Now, let's launch Fuse. The application opens to the Camera view.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:55.533
If you need to record a video or take a photo, tap the corresponding button here.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:01:03.699
Or, if there's already an image or video on your mobile device that you want to send to Camtasia, tap the Library button.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:12.833
The Library consists of three tabs. First, there's the Fuse Library, which contains images or videos captured with the app itself.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:16.699
The other two tabs pull media directly from your device.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:26.166
If you have images or videos in your Gallery or Camera roll, those will show up in this tab and any screenshots you’ve taken will be here.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:34.366
If you’re using an iOS device, you’ll need to allow Fuse access to your Camera Roll before it can populate these tabs.

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:38.932
Next, tap the image or video you want to send to Camtasia.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:46.833
If you want to send more than one, tap and hold until you see a checkmark appear then select the additional media.

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:58.666
When you’re ready to send everything to Camtasia, tap the Share icon, then Camtasia, and then Connect to Camtasia.

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:06.832
Now open Camtasia on your computer and select File &gt; Connect Mobile Device.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:12.466
Grab your mobile device and point the Scanner in Fuse at the QR code in the dialog.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:17.966
Position the camera so the QR code is centered within the corners of the Scanner.

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:25.032
Once the Scanner reads the QR code, the images or videos you selected will be sent to the clip bin in Camtasia.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:32.133
As long as Fuse and Camtasia are connected, you can continue to send as many images and videos as you want.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:44.133
