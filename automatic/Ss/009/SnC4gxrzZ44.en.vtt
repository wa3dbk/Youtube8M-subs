review now you've probably noticed that

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.370 
review now you've probably noticed that
the<00:00:07.919> 3gs<00:00:08.610> looks<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.269> like<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.630> 3g<00:00:10.139> and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the 3gs looks just like the 3g and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.400 
the 3gs looks just like the 3g and
indeed<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:12.030> exteriors<00:00:12.690> are<00:00:12.900> virtually

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
indeed the exteriors are virtually

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.930 
indeed the exteriors are virtually
identical<00:00:15.350> however<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.890> 3gs<00:00:17.490> there<00:00:17.789> are<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
identical however on the 3gs there are a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.720 
identical however on the 3gs there are a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.609 
microphone now like i mentioned before
the<00:01:08.369> 3gs<00:01:08.909> has<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> faster<00:01:09.600> processor<00:01:09.630> than<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the 3gs has a faster processor than the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.580 
the 3gs has a faster processor than the
3g<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.939> what<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> version<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
3g so what I have here is a version of

3g so what I have here is a version of
howardforums<00:01:14.010> let's<00:01:14.790> locate<00:01:15.180> that's<00:01:15.570> hosted

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
howardforums let's locate that's hosted

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.780 
howardforums let's locate that's hosted
locally<00:01:17.330> their<00:01:18.330> ads<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:19.170> being<00:01:19.500> removed<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
locally their ads have being removed so

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.630 
locally their ads have being removed so
all<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> information<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.590> being<00:01:23.070> pulled<00:01:23.400> off

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
all the information is being pulled off

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.800 
all the information is being pulled off
one<00:01:23.939> server<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.869> let's<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:26.420> iphone<00:01:27.420> can

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
one server so let's see which iphone can

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.859 
one server so let's see which iphone can
render<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.650> page<00:01:28.909> fastest<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.390> ready<00:01:30.630> set

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
render the page fastest so all ready set

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.170 
render the page fastest so all ready set
go<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> 3gs<00:01:35.759> has<00:01:35.970> already

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
go so as you can see the 3gs has already

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.429 
go so as you can see the 3gs has already
started<00:01:36.570> loading<00:01:37.020> whereas<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> 3g<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.490> still

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
started loading whereas the 3g is still

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.319 
started loading whereas the 3g is still
there<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.680> done<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> 3g<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:44.329> grinding

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
there it's done here the 3g is grinding

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.710 
there it's done here the 3g is grinding
away<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.340> i've<00:01:47.340> never<00:01:47.640> found<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.060> 3g<00:01:48.509> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
away at it and i've never found a 3g to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.920 
away at it and i've never found a 3g to
be<00:01:48.990> particularly<00:01:49.950> slow<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> 3gs<00:01:51.689> is

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
be particularly slow so the 3gs is

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.910 
be particularly slow so the 3gs is
pretty<00:01:52.439> fast<00:01:54.320> now<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.470> thing<00:01:55.500> i<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.890> about

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
pretty fast now one thing i like about

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.780 
pretty fast now one thing i like about
the<00:01:56.340> 3gs<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.020> Apple<00:01:58.770> hasn't<00:01:59.009> changed

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the 3gs is that I Apple hasn't changed

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.480 
the 3gs is that I Apple hasn't changed
the<00:02:00.180> shape<00:02:00.960> at<00:02:01.290> all<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.950> here<00:02:02.579> i<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.850> 3g

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
the shape at all so here i have a 3g

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.670 
the shape at all so here i have a 3g
you'll<00:02:05.490> notice<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.780> case<00:02:07.079> fits<00:02:07.469> it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
you'll notice it this case fits it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.150 
you'll notice it this case fits it
nicely<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:09.060> also<00:02:09.209> fits

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
nicely and it also fits

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.630 
nicely and it also fits
the<00:02:11.160> 3gs<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:12.990> if<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.710> have<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> case<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.520> your

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
the 3gs so if you have a case for your

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.150 
the 3gs so if you have a case for your
3g<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.270> you're<00:02:15.360> upgrading<00:02:15.510> well<00:02:16.500> it'll<00:02:16.860> work

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
3g and you're upgrading well it'll work

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.820 
3g and you're upgrading well it'll work
with<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.610> 3gs<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> 3gs<00:02:23.670> runs<00:02:24.000> OS<00:02:24.510> 3<00:02:24.990> which

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
with the 3gs now the 3gs runs OS 3 which

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.030 
with the 3gs now the 3gs runs OS 3 which
brings<00:02:26.670> some<00:02:27.000> improvements<00:02:27.600> over<00:02:27.720> OS<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
brings some improvements over OS to the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.180 
brings some improvements over OS to the
most<00:02:29.220> noticeable<00:02:29.820> being<00:02:30.120> mms<00:02:30.600> support

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
most noticeable being mms support

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.900 
most noticeable being mms support
copying<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.310> pasting<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:33.030> tethering<00:02:33.660> i

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
copying and pasting and tethering i

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.100 
copying and pasting and tethering i
should<00:02:35.910> point<00:02:36.030> out<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.210> these<00:02:36.510> features<00:02:36.960> are

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
should point out that these features are

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.890 
should point out that these features are
already<00:02:37.410> available<00:02:37.710> are<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:38.700> available<00:02:38.970> for

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
already available are now available for

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.500
