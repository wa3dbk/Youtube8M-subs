about<00:00:43.389> this<00:00:43.600> fight<00:00:43.809> I<00:00:43.839> think<00:00:44.050> it's<00:00:44.139> a<00:00:44.199> very

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
about this fight I think it's a very

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.039 
about this fight I think it's a very
entertaining<00:00:44.559> fight<00:00:45.129> I<00:00:45.690> think<00:00:46.690> it's<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:46.839> fight

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.049 
entertaining fight I think it's a fight

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.229 
entertaining fight I think it's a fight
that<00:00:47.079> Manny<00:00:47.739> Pacquiao<00:00:48.159> will<00:00:48.339> win<00:00:48.519> I<00:00:48.699> think<00:00:49.149> it

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
that Manny Pacquiao will win I think it

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.239 
that Manny Pacquiao will win I think it
favors<00:00:49.420> Manny<00:00:49.870> Pacquiao<00:00:50.319> more<00:00:50.679> than<00:00:50.920> Ruslan

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
favors Manny Pacquiao more than Ruslan

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.369 
favors Manny Pacquiao more than Ruslan
provodnikov<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.420> without<00:00:52.659> being<00:00:52.929> said<00:00:53.199> this

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
provodnikov but without being said this

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.649 
provodnikov but without being said this
is<00:00:53.499> one<00:00:53.949> hell<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.339> an<00:00:54.549> entertaining<00:00:55.209> fight<00:00:55.389> man

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
is one hell of an entertaining fight man

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.340 
is one hell of an entertaining fight man
and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:58.329> problem<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.719> have<00:00:58.749> with<00:00:58.899> this<00:00:59.049> fight

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
and the problem I have with this fight

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.319 
and the problem I have with this fight
is<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.619> boat<00:00:59.829> guys<00:01:00.069> are<00:01:00.369> trained<00:01:00.729> by<00:01:00.940> Freddie

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
is that boat guys are trained by Freddie

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.630 
is that boat guys are trained by Freddie
Roach<00:01:02.159> so<00:01:03.159> this<00:01:03.459> means<00:01:03.729> that<00:01:03.989> Freddie<00:01:04.989> Roach

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
Roach so this means that Freddie Roach

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.920 
Roach so this means that Freddie Roach
has<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.910> choose<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.540> course<00:01:07.750> it's<00:01:07.900> going

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
has to choose and of course it's going

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.080 
has to choose and of course it's going
to<00:01:08.110> choose<00:01:08.410> Manny<00:01:08.860> Pacquiao<00:01:09.310> it's<00:01:09.490> been<00:01:09.670> his

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
to choose Manny Pacquiao it's been his

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.430 
to choose Manny Pacquiao it's been his
been<00:01:10.300> with<00:01:10.450> Manny<00:01:10.630> Pacquiao<00:01:11.050> way<00:01:11.200> much<00:01:11.410> more

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.760 
been with Manny Pacquiao way much more
longer<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:12.640> rasam<00:01:13.450> provodnikov<00:01:13.780> has<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.530> go

wasn't really into this fight it didn't

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.060 
wasn't really into this fight it didn't
want<00:01:36.730> to<00:01:36.820> fight<00:01:37.000> pacquiao<00:01:37.870> but<00:01:38.590> now<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.950> looks

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
want to fight pacquiao but now it looks

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.890 
want to fight pacquiao but now it looks
like<00:01:39.220> he's<00:01:39.460> very<00:01:39.550> interested<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.540> this<00:01:40.630> fight

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
like he's very interested in this fight

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.130 
like he's very interested in this fight
and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:46.180> would<00:01:46.360> be<00:01:46.510> one<00:01:46.659> have<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.870> fight

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
and then this would be one have a fight

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.480 
and then this would be one have a fight
though<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:47.440> my<00:01:47.590> opinion<00:01:47.620> I<00:01:47.920> think<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.220> one

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
though in my opinion I think it's one

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.520 
though in my opinion I think it's one
hell<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.700> an<00:01:48.820> entertaining<00:01:49.360> fight<00:01:49.540> if<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:50.350> does

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
hell of an entertaining fight if it does

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.220 
hell of an entertaining fight if it does
happen<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:51.040> April<00:01:51.400> all<00:01:51.760> I<00:01:52.390> hope<00:01:52.780> for<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:53.110> that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
happen in April all I hope for is that

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.969 
happen in April all I hope for is that
it<00:01:53.800> takes<00:01:54.190> place<00:01:54.490> at<00:01:54.700> 140<00:01:55.450> pounds<00:01:55.480> I<00:01:56.020> would

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
it takes place at 140 pounds I would

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.540 
it takes place at 140 pounds I would
love<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.130> satisfy<00:01:57.610> at<00:01:57.729> 140<00:01:58.360> pounds<00:01:59.159> for<00:02:00.159> so

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
love to satisfy at 140 pounds for so

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.010 
love to satisfy at 140 pounds for so
that<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.820> belt<00:02:01.030> will<00:02:01.270> be<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.600> line<00:02:01.780> if

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
that the belt will be in the line if

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.200 
that the belt will be in the line if
it's<00:02:02.380> at<00:02:02.560> 147<00:02:03.250> there<00:02:03.640> really<00:02:03.850> isn't<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.120> much

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
it's at 147 there really isn't that much

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.149 
it's at 147 there really isn't that much
meaning<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.050> other<00:02:05.229> than<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.830> fact<00:02:06.010> that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
meaning to it other than the fact that

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.899 
meaning to it other than the fact that
it's<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.820> money<00:02:07.570> fight<00:02:07.840> but<00:02:08.709> if<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.069> at<00:02:09.189> 140

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
it's a money fight but if it's at 140

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.339 
it's a money fight but if it's at 140
pounds<00:02:09.939> at<00:02:10.420> least<00:02:10.450> there's<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.899> belt<00:02:11.139> in<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
pounds at least there's a belt in the
