00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
and I won't be when today so I thought I

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.080 
and I won't be when today so I thought I
would<00:00:39.160> just<00:00:39.190> shoot<00:00:39.460> went<00:00:39.670> really<00:00:39.730> quickly

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
would just shoot went really quickly

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.610 
would just shoot went really quickly
hopefully<00:00:40.809> I<00:00:40.840> get<00:00:40.960> this<00:00:41.110> done<00:00:41.290> right<00:00:41.320> the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
hopefully I get this done right the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.979 
hopefully I get this done right the
first<00:00:41.650> I<00:00:42.040> don't<00:00:42.400> have<00:00:42.790> time<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.300> reshoot<00:00:43.690> and

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989
