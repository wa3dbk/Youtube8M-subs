times<00:01:12.539> own<00:01:14.119> security<00:01:15.119> gets<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.689> couldn't

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
times own security gets that I couldn't

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.900 
times own security gets that I couldn't
yeah<00:01:17.480> you<00:01:17.720> just<00:01:17.900> cut<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.110> groove<00:01:18.320> in<00:01:18.620> them<00:01:18.910> and

yeah you just cut a groove in them and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.730 
yeah you just cut a groove in them and
then<00:01:20.060> they<00:01:20.150> become<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.480> regular<00:01:22.090> screw<00:01:23.090> slot

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
then they become a regular screw slot

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.890 
then they become a regular screw slot
for<00:01:24.740> regular<00:01:25.040> screwdriver<00:01:25.310> or<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:27.590> course

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.330 

you<00:01:30.290> can<00:01:30.440> also<00:01:32.020> how<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.080> then<00:01:33.800> use<00:01:33.980> a<00:01:34.010> false

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
you can also how to then use a false

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.500 
you can also how to then use a false
