sets<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.030> drop<00:01:39.330> sets<00:01:39.630> things<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.410> these

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
sets or drop sets things like that these

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
sets or drop sets things like that these
are<00:01:41.100> things<00:01:41.370> that<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:42.000> used<00:01:42.300> to<00:01:42.690> be

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
are things that can be used to be

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.450 
are things that can be used to be
beneficial<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.190> saying

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
beneficial and I'm not saying

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.590 
beneficial and I'm not saying
necessarily<00:01:44.640> any<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.210> those<00:01:45.270> things<00:01:45.420> are

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
necessarily any of those things are

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
necessarily any of those things are
beneficial<00:01:45.780> I'll<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.500> into<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:46.680> video<00:01:46.980> on

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
beneficial I'll get into a video on

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.830 
beneficial I'll get into a video on
super<00:01:47.430> sets<00:01:47.610> drop<00:01:47.880> sets<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.300> all<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> stuff

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
super sets drop sets and all that stuff

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.130 
super sets drop sets and all that stuff
but<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.040> also<00:01:50.280> something<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.570> abused

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
but it's also something that if abused

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.540 
but it's also something that if abused
can<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.710> detrimental

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
can be detrimental

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.899 
can be detrimental
so<00:01:54.120> using<00:01:54.690> straps<00:01:55.140> too<00:01:55.530> often<00:01:55.980> in<00:01:56.190> my<00:01:56.490> opinion

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
so using straps too often in my opinion

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.250 
so using straps too often in my opinion
might<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.210> detrimental<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:57.990> training

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
might be detrimental to your training

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.680 
might be detrimental to your training
however<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.190> lot<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.550> this<00:01:59.730> and<00:02:00.000> most<00:02:00.180> things<00:02:00.510> in

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
however a lot of this and most things in

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.810 
however a lot of this and most things in
life<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.260> lot<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:01.920> personal<00:02:02.250> preference<00:02:02.700> in

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
life a lot of personal preference in

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.490 
life a lot of personal preference in
your<00:02:02.940> own<00:02:03.060> mindset<00:02:03.510> kind<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.930> come<00:02:04.080> into<00:02:04.290> play

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
your own mindset kind of come into play

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.680 
your own mindset kind of come into play
so<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:04.980> how<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.250> about<00:02:05.640> things<00:02:05.909> when

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
so this is how I think about things when

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.020 
so this is how I think about things when
I<00:02:06.720> train<00:02:07.110> anything<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:08.030> potentially

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
I train anything and potentially

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.259 
I train anything and potentially
consider<00:02:09.539> using<00:02:09.869> these<00:02:10.170> straps<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:11.180> kind<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
consider using these straps I kind of

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.210 
consider using these straps I kind of
mentally<00:02:12.659> ask<00:02:12.840> myself<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.530> question<00:02:13.590> of

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
mentally ask myself this question of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.880 
mentally ask myself this question of
what<00:02:14.849> am<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.030> trying<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.690> here<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.680> most

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
what am I trying to do here and in most

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.979 
what am I trying to do here and in most
cases<00:02:17.190> when<00:02:17.730> I'm<00:02:17.849> considering<00:02:18.389> using<00:02:18.540> straps

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
cases when I'm considering using straps

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.110 
cases when I'm considering using straps
it's<00:02:19.590> move<00:02:19.889> a<00:02:19.980> lot<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.249> weight<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:20.730> when<00:02:21.090> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
it's move a lot of weight because when I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.240 
it's move a lot of weight because when I
use<00:02:21.389> them<00:02:21.569> it's<00:02:21.780> more<00:02:21.930> than

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
use them it's more than

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.910 
use them it's more than
Leon<00:02:22.610> heavy<00:02:22.940> bent-over<00:02:23.390> rows<00:02:23.780> or<00:02:24.440> on<00:02:24.650> heavy

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
Leon heavy bent-over rows or on heavy

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.370 
Leon heavy bent-over rows or on heavy
deadlifts<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.240> if<00:02:26.540> there's<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.990> potential

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
deadlifts so if there's the potential

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.280 
deadlifts so if there's the potential
for<00:02:27.920> me<00:02:28.040> failing<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.000> lift<00:02:29.390> as<00:02:29.720> far<00:02:30.050> as<00:02:30.140> my

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
for me failing on this lift as far as my

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.410 
for me failing on this lift as far as my
grip<00:02:30.560> strength<00:02:30.590> goes<00:02:31.130> before<00:02:31.850> some<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.330> my

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
grip strength goes before some of my

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.270 
grip strength goes before some of my
other<00:02:32.630> muscle<00:02:33.020> groups<00:02:33.230> get<00:02:33.470> out<00:02:33.620> my<00:02:33.980> bigger

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
other muscle groups get out my bigger

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.710 
other muscle groups get out my bigger
muscle<00:02:34.670> groups<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.060> ones<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.360> are<00:02:35.450> more<00:02:35.630> in

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
muscle groups the ones that are more in

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.990 
muscle groups the ones that are more in
control<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.110> these<00:02:36.230> movements<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.950> might<00:02:37.700> use

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
control of these movements I might use

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.910 
control of these movements I might use
straps<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.990> make<00:02:39.140> sure<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.530> I'm<00:02:39.740> able

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
straps just to make sure that I'm able

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.860 
straps just to make sure that I'm able
to<00:02:40.070> move<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.490> weight<00:02:40.640> for<00:02:40.910> my<00:02:41.000> desired<00:02:41.420> amount

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
to move the weight for my desired amount

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.160 
to move the weight for my desired amount
of<00:02:42.110> reps<00:02:42.820> however<00:02:43.820> where<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.300> don't<00:02:44.660> use<00:02:44.900> them

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
of reps however where I don't use them

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.050 
of reps however where I don't use them
is<00:02:45.380> when<00:02:45.740> I'm<00:02:45.860> doing<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.220> set<00:02:46.490> of<00:02:46.670> something

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
is when I'm doing a set of something

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.699 
is when I'm doing a set of something
that<00:02:47.209> first<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.600> all<00:02:47.720> doesn't<00:02:48.020> recruit<00:02:48.440> heavy

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
that first of all doesn't recruit heavy

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.650 
that first of all doesn't recruit heavy
weights<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.640> if<00:02:49.730> I'm<00:02:49.850> doing<00:02:50.180> something<00:02:50.630> like

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
weights so if I'm doing something like

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.620 
weights so if I'm doing something like
maybe<00:02:51.080> lat<00:02:51.410> pull-downs<00:02:51.880> maybe<00:02:52.880> seated<00:02:53.390> cable

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
maybe lat pull-downs maybe seated cable

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.080 
maybe lat pull-downs maybe seated cable
rows<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.530> don't<00:02:55.130> really<00:02:55.310> see<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.700> point<00:02:55.940> of

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
rows I don't really see the point of

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.110 
rows I don't really see the point of
using<00:02:56.570> straps<00:02:56.930> in<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.500> circumstance<00:02:58.280> but

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
using straps in that circumstance but

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.510 
using straps in that circumstance but
again<00:02:59.720> going<00:03:00.320> with<00:03:00.440> heavy<00:03:00.830> weights<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.310> heavy

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
again going with heavy weights and heavy

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.180 
again going with heavy weights and heavy
compounds<00:03:02.180> they<00:03:02.300> can<00:03:02.510> be<00:03:02.660> very<00:03:02.900> beneficial

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
compounds they can be very beneficial

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.229 
compounds they can be very beneficial
now<00:03:04.190> some<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.489> people<00:03:04.580> out<00:03:04.760> there<00:03:04.820> will

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
now some of the people out there will

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.390 
now some of the people out there will
say<00:03:05.480> well<00:03:05.750> bro<00:03:06.080> you're<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.860> if<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.100> can't

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
say well bro you're a if you can't

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400 
say well bro you're a if you can't
move<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.640> weight<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.150> begin<00:03:08.690> with<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.080> can't

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
move that weight to begin with you can't

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.590 
move that weight to begin with you can't
hold<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.310> shouldn't<00:03:10.670> be<00:03:10.790> lifting<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.330> and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
hold it you shouldn't be lifting it and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.720 
hold it you shouldn't be lifting it and
I<00:03:12.170> can<00:03:12.380> kind<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.739> agree<00:03:12.980> from<00:03:13.250> somewhat<00:03:13.640> of

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
I can kind of agree from somewhat of

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.449 
I can kind of agree from somewhat of
that<00:03:13.880> mindset<00:03:14.300> if<00:03:14.690> your<00:03:15.380> primary<00:03:15.920> goal<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.430> to

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
that mindset if your primary goal is to

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.250 
that mindset if your primary goal is to
just<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.300> strongest<00:03:17.720> grip<00:03:17.959> strength

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
deadlifts I guess but I look at it as

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.610 
deadlifts I guess but I look at it as
more<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.329> complete<00:03:59.720> body<00:04:00.019> exercise

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
and their importance I want to make sure

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.250 
and their importance I want to make sure
I<00:04:09.440> work<00:04:09.680> at<00:04:09.860> them<00:04:10.010> till<00:04:10.700> failure<00:04:11.030> now<00:04:11.840> if<00:04:12.079> the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
I work at them till failure now if the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.930 
I work at them till failure now if the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
problem is that my grip strength isn't

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.000 
problem is that my grip strength isn't
strong<00:04:14.209> enough<00:04:14.239> to<00:04:14.540> get<00:04:15.079> me<00:04:15.200> there<00:04:15.470> then<00:04:15.980> I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
strong enough to get me there then I

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.219 
strong enough to get me there then I
might<00:04:16.489> again<00:04:16.820> use<00:04:17.150> straps<00:04:17.540> in<00:04:17.750> that<00:04:17.900> case

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
might again use straps in that case

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.440 
might again use straps in that case
however<00:04:18.829> if<00:04:19.190> I'm<00:04:19.310> going<00:04:19.609> lighter<00:04:19.910> or<00:04:20.209> not

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
however if I'm going lighter or not

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.780 
however if I'm going lighter or not
using<00:04:20.690> optimal<00:04:21.290> loads<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.890> don't<00:04:22.430> see<00:04:22.640> the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
using optimal loads I don't see the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.580 
using optimal loads I don't see the
point<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.210> using<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.660> straps<00:04:23.960> because<00:04:24.200> in

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
point in using the straps because in

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.800 
point in using the straps because in
