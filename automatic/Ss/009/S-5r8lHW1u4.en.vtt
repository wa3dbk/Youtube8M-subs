were<00:00:34.800> muzzle<00:00:35.160> loaders<00:00:35.750> that<00:00:36.750> means<00:00:37.020> the

were muzzle loaders that means the

were muzzle loaders that means the

muzzle that was more time consuming and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
more dangerous to the loader who could

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.080 
more dangerous to the loader who could

used<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.379> method<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.890> still<00:00:53.100> used<00:00:53.370> with

clearly<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.719> method<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.739> safer

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
clearly this method is going to be safer

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920 
clearly this method is going to be safer
for<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.489> shooter<00:00:59.789> who<00:00:59.969> remains<00:01:00.359> behind<00:01:00.600> the
