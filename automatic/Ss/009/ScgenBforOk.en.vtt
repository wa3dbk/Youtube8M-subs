00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.870
 as always we have various images 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.460

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.590
 left the stylized image of the 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.590
 frontal we now go to boxing 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.670
 inside we have 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.880
 the slim pc that we will see soon and 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.180
 inside the box we have this 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 package 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:29.560
 inside we have booklet with 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:34.840
 instructions and warranty the basis for 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 put the slim pc in vertical cd with i 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.070
 driver the power cord 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.630
 and the feeder we now turn to 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.850
 slim pc 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.200
 let's see some specific dimensions 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.120
 width 25.2 mm height 16.2 thickness 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.710
 3.85 weight a killer 250 grams 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.149
 compatible with windows seven and 32 e 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 64 bit montano ac more intel atom d2700 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.280
 dual core 2.13 gigahertz hyper 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.090
 treating so we will have two threads per 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.190
 core chipset nm10 world loves gpu radeon 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.410
 hard disk dvd player and burner 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.050
 internal 500 gigabyte card reader 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.880
 sd lan and wifi connectivity 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.420
 on the front we have the reader 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.400
 dvd burner a usb 2.0 port the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.650
 sd card reader and the key 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.930
 switching on with the power and LED lights inside 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.060
 hard disk in the back we have 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.420
 a hole for the kensington lock jack from 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.890
 3.5 mm for headphones and microphone a door 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.100
 RJ45 for Ethernet cable 4 USB ports 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.320
 2.0 a sub vga port an hdmi port 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.330
 and a port for the connector of 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.940
 power supply as you can see also 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.940
 we have two other video outputs a d sub 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.220
 vga and a hdmi but they are right and 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.590
 dates between pines in plastic and disabled 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.150
 probably at the hardware level indeed 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.700
 not even from bios I managed to 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.890
 enable them on the four sides and that is in the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.390
 upper lower left side 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.980
 and right 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.080
 we have many small holes for the 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.209
 air passage as it is a 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.190
 fanless system is very important not 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.910
 cover or build any of these 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.470
 sides 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.420
 otherwise we could compromise the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.670
 system cooling let's move on 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.650
 now inside the pc to open it is 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.030
 very simple, just unscrew this 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.030
 life located in the back 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.500
 here she is 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:10.120
 then he turns from the back to the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:12.780
 right side and here is one side turns 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.780
 on the other side 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.450
 just slide these mini bulkheads 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.930
 towards the back side and here it is 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:27.730
 the inside in one side we have a plate 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:31.120
 dissipating and dvd and cd player while 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.510
 on the other hand we have the hard disk and the 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.250
 ram 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.110
 the hard drive to the ahram can also 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.270
 be replaced in what way 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.150
 the hard disk will be enough to unscrew all the 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.050
 screws while for the ram 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.660
 it will be enough to do it in this way it is released and 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.610
 you pull as you see there are two slots in 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.220
 this way we can add more 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.990
 ram this slim pc to put it back 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:58.270
 simply slip it on and press 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.490
 lower inside we also can 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.500
 see other components as a reader 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.990
 sd card the network card another 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.460
 dissipating plate etc. not there 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.380
 list all simply for not 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.420
 make the video too tedious to 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.540
 closing it is very simple 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.940
 one of the bases especially this one 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.970
 here that has the hole in the most part 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.970
 internal you take the mini pc 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.790
 if then already up here almost towards the end 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.340
 this to that front panel yes 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.030
 you support that you accept that all sides 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.860
 have entered and pushes forward 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:42.650
 here is how you see here is entered then 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.530
 you take the other mini bulkhead with it 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.110
 same procedure leans there is 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.100
 turned on that all the data are entered e 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.100
 goes down 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.970
 here it rests defends the vine 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.250
 and syria life 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.490
 and here it is while in the lower part 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.260
 we can see the mounting holes 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.340
 of the base to mount the pc in 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.870
 vertical 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.540
 if we take the base in the part 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.780
 lower we have scotch by removing 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:21.610
 scotch we can see this network 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:28.030
 here it is, just insert it in here 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.030
 hook the base following the violins 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.469
 entrust the vine 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:42.749
 and here is what we can say about this 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.849
 product and if not the slim pc results 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:46.409
 obviously very silent that you give the 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.329
 its small size we could 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:50.489
 position it where we like without it 

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:52.259
 having space problems consumption is 

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:54.029
 also reduced to the minimum given the 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.009
 very minimal components e 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:58.799
 even as a mobile version 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.539
 the performance gpu treating 101 slim 

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:02.879
 pc result all in all enough 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:04.979
 good is definitely not a product 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:07.199
 suitable for gaming except of course for 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.689
 flash games facebook games or 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.999
 anyway games really very light me 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:14.939
 blow to a more multimedia use such as 

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:17.399
 watch movies listening to music a face 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:19.739
 light of office studying or otherwise 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.659
 not too demanding activities the pc 

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.729
 it is sold without an operating system 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:25.319
 so we should install it is us 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:29.099
 compatible as already mentioned at the beginning 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:33.569
 with windows seven 32 and 64 bit well 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:35.699
