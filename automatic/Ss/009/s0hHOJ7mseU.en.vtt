00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
ugly careers this is a really big step

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.050 
ugly careers this is a really big step
for<00:04:45.300> them<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.990> mean<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.610> sports<00:04:47.610> school

sports at the moment since Africa is
just<00:04:49.740> getting<00:04:49.889> bigger<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.250> bigger<00:04:50.400> and

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
just getting bigger and bigger and

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.670 
just getting bigger and bigger and
televising<00:04:51.599> a<00:04:51.660> schoolboy<00:04:52.020> rugby<00:04:52.200> is<00:04:52.440> really

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
televising a schoolboy rugby is really

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.060 
televising a schoolboy rugby is really
making<00:04:52.889> it<00:04:53.039> a<00:04:53.160> huge<00:04:53.639> actually<00:04:53.820> beat<00:04:54.090> some<00:04:54.360> two

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
making it a huge actually beat some two

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.650 
making it a huge actually beat some two
networks<00:04:56.070> on<00:04:56.250> television<00:04:56.849> and<00:04:56.970> boys<00:04:57.479> are

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
networks on television and boys are

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.210 
networks on television and boys are
really<00:04:57.750> Africa<00:04:58.320> that's<00:04:58.530> all<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:58.800> really<00:04:58.860> fired

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
really Africa that's all it really fired

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.860 
really Africa that's all it really fired
them<00:04:59.400> up<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.760> think<00:05:00.210> there's<00:05:00.419> just<00:05:00.599> too<00:05:00.750> much

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
them up I think there's just too much

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.629 
them up I think there's just too much
pressure<00:05:00.930> on<00:05:01.289> schoolboy<00:05:01.710> rugby<00:05:01.889> as<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.430> and

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
pressure on schoolboy rugby as it is and

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.310 
pressure on schoolboy rugby as it is and
it's<00:05:02.910> our<00:05:03.060> job<00:05:03.090> as<00:05:03.360> heads<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.050> leaders<00:05:04.289> of

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
it's our job as heads and leaders of

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.710 
it's our job as heads and leaders of
schools<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.950> actually<00:05:05.400> help<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.060> boys<00:05:06.270> keep

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
schools to actually help the boys keep

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.110 
schools to actually help the boys keep
it<00:05:06.840> at<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.020> spectrum<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.950> fact<00:05:08.250> is<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.610> very

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
it at the spectrum the fact is that very

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.969 
it at the spectrum the fact is that very
very<00:05:09.210> few<00:05:09.419> people<00:05:09.930> can<00:05:09.960> make<00:05:10.229> a<00:05:10.470> living<00:05:10.800> out<00:05:10.919> of

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
very few people can make a living out of

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.320 
very few people can make a living out of
professional<00:05:11.520> sports<00:05:11.760> or<00:05:12.000> particularly

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
professional sports or particularly

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.230 
professional sports or particularly
rugby<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.950> fundamentally<00:05:14.940> we're<00:05:15.120> an

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
rugby and that fundamentally we're an

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.940 
rugby and that fundamentally we're an
academic<00:05:15.720> institution<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.500> there's<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.800> whole

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
academic institution but there's a whole

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.070 
academic institution but there's a whole
lot<00:05:17.099> of<00:05:17.190> wonderful<00:05:17.370> things<00:05:18.080> including

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
lot of wonderful things including

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.379 
lot of wonderful things including
playing<00:05:19.320> sport<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.919> still<00:05:20.849> think<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:21.210> there's

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
playing sport I still think that there's

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.420 
playing sport I still think that there's
something<00:05:21.510> really<00:05:22.380> special<00:05:22.500> about<00:05:23.010> the<00:05:23.310> way

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
something really special about the way

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.940 
something really special about the way
school<00:05:23.789> rugby<00:05:23.970> is<00:05:24.240> played<00:05:24.539> it's<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.590> it's<00:05:25.620> an

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
school rugby is played it's a it's an

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.520 
school rugby is played it's a it's an
exciting<00:05:26.460> brand<00:05:26.729> of<00:05:26.910> rugby<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.660> we<00:05:27.840> see<00:05:28.050> it

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
exciting brand of rugby that we see it

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.640 
exciting brand of rugby that we see it
brings<00:05:28.950> out<00:05:29.180> cards<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.539> are<00:05:30.660> that<00:05:31.320> they're

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
brings out cards that are that they're

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.580 
brings out cards that are that they're
driving<00:05:32.099> provincial<00:05:32.610> games<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.120> so<00:05:33.960> you<00:05:34.560> know

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
driving provincial games and so you know

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.560 
driving provincial games and so you know
from<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:35.370> point<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.729> view<00:05:35.789> I<00:05:35.910> think<00:05:36.030> that<00:05:36.419> the

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
from that point of view I think that the

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.390 
from that point of view I think that the
boys<00:05:36.780> are<00:05:37.080> really<00:05:37.590> really<00:05:37.800> looking<00:05:38.130> forward

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
boys are really really looking forward

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.920 
boys are really really looking forward
it's<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.639> wonderful<00:05:39.000> opportunity<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.750> be<00:05:39.900> on

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
it's a wonderful opportunity to be on

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.500 
it's a wonderful opportunity to be on
television<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:41.520> it's<00:05:41.789> so<00:05:41.940> that<00:05:42.120> certainly

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
television and it's so that certainly

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.230 
television and it's so that certainly
does<00:05:42.719> add<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.110> add<00:05:43.469> a<00:05:43.500> bit<00:05:43.710> of<00:05:43.740> pressure<00:05:44.240> but

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
does add the add a bit of pressure but

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.880 
does add the add a bit of pressure but
they<00:05:45.450> if<00:05:45.840> they<00:05:46.020> are<00:05:46.140> wanting<00:05:46.409> to<00:05:46.530> take<00:05:46.710> this

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
they if they are wanting to take this

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.320 
they if they are wanting to take this
game<00:05:47.070> any<00:05:47.310> further<00:05:47.580> that's<00:05:47.909> something<00:05:48.210> they

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
game any further that's something they

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.060 
game any further that's something they
could<00:05:48.510> have<00:05:48.630> got<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.140> live<00:05:49.229> with<00:05:49.260> and<00:05:49.590> get<00:05:49.860> used

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
could have got to live with and get used
