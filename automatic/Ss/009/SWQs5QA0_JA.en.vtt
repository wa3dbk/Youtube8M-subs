00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.790 
with a dollar dog and you put in the
correct<00:00:09.480> direction<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:10.110> see<00:00:10.290> how<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.559> loads

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
correct direction you see how that loads

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.549 
correct direction you see how that loads
it's<00:00:10.980> on<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.219> side<00:00:11.780> once<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.929> backwards<00:00:13.410> if

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it's on this side once in backwards if

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.169 
it's on this side once in backwards if
you<00:00:13.650> notice<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> loan<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.519> side<00:00:14.790> it

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
you notice the loan is on this side it

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.300 
you notice the loan is on this side it
turns<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> opposite<00:00:15.750> direction

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
turns the opposite direction

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.470 
turns the opposite direction
good<00:00:17.310> that's<00:00:17.609> why<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.820> matters<00:00:18.119> which<00:00:18.240> way<00:00:18.390> it

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
good that's why it matters which way it

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.960 
good that's why it matters which way it
goes<00:00:20.600> alright<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> all<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.580> stuff<00:00:23.760> here

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
goes alright so all of this stuff here

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.580 
goes alright so all of this stuff here
goes<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.420> here<00:00:24.689> before<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.230> goes<00:00:25.350> into<00:00:25.619> there

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
goes on here before it goes into there

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.689 
goes on here before it goes into there
some<00:00:28.590> years<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.160> put<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.519> in

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
some years you can actually put this in

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.889 
some years you can actually put this in
from<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> side<00:00:31.340> assembled<00:00:32.420> this<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.750> one

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
from the side assembled this is not one

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.920 
from the side assembled this is not one
of<00:00:33.930> them<00:00:36.140> okay<00:00:41.000> yeah<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.120> I'll<00:00:42.660> make<00:00:42.809> sure

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
of them okay yeah I think I'll make sure

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.270 
of them okay yeah I think I'll make sure
those<00:00:43.020> snap<00:00:43.260> rings<00:00:43.500> got<00:00:43.649> no<00:00:43.770> tension<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
those snap rings got no tension on it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.760 
those snap rings got no tension on it
that's<00:00:44.489> gonna<00:00:44.670> stay<00:00:44.820> put

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.380 

maybe<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.980> shape<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> customers

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
maybe in shape and I know the customers

cheap I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
cheap I'm just gonna go ahead and
squeeze<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.420> fix<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> clip

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
I'll have a little squeeze tie her up

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.799 
I'll have a little squeeze tie her up
I'm<00:00:57.780> gonna<00:00:57.899> freshen<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.070> bit

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.700 

we're<00:01:03.809> gonna<00:01:03.899> from<00:01:04.110> three<00:01:04.290> different<00:01:04.409> angles

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
we're gonna from three different angles

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.330 
we're gonna from three different angles
so<00:01:07.010> we'll<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.159> how<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.310> works<00:01:10.189> it<00:01:11.189> doesn't

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
so we'll see how that works it doesn't

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:22.590 
so we'll see how that works it doesn't
work

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.190 

all<00:01:23.600> right<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:25.690> will<00:01:26.690> get<00:01:26.870> through<00:01:27.080> this

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
all right so this will get through this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.900 
all right so this will get through this
hole<00:01:27.410> right<00:01:27.440> here<00:01:27.620> see<00:01:29.410> right<00:01:30.410> here<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:34.670> one

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
hole right here see right here this one

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.790 
hole right here see right here this one
will<00:01:35.090> not<00:01:35.180> fit<00:01:35.420> through<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.630> hole<00:01:35.800> there

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
will not fit through that hole there

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.480 
will not fit through that hole there
okay

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
okay

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.680 
okay
so<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.580> get<00:01:40.700> up<00:01:40.730> in<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.030> 80s<00:01:41.480> they<00:01:41.600> have

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
so you get up in the 80s they have

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.530 
so you get up in the 80s they have
different<00:01:41.990> gear<00:01:42.170> ratios<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.360> these<00:01:44.360> things

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
different gear ratios and these things

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.430 
different gear ratios and these things
can<00:01:44.750> wash<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.140> all<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.320> way<00:01:45.410> through

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
can wash you all the way through

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.340 
can wash you all the way through
assemble<00:01:46.270> all<00:01:47.270> right<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.660> we<00:01:47.810> put<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.110> one<00:01:48.260> in

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
assemble all right so we put that one in

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.440 
assemble all right so we put that one in
there<00:01:48.640> then<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:49.730> got<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.000> one<00:01:50.060> right<00:01:50.330> behind

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
there then we got this one right behind

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.710 
there then we got this one right behind
it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
it

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.580 
it
grease<00:01:53.720> yep<00:01:54.670> lots<00:01:55.670> more<00:01:55.850> degrees<00:01:56.500> candle<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
grease yep lots more degrees candle the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.500 
grease yep lots more degrees candle the
Grayson<00:01:57.950> well<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:58.850> could<00:01:59.000> offer<00:01:59.090> grease<00:01:59.360> for

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
Grayson well you could offer grease for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.120 
Grayson well you could offer grease for
the<00:01:59.570> whole<00:01:59.660> thing<00:01:59.780> was<00:01:59.930> full<00:02:00.140> any<00:02:00.950> room<00:02:01.100> for

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
the whole thing was full any room for

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.020 
the whole thing was full any room for
gears<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:02.350> lot<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.440> grease<00:02:03.700> now<00:02:04.700> if<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:04.820> put<00:02:04.970> it

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
gears a lot of grease now if you put it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.280 
gears a lot of grease now if you put it
over<00:02:05.119> here<00:02:05.330> like<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.660> it<00:02:05.990> won't<00:02:06.140> go<00:02:06.260> in

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
over here like that it won't go in

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.540 
over here like that it won't go in
because<00:02:06.880> get<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.709> three<00:02:09.709> knuckles<00:02:10.220> now<00:02:10.369> this

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
because get that three knuckles now this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.220 
because get that three knuckles now this
is<00:02:10.700> for<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.910> reverse<00:02:11.240> gear<00:02:11.510> down<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.050> case

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
is for a reverse gear down here in case

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.630 
is for a reverse gear down here in case
you<00:02:12.320> don't<00:02:12.440> know<00:02:12.590> what<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.740> notch<00:02:13.250> in<00:02:13.490> there

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
you don't know what that notch in there

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.210 
you don't know what that notch in there
there's<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> gear<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.180> goes<00:02:14.209> over<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> shaft

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
there's a gear that goes over the shaft

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.290 
there's a gear that goes over the shaft
like<00:02:16.220> down<00:02:16.400> there<00:02:16.610> it's<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> reverse<00:02:17.060> gear

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
like down there it's a reverse gear

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.620 
like down there it's a reverse gear
we're<00:02:18.140> not<00:02:18.260> using<00:02:18.970> we're<00:02:19.970> using<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.209> four-speed

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
we're not using we're using a four-speed

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.040 
we're not using we're using a four-speed
yourself<00:02:22.000> if<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.180> put<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.690> there

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
yourself if you put that on there
