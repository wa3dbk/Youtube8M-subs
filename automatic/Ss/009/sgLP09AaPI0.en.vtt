hello vitamin malam here i am playing
Terraria<00:00:03.389> again<00:00:04.339> this<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.400> my<00:00:05.670> roller<00:00:05.879> coaster

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
Terraria again this is my roller coaster

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.730 
Terraria again this is my roller coaster
world<00:00:06.450> pretty<00:00:06.750> much<00:00:06.839> as<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.230> last<00:00:07.470> saw<00:00:07.710> it

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
world pretty much as you last saw it

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.629 
world pretty much as you last saw it
except<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:09.469> so<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.769> little<00:00:11.010> system

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
except this so this is a little system

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.330 
except this so this is a little system
that's<00:00:11.910> going<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.240> between<00:00:12.809> setups<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
that's going to be between setups so you

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.120 
that's going to be between setups so you
can<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:14.549> ride<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.330> little<00:00:15.630> setup<00:00:15.890> from<00:00:16.890> place

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
can just ride a little setup from place

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.040 
can just ride a little setup from place
to<00:00:17.310> place<00:00:17.340> without<00:00:17.760> accidentally<00:00:18.720> doing<00:00:18.930> with

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
to place without accidentally doing with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349 
to place without accidentally doing with
that<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.380> then<00:00:19.520> you<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.670> flip<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> rail

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
that and then you can flip the rail

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
that and then you can flip the rail
around<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:22.289> if<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.529> get<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.550> will<00:00:23.580> send

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
around now if I get on it it will send

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.170 
around now if I get on it it will send
me<00:00:24.000> right<00:00:24.119> back<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.480> other<00:00:24.539> way<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.150> can

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
me right back the other way so I can

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.769 
me right back the other way so I can
just<00:00:27.449> flip<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:28.050> back<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.439> way<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.779> swing

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
just flip it go back this way and swing

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.520 
just flip it go back this way and swing
our<00:00:30.929> thing<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.380> off

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.369 

and<00:00:34.940> we're<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.570> that's<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.989> other<00:00:37.110> ride

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
and we're there so that's the other ride

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.000 
and we're there so that's the other ride
don't<00:00:37.920> mess<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:39.350> this<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> new<00:00:40.769> one

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
don't mess with that this is a new one

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.610 
don't mess with that this is a new one
this<00:00:41.519> is<00:00:41.699> one<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.480> yet<00:00:42.750> seen<00:00:43.050> or<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
this is one that's not yet seen or you

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
this is one that's not yet seen or you
saw<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.339> those<00:00:44.760> two<00:00:45.030> jumps<00:00:45.510> but

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
saw it it was just those two jumps but

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.119 
saw it it was just those two jumps but
I've<00:00:45.960> added<00:00:46.199> more<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:50.000> lot<00:00:51.000> more<00:00:51.680> up<00:00:52.680> there

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
I've added more a lot more up there

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
I've added more a lot more up there
you're<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.519> seeing<00:00:53.909> that<00:00:54.120> till<00:00:54.420> later<00:00:54.659> or

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
you're not seeing that till later or

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.319 
you're not seeing that till later or
later<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.890> video<00:00:56.040> actually<00:00:56.430> lets<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
later in this video actually lets you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
later in this video actually lets you
see<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> still<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.620> hack<00:00:58.890> stuff<00:01:01.250> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
see I still have this hack stuff and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.580 
see I still have this hack stuff and
this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.989> cool<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.229> yeah<00:01:05.070> that's<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.000> ride<00:01:06.590> so

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
this is cool but yeah that's the ride so

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.560 
this is cool but yeah that's the ride so
jump<00:01:08.009> it<00:01:08.280> doesn't<00:01:08.670> land<00:01:08.910> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> rail<00:01:09.390> there

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
jump it doesn't land on the rail there

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
jump it doesn't land on the rail there
it's<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.380> rails<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.009> give<00:01:11.190> that

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it's just the rails there to give that

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.070 
it's just the rails there to give that
impression<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:12.720> you're<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.929> to<00:01:12.990> go

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
impression so now you're going to go

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.359 
impression so now you're going to go
into<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.320> place<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.679> didn't<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:14.009> I'm<00:01:14.220> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
into a place you didn't know I'm just

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.120 
into a place you didn't know I'm just
going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> turn<00:01:14.640> myself<00:01:14.850> around<00:01:15.149> right<00:01:15.539> there

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
going to turn myself around right there

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
going to turn myself around right there
so<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> myself<00:01:17.399> a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.630> pitfall<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so I myself a little that's a pitfall it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.109 
so I myself a little that's a pitfall it
works<00:01:20.069> completely<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> pressure<00:01:20.909> plate

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
works completely with a pressure plate

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.480 
works completely with a pressure plate
rack<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> only<00:01:23.159> way<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> could

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
rack in and that's the only way I could

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.410 
rack in and that's the only way I could
see<00:01:23.789> to<00:01:23.819> get<00:01:24.390> us<00:01:24.509> back<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:27.140> wiring<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.350> this

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
see to get us back up so wiring for this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
see to get us back up so wiring for this
there's<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> lot<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.380> basically<00:01:31.679> every

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
there's a lot of it so basically every

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.649 
there's a lot of it so basically every
single<00:01:32.490> block<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.000> pit<00:01:33.179> bull<00:01:33.420> has<00:01:33.539> an

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
single block in that pit bull has an

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.520 
single block in that pit bull has an
actuator<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.800> it<00:01:35.640> takes<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.000> lot<00:01:36.530> along

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
actuator on it so it takes a lot along

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.109 
actuator on it so it takes a lot along
with<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.800> rails<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.369> actually<00:01:38.490> actuate

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
with the rails you can actually actuate

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.870 
with the rails you can actually actuate
rails<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.899> well<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.530> neat<00:01:40.979> I'll

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
rails as well which is really neat I'll

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.130 
rails as well which is really neat I'll
just<00:01:42.119> flip<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:43.280> show<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:45.750> fact

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
just flip that show you that in fact

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.899 
just flip that show you that in fact
i'll<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.439> ahead<00:01:46.469> and<00:01:46.590> jump<00:01:46.799> down<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.219> close

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
i'll go ahead and jump down here close

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.319 
i'll go ahead and jump down here close
data<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.960> then<00:01:49.229> there's<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.770> light<00:01:50.329> that

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
data and then there's the light that

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
data and then there's the light that
one's<00:01:51.539> triggered<00:01:51.990> by<00:01:52.140> another<00:01:52.649> swish<00:01:53.009> it's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
one's triggered by another swish it's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.630 
one's triggered by another swish it's
this<00:01:53.789> one<00:01:54.000> uses<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> blue<00:01:54.630> wire<00:01:54.840> i<00:01:55.640> was

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
this one uses are the blue wire i was

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.219 
this one uses are the blue wire i was
considering<00:01:57.000> placing<00:01:57.240> white<00:01:57.539> sand<00:01:57.750> lice<00:01:58.079> in

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
considering placing white sand lice in

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.510 
considering placing white sand lice in
hville<00:01:58.380> every<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.799> those<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> decided

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
hville every one of those but I decided

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
hville every one of those but I decided
I<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.149> had<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.049> hammer<00:02:01.259> every<00:02:01.649> single<00:02:01.920> one

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
I and I had to hammer every single one

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.859 
I and I had to hammer every single one
of<00:02:02.100> these<00:02:02.219> tracks<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:02.909> out<00:02:02.939> six<00:02:03.479> times

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
of these tracks on the way out six times

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.620 
of these tracks on the way out six times
to<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.560> go<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> right<00:02:05.039> way<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.630> that's

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
to get it to go the right way and that's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.870 
to get it to go the right way and that's
a<00:02:06.750> little<00:02:06.930> slow<00:02:07.200> down<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.740> don't<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
a little slow down so you don't just it

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.120 
a little slow down so you don't just it
actually<00:02:09.299> derails<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.289> go<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.859> too

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
actually derails if you go up that too

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.949 
actually derails if you go up that too
fast<00:02:11.430> Sonja's<00:02:12.150> gonna<00:02:12.329> turn<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.690> lights<00:02:12.840> back

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
fast Sonja's gonna turn the lights back

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.150 
fast Sonja's gonna turn the lights back
off<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:16.230> quite<00:02:16.410> fun<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.859> then<00:02:17.010> this

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
off there it's quite fun and then this

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.849 
off there it's quite fun and then this
one<00:02:17.570> um<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:19.019> hit<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> pressure<00:02:19.410> plate<00:02:19.620> down

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
one um you hit a pressure plate down

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.500 
one um you hit a pressure plate down
here<00:02:20.160> suddenly<00:02:20.489> going<00:02:20.850> into<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> place<00:02:21.359> you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
here suddenly going into a place you

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.569 
here suddenly going into a place you
don't<00:02:21.540> know<00:02:21.859> but<00:02:22.859> really<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.370> turn

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
don't know but really you just turn

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.280 
don't know but really you just turn
around<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.150> shoot<00:02:24.299> right<00:02:24.660> back<00:02:24.840> out<00:02:25.049> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
around then you shoot right back out and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.710 
around then you shoot right back out and
jump<00:02:28.940> quite<00:02:29.940> fun<00:02:30.180> if<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.390> ask<00:02:30.540> me

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
jump quite fun if you ask me

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.510 
jump quite fun if you ask me
I'm<00:02:32.230> yet<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.500> figure<00:02:32.680> out<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.890> way<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.040> keep<00:02:33.250> you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
I'm yet to figure out a way to keep you

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.640 
I'm yet to figure out a way to keep you
from<00:02:33.760> falling<00:02:34.090> down<00:02:34.330> there<00:02:34.780> I'm<00:02:35.350> not<00:02:35.530> gonna

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
from falling down there I'm not gonna

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.780 
from falling down there I'm not gonna
place<00:02:35.830> platforms<00:02:36.340> because<00:02:36.460> that<00:02:36.670> will

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
place platforms because that will

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.460 
place platforms because that will
utterly<00:02:37.270> screw<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:37.900> everything<00:02:38.080> there

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
utterly screw up everything there

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.650 
utterly screw up everything there
because<00:02:38.680> they'll<00:02:39.340> turn<00:02:39.610> into<00:02:39.880> stairs<00:02:40.210> and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
because they'll turn into stairs and

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.510 
because they'll turn into stairs and
connect<00:02:41.020> each<00:02:41.170> other<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.620> yeah<00:02:44.520> really

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
connect each other and yeah really

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.660 
connect each other and yeah really
tonight<00:02:46.210> did<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.050> fail<00:02:47.470> hard<00:02:47.890> enough<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.340> know<00:02:48.640> I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
tonight did I fail hard enough to know I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.270 
tonight did I fail hard enough to know I
didn't<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:50.290> would<00:02:50.440> cause<00:02:50.590> problems<00:02:50.740> if<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
didn't it would cause problems if I

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.310 
didn't it would cause problems if I
actually<00:02:51.490> kept<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.300> I'm<00:02:52.840> gonna<00:02:53.050> leave<00:02:53.260> that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
actually kept it so I'm gonna leave that

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:02.550 
actually kept it so I'm gonna leave that
as<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.740> is<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:56.800> know<00:02:56.890> what<00:02:57.010> I'm<00:02:57.130> not<00:03:01.560> that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
as it is and you know what I'm not that

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.199 
as it is and you know what I'm not that
one<00:03:02.800> I<00:03:02.830> needed<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:03.430> staircase<00:03:03.790> derp<00:03:04.480> derp<00:03:06.209> so

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
one I needed this staircase derp derp so

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.730 
one I needed this staircase derp derp so
no<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:08.080> guess<00:03:12.630> now<00:03:13.630> I'm<00:03:13.900> afraid<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:14.410> will<00:03:14.560> mess

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
no I guess now I'm afraid this will mess

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.740 
no I guess now I'm afraid this will mess
that<00:03:14.950> up<00:03:14.980> though<00:03:17.910> I'm<00:03:18.910> actually<00:03:19.240> afraid<00:03:19.480> this

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that up though I'm actually afraid this

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.020 
that up though I'm actually afraid this
will<00:03:19.870> mess<00:03:20.050> Lisa

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.199 

I'm<00:03:26.030> crazy<00:03:26.629> but<00:03:27.469> you<00:03:27.769> know<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.099> might<00:03:28.280> not<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
I'm crazy but you know it might not a

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.059 
I'm crazy but you know it might not a
lot<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.930> zombies<00:03:30.049> are<00:03:30.379> gonna<00:03:30.500> die<00:03:30.739> if<00:03:30.950> they

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
lot of zombies are gonna die if they

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.360 
lot of zombies are gonna die if they
stay<00:03:31.340> where<00:03:31.519> they<00:03:31.640> are<00:03:32.859> yeah<00:03:33.859> it<00:03:33.980> does<00:03:34.159> nice

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
stay where they are yeah it does nice

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.259 
stay where they are yeah it does nice
that<00:03:34.579> up<00:03:34.700> okay<00:03:36.069> so<00:03:37.069> we're<00:03:37.760> not<00:03:37.819> keeping<00:03:38.030> these

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
that up okay so we're not keeping these

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.990 
that up okay so we're not keeping these
platforms<00:03:38.599> I<00:03:39.079> think<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:40.280> removal<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.819> those

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
platforms I think the removal of those

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.199 
platforms I think the removal of those
is<00:03:41.299> essential<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.170> ride<00:03:42.409> working<00:03:43.209> let's

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
is essential to this ride working let's

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.089 
is essential to this ride working let's
see<00:03:44.359> it's<00:03:44.840> kind<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.019> experiment<00:03:45.530> around<00:03:45.650> until

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
see it's kind of experiment around until

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.490 
see it's kind of experiment around until
you<00:03:46.189> get<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.459> because<00:03:47.000> like<00:03:47.719> I<00:03:47.870> said<00:03:47.930> it's<00:03:48.319> not

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
you get it because like I said it's not

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.899 
you get it because like I said it's not
on<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.769> rails<00:03:48.950> right<00:03:49.129> here<00:03:49.310> actually<00:03:49.459> lands

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
on the rails right here actually lands

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.410 
on the rails right here actually lands
on<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:51.560> Sun<00:03:51.799> plate<00:03:52.069> let's<00:03:52.819> go<00:03:52.939> right<00:03:53.120> upstairs

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
on the Sun plate let's go right upstairs

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.000 
on the Sun plate let's go right upstairs
and<00:03:53.719> they'll<00:03:53.840> fall<00:03:54.079> back<00:03:54.319> onto<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.799> track

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
and they'll fall back onto the track

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.220 
and they'll fall back onto the track
where<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.579> will<00:03:55.700> bump<00:03:55.939> jump<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:56.659> fall<00:03:57.169> down

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
where it will bump jump and fall down

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.170 
where it will bump jump and fall down
here<00:03:57.939> where<00:03:58.939> you<00:03:59.180> shoot<00:03:59.480> across<00:03:59.540> in<00:04:00.549> here<00:04:01.549> lie

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
here where you shoot across in here lie

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.030 
here where you shoot across in here lie
still<00:04:02.209> shut<00:04:02.870> off<00:04:03.019> on<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.319> all<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.650> sudden<00:04:03.950> in

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
still shut off on you all of a sudden in

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.030 
still shut off on you all of a sudden in
yet<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:05.209> up<00:04:05.480> here<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:06.079> just<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.680> complete

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
yet this up here is just a complete

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.860 
yet this up here is just a complete
separate<00:04:07.430> experiment<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.150> decided<00:04:08.599> to

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
separate experiment that I decided to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.250 
separate experiment that I decided to
build<00:04:09.139> and<00:04:09.349> make<00:04:09.469> look<00:04:09.919> realistic<00:04:10.489> uh<00:04:11.260> you

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
build and make look realistic uh you

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.140 
build and make look realistic uh you
know<00:04:12.379> I'm<00:04:12.650> sure<00:04:13.069> if<00:04:13.400> you've<00:04:13.549> been<00:04:13.669> to<00:04:13.849> disney

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
know I'm sure if you've been to disney

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.089 
know I'm sure if you've been to disney
world<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.540> would<00:04:14.719> know<00:04:15.139> what<00:04:15.409> test<00:04:15.650> track<00:04:15.889> is

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
world you would know what test track is

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.439 
world you would know what test track is
and<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.370> know<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.609> part<00:04:16.820> where<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.000> rock<00:04:17.419> it

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
and you know the part where you rock it

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.749 
and you know the part where you rock it
at<00:04:17.750> that<00:04:17.989> wall<00:04:18.259> that's<00:04:18.919> about<00:04:19.190> rock<00:04:19.400> guard<00:04:19.669> is

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
at that wall that's about rock guard is

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.240 
at that wall that's about rock guard is
obviously<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.539> suddenly<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.680> wall<00:04:21.859> opens

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
obviously and suddenly the wall opens

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.499 
obviously and suddenly the wall opens
and<00:04:22.550> yeah<00:04:24.130> best<00:04:25.130> i<00:04:25.310> could<00:04:25.370> do<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:25.639> actuators

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
and yeah best i could do is actuators

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.480 
and yeah best i could do is actuators
for<00:04:26.539> that<00:04:26.870> one<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:29.240> soup<00:04:30.039> this<00:04:31.039> is<00:04:31.220> the

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
for that one so the soup this is the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.510 
for that one so the soup this is the
concept<00:04:31.940> it's<00:04:32.180> not<00:04:32.330> actually<00:04:32.720> used<00:04:33.020> yet<00:04:33.349> and

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.950 

yeah<00:04:37.520> i<00:04:37.550> made<00:04:37.789> into<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> whole<00:04:38.300> loop<00:04:38.510> because<00:04:38.659> i

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
yeah i made into a whole loop because i

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.730 
yeah i made into a whole loop because i
was<00:04:39.260> bored<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:41.870> like<00:04:41.990> for<00:04:42.199> a<00:04:42.229> pair<00:04:42.530> of

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
was bored so it's like for a pair of

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.580 
was bored so it's like for a pair of
yourself<00:04:44.680> yeah<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:47.449> I<00:04:48.020> built<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.470> look

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
yourself yeah and I built it to look

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.499 
yourself yeah and I built it to look
realistic<00:04:48.919> as<00:04:49.250> well<00:04:49.610> make<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:49.909> fit<00:04:50.150> in<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:52.509> guess

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
realistic as well make it fit in I guess

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:54.879 
realistic as well make it fit in I guess
if<00:04:53.720> you<00:04:53.810> think<00:04:54.020> about<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.229> though<00:04:54.500> this

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
if you think about it though this

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.649 
if you think about it though this
connecting<00:04:55.400> system<00:04:55.820> is<00:04:55.970> gonna<00:04:56.120> be<00:04:56.240> hard<00:04:56.479> to

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
connecting system is gonna be hard to

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.950 
connecting system is gonna be hard to
work<00:04:56.840> with<00:04:57.580> lookie<00:04:58.580> here<00:04:58.880> yeah<00:04:59.720> it's<00:04:59.870> gonna
