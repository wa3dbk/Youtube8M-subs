into<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.740> games<00:02:47.920> too<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.460> I<00:02:48.840> should<00:02:49.840> ask<00:02:50.020> him

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
into the games too so I should ask him

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.740 
into the games too so I should ask him
if<00:02:50.350> it's<00:02:50.680> also<00:02:50.920> worth<00:02:51.220> getting<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.640> 3ds<00:02:52.060> game<00:02:52.390> or

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
if it's also worth getting a 3ds game or

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.630 
if it's also worth getting a 3ds game or
or<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.500> there<00:02:53.680> another<00:02:53.860> game<00:02:54.280> that's<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.490> little

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
or is there another game that's a little

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.400 
or is there another game that's a little
bit<00:02:54.730> better<00:02:54.850> getting<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.630> on<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.840> series<00:02:56.170> for

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
bit better getting in on the series for

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.990 
bit better getting in on the series for
I<00:02:58.740> guess<00:02:59.740> there<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.130> some<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.640> these<00:03:00.730> cards

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000

a great way for you to already know the
anime<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.850> everything<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.600> game<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.140> I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
anime and everything in the game and I

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.930 
anime and everything in the game and I
think<00:03:20.709> there<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:20.830> an<00:03:21.070> anime<00:03:21.340> right<00:03:21.490> to<00:03:21.700> this<00:03:21.790> I

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
think there is an anime right to this I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.310 
think there is an anime right to this I
know<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.240> game<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.630> course<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.020> I<00:03:23.050> believe

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
know it's a game of course but I believe

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.270 
know it's a game of course but I believe
there's<00:03:23.470> also<00:03:23.620> an<00:03:23.770> anime<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.070> I'm<00:03:24.190> not

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
there's also an anime if I'm not

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.650 
there's also an anime if I'm not
mistaken<00:03:24.670> or<00:03:24.910> there's<00:03:25.270> at<00:03:25.360> least<00:03:25.510> been

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
mistaken or there's at least been

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.680 
mistaken or there's at least been
something<00:03:26.290> like<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.850> but<00:03:27.850> yeah<00:03:27.970> looks

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
something like that but yeah looks

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.720 
something like that but yeah looks
really<00:03:29.230> cool<00:03:29.410> it's<00:03:30.220> another<00:03:30.459> one<00:03:30.610> of<00:03:30.640> those
