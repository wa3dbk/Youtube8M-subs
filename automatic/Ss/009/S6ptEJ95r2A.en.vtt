00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 and you will be all welcome to a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.180
 new video and these are more in people to 5 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.670
 online and pretty good trick and wait 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.559
 have 13 cars in our garage many 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.120
 you only know you can 10 so 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.740
 we are a car that you step history 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.750
 of the garage in this case then used 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.130
 this from the tourists that many what 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.710
 you know I think not in trick that I did 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.410
 previously and an hour what we would do 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.539
 is to take out a car that the car that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 we want to have common today if in this case 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.119
 It would be like the car that the car 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.430
 number 11 and we're going to take out the car that 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.260
 is what it will do is duplicate worth 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.260
 like many in a tris of money that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.300
 you have to upload previously because this 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.040
 what it does is duplicate the car ok 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.360
 let's wait for us to come out as 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.370
 They know how it always blocks the way 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.489
 let's look like science or kinematics 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.500
 because we did not want it here wait no 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.530
 I know if they see in the orange ball that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.570
 is loading that is pretty I think that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.050
 many do not see it ok let's call 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.460
 sure and we're going to ask for the whereabouts 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 specific we are going to ask for the same car 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 that this one and this one is a pretty click 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 good to duplicate and to make money 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.799
 we are going to order this car and already what 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.229
 we would do is the following we need 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.460
 help from a friend ok and also clarify 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.109
 than yesterday of the place of location 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.700
 the garage 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.909
 ok then our friend what would have to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.619
 do here excuse me is riding ok and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.530
 what we would do quickly go 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.289
 to our garage and take a bicycle 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.840
 ok any bicycle but remember that 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.899
 that bike when we do this that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.659
 will do and is that that car will be that ok me 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.000
 I explain so that they understand 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.349
 bike home, you will appear but 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.479
 every time you go to take for example 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:44.549
 the salt place of that bicycle when 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 is the arrow to the right I think you're going to 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.530
 to leave is to connect not with bicycles but 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.149
 with a car and that is the trick itself 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.189
 You will ask what or what 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.649
 why good and what would we do that 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.659
 our bicycle what we would do is 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.000
 destroy it as well as they hear it 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.700
 destroy it we put some bombs 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.489
 adhesive and scale so boom exploded 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.739
 ok I'm not funny now what we would do 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.509
 in riding in the car key because what 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.310
 we want there there is my partner of 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.569
 it runs over but good, it does not matter there 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.770
 that I have the police that we 're going to 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.480
 remove the police 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.970
 more than anything for comfort so that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.520
 Fuck us because the gta police is 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.150
 shit shit is very very song to 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.570
 gta 5 police online and the saints 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.490
 cristos ok and well well I do not know if I 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.530
 I'm explaining it well so if any 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.420
 doubt or suggestion leave it in the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.760
 comments and let's put a challenge 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.340
 Walk that seems 40 light 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.040
 a very very good trick is it became a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.960
 erp video ok 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.630
 well we want it here a jump is 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.610
 just change the color is only ok 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.110
 the crew of the run of any color 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.140
 only to change the color we put it 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.120
 he changed his color when he's trying and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.770
 well, our friend has to be 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.930
 assembled that now what we would do is 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.700
 go to online people open to a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.920
 new activity and that's why we have to 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.130
 have last place to park a garage 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.330
 it goes and well that our friend has to 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.430
 carl rode in the car 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.620
 then not because I do not know what will happen there 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.900
 the car with our friend tell him that 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.120
 will give ok but good our car is not going to 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.230
 appear where the bicycle is ok 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.150
 we can have a new activity 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.709
 we wait for everything to load 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.360
 sometimes it takes forever the truth sometimes 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.280
 we can destroy people online 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.380
 this can be delayed for a while so 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.090
 what am I putting the slow motion is that 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.620
 eating encouraged is not that I'm silly 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.560
 fast camera 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.970
 and well, well, they did it well 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.680
 we already wanted to take it out to see us 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.180
 we go where the bicycle is here 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.769
 we are going to give you the arrow on the right 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.209
 as you can see there in the video 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.849
 there is not any discipline in me 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.379
 garage as you can see the arrow to 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.530
 the right and saved with the car that 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.120
 we must change the color previously 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.269
 quite one was changed so leave him a 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.400
 like and see, well, if you feel lost 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.470

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.180

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.180

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.919
