conclude I think this stuff is cool and
it's<00:04:01.430> not<00:04:01.730> as<00:04:01.910> impractical<00:04:02.540> as<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:02.750> looks<00:04:02.960> and

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
it's not as impractical as it looks and

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.920 
it's not as impractical as it looks and
if<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.400> stroke<00:04:04.760> people's<00:04:05.120> faces<00:04:05.390> with<00:04:05.720> them

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
if you stroke people's faces with them
