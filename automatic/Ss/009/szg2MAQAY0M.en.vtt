at<00:01:46.049> all<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:48.000> try<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> stick<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.610> pencils

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
at all but try to stick with pencils

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.300 
at all but try to stick with pencils
that<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.790> softer<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.200> aren't<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.740> hard<00:01:53.009> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that are softer that aren't as hard so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
that are softer that aren't as hard so
you're<00:01:53.460> not<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.759> jabbing<00:01:54.270> yourself<00:01:54.659> or

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you're not like jabbing yourself or

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.090 
you're not like jabbing yourself or
anything<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.680> because<00:01:55.979> that's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
anything like that because that's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
anything like that because that's
uncomfortable<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.149> need<00:01:57.329> your<00:01:57.479> eyes<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
uncomfortable and you need your eyes to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.280 
uncomfortable and you need your eyes to
see<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:59.119> well<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> think<00:02:00.420> I've<00:02:00.659> blacked<00:02:00.899> enough

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.389 
see so well I think I've blacked enough
so<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> guess<00:02:01.799> I'll<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.100> into<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:03.659> actual

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
way you're not really as much

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.009 
way you're not really as much
interfering<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.849> do<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.180> after<00:02:35.870> you

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019

lashes and gently pull push up and you
see<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.620> inner<00:02:48.950> rim<00:02:49.190> right<00:02:49.430> there<00:02:49.610> that's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
see that inner rim right there that's

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.259 
see that inner rim right there that's
where<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.299> want<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.569> get<00:02:51.099> so<00:02:52.099> you<00:02:52.190> just<00:02:52.549> I<00:02:52.880> just

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
where you want to get so you just I just

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:03.620 
where you want to get so you just I just
lightly<00:02:53.450> do<00:02:53.810> it

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.750 

and<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.290> don't<00:03:04.350> really<00:03:04.620> go<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.250> all<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.670> way

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
and I don't really go in all the way

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.890 
and I don't really go in all the way
over<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.300> don't<00:03:06.510> want<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.750> mess

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
over here because you don't want to mess

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.750 
over here because you don't want to mess
around<00:03:07.050> with<00:03:07.260> your<00:03:07.440> tear<00:03:07.680> duct<00:03:07.890> which<00:03:08.130> could

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
around with your tear duct which could

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.740 
around with your tear duct which could
cause<00:03:09.000> damage<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.870> eye<00:03:10.490> so<00:03:11.490> just<00:03:11.820> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
cause damage to the eye so just and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.580 
cause damage to the eye so just and
really<00:03:13.110> focus<00:03:13.470> on<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.680> outer<00:03:13.980> corner<00:03:14.640> part

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
really focus on the outer corner part

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.180 
really focus on the outer corner part
the<00:03:16.590> most<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:19.530> can<00:03:19.650> already<00:03:19.860> see<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
the most and you can already see the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.250 
the most and you can already see the
difference<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.850> added<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.540> my<00:03:21.690> lashes<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
difference is added to my lashes it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.790 
difference is added to my lashes it
makes<00:03:22.500> them<00:03:22.680> look<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.220> lot<00:03:23.550> fuller

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.130 

and<00:03:31.310> sometimes<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.180> just<00:03:32.540> put<00:03:32.840> black

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
and sometimes I like to just put black

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.890 
and sometimes I like to just put black
in<00:03:33.410> my<00:03:33.530> waterline<00:03:33.890> down<00:03:34.340> here<00:03:34.640> also<00:03:34.880> but<00:03:35.780> if

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
in my waterline down here also but if

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.870 
in my waterline down here also but if
I'm<00:03:36.050> going<00:03:36.320> for<00:03:36.530> more<00:03:36.890> of<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:37.100> everyday<00:03:37.520> natural

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
I'm going for more of a everyday natural

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.140 
I'm going for more of a everyday natural
look<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.840> typically<00:03:39.680> put<00:03:39.980> either<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.460> flesh<00:03:40.850> tone

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
look I typically put either a flesh tone

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.140 
look I typically put either a flesh tone
color<00:03:41.180> or<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.720> white<00:03:42.320> under<00:03:43.130> there<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.550> make<00:03:43.970> my

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
color or a white under there to make my

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.630 
color or a white under there to make my
eyes<00:03:44.300> appear<00:03:44.720> larger<00:03:44.800> so<00:03:45.800> if<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.100> have<00:03:46.280> small

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
eyes appear larger so if you have small

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.530 
eyes appear larger so if you have small
eyes<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.210> would<00:03:47.360> try<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:48.010> avoid<00:03:49.010> using<00:03:49.730> black<00:03:50.150> in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
eyes I would try to avoid using black in

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.820 
eyes I would try to avoid using black in
the<00:03:51.110> waterline<00:03:51.590> right<00:03:51.890> here<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:54.560> lot<00:03:54.800> of

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
the waterline right here and a lot of

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.280 
the waterline right here and a lot of
people<00:03:55.190> have<00:03:55.370> problems<00:03:55.730> asking<00:03:56.600> about<00:03:56.930> how<00:03:57.230> to

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
people have problems asking about how to

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.210 
people have problems asking about how to
avoid<00:03:57.890> like<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.820> guess<00:03:59.380> the<00:04:00.380> color<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.770> running

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
avoid like I guess the color is running

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.310 
avoid like I guess the color is running
or<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.940> black<00:04:02.150> staining<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.810> white<00:04:03.020> making

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
or the black staining the white making

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.740 
or the black staining the white making
it<00:04:03.560> look<00:04:03.710> muddy<00:04:04.100> I<00:04:04.400> don't<00:04:05.000> have<00:04:05.150> any<00:04:05.450> right<00:04:05.720> now

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
it look muddy I don't have any right now

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.700 
it look muddy I don't have any right now
but<00:04:05.960> you<00:04:06.380> can<00:04:06.650> use<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.340> q-tip<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.270> just<00:04:08.530> run<00:04:09.530> it

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
but you can use a q-tip and just run it

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.160 
but you can use a q-tip and just run it
like<00:04:10.040> just<00:04:10.310> push<00:04:10.670> down<00:04:10.700> here<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.510> just<00:04:11.630> run<00:04:12.020> it

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
like just push down here and just run it

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.990 
like just push down here and just run it
along<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.310> gets<00:04:13.520> any<00:04:13.700> excess<00:04:15.610> water<00:04:16.610> that

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
along and it gets any excess water that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.449 
along and it gets any excess water that
was<00:04:17.450> caused<00:04:17.780> by<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.140> tight<00:04:18.590> lining<00:04:18.830> up<00:04:19.070> here
