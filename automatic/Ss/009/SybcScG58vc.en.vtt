00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.749 

there<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.640> six<00:01:49.070> Philips<00:01:50.070> tile<00:01:50.280> screws<00:01:50.610> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
there are six Philips tile screws that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.419 
there are six Philips tile screws that
hold<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> evaporator<00:01:51.060> cover<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:52.429> the

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429

hold the evaporator cover on the
evaporator<00:01:53.909> cover<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.810> guess<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.319> back

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
evaporator cover on I guess the back

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
evaporator cover on I guess the back
panel<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.009> go<00:01:56.640> ahead<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.850> remove<00:01:56.970> all<00:01:57.270> six

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
panel here go ahead and remove all six

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.660 
panel here go ahead and remove all six
screws<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.039> take<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.250> look<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
screws so we can take a look at the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:16.520 
screws so we can take a look at the
evaporator<00:02:14.870> I'm<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:16.019> going<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.170> hold<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.470> up

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
evaporator I'm just going to hold it up

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.160 
evaporator I'm just going to hold it up
like<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:17.069> don't<00:02:17.280> think<00:02:17.489> all<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.610> way<00:02:17.760> out

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
like this I don't think all the way out

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.539 
like this I don't think all the way out
okay<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.470> what<00:02:19.709> we're<00:02:19.829> looking<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.400> is

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
okay so what we're looking at here is

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.670 
okay so what we're looking at here is
the<00:02:21.030> evaporator<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> heating

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
the evaporator we have the heating

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.319 
the evaporator we have the heating
element<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.190> towards<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.549> bottom<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
element here towards the bottom the

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.330 
element here towards the bottom the
defrost<00:02:24.780> thermostat<00:02:25.319> what<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:25.980> were<00:02:26.069> looking

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
defrost thermostat what we were looking

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.449 
defrost thermostat what we were looking
for<00:02:26.579> is<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:27.599> see<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.079> it<00:02:28.349> has<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> frost<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.220> one

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
for is we see that it has a frost on one

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.280 
for is we see that it has a frost on one
coil<00:02:29.730> here<00:02:30.090> that's<00:02:30.599> what<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.840> want<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.079> see

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
coil here that's what we want to see

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.350 
coil here that's what we want to see
throughout<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.920> whole<00:02:32.099> vaporators<00:02:32.579> this

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
throughout the whole vaporators this

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.970 
throughout the whole vaporators this
only<00:02:33.540> has<00:02:33.720> one<00:02:34.019> coil<00:02:34.370> as<00:02:35.370> frost<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:37.049> what's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
only has one coil as frost on so what's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.830 
only has one coil as frost on so what's
going<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.280> with<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.579> refrigerator<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.480> it's

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
going on with this refrigerator is it's

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.449 
going on with this refrigerator is it's
going<00:02:40.079> through<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> sealed<00:02:40.620> system<00:02:40.709> failure

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
going through a sealed system failure

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.879 
going through a sealed system failure
either<00:02:41.940> there<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.930> leak<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.350> refrigerant

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
either there is a leak of refrigerant

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:44.930 
either there is a leak of refrigerant
somewhere<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> system<00:02:44.760> or<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
somewhere in the system or the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.000 
somewhere in the system or the
compressor<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.139> valves<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.560> compressor

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
compressor the valves in the compressor

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.430 
compressor the valves in the compressor
are<00:02:47.220> starting<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:47.670> fail<00:02:48.019> so<00:02:49.019> what<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.290> found

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
are starting to fail so what we found

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.479 
are starting to fail so what we found
out<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.829> unit<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:52.100> like<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.130> said<00:02:53.370> it's

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
out on this unit is like I said it's

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.340 
out on this unit is like I said it's
either<00:02:53.609> a<00:02:53.940> new<00:02:54.150> needs<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.600> new<00:02:54.720> compressor<00:02:54.989> or

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
either a new needs a new compressor or

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.740 
either a new needs a new compressor or
there's<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.590> leak<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.920> system<00:02:56.250> somewhere

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
there's a leak in the system somewhere

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.699 
there's a leak in the system somewhere
repair<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.139> really<00:02:58.560> isn't

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
repair like this really isn't

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.530 
repair like this really isn't
cost-effective<00:02:59.459> unless<00:02:59.700> your<00:02:59.880> refrigerators

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
cost-effective unless your refrigerators

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.460 
cost-effective unless your refrigerators
real<00:03:00.720> expensive<00:03:01.019> or<00:03:01.440> or<00:03:02.100> it's<00:03:02.459> newer

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
real expensive or or it's newer

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.780 
real expensive or or it's newer
so<00:03:04.470> most<00:03:04.680> repairs<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:05.220> will<00:03:05.430> not<00:03:05.579> get

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
so most repairs like this will not get

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.160 
so most repairs like this will not get
repaired<00:03:06.269> we're<00:03:06.750> gonna<00:03:06.870> start<00:03:07.049> putting

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
repaired we're gonna start putting

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.330 
repaired we're gonna start putting
together<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.010> unit<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.410> ahead<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.889> put

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
together the unit so go ahead and put

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.949 
together the unit so go ahead and put
the<00:03:11.459> e-rep<00:03:11.760> evaporator<00:03:12.600> cover<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:14.870> thank<00:03:15.870> you

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
the e-rep evaporator cover on thank you

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.420 
the e-rep evaporator cover on thank you
for<00:03:16.170> watching<00:03:16.470> another<00:03:16.620> quality<00:03:17.100> video

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
for watching another quality video

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.650
