00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.439
 motorcyclist during flight 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.880
 driving us all favorite character 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.760

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.690
 regiment spider cucumber year went out man and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 that's it, he rides this bike 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.070
 pretty cool game done all 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.739
 the levels are very beautifully drawn i am 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.870
 personally really like this schedule must 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.480
 I'm not the only one, but we are many 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.239
 by the way if you drive the track already 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.670
 several times you see your 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.640
 the phantom which is ahead of you is either 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.300
 behind if you improve your highscore 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.320
 here you can also buy new 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.180
 motorcycles 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 but it is only available when you 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.240
 earn enough money 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.560
 and experience in general is a cool game for everyone 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.299
 I advise beautiful and fashionable 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.790
 the second game is called mystery jack and for 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.890
 we will need her camera device 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.229
 as in on this 7th rear camera 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 so we took a mobile phone so 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.030
 click play here quite a lot 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.640
 parks with levels and written by more cummings 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.070
 mind that is, they are still expected to be different 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.020
 the fact that they appear in various 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.329
 chips and obstacles but so that they 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 everybody needed to open under 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.070
 order to pass so here we start with 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.079
 first until we press the third level and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.659
 in order for it to start us 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.869
 need to scan barcode 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.729
 take a milk bag with scan 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.829
 barcode 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.320
 that is, you can take any item 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.719
 which has a barcode and create with 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.240
 using his level and now we 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.789
 we will run on the barcode from the packages 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.760
 from the milk here already appeared 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.000
 these are the kind of obstacles 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.420
 moving single strip 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.770
 before that were just the level by which 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.040
 it was necessary just like this 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.770
 jump on the real usually in barcode 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.320
 that is, each level you can 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.380
 create yourself that is in 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.760
 whichever big you have 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.120
 barcode so long you will 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.430
 jump in general very cool 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.680
 ideas or vice versa the author was lazy 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.320
 they decided to do the level like this 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.360
 let each user to take 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.140
 scans bar codes even if for him 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.370
 there will be a level of course i am kidding it 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.920
 really very cool original 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.989
 an idea like that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.250
 I met in general, that's such 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.280
 cool here 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.459
 arcade to platformer in which you 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.130
 to create the levels themselves more precisely 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.310
 use barcodes from any from any 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.100
 goods 3 grams called microbe battle 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.500
 tank cool enough original 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.050
 game to start playing it 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.420
 and open arcade mode is necessary 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.630
 pass the mission mode wait 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.570
 survival i passed survival mode 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.180
 only 4 missions so me in the arcade 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.280
 mode they are only available in what 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.280
 is the survival mode we go 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.950
 we have a limited mission 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.040
 number of lives and we need 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.200
 accordingly go as far as possible 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.930
 to unlock all levels with us 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.230
 here are two joysticks respectively stages 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.450
 we also shoot all our screens 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.110
 shny price rows ricochets off the walls and 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.090
 hit all our rivals in general 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.880
 Here is such a cool little game 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.400
 uncomfortable and for me so control but 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.100
 idea and implementation of the game to me in principle 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.440
 I would like multiplayer here 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.870
 it would be generally super but natural 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.739
 multiplayer would be appropriate here if 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.680
 control was a little better and a little 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:14.920
 more so that's convenient and on the whole game 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.729
 pretty well called on micro 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.340
 tank battle 4 gram hare with c.mn. this 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.940
 the game about man cannonball she 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.690
 is to pass this game by 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.690
 days 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.730
 week respectively 20 days and depending 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.280
 How much will you spend up to 20 days? 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.560
 It will be cooler I now wanted to pump 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.530
 just super cool and show you but 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.140
 when i went all 20 days career 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.720
 starts first in general what's here 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.380
 necessary to do the necessary to tap into 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.990
 the best moment to force 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.720
 the shot was as high as possible 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.730
 then open the parachute to our man 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.130
 cannonball not crashed now we 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.500
 let's see what we have in store in 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.070
 store we can buy a first aid kit if 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.860
 our character fell and hurt himself to improve 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.980
 parachute fly special wings 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.760
 which will help him soar also jetpack 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.370
 so that he can fly further how to say 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.500
 Brownies are such traces to make it beautiful 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.960
 flew into eyes admired and we got 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.720
 accordingly more more money and 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.750
 a helmet that will protect him a little 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.440
 Well, naturally you can improve the gun itself 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.270
 which run our hero so us 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.510
 part of the money is not enough for anything 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.090
 let's make a little more money and 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.810
 buy at least jetpack and you look 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.300
 how does it work and works right now I 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.860
 I think we have enough for Jed before my 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.290
 we get and start the game that's when 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.120
 win the first time crazily and 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:57.250
 reluctance to talk straight 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.410
 really very cool done but after 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.810
 of how you get through this one 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.080
 a career within 20 days will tell you everything 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.380
 you have all your things that you 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.140
 currently bought nulled it saddens and 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.700
 more and more into the game and go no hunting for 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.600
 so how was my game originally 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.360
 liked 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.520
 so I decided to share my own 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.690
 so you too can pass and one 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.050
 once you lose nothing enough 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:29.410
 not bad kill time for example in the queue 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.590
 or public transport last 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.770
 a grant for this zombie yes I drew and this 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.150
 such kind 2d shooter in which at 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.950
 here we have various missions 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.080
 we also have a shop where 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.550
 accordingly we can buy different 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.430
 different types of weapons here 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.290
 characters larvae various shields and 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.270
 also here are some cool ones 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.660
 pieces and not worth 5,000 coins 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.210
 so proceed to the mission in this case 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.780
 we need to kill 20 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.030
 zombary in 30 more precisely also happens here 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.300
 missions where we need to go nth 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.330
 number of meters and hold out and she and 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.130
 the number of seconds in general is such 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.980
 timekiller basically nothing 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.540
 no special outstanding management 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.120
 simple enough two arrows 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.700
 shooting and changing weapons 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.370
 turned this weapon available in it 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.300
 without and limit cartridges but this is me 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.970
 bought myself 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.000
 she makes a pretty cool service 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.850
 borey in general here's one too 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.700
 timekiller i'm able to imagine him 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:40.280
 leave him to be and when I will be 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.800
 bored i'm like this i can go in a couple 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.470
 pass missions do not forget to pass again 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.810
 a game for a while all big
