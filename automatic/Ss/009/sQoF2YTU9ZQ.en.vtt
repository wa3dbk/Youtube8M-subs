thing is natal you know it does look
very<00:01:20.009> much<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.570> looked<00:01:21.869> like

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
very much like what the we looked like

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.690 
very much like what the we looked like
when<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.380> first<00:01:22.619> launched<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.640> very

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
when it was first launched so I'm very

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.410 
when it was first launched so I'm very
skeptical<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:26.490> bits<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
skeptical and there are some bits of it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.730 
skeptical and there are some bits of it
going<00:01:27.720> wrong<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.229> definitely<00:01:28.560> see

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
going wrong you can definitely see

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.800 
going wrong you can definitely see
especially<00:01:28.979> when<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> guy<00:01:29.759> does<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
especially when that guy does the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
especially when that guy does the
demonstration<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.220> avatar<00:01:32.579> goes<00:01:32.790> all

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
demonstration and the avatar goes all

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.360 
demonstration and the avatar goes all
over<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.450> place<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.549> but

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
over the place so but

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.990 
over the place so but
the<00:01:37.940> bid<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:38.540> freaked<00:01:38.960> me<00:01:38.990> out<00:01:39.200> was<00:01:40.130> my<00:01:40.760> life

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the bid that freaked me out was my life

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.320 
the bid that freaked me out was my life
