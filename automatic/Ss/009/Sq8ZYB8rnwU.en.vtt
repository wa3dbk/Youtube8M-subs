00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.189
 hello my friends with you shamov 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.349
 dmitry since childhood I dreamed to buy myself 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.300
 large two-door refrigerator to 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.300
 could open and see the whole 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.730
 a bunch of delicious food and so I became an adult and 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.250
 just bought one 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.070
 a little problem he won't pass the door 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.440
 Japanese apartments about May reptile arrived 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.719
 movers and could not drag him into 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.910
 apartment in no way at times 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.550
 it seems that Japanese apartments do for 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.170
 hobbits there well or for dwarves and most importantly 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.990
 why so in Japan there is and 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.640
 two meter schoolgirls and stuff in general 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.070
 I had to order a crane to 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.990
 refrigerator dragged through the window you 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.750
 can see as movers diligently 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.340
 pulls my darling through the window though 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.970
 my plan with a fridge and and was close 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.140
 failures but still I could get it 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.290
 I liked that the Japanese movers are not 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.659
 trash ordinary workers talk 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.450
 politely neat and does not stink on two 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.040
 kilometer then you go to the bank or 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.430
 order pizza delivery 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.560
 everywhere you will see a high level of service well 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.929
 so here going back to my charms 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.729
 when they took the fridge out of the box 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.549
 said to check for scratches 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.619
 Well, in the end I checked and found very 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.959
 small scratch on the right side 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.789
 refrigerator so delivery immediately 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.749
 offered to change everything for free to 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.909
 new fridge 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.829
 but as a result of the white refrigerator 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.709
 the colors run out then we were offered 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.950
 10,000 yen discount in general and here we are 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:44.229
 got some freebies and coming back 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.539
 a bit to japanese houses as i have 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.439
 spoke in Japanese houses are very narrow and 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.929
 low doors 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.049
 what could be the problem when moving 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.299
 such things as wardrobe beds 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.009
 often enters through the window and no 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.380
 no problem if you live on the second 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.020
 floor but if on the fourth or the other 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.240
 somewhere above the move will flow enough 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.399
 in a large amount of money I advise you always 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.770
 all checked a hundred times before 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.720
 buy something in japan if you 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.360
 conceived to move somewhere in Japan is 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.410
 better do it yourself or ask 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.180
 japanese friends 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:23.769
 if you have them of course, but because 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.990
 that companies that help with 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.120
 relocation will take from you at least from 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.590
 a thousand yen and so on to infinity 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.600
 depending on the move 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.120
 when I just moved from the dorm to 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.240
 the apartment then your all lane on yourself and drove 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.410
 four times four o'clock in the morning uploaded 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.200
 bicycle bales 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.450
 and went to a new apartment I looked 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.970
 like a hindu with bales or like sellers 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.980
 potatoes on tuning with six 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.590
 pluton generally sat in the subway and doing 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.860
 beshta diligently do not notice how to me 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.480
 look askance but with the difficulty of moving I 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.270
 I will tell you in more detail in my releases 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.510
