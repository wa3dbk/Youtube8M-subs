00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.380 
your files between 4 to 10 megabits per
second<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:34.810> that's<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.530> lot<00:03:36.130> slower<00:03:36.519> than

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
second so that that's a lot slower than

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.420 
second so that that's a lot slower than
what<00:03:37.930> you're<00:03:38.050> gonna<00:03:38.170> get<00:03:38.410> from<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.860> Ultra

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.170 
so here's the card it's got 124 gigs
available<00:04:11.500> why<00:04:11.920> should<00:04:12.130> actually<00:04:12.370> get<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:12.760> get

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180

to see how long it takes to transfer a
full<00:04:23.530> CD<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.970> here<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.560> $0.50<00:04:26.560> CD

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
full CD so here is a $0.50 CD

animal ambition so we're gonna go

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.320 
animal ambition so we're gonna go
through<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.310> card<00:04:31.170> I'm<00:04:32.170> gonna<00:04:32.350> paste<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.890> and

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
through the card I'm gonna paste it and

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.870 
through the card I'm gonna paste it and
let's<00:04:34.330> see<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.690> transfer<00:04:35.200> rate<00:04:35.640> this<00:04:36.640> is<00:04:36.700> a

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
let's see the transfer rate this is a

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.260 
let's see the transfer rate this is a
generic<00:04:37.300> card<00:04:37.980> it's<00:04:38.980> not<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.790> name-brand

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
generic card it's not the name-brand

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.340 
generic card it's not the name-brand
kind<00:04:40.870> SanDisk<00:04:42.300> sandesh<00:04:43.300> is<00:04:43.450> actually<00:04:43.990> I

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
kind SanDisk sandesh is actually I

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.020 
kind SanDisk sandesh is actually I
started<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.830> video<00:04:45.040> by<00:04:45.160> saying<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.400> was<00:04:45.460> 200

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
started the video by saying it was 200

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.240 
started the video by saying it was 200
now<00:04:46.300> it's<00:04:46.720> actually<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:47.530> think<00:04:47.710> on<00:04:47.830> sale<00:04:48.070> for

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
now it's actually I think on sale for

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.450 
now it's actually I think on sale for
hundreds<00:04:48.640> you<00:04:48.730> can<00:04:48.880> find<00:04:49.090> them<00:04:49.650> 120<00:04:50.650> 100

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
hundreds you can find them 120 100

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.120 
hundreds you can find them 120 100
around<00:04:52.120> there<00:04:52.390> you<00:04:52.780> can<00:04:52.930> actually<00:04:53.080> find<00:04:53.920> them

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
around there you can actually find them

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.180 
around there you can actually find them
in<00:04:54.280> different<00:04:54.310> prices<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:56.560> let's<00:04:56.950> go<00:04:57.100> ahead

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
in different prices so let's go ahead

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.220 
in different prices so let's go ahead
and<00:04:57.340> go<00:04:57.430> back<00:04:57.460> and<00:04:57.820> let's<00:04:58.000> do<00:04:58.240> something<00:04:58.960> a

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
and go back and let's do something a

and go back and let's do something a
little<00:04:59.980> bit<00:05:00.190> more<00:05:00.460> heavy<00:05:01.090> so<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:01.780> is<00:05:02.970> several

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
little bit more heavy so this is several

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.010 
little bit more heavy so this is several
CDs<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.750> here<00:05:05.880> so<00:05:06.880> we're<00:05:06.970> gonna<00:05:07.060> just<00:05:08.430> copy<00:05:09.430> it

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
CDs and here so we're gonna just copy it

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.870 
CDs and here so we're gonna just copy it

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
you can also drag it but I mean I just

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.310 
you can also drag it but I mean I just
used<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.420> copy<00:05:13.630> because<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.870> want<00:05:13.990> you<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.170> see

the<00:05:14.440> screen<00:05:14.740> here<00:05:16.110> so<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.200> can<00:05:17.320> see<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:17.710> is

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
the screen here so you can see this is

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.420 
the screen here so you can see this is
several<00:05:18.850> CDs<00:05:19.090> in<00:05:19.420> here<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:21.070> can<00:05:21.190> see<00:05:21.310> the

several CDs in here you can see the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.170 
several CDs in here you can see the
transfer<00:05:21.940> rate<00:05:22.090> it's<00:05:23.050> not<00:05:23.370> fast<00:05:24.370> it's<00:05:24.820> almost

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
transfer rate it's not fast it's almost

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.030 
transfer rate it's not fast it's almost
seems<00:05:25.420> like<00:05:25.480> it's<00:05:25.750> failing<00:05:26.020> is<00:05:26.380> going<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.710> zero

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
seems like it's failing is going to zero

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.650 
seems like it's failing is going to zero
at<00:05:27.190> one<00:05:27.370> point<00:05:27.720> but<00:05:28.720> a<00:05:29.640> generic<00:05:30.640> card<00:05:30.970> this<00:05:31.600> is

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
at one point but a generic card this is

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.090 
at one point but a generic card this is
what<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.110> get<00:05:32.290> this<00:05:32.470> is<00:05:32.560> what<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.860> pay<00:05:33.070> for

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
what you get this is what you pay for

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.730 
what you get this is what you pay for
you<00:05:33.610> don't<00:05:34.030> pay<00:05:34.270> for<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.600> performance<00:05:35.500> you're

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
you don't pay for the performance you're

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
for if you decide to take the generic

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.480 
for if you decide to take the generic
route<00:06:25.909> see<00:06:26.909> what<00:06:27.119> it's<00:06:27.240> like<00:06:27.419> to<00:06:27.809> actually<00:06:28.490> buy

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
route see what it's like to actually buy

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.290 
route see what it's like to actually buy
the<00:06:29.669> generic<00:06:29.879> one<00:06:30.419> and<00:06:31.610> or<00:06:32.610> you<00:06:32.849> decide<00:06:33.149> you

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
the generic one and or you decide you

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.059 
the generic one and or you decide you
want<00:06:33.449> to<00:06:33.539> go<00:06:33.659> with<00:06:33.869> the<00:06:34.020> high-end<00:06:34.589> you<00:06:34.860> want<00:06:35.009> to

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
want to go with the high-end you want to

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.549 
want to go with the high-end you want to
go<00:06:35.159> with<00:06:35.309> the<00:06:35.399> actual<00:06:36.050> name-brand<00:06:37.050> because

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:37.559 
go with the actual name-brand because

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:41.600 
go with the actual name-brand because
you<00:06:37.679> want<00:06:37.830> to<00:06:37.860> pay<00:06:38.009> for<00:06:38.189> quality<00:06:40.339> so<00:06:41.339> it<00:06:41.429> looks

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
you want to pay for quality so it looks

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.519 
you want to pay for quality so it looks
as<00:06:41.729> though<00:06:41.759> we<00:06:41.969> can<00:06:42.149> handle<00:06:42.569> one<00:06:43.050> at<00:06:43.199> a<00:06:43.289> time

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:43.529 
as though we can handle one at a time

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.589 
as though we can handle one at a time
which<00:06:43.949> again<00:06:44.249> I<00:06:44.309> started<00:06:44.789> no<00:06:44.969> other<00:06:45.330> part<00:06:45.539> of

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
which again I started no other part of

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.239 
which again I started no other part of
video<00:06:45.719> telling<00:06:46.110> you<00:06:46.169> it's<00:06:46.289> gonna<00:06:46.439> be<00:06:46.619> a<00:06:46.649> slow

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:47.249 
video telling you it's gonna be a slow

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:50.570 
video telling you it's gonna be a slow
transfer<00:06:48.209> so<00:06:49.050> I<00:06:49.080> won't<00:06:49.529> keep<00:06:49.800> you<00:06:49.860> on<00:06:50.219> this

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
transfer so I won't keep you on this

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.549 
transfer so I won't keep you on this
video<00:06:50.879> much<00:06:51.240> longer<00:06:51.629> showing<00:06:51.959> you<00:06:52.169> all<00:06:52.409> the

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:52.559 
video much longer showing you all the

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.649 
video much longer showing you all the
things<00:06:52.800> that<00:06:52.949> it<00:06:53.189> can<00:06:53.339> transfer<00:06:53.909> and<00:06:54.179> how<00:06:54.330> fast

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:54.659 
things that it can transfer and how fast

00:06:54.659 --> 00:07:00.290 
things that it can transfer and how fast
I<00:06:55.110> think<00:06:55.649> it<00:06:55.740> just<00:06:55.949> depends<00:06:56.490> on<00:06:58.999> the<00:06:59.999> size

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
I think it just depends on the size

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.570 
I think it just depends on the size
obviously<00:07:00.869> since<00:07:01.469> this<00:07:01.619> is<00:07:01.860> transferring<00:07:02.490> a

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
obviously since this is transferring a

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.100 
obviously since this is transferring a
lot<00:07:02.789> slower<00:07:03.149> than<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.599> SanDisk<00:07:04.080> version<00:07:04.619> and

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
lot slower than the SanDisk version and

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.149 
lot slower than the SanDisk version and
that's<00:07:07.110> what<00:07:07.199> you<00:07:07.259> get<00:07:07.439> I<00:07:07.529> think<00:07:07.709> I<00:07:07.740> pay<00:07:07.949> the

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:08.159 
that's what you get I think I pay the

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:09.649 
that's what you get I think I pay the
thirty<00:07:08.490> three<00:07:08.669> dollars<00:07:09.059> or<00:07:09.209> something<00:07:09.419> like

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:09.659 
thirty three dollars or something like

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:10.939 
thirty three dollars or something like
this<00:07:09.779> for<00:07:09.959> this<00:07:10.110> hundred<00:07:10.379> twenty-eight<00:07:10.740> gig

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
this for this hundred twenty-eight gig

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.449 
this for this hundred twenty-eight gig
so<00:07:11.300> it's<00:07:12.300> worth<00:07:12.449> it<00:07:12.889> to<00:07:13.889> me<00:07:13.919> in<00:07:14.129> the<00:07:14.219> end<00:07:14.369> I'm

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:14.459 
so it's worth it to me in the end I'm

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:16.159 
so it's worth it to me in the end I'm
willing<00:07:14.699> to<00:07:14.789> sit<00:07:14.999> and<00:07:15.119> wait<00:07:15.269> I'll<00:07:15.509> wait<00:07:15.719> three
