00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.610
 today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.210
 definitely interesting or we do 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.640
 ravioli with prawns and with 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.490
 seasoning with clams 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.009
 but let's start by preparing the clams here 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.480
 a pan where I'm going to put a little 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:29.310
 of oil takes a bit of parsley e 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.949
 I also take the clams this along the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.949
 we kept soaking for a few hours 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.090
 let's light the fire and before the oil 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.920
 you can become too hot 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.750
 let's add the chirac clams e 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.940
 so it is more than sufficient considered 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.510
 let's make a couple of potions and let's go 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.670
 add a little of the parsley and go to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.449
 cover here or with the very simple pasta 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.850
 fresh 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.430
 we take a good slice of it dust 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.470
 a little with a little flour and let's go 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.690
 I'll use this to pull it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.680
 very simple type machine 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.150
 home 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.150
 starting from the lowest size 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.410
 and here is our pasta ready 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.740
 let's cover with a clean cloth e 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.230
 wet notice that you do not go to dry 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.300
 the clams are practically all 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.430
 completely open so let's say that 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.370
 these are in place we can for a moment 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.520
 move them we go to take a pan 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.730
 but without little girl we choose the fire 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:11.830
 we put the oil then we go to prepare 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:14.530
 the courgette we will use only the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.570
 outside part of the pulp it is 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.570
 very watery we will not use them 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.000
 here we are and we can put them right away 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.500
 fire and let's add these too 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.220
 shrimp tails that we already have 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.220
 shelled 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.450
 add a little bit of salt 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.330
 in the meantime let's go to cut 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.230
 another zucchini that then instead 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.060
 we will use for external seasoning 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.160
 also in this case used here 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.280
 only the external part in this 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:01.800
 case we're going to do some 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.510
 our shrimp strips are 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.610
 practically ready I have now turned off the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.470
 fire and let go for some 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.040
 another minute in the meantime let's take care 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.750
 of the clams we keep the most beautiful 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.530
 so those a little bigger than that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.760
 they are scenographically more beautiful and 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.760
 others we are going to shell them 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.300
 let's filter our bettino 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.980
 who left the clams because there 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.310
 they could be earthy residues 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.319
 small pieces of shell 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.890
 let's take a glass we put the 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:44.110
 shrimp with courgettes and a mix 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.110
 immersion mixer we are going to chop 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.550
 we also put the clams in this other one 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.580
 bull 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.980
 then we have the two sheets e 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.340
 let's go to make radio beds let's go to 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.120
 cut the first let's take some 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.590
 stuffed 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.690
 take a glass with a little bit 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.940
 of water because it will serve to be able to hold 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.500
 Wet the edges of our exchequer bed 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.580
 because otherwise you risk not 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.180
 then be able to close it here 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.520
 let's close our triangle e 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.890
 this could already be the form 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.720
 quite rather pretty enough 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.930
 usual or if we can do it too 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.990
 this thing here a kind of lot cakes 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.940
 a little over a larger one for me 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.080
 this could be rather 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.080
 cute as they form 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.289
 we take 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.289
 to see 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:25.220
 and we go to our thread of nothing 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:28.140
 zucchini we cut more earlier 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.560
 when you see that the oil begins to 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:36.680
 being hot at this point let's go 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:44.030
 add the liquid hold the clams 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:44.030
 and let's add some Italian modules 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.600
 then everything goes to add the 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.600
 rumors we left 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.520
 drain well 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.160
 we can add some faith to us 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.160
 will really be why 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.430
 all
