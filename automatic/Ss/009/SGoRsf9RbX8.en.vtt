00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
stuck it back in and what I mean when I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.719

say<00:01:42.780> worked<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.860> could<00:01:44.220> push<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.579> with

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.510 
say worked like I could push it with
tweezers<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.509> would<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.130> effect

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
tweezers and I would get that effect

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.600 
tweezers and I would get that effect
like<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.630> wasn't<00:01:48.810> cut<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> broken<00:01:50.159> her<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.430> any

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
like it wasn't cut a broken her in any

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.450 
like it wasn't cut a broken her in any
way<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.450> um

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
way but um

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.030 
way but um
so<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> tried<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.850> put<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.030> back<00:01:54.240> into<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.659> phone

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
so I tried to put it back into the phone

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.410 
so I tried to put it back into the phone
to<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> would<00:01:56.490> work<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.299> still

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to see if it would work but it still

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.030 
to see if it would work but it still
wouldn't<00:01:57.840> work<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> used<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.390> new<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
wouldn't work so I used the new one and

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
wouldn't work so I used the new one and
those<00:02:02.040> pieces<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.579> come<00:02:02.909> off<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
those pieces that come off of this that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.469 
those pieces that come off of this that
you<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.500> make<00:02:05.340> sure<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.579> don't<00:02:05.670> lose<00:02:05.909> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you have to make sure you don't lose and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.479 
you have to make sure you don't lose and
it's<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.990> very<00:02:07.290> tedious<00:02:07.680> process<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.429> whole

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
it's a very tedious process this whole

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.880 
it's a very tedious process this whole
thing<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.090> mean<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.509> started<00:02:10.050> probably<00:02:10.560> at

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
thing I mean I started probably at

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.640 
thing I mean I started probably at
I'd<00:02:12.890> say<00:02:13.270> 8<00:02:14.270> o'clock<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.750> morning<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.440> now

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.280 
I'd say 8 o'clock this morning and now
it's<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:16.010> 2<00:02:16.910> o'clock<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.450> mean<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.690> stopped<00:02:17.990> here

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
and there and I was messing around but

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.800 
and there and I was messing around but
all<00:02:20.660> in<00:02:20.810> all<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.080> probably<00:02:21.440> took<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.830> don't<00:02:21.980> know

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
all in all it probably took I don't know

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.400 
all in all it probably took I don't know
4<00:02:23.810> hours<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:25.240> straight<00:02:26.240> doing<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.720> time<00:02:26.930> just

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
4 hours of straight doing it time just

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.260 
4 hours of straight doing it time just
because<00:02:27.800> you're<00:02:28.070> not<00:02:28.220> sure<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:28.970> have<00:02:29.150> to

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
because you're not sure and you have to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.740 
because you're not sure and you have to
be<00:02:29.360> really<00:02:29.630> careful<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:31.460> video<00:02:32.120> says<00:02:32.450> takes

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
be really careful the video says takes

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.260 
be really careful the video says takes
about<00:02:32.870> 50<00:02:33.260> minutes<00:02:33.610> probably<00:02:34.610> for<00:02:35.120> them

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
about 50 minutes probably for them

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.200 
about 50 minutes probably for them
because<00:02:35.540> they've<00:02:35.870> done<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.080> more<00:02:36.350> than<00:02:36.380> once

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
because they've done it more than once

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.210 
because they've done it more than once
however<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.390> video<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:38.780> awesome<00:02:38.990> one<00:02:39.830> thing<00:02:40.070> I

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
however the video is awesome one thing I

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.970 
however the video is awesome one thing I
have<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.820> tell<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.210> is<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.890> used<00:02:43.600> various

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
have to tell you is that I used various

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.670 
have to tell you is that I used various
little<00:02:45.980> containers<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.840> put<00:02:47.870> all<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.380> screws

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
little containers to put all the screws

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.980 
little containers to put all the screws
in<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:52.190> was<00:02:52.340> doing<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.730> another<00:02:53.660> reason

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
in and as I was doing it another reason

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.510 
in and as I was doing it another reason
that<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.170> probably<00:02:54.290> took<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:54.710> long<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.070> I<00:02:55.280> took

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
that it probably took so long is I took

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.510 
that it probably took so long is I took
pictures<00:02:55.910> because<00:02:56.600> if<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.710> go<00:02:57.830> step<00:02:58.130> by<00:02:58.160> step

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
pictures because if you go step by step

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.140 
pictures because if you go step by step
by<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.850> video<00:02:59.530> that's<00:03:00.530> great<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.090> have

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
by the video that's great but you have

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.790 
by the video that's great but you have
to<00:03:02.390> be<00:03:02.480> all<00:03:02.810> these<00:03:02.990> screws<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.470> different

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
to be all these screws of different

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.270 
to be all these screws of different
lengths<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.400> widths<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.440> have<00:03:06.710> to<00:03:06.890> make

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
lengths and widths so you have to make

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.950 
lengths and widths so you have to make
sure<00:03:07.460> you<00:03:07.550> put<00:03:07.730> them<00:03:07.850> all<00:03:08.000> back<00:03:08.330> in<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.780> right

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
sure you put them all back in the right

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.120 
sure you put them all back in the right
spots<00:03:10.240> which<00:03:11.240> is<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:11.960> what<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.170> was<00:03:12.440> doing<00:03:12.470> is

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
spots which is so what I was doing is

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.280 
spots which is so what I was doing is
each<00:03:13.730> piece<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.450> would<00:03:14.600> tell<00:03:14.930> me<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.140> would

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
each piece that it would tell me I would

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.000 
each piece that it would tell me I would
pause<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.010> then<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.640> would<00:03:18.010> unscrew

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
pause it and then I would unscrew

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.710 
pause it and then I would unscrew
whatever<00:03:19.670> screws<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.300> told<00:03:20.540> me<00:03:20.600> to

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
whatever screws that it told me to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.280 
whatever screws that it told me to
unscrew<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.560> then<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.670> would<00:03:22.910> tediously<00:03:23.480> place

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
unscrew and then I would tediously place

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.380 
unscrew and then I would tediously place
them<00:03:24.530> near<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.130> holes<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.760> take<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> picture

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
them near the holes and take a picture

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.420 
them near the holes and take a picture
with<00:03:26.540> another<00:03:26.989> phone<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.070> could<00:03:28.250> see

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
with another phone so that I could see

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.970 
with another phone so that I could see
the<00:03:28.550> difference<00:03:28.670> in<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.150> sizes<00:03:29.620> then<00:03:30.620> once<00:03:30.860> I

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
the difference in the sizes then once I

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.640 
the difference in the sizes then once I
was<00:03:31.130> done<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.730> piece<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.450> know<00:03:33.170> cuz<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.500> goes

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
was done that piece you know cuz it goes

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.650 
was done that piece you know cuz it goes
like<00:03:33.950> step<00:03:34.220> one<00:03:34.250> two<00:03:34.700> all<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:34.940> way<00:03:35.090> through<00:03:35.450> I

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
like step one two all the way through I

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.979 
like step one two all the way through I
would<00:03:36.350> put<00:03:36.500> all<00:03:36.590> those<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.340> saucer<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.030> all

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
would put all those in a saucer and all

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.630 
would put all those in a saucer and all
together<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:39.770> that<00:03:40.660> piece<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.680> would<00:03:43.550> do

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
together that that piece and I would do

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.820 
together that that piece and I would do
that<00:03:43.760> all<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:43.970> way<00:03:44.269> through<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:45.170> if<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.500> didn't

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830
