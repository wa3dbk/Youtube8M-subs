of old-school Jeff Porcaro so I've kind

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.650 
of old-school Jeff Porcaro so I've kind
of<00:02:31.830> looked<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> past<00:02:32.489> on<00:02:32.760> heel-toe

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
of looked in the past on heel-toe

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.260 
of looked in the past on heel-toe
technique<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.950> thought<00:02:35.790> I'd<00:02:35.910> have<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> go<00:02:36.209> to

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
technique and I thought I'd have a go to

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.580 
technique and I thought I'd have a go to
see<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.690> would<00:02:36.900> actually<00:02:36.989> help<00:02:37.260> me

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
see if this would actually help me

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.940 
see if this would actually help me
so<00:02:38.370> don't<00:02:38.520> if<00:02:38.610> Daniel<00:02:38.880> Adair<00:02:39.060> plays<00:02:39.950> this

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so don't if Daniel Adair plays this

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.949 
so don't if Daniel Adair plays this
technique<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.580> don't<00:02:41.850> know<00:02:41.910> for<00:02:42.030> users<00:02:44.780> if<00:02:45.780> his

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
technique I don't know for users if his

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.270 
technique I don't know for users if his
feet<00:02:46.170> are<00:02:46.320> actually<00:02:46.440> quicker<00:02:46.739> probably<00:02:47.190> I've

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
feet are actually quicker probably I've

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.560 
feet are actually quicker probably I've
got<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> lot<00:02:47.550> quicker<00:02:47.670> than<00:02:47.820> my<00:02:48.030> listen<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.420> some

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.500 
got a lot quicker than my listen to some
of<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.720> recordings<00:02:49.140> he's<00:02:49.650> actually<00:02:49.830> doing

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
of the recordings he's actually doing

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.449 
of the recordings he's actually doing
but<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.720> actually<00:02:51.989> playing<00:02:52.320> two<00:02:52.560> hits<00:02:54.110> with

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
but I'm actually playing two hits with

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:17.960 
but I'm actually playing two hits with
technique<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:59.360> the<00:03:00.360> left

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.480 

there's<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.690> jared<00:03:18.990> Faulkner<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.710> think<00:03:20.340> if<00:03:20.430> you

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
there's a jared Faulkner I think if you

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.160 
there's a jared Faulkner I think if you
tap<00:03:20.700> into<00:03:20.880> YouTube<00:03:21.300> he's<00:03:21.750> done<00:03:21.900> some<00:03:22.050> really

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
tap into YouTube he's done some really

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.430 
tap into YouTube he's done some really
good<00:03:22.350> videos<00:03:22.730> on<00:03:23.730> those<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:26.900> if<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.960> practice

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
good videos on those so if you practice

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.410 
good videos on those so if you practice
that<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.710> can<00:03:28.740> get<00:03:29.100> fluid<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.030> say<00:03:30.210> for

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
that you can get fluid and I say for

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.780 
that you can get fluid and I say for
this<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:31.140> this<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.680> song<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.190> fight<00:03:32.460> really

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
this and this this song I fight really

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.810 
this and this this song I fight really
really<00:03:33.210> easy<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.630> play<00:03:39.200> something<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.230> that

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
really easy to play something like that

00:03:40.820 --> 00:04:56.510 
really easy to play something like that
so<00:03:41.820> um<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.630> kind<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:43.130> just<00:03:44.130> repeat<00:03:44.430> yourself

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.370 

so<00:04:59.460> I<00:05:00.460> find<00:05:01.000> new<00:05:01.060> videos<00:05:01.360> explain<00:05:02.139> how<00:05:02.199> to<00:05:02.260> play

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380

and<00:05:05.320> i<00:05:05.560> started<00:05:05.830> on<00:05:05.919> about<00:05:06.490> 112<00:05:07.229> beats<00:05:08.229> per

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
and i started on about 112 beats per

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.350 
and i started on about 112 beats per
minute<00:05:08.680> went<00:05:09.039> 120<00:05:09.490> just<00:05:09.910> keep<00:05:10.060> building<00:05:10.240> the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
minute went 120 just keep building the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.969 
minute went 120 just keep building the
speed<00:05:10.570> up<00:05:10.690> I'm<00:05:10.810> not<00:05:10.960> too<00:05:11.169> sure<00:05:11.440> it's<00:05:11.710> probably

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
speed up I'm not too sure it's probably

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.400 
speed up I'm not too sure it's probably
1<00:05:12.250> to<00:05:12.430> 5<00:05:12.669> 130<00:05:13.150> well<00:05:13.510> that's<00:05:13.780> about<00:05:13.870> 1/2<00:05:14.169> father

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
1 to 5 130 well that's about 1/2 father

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.770 
1 to 5 130 well that's about 1/2 father
think<00:05:14.740> unnatural<00:05:15.550> recording<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.449> you<00:05:16.539> can<00:05:16.660> get

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
think unnatural recording so you can get

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.610 
think unnatural recording so you can get
to<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:17.050> speed

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
to that speed

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.589 
to that speed
they<00:05:17.949> were<00:05:18.070> Hilter<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.820> toe<00:05:18.970> technique<00:05:19.360> aim

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
they were Hilter to toe technique aim

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.629 
they were Hilter to toe technique aim
