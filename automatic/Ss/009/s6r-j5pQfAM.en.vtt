00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.760
 Hello 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.330
 today we are going to make an origami swan 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.089
 with square paper 15 by 15 ours 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.140
 swan will start with a 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.289
 ice cream going to a tie and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.660
 end when it turns into a swan 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.070
 and I'll tell you a little secret that the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.230
 Japanese talk about this figure that is 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.640
 the circle you follow step-by-step 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.880
 with me 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.850
 the square paper you will fold in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.950
 diagonal 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.950
 so this way 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.420
 After you open it and it will form 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.010
 Why do we call in the origami of 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:05.780
 ice cream cone to be added to 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:13.770
 these tip here this tip here in the middle 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:19.220
 forming a very nice beak of this 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.220
 like this 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:30.060
 this is the basis of our cinema, which is the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.330
 ice cream cone done this we 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.560
 let's fold in half 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:42.930
 this way and we will have a project of one 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.600
 airplane but not yet 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.770
 now we are going to move on to the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.130
 necktie 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.660
 we opened this tip and came back with 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.850
 her here 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:00.240
 this way also to be the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 pointed out that our organism 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:11.520
 on the other side in the same way 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:18.540
 so this way and come to getting 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:24.140
 I am cool and peri and O branches in 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:30.000
 week, gentlemen and we have here a 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.260
 tie made to our 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.170
 necktie 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 We'll get this tip and put it together. 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:48.350
 with this other kim up 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:52.720
 We're going to get this point here now. 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.720
 and fold it down 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.550
 this way you can see 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.530
 so now we 're going to double everything. 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.609
 all in half 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:25.960
 bending that way we're going to get up 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:30.810
 the neck of our swan 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:34.000
 this way this done we will 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:41.100
 raise the beak of our earthquake a 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:46.200
 little like this this way then it is 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.490
 the swan that for the Japanese means 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.630
 eternal love 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:04:00.660
 the pope when a couple of swans in 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.660
 way it never stops you from alone 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.830
 This was one more that is cool to have connected. 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.830
 for you
