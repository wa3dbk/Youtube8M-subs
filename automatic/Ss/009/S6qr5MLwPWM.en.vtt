choosy starting level so might as well

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.720 
choosy starting level so might as well
for<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.750> hell<00:01:51.870> of<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> put<00:01:52.230> it<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.410> 15<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
for the hell of a put it on 15 just to

can<00:01:55.440> see<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.130> fast<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.940> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
can see just how fast it is because I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.310 
can see just how fast it is because I
know<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.690> big<00:01:57.870> things<00:01:57.900> with

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
know that's one of the big things with

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.070 
know that's one of the big things with
terrace<00:01:59.150> but<00:02:00.150> anyway<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.720> know<00:02:00.840> upload

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
terrace but anyway if you know upload

terrace but anyway if you know upload
begin<00:02:01.290> before<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.980> puzzle<00:02:02.160> game<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.760> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
begin before it is a puzzle game and the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.460 
begin before it is a puzzle game and the
whole<00:02:03.210> point<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.690> have<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.050> fill<00:02:04.440> up

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
whole point is you have to fill up

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.280 
whole point is you have to fill up
bricks<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.280> lines<00:02:05.550> so<00:02:06.270> very<00:02:06.870> quickly<00:02:07.020> do

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
bricks to make lines so very quickly do

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.190 
bricks to make lines so very quickly do
this<00:02:07.470> here<00:02:08.000> good<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.420> got<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.840> aligned

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this here good now we got that aligned

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.660 
this here good now we got that aligned
on<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.800> that's<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.130> whole<00:02:11.280> point<00:02:11.460> you've<00:02:11.640> got

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
on so that's the whole point you've got

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.309 
on so that's the whole point you've got
to<00:02:11.790> fill<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> screen<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:13.080> all<00:02:13.470> gaps

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
to fill the screen in all gaps

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.750 
to fill the screen in all gaps
you<00:02:14.499> can<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:15.010> lines<00:02:15.249> and<00:02:15.459> when<00:02:15.549> you<00:02:15.609> get<00:02:15.700> a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
you can get lines and when you get a

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.520 
you can get lines and when you get a
line<00:02:15.969> into<00:02:16.209> sinha<00:02:16.420> grid<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.230> whole<00:02:17.379> point

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
line into sinha grid and the whole point

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.800 
line into sinha grid and the whole point
is<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.920> basically<00:02:18.189> not<00:02:18.730> go<00:02:18.909> on<00:02:18.939> the<00:02:19.150> top<00:02:19.329> which

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
is to basically not go on the top which

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.449 
is to basically not go on the top which
I'll<00:02:20.049> do<00:02:20.170> very<00:02:20.379> quickly<00:02:20.469> after<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.099> mentioned

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
I'll do very quickly after I mentioned

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.920 
I'll do very quickly after I mentioned
you<00:02:21.549> can<00:02:21.730> hold<00:02:21.999> blocks<00:02:22.389> as<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:22.659> might<00:02:22.810> in

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
you can hold blocks as you might in

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.420 
you can hold blocks as you might in
order<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.439> can<00:02:23.590> swap<00:02:23.799> things<00:02:24.069> over<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
order so you can swap things over and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.399 
order so you can swap things over and
that<00:02:24.549> but<00:02:24.999> anywhere<00:02:25.329> just<00:02:25.689> quickly<00:02:26.109> pushing

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
that but anywhere just quickly pushing

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.750 
that but anywhere just quickly pushing
the<00:02:26.560> UP<00:02:26.650> button<00:02:26.680> hit<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.340> top<00:02:27.489> of<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.670> screen

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the UP button hit the top of the screen

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.629 
the UP button hit the top of the screen
gone<00:02:28.269> dead<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:29.230> that's<00:02:29.680> marathon<00:02:30.129> what<00:02:30.280> just

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
gone dead so that's marathon what just

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.259 
gone dead so that's marathon what just
going<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.849> cut<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.090> one<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.420> variants<00:02:31.840> now

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
going to cut in one of the variants now

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.789 
going to cut in one of the variants now
so<00:02:34.269> this<00:02:34.480> variant<00:02:34.989> is<00:02:35.109> you<00:02:35.230> might<00:02:35.379> you<00:02:35.469> noticed

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
so this variant is you might you noticed

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.399 
so this variant is you might you noticed
already<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.519> floor<00:02:36.819> moves<00:02:37.090> left<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.569> right<00:02:37.719> so

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
already the floor moves left to right so

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.289 
already the floor moves left to right so
that's<00:02:38.950> pretty<00:02:39.400> much<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.579> then<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.180> whole

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
that's pretty much it then the whole

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.030 
that's pretty much it then the whole
point<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.629> you<00:02:40.780> have<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.079> still<00:02:41.590> make<00:02:41.739> lines

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
point is you have to still make lines

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.979 
point is you have to still make lines
but<00:02:42.400> you've<00:02:42.519> got<00:02:42.639> to<00:02:42.669> watch<00:02:42.879> out<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.180> well

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
but you've got to watch out and well

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.229 
but you've got to watch out and well
move<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.620> floor<00:02:44.829> left<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.129> right<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.459> one

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
move the floor left to right and one

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.520 
move the floor left to right and one
thing<00:02:46.419> I've<00:02:46.510> noticed<00:02:46.689> actually<00:02:47.019> playing<00:02:47.439> this

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
thing I've noticed actually playing this

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.289 
thing I've noticed actually playing this
on<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:47.769> big<00:02:47.980> spring<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.459> don't<00:02:48.849> like<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.180> on

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
on this big spring I don't like it on

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.879 
on this big spring I don't like it on
the<00:02:49.389> big<00:02:49.540> screen<00:02:49.569> because<00:02:50.079> my<00:02:50.230> eyesight's<00:02:50.650> too

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
the big screen because my eyesight's too

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.679 
the big screen because my eyesight's too
bad<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:51.370> I'm<00:02:51.700> placing<00:02:51.939> blocks<00:02:52.299> in<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.540> wrong

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
bad and I'm placing blocks in the wrong

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.270 
bad and I'm placing blocks in the wrong
place<00:02:52.959> all<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.230> time<00:02:53.260> because<00:02:53.620> i<00:02:53.799> purely

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
place all the time because i purely

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.509 
place all the time because i purely
can't<00:02:54.639> say<00:02:54.879> so<00:02:55.680> won't<00:02:56.680> there<00:02:56.859> be<00:02:56.919> much<00:02:57.250> more<00:02:57.430> of

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
can't say so won't there be much more of

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.490 
can't say so won't there be much more of
this<00:02:57.579> review<00:02:57.639> but<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.900> be<00:02:58.989> fair<00:02:59.139> there's<00:02:59.349> not

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
this review but to be fair there's not

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.809 
this review but to be fair there's not

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
really much more left to show just a

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.839 
really much more left to show just a
couple<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.180> variant<00:03:01.540> mods<00:03:05.189> so<00:03:06.189> this<00:03:06.519> one<00:03:06.699> here

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
couple the variant mods so this one here

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.699 
couple the variant mods so this one here
is<00:03:06.909> you<00:03:07.180> make<00:03:07.359> a<00:03:07.389> guest<00:03:07.959> by<00:03:08.169> the<00:03:08.230> fact<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.620> i

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
is you make a guest by the fact that i

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.379 
is you make a guest by the fact that i
keep<00:03:08.919> going<00:03:09.129> left<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.489> right<00:03:09.579> I've<00:03:10.000> got<00:03:10.150> two

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
keep going left to right I've got two

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.659 
keep going left to right I've got two
tiny<00:03:10.840> matrixes<00:03:11.469> and<00:03:11.680> I've<00:03:11.829> got<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> clear<00:03:12.310> lines

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
tiny matrixes and I've got a clear lines

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.119 
tiny matrixes and I've got a clear lines
but<00:03:13.329> I've<00:03:13.569> still<00:03:13.810> gotta<00:03:14.049> make<00:03:14.439> a<00:03:14.620> full<00:03:14.919> line

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
but I've still gotta make a full line

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.280 
but I've still gotta make a full line
across<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:15.939> by<00:03:16.180> filling<00:03:16.510> up<00:03:16.599> one<00:03:16.780> side<00:03:17.019> as<00:03:17.199> I've

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
across so by filling up one side as I've

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.170 
across so by filling up one side as I've
done<00:03:17.439> here<00:03:17.620> doesn't<00:03:18.370> get<00:03:18.459> rid<00:03:18.609> of<00:03:18.639> them<00:03:18.790> but<00:03:19.000> by

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
done here doesn't get rid of them but by

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.420 
done here doesn't get rid of them but by
doing<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.540> does<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.919> just<00:03:21.129> means<00:03:21.280> that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
doing this does so it just means that

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.569 
doing this does so it just means that
basically<00:03:21.879> you<00:03:22.269> have<00:03:22.419> to<00:03:22.500> wealth<00:03:23.500> plan<00:03:24.250> even

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
basically you have to wealth plan even

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.699 
basically you have to wealth plan even
more<00:03:24.849> strategically<00:03:25.419> than<00:03:25.629> usual<00:03:25.989> it's<00:03:26.409> a<00:03:26.530> fun

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
more strategically than usual it's a fun

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.530 
more strategically than usual it's a fun

honestly can't understand why people
don't<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:42.519> this<00:03:42.819> because<00:03:43.060> it's<00:03:43.509> just

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
don't like this because it's just

the fast PS side to what it's got that
like<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:54.639> you've<00:03:54.669> got<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.000> exciting<00:03:55.540> action

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
like so you've got the exciting action

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.270 
like so you've got the exciting action
in<00:03:56.019> stuff<00:03:56.259> because<00:03:56.590> when<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:56.859> gets<00:03:57.009> to<00:03:57.189> the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
in stuff because when it gets to the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.399 
in stuff because when it gets to the
highest<00:03:57.489> level<00:03:57.969> to<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.180> really<00:03:58.780> are<00:03:58.930> going<00:03:59.290> to

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
highest level to you really are going to

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.860 
highest level to you really are going to
run<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.829> as<00:03:59.979> mad<00:04:00.159> it's<00:04:00.790> got<00:04:01.000> good<00:04:01.180> music<00:04:01.359> got

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
run it as mad it's got good music got

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.469 
run it as mad it's got good music got
well<00:04:02.319> it's<00:04:03.040> got<00:04:03.310> nice<00:04:03.489> visuals<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.180> suppose

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:04.479 
well it's got nice visuals I suppose

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.789 
well it's got nice visuals I suppose
it's<00:04:04.689> hard<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.079> really<00:04:05.199> say<00:04:05.379> it's<00:04:05.500> got<00:04:05.620> great

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
it's hard to really say it's got great

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.770 
it's hard to really say it's got great
visuals<00:04:06.189> only<00:04:06.370> thinks<00:04:06.609> it's<00:04:06.790> just<00:04:07.060> two<00:04:07.239> day<00:04:07.419> it

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
visuals only thinks it's just two day it

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.209 
visuals only thinks it's just two day it
just<00:04:07.959> pretty<00:04:08.349> much<00:04:08.500> does<00:04:08.769> everything<00:04:08.979> right

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:09.219 
just pretty much does everything right

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:10.979 
just pretty much does everything right
in<00:04:09.400> my<00:04:09.519> box<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:10.060> as<00:04:10.239> I'll<00:04:10.389> see<00:04:10.509> how<00:04:10.599> we<00:04:10.689> are<00:04:10.810> all

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
in my box but as I'll see how we are all

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.259 
in my box but as I'll see how we are all
different<00:04:11.139> so<00:04:11.620> anyway<00:04:12.609> this<00:04:12.849> is<00:04:12.939> the<00:04:12.969> part<00:04:13.239> of

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
different so anyway this is the part of

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.640 
different so anyway this is the part of
what<00:04:13.479> I'm<00:04:13.569> gonna<00:04:13.689> show<00:04:13.900> up<00:04:14.019> it's<00:04:14.199> flashlight

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
what I'm gonna show up it's flashlight

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.959 
what I'm gonna show up it's flashlight
mode<00:04:14.829> as<00:04:15.099> you<00:04:15.189> might<00:04:15.310> have<00:04:15.370> figured<00:04:15.579> out<00:04:15.759> by

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:15.969 
mode as you might have figured out by

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.849 
mode as you might have figured out by
now<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.690> steer<00:04:16.989> just<00:04:17.229> pretty<00:04:17.380> much<00:04:17.560> pitch

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
now the steer just pretty much pitch

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.709 
now the steer just pretty much pitch
black<00:04:18.190> or<00:04:18.430> with<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.880> exception<00:04:19.329> of<00:04:19.419> where<00:04:19.599> the

black or with the exception of where the

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.430 
black or with the exception of where the
blocks<00:04:19.959> falling<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:20.859> it's<00:04:21.009> one<00:04:21.159> of

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
blocks falling so it's one of
