hi there this is Ranjit and in this
video<00:00:05.069> we'll<00:00:05.430> be<00:00:05.580> comparing<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.210> moto<00:00:06.420> g2

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
video we'll be comparing the moto g2

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.169 
video we'll be comparing the moto g2
versus<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.770> samsung<00:00:08.189> galaxy<00:00:08.220> grand<00:00:08.820> prime

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
versus the samsung galaxy grand prime

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.180 
versus the samsung galaxy grand prime
and<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.750> fact<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.050> have<00:00:10.170> already<00:00:10.200> reviewed<00:00:10.800> both

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and in fact I have already reviewed both

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.220 
and in fact I have already reviewed both
these<00:00:11.429> devices<00:00:11.940> link<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> main<00:00:12.840> reviews

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
these devices link for the main reviews

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.950 
these devices link for the main reviews
will<00:00:13.410> be<00:00:13.440> somewhere<00:00:13.860> over<00:00:14.070> here<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.420> both

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
will be somewhere over here but and both

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.810 
will be somewhere over here but and both
these<00:00:16.080> devices<00:00:16.260> are<00:00:16.650> mid-range<00:00:17.070> devices<00:00:17.460> and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
these devices are mid-range devices and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
these devices are mid-range devices and
the<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.630> I'm<00:00:19.560> getting<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.250> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the thing is that I'm getting a lot of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.460 
the thing is that I'm getting a lot of
questions<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:20.939> regarding<00:00:21.359> these<00:00:21.539> devices<00:00:22.260> so

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
questions so regarding these devices so

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.590 
questions so regarding these devices so
I'll<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.189> comparing<00:00:23.760> both<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.150> them<00:00:24.269> because

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
I'll be comparing both of them because

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.810 
I'll be comparing both of them because
in<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:24.930> aspects<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> Moto<00:00:25.680> G<00:00:25.949> 2<00:00:26.099> goes<00:00:26.609> ahead

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
in some aspects the Moto G 2 goes ahead

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.839 
in some aspects the Moto G 2 goes ahead
and<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.510> some<00:00:27.720> aspects<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.949> galaxy<00:00:29.550> grant

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
and in some aspects the galaxy grant

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.370 
and in some aspects the galaxy grant
prime<00:00:30.090> goes<00:00:30.330> ahead<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.750> fact<00:00:31.170> I've<00:00:31.349> just

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
prime goes ahead in fact I've just

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.130 
prime goes ahead in fact I've just
written<00:00:31.650> them<00:00:31.949> down<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.610> let's<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.809> over<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
written them down so let's go over it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
written them down so let's go over it
and<00:00:34.320> these<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> top<00:00:35.340> 10<00:00:35.579> points<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.239> would

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and these are the top 10 points I would

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
and these are the top 10 points I would
say<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.140> first<00:00:37.380> thing<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.129> build

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
say and the first thing is the build

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580 
say and the first thing is the build
quality<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:39.420> definitely<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.020> would<00:00:40.230> say<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
quality here definitely I would say the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.770 
quality here definitely I would say the
Moto<00:00:40.800> G<00:00:41.129> 2<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> superior<00:00:42.210> build<00:00:42.600> quality

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
Moto G 2 has a superior build quality

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
Moto G 2 has a superior build quality
the<00:00:43.140> grant<00:00:43.530> prime<00:00:43.710> also<00:00:43.920> has<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> decent<00:00:44.460> build

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the grant prime also has a decent build

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
the grant prime also has a decent build
quality<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:45.750> say<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.170> still<00:00:46.469> feels

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
quality but I would say it still feels

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.799 
quality but I would say it still feels
very<00:00:47.250> plasticy<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.239> build<00:00:48.629> quality

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
very plasticy in build quality

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
very plasticy in build quality
definitely<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> would<00:00:49.680> give<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> word<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
definitely I would give the word to the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
definitely I would give the word to the
Moto<00:00:51.180> G<00:00:51.510> 2<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.379> comes<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> configuration

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
Moto G 2 when it comes to configuration

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
Moto G 2 when it comes to configuration
your<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.300> would<00:00:54.480> say<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.079> grand<00:00:55.410> trine<00:00:55.649> goes

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
your I would say the grand trine goes

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.760 
your I would say the grand trine goes
ahead<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.210> sports<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.870> quad-core

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
ahead because it sports a quad-core

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.400 
ahead because it sports a quad-core
processor<00:00:58.949> even<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> Moto<00:01:00.059> G<00:01:00.300> 2<00:01:00.449> has<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.899> but

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
processor even the Moto G 2 has that but

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.009 
processor even the Moto G 2 has that but
the<00:01:01.649> grant<00:01:02.219> prime<00:01:02.489> has<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.120> Snapdragon<00:01:03.719> 410

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the grant prime has the Snapdragon 410

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.700 
the grant prime has the Snapdragon 410
chipset<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> Adreno<00:01:05.729> 306<00:01:06.240> GPU<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
chipset with the Adreno 306 GPU and that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
chipset with the Adreno 306 GPU and that
also<00:01:07.860> reflects<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> performance<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.689> if

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
also reflects in the performance so if

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.410 
also reflects in the performance so if
you<00:01:10.530> look<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.130> raw<00:01:11.460> configuration

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you look at just a raw configuration

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.510 
you look at just a raw configuration
here<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> grant<00:01:13.260> prime<00:01:13.560> goes<00:01:13.920> ahead<00:01:14.100> both

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
here the grant prime goes ahead both

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
here the grant prime goes ahead both
have<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:14.970> gig<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.270> ROM<00:01:15.799> now<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.070> move<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
have one gig of ROM now if we move to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
have one gig of ROM now if we move to
the<00:01:17.490> screen<00:01:17.820> quality<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.630> definitely<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the screen quality here definitely the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.010 
the screen quality here definitely the
Moto<00:01:19.830> G<00:01:20.100> 2<00:01:20.280> goes<00:01:20.520> ahead<00:01:20.820> both<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> 5-inch

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
Moto G 2 goes ahead both have a 5-inch

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.520 
Moto G 2 goes ahead both have a 5-inch
screen<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> Moto<00:01:23.280> G<00:01:23.549> 2<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> 720p<00:01:25.080> HD

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
screen but the Moto G 2 has a 720p HD

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.160 
screen but the Moto G 2 has a 720p HD
screen<00:01:25.860> whereas<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.820> grande<00:01:27.090> Prime<00:01:27.360> has<00:01:27.869> just

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
screen whereas the grande Prime has just

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.069 
screen whereas the grande Prime has just
a<00:01:28.320> qht<00:01:28.950> screen<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:30.180> 540<00:01:30.720> by<00:01:30.840> 960

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
a qht screen that is just 540 by 960

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.770 
a qht screen that is just 540 by 960
pixels<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> definitely<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.329> screen<00:01:33.570> quality

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
pixels and definitely the screen quality

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.370 
pixels and definitely the screen quality
is<00:01:34.200> much<00:01:34.500> better<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> Moto<00:01:35.970> G<00:01:36.360> 2<00:01:36.600> next<00:01:37.290> if

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
is much better on the Moto G 2 next if

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.410 
is much better on the Moto G 2 next if
we<00:01:37.470> move<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.799> call<00:01:38.189> quality<00:01:38.640> both<00:01:39.210> these

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
we move to the call quality both these

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
we move to the call quality both these
devices<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.990> pretty<00:01:40.200> decent<00:01:40.290> call<00:01:40.890> quality

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
devices have pretty decent call quality

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
devices have pretty decent call quality
but<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> would<00:01:42.000> give<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> slight<00:01:42.479> edge<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
but I would give a slight edge to the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.960 
but I would give a slight edge to the
grant<00:01:43.560> prime<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> call<00:01:44.520> quality<00:01:44.670> was

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
grant prime because the call quality was

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.660 
grant prime because the call quality was
slightly<00:01:45.240> better<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.259> grant<00:01:46.680> prime<00:01:47.070> now

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
slightly better on the grant prime now

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.370 
slightly better on the grant prime now
if<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> move<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.180> battery<00:01:48.600> life<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.200> we

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
if we move to the battery life here we

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
if we move to the battery life here we
have<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> stark<00:01:49.950> difference<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:51.360> Moto<00:01:51.600> G<00:01:51.810> 2<00:01:51.960> has

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
have a stark difference the Moto G 2 has

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.740 
have a stark difference the Moto G 2 has
a<00:01:52.170> 2070<00:01:53.040> milliamp<00:01:53.430> hour<00:01:53.610> battery<00:01:53.640> whereas<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a 2070 milliamp hour battery whereas the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
a 2070 milliamp hour battery whereas the
grande<00:01:54.990> prime<00:01:55.259> has<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> 2600<00:01:56.759> milliamp<00:01:56.939> hour

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
grande prime has the 2600 milliamp hour

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
grande prime has the 2600 milliamp hour
battery<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.500> my<00:01:58.649> testing<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> grant

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
battery and in my testing the grant

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.700 
battery and in my testing the grant
prime<00:01:59.759> actually<00:02:00.509> performed<00:02:00.930> very<00:02:01.259> well<00:02:01.350> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
prime actually performed very well I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.550 
prime actually performed very well I
could<00:02:02.159> make<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> work<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:03.000> casual<00:02:03.509> usage<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
could make it work with casual usage to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160 
could make it work with casual usage to
even<00:02:04.860> around<00:02:05.130> 1.5<00:02:05.729> days<00:02:05.969> or<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.450> whereas<00:02:07.049> on

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
even around 1.5 days or so whereas on

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
even around 1.5 days or so whereas on
the<00:02:07.259> Moto<00:02:07.439> G<00:02:07.680> 2<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.039> had<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> charge<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.970> at<00:02:09.270> night

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the Moto G 2 I had to charge it at night

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.080 
the Moto G 2 I had to charge it at night
so<00:02:10.170> definitely<00:02:10.500> battery<00:02:11.129> life<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> criteria

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
so definitely battery life is a criteria

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.180 
so definitely battery life is a criteria
the<00:02:12.480> grant<00:02:12.870> prime<00:02:13.140> goes<00:02:13.379> ahead

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the grant prime goes ahead

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.280 
the grant prime goes ahead
and<00:02:14.280> next<00:02:15.210> if<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.360> move<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> internal

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and next if we move to the internal

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.680 
and next if we move to the internal
storage<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.280> preference<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.330> would<00:02:18.480> save

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
storage here the preference I would save

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.570 
storage here the preference I would save
would<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:19.050> for<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> Moto<00:02:19.800> G<00:02:20.040> 2<00:02:20.190> because<00:02:20.460> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
would be for the Moto G 2 because the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.090 
would be for the Moto G 2 because the
Moto<00:02:20.760> G<00:02:21.000> 2<00:02:21.150> comes<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:21.750> 16<00:02:22.230> gigs<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.920> internal

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
Moto G 2 comes with 16 gigs of internal

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.700 
Moto G 2 comes with 16 gigs of internal

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
storage whereas on the ground Prime we

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.070 
storage whereas on the ground Prime we
just<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.130> 8<00:02:26.430> gigs<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.850> internal<00:02:27.030> storage<00:02:27.480> both

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
just get 8 gigs of internal storage both

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.500 
just get 8 gigs of internal storage both
these<00:02:28.260> devices<00:02:28.680> support<00:02:29.100> micro<00:02:29.430> SD<00:02:29.760> card<00:02:30.030> slot

these devices support micro SD card slot

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.230 
these devices support micro SD card slot
though<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.800> next<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:32.610> move<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.880> camera

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
though and next if we move to camera

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.790 
though and next if we move to camera
here<00:02:33.420> things<00:02:33.690> become<00:02:33.960> really<00:02:33.990> interesting

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
here things become really interesting

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.620 
here things become really interesting
because<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.670> main<00:02:35.820> camera<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.300> both<00:02:36.510> these

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
because the main camera on both these

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.080 
because the main camera on both these
devices<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:37.170> 8<00:02:37.470> megapixel<00:02:38.040> shooter<00:02:38.100> but<00:02:38.850> when

Prime Samsung hasn't promised anything

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.690 
Prime Samsung hasn't promised anything
like<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.230> I'm<00:03:07.320> not<00:03:07.380> very<00:03:07.500> sure<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.340> it

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
like that so I'm not very sure if it

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.610 
like that so I'm not very sure if it

not next if we move to some of the
features<00:03:13.650> your<00:03:14.130> Samsung<00:03:14.820> really<00:03:15.090> skim<00:03:15.600> for

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
features your Samsung really skim for

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.110 
features your Samsung really skim for
example<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.830> grande<00:03:17.220> prime<00:03:17.520> does<00:03:17.760> not<00:03:17.940> even

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
example the grande prime does not even

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.420 
example the grande prime does not even
have<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.390> LED<00:03:18.780> notification<00:03:18.959> light<00:03:19.470> USB<00:03:20.310> OTG

all<00:03:22.950> these<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.520> present<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.240> Moto<00:03:24.480> G<00:03:24.750> 2<00:03:24.900> so

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
all these are present on the Moto G 2 so

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.380 
all these are present on the Moto G 2 so
here<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.440> would<00:03:25.680> say<00:03:25.709> Samsung<00:03:26.400> really<00:03:26.670> skimp<00:03:27.150> on

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
here I would say Samsung really skimp on

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.420 
here I would say Samsung really skimp on
it<00:03:27.600> next<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.620> talk<00:03:28.800> about<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.130> speaker
