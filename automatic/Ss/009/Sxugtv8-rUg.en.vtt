00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.280 
the bottom of your channel you're going
to<00:01:07.890> place<00:01:08.070> electromagnets<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:12.290> there

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to place electromagnets like this there

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.700 
to place electromagnets like this there
we<00:01:13.350> go

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
we go

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
we go
then<00:01:14.700> you're<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.270> some<00:01:16.080> more

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
then you're going to get some more

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.149 
then you're going to get some more
little<00:01:16.470> magnets<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.759> along<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> sides<00:01:19.159> along

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
little magnets go along the sides along

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.630 
little magnets go along the sides along
this<00:01:20.280> side<00:01:23.030> build<00:01:24.030> along<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.689> side<00:01:25.640> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this side build along this side you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
this side build along this side you
don't<00:01:26.850> need<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> corner<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.170> we

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
don't need this one in the corner so we

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.100 
don't need this one in the corner so we
can<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.560> rid<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:30.439> there<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> then

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
can get rid of that there we go and then

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
can get rid of that there we go and then
you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.320> place<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:35.810> he's<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> get

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you can place one here he's going to get

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.460 
you can place one here he's going to get
some<00:01:37.439> glass<00:01:38.090> next<00:01:39.090> magnetic<00:01:39.630> glass<00:01:39.810> even<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
some glass next magnetic glass even and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.539 
some glass next magnetic glass even and
run<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> across<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.000> top<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:43.280> across<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
run it across the top here across the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.580 
run it across the top here across the
top<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.210> across<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> top<00:01:46.549> yeah<00:01:48.590> okay

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
top here and across the top yeah okay

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.429 
top here and across the top yeah okay
that's<00:01:49.950> step<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:50.540> okay<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.899> we're<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that's step one okay so we're back and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.289 
that's step one okay so we're back and

leaving<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.959> 1<00:02:28.230> block<00:02:28.500> gap<00:02:31.579> like<00:02:32.579> this<00:02:52.099> okay

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
leaving a 1 block gap like this okay

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.819 
leaving a 1 block gap like this okay
that's<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:54.030> end<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.239> step<00:02:54.480> 3<00:02:55.109> I<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.439> I<00:02:55.650> said

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
that's the end of step 3 I think I said

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.909 
that's the end of step 3 I think I said
and<00:02:56.040> will<00:02:56.639> be<00:02:56.790> backward<00:02:57.150> step<00:02:57.329> 4<00:02:57.739> okay

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
and will be backward step 4 okay

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.800 
and will be backward step 4 okay
so<00:02:59.189> step<00:02:59.430> 4<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.000> guys<00:03:00.150> need<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.480> get<00:03:00.720> yourself

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
so step 4 you guys need to get yourself

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.920 
so step 4 you guys need to get yourself

can just reach it down then it will

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.680 
can just reach it down then it will
generate<00:04:31.100> something<00:04:31.729> like<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.360> but<00:04:32.630> I'm

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690

every<00:06:44.820> time<00:06:45.000> so<00:06:45.690> if<00:06:45.750> I<00:06:45.900> go<00:06:46.050> into<00:06:46.229> this<00:06:46.680> machine

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
every time so if I go into this machine

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.120 
every time so if I go into this machine
here<00:06:47.880> I<00:06:48.150> take<00:06:48.479> out<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:48.750> stone<00:06:48.990> you<00:06:49.919> just

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
here I take out the stone you just

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.779 
here I take out the stone you just
automatically<00:06:50.850> tops<00:06:51.210> it<00:06:51.360> up<00:06:51.479> with<00:06:51.690> stone<00:06:52.789> so

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
automatically tops it up with stone so

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.020 
automatically tops it up with stone so
there<00:06:54.300> yeah<00:06:54.510> that's<00:06:54.810> just<00:06:55.050> how<00:06:55.139> that<00:06:55.289> works<00:06:56.030> so

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
there yeah that's just how that works so

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.150 
there yeah that's just how that works so
in<00:06:57.180> practice<00:06:57.660> here<00:06:58.050> we<00:06:58.139> are<00:06:58.169> we<00:06:58.710> can<00:06:58.860> turn<00:06:59.070> this

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
in practice here we are we can turn this

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.840 
in practice here we are we can turn this
machine<00:06:59.310> on

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.400 

and<00:07:03.850> hopefully<00:07:04.630> it<00:07:04.690> will<00:07:04.750> generate<00:07:05.110> strange

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
and hopefully it will generate strange

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.680 
and hopefully it will generate strange
Matt's<00:07:05.590> presence<00:07:05.860> if<00:07:05.950> you<00:07:06.040> quickly<00:07:06.690> so

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
Matt's presence if you quickly so

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:13.010 
Matt's presence if you quickly so
they're<00:07:07.900> not<00:07:07.960> waiting<00:07:08.170> for<00:07:08.440> a<00:07:08.560> long<00:07:08.650> time

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.210 

there<00:07:14.020> you<00:07:14.080> go<00:07:14.260> strange<00:07:14.740> bastards<00:07:15.070> been

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
there you go strange bastards been

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.310 
there you go strange bastards been
generated<00:07:15.850> that's<00:07:16.690> going<00:07:16.870> to<00:07:16.960> flow<00:07:17.140> all<00:07:17.290> the

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320 
generated that's going to flow all the

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.880 
generated that's going to flow all the
way<00:07:17.410> down<00:07:17.680> here<00:07:17.980> you<00:07:19.350> saw<00:07:20.350> that<00:07:20.470> we<00:07:20.590> only<00:07:20.710> had

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.890 
way down here you saw that we only had

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.590 
way down here you saw that we only had
two<00:07:21.070> strange<00:07:21.460> master<00:07:21.700> in<00:07:21.880> the<00:07:21.970> system<00:07:22.270> earlier

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
two strange master in the system earlier

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.580 
two strange master in the system earlier
so<00:07:25.600> the<00:07:25.720> strange<00:07:25.960> race<00:07:26.110> is<00:07:26.260> going<00:07:26.380> to<00:07:26.500> come

the chest and then move out the DME

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.100 
the chest and then move out the DME
system<00:07:30.160> and<00:07:30.790> it'll<00:07:30.970> be<00:07:31.030> placed<00:07:31.330> in<00:07:31.600> it<00:07:31.840> as
