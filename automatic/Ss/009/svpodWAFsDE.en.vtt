00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.401
 Welcome to the grandest Atlassian summit in history 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.660
 More than 40,000 companies and organizations worldwide will use Atlassian products 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:25.190
 Many companies have found that our products JIRA, Confluence and HipChat can greatly improve their productivity 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.140
 Next you will hear how Vistaprint uses Atlassian's Service Desk to support their teams in 22 countries. 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.220
 You will also hear how Twitter uses Atlassian products to support their human resources, finance and legal departments. 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:48.380
 You will even hear how B Braun uses Atlassian products to create a social intranet that can support 50,000 employees. 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.350
 If there is only one company in the world, 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.430
 I woke up every day to think about teamwork. 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.371
 That must be Atlassian 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.540
 Below, we welcome my good friends and partners to the stage. 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.080
 Mike Cannon-Brooks. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.470
 Next, I will share with you the five highlights of the summit. 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.650
 This is an important year for our customers. 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.700
 In July not long ago, we launched enterprise services and software support services. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.620
 In addition to launching cloud services and server provisioning, we have also released a series of new products. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.080
 We have introduced a range of data center-based products for customers who have a huge demand for large-scale operations. 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.660
 Since July we have launched the JIRA data center 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.100
 Just last week 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.320
 We launched the Confluence data center 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.641
 Today I want to announce the launch of another data center service. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.300
 That is stash 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.080
 Stash data center features clustering, high availability, and high scalability 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.161
 We can use all accessories and Marketplace products in Stash. 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.169
 Let's talk about HipChat 

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:59.909
 Today, no matter what equipment your team is using, HipChat can connect everyone on the team anytime, anywhere. 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.830
 It integrates group chat, file sharing and applications together. 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.860
 Provide a good user experience for your teamwork 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.760
 You may be thinking: How much do I have to pay for this service? 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.610
 The answer is, 0 yuan 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.260
 We also launched HipChat+. If you want to add a video call 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.709
 Screen sharing and unlimited storage, you only need to buy 2 dollars a month for HipChat+ 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.309
 People sent a total of 3 billion messages via HipChat 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.310
 I have sent 1 billion in the past four months alone. 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.590
 As you can see in this chart, the number of messages sent by HipChat is accelerating. 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.401
 We have released the beta version of the HipChat server. 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.221
 More than 400 companies have been installed and put into production. 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.400
 Thousands of employees are using the product. 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.461
 This is definitely comparable to our cloud service. 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.900
 I am very looking forward to the upcoming iOS8 mobile client. 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.341
 Because of IOS8 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.100
 We can integrate HipChat with the entire system and other applications of the system. 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.660
 I also heard that there is another company. 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.880
 Now also in the development of the conference 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.460
 I seem to want to compete with us. 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.261
 They seem to have released a watch 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.381
 cHipChat will also be available on Apple Watches 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.301
 Now sdk and watches have not come out, so we can't be 100% sure 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.889
 But it should look like this 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.890
 Next, let's talk about Service Desk. 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.250
 It has easily become the most successful product we have ever published. 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.760
 There are already thousands of teams working on Service Desk. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.420
 Today while releasing Service Desk 2.0 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.900
 We have new pricing: 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.401
 All customers can use the Service Desk client for free 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.280
 For all customer service personnel using the service platform, the price is the same: $25 per customer service 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.520
 This fee includes all features 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.581
 You don't have to pay extra for other features 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.340
 Let's talk about Confluence 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.720
 Needless to say, one of our biggest applications, Confluence 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.920
 Great success in the past decade 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.460
 This success is: to enable everyone to cooperate in the same business environment 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.940
 Let's see why cooperation in the same transaction environment is so important. 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.580
 Working in the same transaction environment, we can improve the speed and precision of cooperation 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.360
 You will notice the difference between Confluence 5.7 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.461
 I can now select a part of the content. 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.841
 Just a little bit 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.111
 I can add comments directly to that part of the content. 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.000
 When I open ppt 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.620
 Look, I can share it with my colleagues. 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.050
 So various types of files are in Confluence 5.7 and above. 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.711
 Occupy an important position 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.460
 Html5 can display more than 80 file types 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.480
 Including the office documents you use 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.281
 Finally, we also added version control of the file. 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.100
 Make it easy to add new file versions 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.101
 Let's talk about development tools 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.060
 Two years ago we started our revolutionary road 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.641
 I hope to help the product team improve their workflow 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.830
 In order to achieve this goal, we created a development panel 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.230
 Now you can easily connect to all development-related content in every issue. 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.620
 Includes the programmer's workflow, work steps, and data 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.850
 We also speed up by adding a robot 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.590
 Now is as long as you set the automatic conversion of the issue state. 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.120
 Developers can continue to go to Stash to continue development work 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.680
 And the business people can continue to work on Bamboo. 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.800
 What we want is to enable people to use the best tools. 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.960
 When developers create branches and commit code 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.740
 The background robot automatically converts the status of the task. 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.490
 The automated workflow you set up on JIRA 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.570
 Now integrated into your development work 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.580
 JIRA also brought us a new experience 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.140
 Through the progress bar, I can see the progress from a macro perspective and understand how far I am from the target. 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.280
 How many problems have been solved, are being solved, or are waiting to be processed 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.450
 Sometimes you may not be aware of problems in your work. 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.570
 But it can remind you in time: your development has a problem 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.500
 We are the only company that can synchronize across different tools. 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.100
 Can tell you where something might be wrong 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.101
 Do you still want to hear more? 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.420
 Still enough? 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.240
 Still want to hear more? Well 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.781
 We have prepared a brand new product for you today. 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.791
 JIRA Portfolio 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.280
 The goal of JIRA Portfolio is clear 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.280
 That is: let you carry out the plan on a large scale 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.600
 Allows you to link your strategic plan to the actual situation 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.400
 Allows you to understand how to respond when something goes wrong 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.160
 Let you know when things are not going according to the plan, take corresponding measures 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.901
 We are working hard to get everyone involved in Portfolio management. 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.600
 You might think it is more useful for big teams. 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.561
 But we believe that all teams will benefit from it. 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.670
 Let us review it quickly. 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.830
 We released Confluence and Stash data centers for our big customers. 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.560
 Guaranteed that we can grow with them 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.230
 Our HipChat has a beta version of the server, IOS and OSX clients 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.640
 Also integrated with Confluence and Bitbucket 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.220
 Service Desk 2.0 has a unified website portal, email service 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.660
 Each customer service costs only $25, and customers can use it for free. 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.260
 Confluence allows teams to collaborate in the same business environment 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.841
 You can add comments, share files and preview content to your document. 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.840
 We provide the development team with a development layout, a smart detector and a new version experience. 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.840
 We also have a brand new product: JIRA Portfolio 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.740
 It allows you to implement your company's strategic plan in actual operations. 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.141
 The above is what I want to share with you, thank you
