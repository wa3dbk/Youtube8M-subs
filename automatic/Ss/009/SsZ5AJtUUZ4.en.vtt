this<00:02:44.020> way<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.950> how<00:02:45.280> we<00:02:45.610> really<00:02:46.120> will<00:02:46.330> create

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
this way is how we really will create

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.150 
this way is how we really will create
the<00:02:47.020> best<00:02:47.260> effect<00:02:52.440> next<00:02:53.440> step<00:02:53.710> is<00:02:53.890> going<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.100> be

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
the best effect next step is going to be

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.430 
the best effect next step is going to be
go<00:02:54.610> right<00:02:54.880> away<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.600> red<00:02:55.810> part<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> eye

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
go right away to the red part of the eye

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.100 
go right away to the red part of the eye
which<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:57.100> one<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.550> most<00:02:57.760> important<00:02:58.480> we

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
which is one of the most important we

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.800 
which is one of the most important we
need<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.320> look<00:02:59.680> really<00:03:00.550> like<00:03:00.820> highlights<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
need to look really like highlights and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.250 
need to look really like highlights and
shadows<00:03:02.580> without<00:03:03.580> using<00:03:04.000> any<00:03:04.300> extra<00:03:04.840> product

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
shadows without using any extra product

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.480 
shadows without using any extra product
so<00:03:05.470> we're<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.710> to<00:03:05.860> start<00:03:05.890> playing<00:03:06.340> the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
so we're going to start playing the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.020 
so we're going to start playing the
brown<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.510> corners<00:03:08.670> now<00:03:09.670> we're<00:03:09.850> going<00:03:09.970> to

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
brown on the corners now we're going to

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.000 
brown on the corners now we're going to
move<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.630> black<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.230> we're<00:03:11.740> going<00:03:11.920> to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
move to the black and we're going to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.340 
move to the black and we're going to
start<00:03:12.250> creating<00:03:12.520> more<00:03:12.940> intensity<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.900> volume

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
start creating more intensity and volume

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.350 
start creating more intensity and volume
gonna<00:03:15.160> start<00:03:15.460> playing<00:03:15.730> first<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.240> all<00:03:16.330> a

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
gonna start playing first of all a

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.540 
gonna start playing first of all a
little<00:03:16.600> bit<00:03:16.810> around<00:03:17.110> their<00:03:17.440> wounds<00:03:17.800> of<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
little bit around their wounds of the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.240 
little bit around their wounds of the
eye<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.990> then<00:03:19.990> again<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.320> use<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:20.830> create

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
eye and then again I use it to create

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.210 
eye and then again I use it to create
some<00:03:21.580> depth<00:03:21.880> just<00:03:22.840> in<00:03:22.990> some<00:03:23.200> areas<00:03:23.620> remember

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
some depth just in some areas remember

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.670 
some depth just in some areas remember
this<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.150> trick<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.660> create<00:03:26.200> some<00:03:26.500> volume

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
this is the trick to create some volume

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.400 
this is the trick to create some volume
and<00:03:27.100> highlighting<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.630> make<00:03:28.810> these<00:03:29.080> loop

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
and highlighting to make these loop

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.900 
and highlighting to make these loop
apparently<00:03:30.280> or<00:03:30.490> parent<00:03:31.060> look<00:03:31.420> real<00:03:32.550> but<00:03:33.550> if<00:03:33.730> we

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
apparently or parent look real but if we

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.850 
apparently or parent look real but if we
apply<00:03:34.210> too<00:03:34.270> much<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:35.110> they<00:03:35.200> will<00:03:35.380> get<00:03:35.650> the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
apply too much and they will get the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.490 
apply too much and they will get the
opposite<00:03:36.340> arm<00:03:36.730> effect<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:38.050> will<00:03:38.200> start

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
opposite arm effect and it will start

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.640 
opposite arm effect and it will start
looking<00:03:38.680> completely<00:03:39.460> fake<00:03:40.020> so<00:03:41.020> get<00:03:41.440> some

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
looking completely fake so get some

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.560 
looking completely fake so get some
natural<00:03:41.860> effect<00:03:42.400> applying<00:03:42.850> here<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.360> there

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
natural effect applying here and there

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.250 
natural effect applying here and there
and<00:03:43.780> blend<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:45.540> we<00:03:46.540> also<00:03:46.690> going<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.990> apply<00:03:47.080> this

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
and blend it we also going to apply this

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.770 
and blend it we also going to apply this
black<00:03:47.860> on<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.250> upper<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.700> lower<00:03:48.880> lash<00:03:49.480> line
