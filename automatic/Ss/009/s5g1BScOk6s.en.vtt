00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.540 
much just an otk deck so you just need
the<00:03:49.940> whole<00:03:50.180> back<00:03:50.330> road<00:03:50.510> mobile<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:52.130> smashing

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
the whole back road mobile to smashing

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.070 
the whole back road mobile to smashing
grounds<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:52.970> like<00:03:53.270> smashing<00:03:53.750> right<00:03:53.900> on<00:03:53.990> the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
deck because pretty much your combo

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.410 
deck because pretty much your combo
revolves<00:03:56.540> around<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:58.190> cyber<00:03:58.520> dragon<00:03:58.940> so

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
revolves around the cyber dragon so

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.270 
revolves around the cyber dragon so
whenever<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.440> special<00:04:00.770> summon<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.220> they

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
whenever you special summon and they

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.340 
whenever you special summon and they
control<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.640> monster<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.570> want<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.870> smashing

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
control a monster you want to smashing

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.810 
control a monster you want to smashing
ground<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.590> monster<00:04:03.950> way<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.190> get<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.700> extra

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
ground the monster way to get the extra

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.520 
ground the monster way to get the extra
damage<00:04:05.180> through<00:04:05.570> for<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:05.960> to<00:04:06.050> push<00:04:06.200> for<00:04:06.380> game

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
damage through for you to push for game

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.200 
damage through for you to push for game
so<00:04:07.220> pretty<00:04:07.400> much<00:04:07.460> smashing<00:04:07.790> ground<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.000> really

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
doesn't destroy the monster so I mean it

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:37.640

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.689 
negated to take a thousand but it stays
there<00:06:41.539> so<00:06:42.539> I<00:06:42.900> mean<00:06:43.199> it's<00:06:43.319> not<00:06:43.469> as<00:06:43.710> good<00:06:43.949> but<00:06:44.279> I

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
there so I mean it's not as good but I

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.070 
there so I mean it's not as good but I
mean<00:06:44.849> the<00:06:44.909> extra<00:06:45.150> burn<00:06:45.300> damage<00:06:45.509> is<00:06:45.810> really

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
mean the extra burn damage is really

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.869 
mean the extra burn damage is really
nice<00:06:46.199> because<00:06:46.800> they're<00:06:47.430> always<00:06:47.550> left<00:06:47.789> with

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:47.879
