aren't really a huge thing anymore

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.660 
aren't really a huge thing anymore
because<00:00:57.710> most<00:00:58.710> people<00:00:58.949> use<00:00:59.070> their<00:00:59.280> cell<00:00:59.489> phone

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
because most people use their cell phone

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.950 
because most people use their cell phone
cameras<00:01:00.800> for<00:01:01.800> things<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.940> guess<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.510> taking

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
this little switch does exactly but but

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.819 
this little switch does exactly but but
let's<00:03:47.650> see<00:03:47.769> if<00:03:47.799> I<00:03:47.889> can<00:03:48.040> get<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:49.680> battery<00:03:50.680> in

let's see if I can get the battery in
there<00:03:52.109> see<00:03:53.109> if<00:03:53.169> I<00:03:53.230> can<00:03:53.349> figure<00:03:53.530> this<00:03:53.620> out<00:03:53.919> okay

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
there see if I can figure this out okay

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.680 
there see if I can figure this out okay
let's<00:03:54.579> see<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:55.030> looks<00:03:55.120> like<00:03:55.239> it's<00:03:55.359> gonna<00:03:55.540> go

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
let's see it looks like it's gonna go

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.839 
let's see it looks like it's gonna go
this<00:03:55.870> way

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.210 

let's<00:04:00.849> see<00:04:00.940> if<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.060> can<00:04:01.410> get<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.739> close<00:04:02.980> up

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
let's see if I can get that to close up

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.539 
let's see if I can get that to close up
there<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.650> see<00:04:05.859> if<00:04:05.919> I<00:04:05.980> can<00:04:06.069> get<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.280> turn<00:04:06.459> off

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
there and see if I can get the turn off

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.460 
there and see if I can get the turn off
okay<00:04:06.760> let's<00:04:07.540> try

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.509
