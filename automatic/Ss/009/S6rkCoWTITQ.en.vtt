00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.450 
because it gives a more of a natural its
shapes<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.260> define<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> face<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.040> better<00:02:11.190> so

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
shapes and define the face of better so

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.570 
shapes and define the face of better so
you<00:02:11.520> hold<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.390> iron<00:02:13.080> upwards<00:02:13.680> like<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.040> like

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
you hold the iron upwards like that like

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.390 
you hold the iron upwards like that like
almost<00:02:14.880> vertical<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.860> then<00:02:16.860> again<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.280> go

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
almost vertical and then again you go

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.040 
almost vertical and then again you go
towards<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.820> end<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.270> then<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.660> build<00:02:18.990> a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
towards the end and then you build a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.140 
towards the end and then you build a
color<00:02:19.290> up

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.520 

so<00:02:26.150> now<00:02:26.330> why<00:02:26.630> it's<00:02:26.900> still<00:02:26.990> there<00:02:27.290> we're<00:02:27.440> gonna

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
so now why it's still there we're gonna

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.590 
so now why it's still there we're gonna
use<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.890> spray<00:02:28.130> again<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.640> just<00:02:28.730> spray<00:02:29.569> it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
use the spray again and just spray it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.170 
use the spray again and just spray it
all<00:02:29.810> over<00:02:29.980> then<00:02:30.980> again<00:02:31.250> using<00:02:31.490> your<00:02:31.700> hands

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
all over then again using your hands

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.690 
all over then again using your hands
just<00:02:32.390> sort<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> scrunch<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.370> scrunch<00:02:34.370> it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
just sort of scrunch that scrunch it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.850 
just sort of scrunch that scrunch it
away<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.510> do<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:38.709> okay

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
away you do this okay

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.370 
away you do this okay
last<00:02:40.069> bit<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.700> crown<00:02:41.110> trying<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.170> create

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
last bit is the crown trying to create

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.840 
last bit is the crown trying to create
more<00:02:42.530> volume<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:43.430> now<00:02:43.520> we're<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:43.670> gonna

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
more volume so now we're just gonna

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.840 
more volume so now we're just gonna
start<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.360> middle<00:02:45.430> I'm<00:02:46.430> gonna<00:02:46.580> curl

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
start in the middle I'm gonna curl

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.850 
start in the middle I'm gonna curl
outwards<00:02:47.420> as<00:02:47.600> well<00:02:47.780> because<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.380> way<00:02:48.650> it

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
outwards as well because that way it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.620 
outwards as well because that way it
creates<00:02:49.040> with<00:02:49.310> more<00:02:49.459> volume<00:02:49.610> but<00:02:49.970> also<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
creates with more volume but also it

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.240 
creates with more volume but also it
shapes<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.110> side<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.410> your<00:02:51.500> face<00:02:51.709> more<00:02:52.040> better

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250
