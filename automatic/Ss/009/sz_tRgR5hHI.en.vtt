hey<00:03:04.560> y'all<00:03:04.769> one<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.760> great<00:03:06.000> things<00:03:06.329> about

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
hey y'all one of the great things about

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.030 
hey y'all one of the great things about
the<00:03:06.720> CUDA<00:03:07.079> which<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.349> one<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.620> reasons<00:03:07.920> why

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
the CUDA which is one of the reasons why

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.160 
the CUDA which is one of the reasons why
I<00:03:08.069> chose<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.459> take<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.150> trip<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
I chose to take it on this trip is the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.599 
I chose to take it on this trip is the
speed<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.920> ease<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.519> paddling<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.959> thing<00:03:13.260> in

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
speed and ease of paddling this thing in

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.180 
speed and ease of paddling this thing in
20<00:03:14.609> mile<00:03:14.790> an<00:03:14.970> hour<00:03:15.060> winds<00:03:15.480> with<00:03:16.010> pretty<00:03:17.010> big

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
20 mile an hour winds with pretty big

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.190 
20 mile an hour winds with pretty big
seas<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:17.910> cuts<00:03:18.510> right<00:03:18.690> through<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.930> waves

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
seas just cuts right through the waves

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.710 
seas just cuts right through the waves
and<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.560> keeps<00:03:19.889> on<00:03:20.069> trucking<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:21.329> thing<00:03:21.569> is

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
and just keeps on trucking this thing is

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.770 
and just keeps on trucking this thing is
amazing<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.010> wind<00:03:23.250> barely<00:03:24.060> affected<00:03:24.450> it

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
amazing that the wind barely affected it

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.379 
amazing that the wind barely affected it
at<00:03:24.900> all<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.319> normally<00:03:26.310> when<00:03:26.819> I'm<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.239> my

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
at all and normally when I'm in like my

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.670 
at all and normally when I'm in like my
kusa<00:03:27.870> HD<00:03:28.410> or<00:03:28.829> even<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:30.030> real<00:03:30.720> tree<00:03:30.930> Kilroy<00:03:31.410> or

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
something like that

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.210 
something like that
I<00:03:33.019> don't<00:03:34.019> always<00:03:34.200> have<00:03:34.410> trouble<00:03:34.590> keeping<00:03:34.950> up

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
I don't always have trouble keeping up

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.360 
I don't always have trouble keeping up
with<00:03:35.370> other<00:03:35.519> people<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.139> can<00:03:37.980> stick<00:03:38.190> with

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
with other people but I can stick with

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.440 
with other people but I can stick with
them<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.730> sometimes<00:03:38.910> I'll<00:03:39.180> fall<00:03:39.329> behind

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
them and sometimes I'll fall behind

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.780 
them and sometimes I'll fall behind
because<00:03:39.690> I'm<00:03:39.959> lazy<00:03:40.310> don't<00:03:41.310> tell<00:03:41.430> anybody<00:03:41.579> I

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
because I'm lazy don't tell anybody I

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.420 
because I'm lazy don't tell anybody I
said<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.269> but<00:03:43.049> when<00:03:43.500> I'm<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.889> CUDA<00:03:44.280> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
said that but when I'm in the CUDA I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.660 
said that but when I'm in the CUDA I
stay<00:03:44.670> in<00:03:44.819> front<00:03:45.620> okay<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.160> next<00:03:47.310> point<00:03:47.609> I

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
stay in front okay so the next point I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.039 
stay in front okay so the next point I
want<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.940> cover<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.420> boat<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
want to cover on the boat is the

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.890 
want to cover on the boat is the
stability<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.950> boat<00:03:50.420> even<00:03:51.420> though<00:03:51.720> it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
stability of this boat even though it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.559 
stability of this boat even though it
may<00:03:52.079> not<00:03:52.109> be<00:03:52.470> as<00:03:52.680> stable<00:03:53.160> as<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.549> kusa<00:03:53.880> HD<00:03:54.329> but

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
may not be as stable as the kusa HD but

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.449 
may not be as stable as the kusa HD but
for<00:03:54.720> somebody<00:03:55.019> with<00:03:55.230> decent<00:03:55.650> balance<00:03:55.859> this

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
for somebody with decent balance this

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.449 
for somebody with decent balance this
boat<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.880> perfect<00:03:57.139> it<00:03:58.139> being<00:03:58.829> able<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.130> stand

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
boat is perfect it being able to stand

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.400 
boat is perfect it being able to stand
and<00:03:59.790> see<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.150> flats<00:04:00.389> where<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:00.630> was<00:04:00.780> fishing<00:04:00.989> is

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
and see the flats where I was fishing is

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.699 
and see the flats where I was fishing is
ideal<00:04:02.220> for<00:04:02.579> being<00:04:03.180> out<00:04:03.359> there<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.780> even<00:04:04.260> in

ideal for being out there and even in

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.099 
ideal for being out there and even in
there<00:04:05.400> being<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.700> light<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.150> medium<00:04:06.299> chop<00:04:06.840> with

lots of boat traffic around and heavy

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.479 
lots of boat traffic around and heavy
winds<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.510> had<00:04:09.959> no<00:04:10.200> problem<00:04:10.739> standing<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.340> this

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
winds I had no problem standing in this

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.290 
winds I had no problem standing in this
boat<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.150> actually<00:04:12.900> liked<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.680> tube

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
boat I actually liked the tube

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.650 
boat I actually liked the tube
because<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:15.260> prefer<00:04:16.160> spinning<00:04:16.820> rod<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.030> lot<00:04:17.390> and

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
because I prefer spinning rod a lot and

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.720 
because I prefer spinning rod a lot and
putting<00:04:18.530> them<00:04:18.650> spinning<00:04:19.040> rod<00:04:19.190> in<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.489> flush

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
putting them spinning rod in the flush

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.310 
putting them spinning rod in the flush
tube<00:04:19.970> requires<00:04:20.300> you<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.630> kick<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.989> out<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.140> the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
tube requires you to kick it out to the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.600 
tube requires you to kick it out to the
side<00:04:21.530> where<00:04:21.709> something<00:04:21.980> can<00:04:22.100> grab<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.520> and

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
side where something can grab it and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.420 
side where something can grab it and
yank<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.910> off<00:04:23.030> your<00:04:23.210> boat<00:04:23.390> a<00:04:23.420> little<00:04:23.720> easier

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
yank it off your boat a little easier

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.770 
yank it off your boat a little easier
with<00:04:25.430> these<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.850> can<00:04:25.970> actually<00:04:26.000> angle<00:04:26.660> them

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
with these you can actually angle them

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.540 
with these you can actually angle them
back<00:04:27.080> so<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.620> can<00:04:27.740> have<00:04:27.890> your<00:04:28.010> rods<00:04:28.280> lower

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
back so you can have your rods lower

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.830 
back so you can have your rods lower
down<00:04:28.850> so<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.120> can<00:04:29.270> paddle<00:04:29.510> through<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
down so you can paddle through the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.410 
down so you can paddle through the
mangroves<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.680> low-hanging<00:04:31.370> trees<00:04:32.060> wherever

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
mangroves and low-hanging trees wherever

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.290 
mangroves and low-hanging trees wherever
you<00:04:32.660> are<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.340> another<00:04:34.340> cool<00:04:34.610> part<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.000> you<00:04:35.150> can

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
you are and another cool part is you can

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.150 
you are and another cool part is you can
angle<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.810> all<00:04:35.990> different<00:04:36.170> directions<00:04:36.380> for<00:04:37.070> if

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
angle in all different directions for if

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.020 
angle in all different directions for if
you're<00:04:37.310> trolling<00:04:38.620> catfishing<00:04:39.820> anything<00:04:40.820> like

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
you're trolling catfishing anything like

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.030 
you're trolling catfishing anything like
that<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.600> can<00:04:41.630> have<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.020> set<00:04:42.260> out<00:04:42.380> in<00:04:42.920> a

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
that you can have it set out in a

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.710 
that you can have it set out in a
different<00:04:43.430> direction<00:04:43.580> for<00:04:44.270> whatever<00:04:44.420> you're

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
different direction for whatever you're

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.590 
different direction for whatever you're
doing<00:04:45.190> okay<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.490> next<00:04:46.760> point<00:04:47.000> that<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.300> want

doing okay so the next point that I want

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.770 
doing okay so the next point that I want
to<00:04:47.630> cover<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:49.130> gear<00:04:49.820> management<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.630> this

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
to cover is the gear management of this
