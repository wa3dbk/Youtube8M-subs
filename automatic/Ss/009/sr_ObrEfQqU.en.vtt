00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.030
 hi everyone good here I bring you a 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.009
 new video accompanied by these three 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.660
 beauties 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:14.730
 are the link the princess of d-link this 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.730
 it's a native barbie 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.590
 and this is my dream house 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.619
 Well, in this video, it has 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.599
 accompanied them to explain you a 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.609
 little bit since you are enough 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.929
 people that you have asked me to 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.899
 I made a video about how to restore or 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.370
 fix the dolls so good 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.329
 tell you that I do not have the material 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.010
 necessary right now and since I'm not 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.170
 editing the videos because it would be very 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:51.149
 difficult to do a demonstration and so on 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.550
 then as I anxiously wanted to make you 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 the video as soon as possible I'll let you 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.530
 this video is going to be short only 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.079
 explaining a little bit like some 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.800
 truquitos to repair or restore 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.540
 barbies 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.510
 especially when you buy those from 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.410
 second hand and they come a little spoiled 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.750
 good the hair the hair I know it soil 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.470
 wash with normal soap is rinsed and 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.940
 then let it soak with softener 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.150
 clothes washer softener is worth 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.370
 because this is not synthetic fibers 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.190
 and the hair softener for us 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.570
 Well, it will not do the same effect 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.150
 obviously then I will wash the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.730
 hair I do it and then I leave it to soak 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.610
 the softener one half hour an hour 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.370
 depending on how you have your hair and 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.140
 Then let dry comb the hair 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.140
 it's super soft and shiny 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.490
 if the hair is much more damaged and not 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.220
 consiguiÃ©ramos fix with this as 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.920
 the second step would be to fix it with 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.650
 boiling water boiling water what 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.400
 it smoothes it and leaves it as 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.390
 new would be to boil water and introduce the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.950
 doll hair in boiling water 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.229
 and at the same time that it explodes in the water 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.280
 can comb what would leave 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.280
 totally smooth 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.470
 good 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.850
 then let dry and comb 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.850
 usually 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.520
 what we do have to be careful 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.650
 because to make boiling water we can not 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.510
 put it in boiling water while being 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.190
 water boiling in the fire and leave it 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.320
 a long time because we will end up burning 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.670
 you have to be careful with this and I 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.440
 I recommend you that the first time 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.710
 We're going to do it with a 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.950
 old barbie that good old no 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.280
 rather it is more used than us 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.900
 like it or not have much value because 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.990
 already be pretty spoiled or any 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.510
 another cause before we try with 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.090
 dolls that we really like in case 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.260
 something happens or does not leave us well then 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 we have to regret 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.410
 and good 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.790
 we can also pass the plant to 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.080
 make them hair and the plant 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.330
 our hair but you have to have 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.150
 very careful that it does not reach 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.940
 maximum temperature because this can 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.739
 burn them I do not recommend this technique 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.780
 a lot if we have not experienced before 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.130
 well with barbies with heads that 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.870
 we have loose that we do not like or 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.340
 any story because you have to have 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.170
 pretty careful with 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.480
 the temperature well that we rise a lot 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.799
 because the hair melts very easily 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.540
 I would put a clack 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.780
 and we remove it if the temperature is 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.780
 very high 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.340
 but good as the first technique said 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.810
 to try to see if it looks good would be 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.209
 with the softener that is the simplest 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.040
 these other two last techniques that you 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.450
 I counted would be in case 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.819
 was very wrong and we got it 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.219
 fix it with that 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.249
 then for the spots that can 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:57.379
 have and what we can do is give 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.379
 with acetone or nail polish 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.720
 you have to be very careful for example 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:07.140
 if the speck is on the face 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.820
 We would give him a little stick 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.760
 we will pour the acetone directly 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.760
 face because if you touch the makeup you 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.109
 would go together we would remove the stain 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.540
 but we would also remove the makeup 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.190
 of the air so imagine what fainÃ¡ there is 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.470
 to be very careful if a stain on 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.150
 the face if it is near the eye of the mouth 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.340
 because we could drag all the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.220
 make up so very careful and 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.220
 a little stick, we can give it 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.500
 the legs go where the speck is 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.500
 we give it good and it would be removed with acetone 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.289
 if the acetone serves us in this case 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.780
 because the stain is of ink that we 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.759
 come out or any other story 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.169
 we would try with but if you see I think it 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.050
 call if I'm not mistaken that it is a cream 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.509
 for acne that is sold in pharmacies and 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.220
 what would be apply for example 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.340
 apply and be beautiful but if you see 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.419
 in the stain and we would put it in the sun and 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.550
 we would leave the sun there with the cream like this 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.270
 so that the effect will be little to 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.030
 little is a matter of patience we return to 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.560
 repeat we put in the sun and so on until 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.920
 the spot is disappearing already 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.170
 disappear completely 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.990
 that would be the other one if the acetone 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.710
 it serves utility we would use forgiveness 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.610
 they perceive 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.939
 good 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.770
 these are the two concepts that 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.740
 I wanted to give you today for the 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.050
 hair and for spots when the barby 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.330
 If the barbie we buy turns out that 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.000
 comes to us with the bitten hands that is 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.520
 very common or the bites of the feet 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.300
 I can not find this solution other than 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.219
 change your body as you know some 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.180
 and for those who do not know it then in the 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:55.210
 channel because I have a video uploaded of how 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.740
 change the bodies how to get the 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.770
 head to put our body 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.620
 different in this case would be to find 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.199
 carefully the exact color because you see 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.409
 How good is it like this is more blanquita 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.360
 this is more brunette this also has 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.740
 a different tone well white good 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.039
 This one is much more white than her 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.480
 although I do not know if with clarity 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.970
 appreciates well seen would be the most brunette 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.990
 and then what would be his would be removed 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.510
 head 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.490
 we would look for a body of it 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.790
 tone so that then there is not much 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.210
 color difference 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:36.960
 and well later go see if I 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.030
 more ideas come up to give you for 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.520
 restore and repair our dolls 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.150
 I would say and make a new video about 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.450
 it 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.890
 I hope it helps you and I feel 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.510
 I really could not have done it 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.910
 a demonstration but that's why we 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.100
 I commented that I have no preparation now 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.890
 same but I hope that these tips we 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:00.720
 can serve when it comes to repairing 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:03.330
 your dolls and good 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.670
 I say goodbye for today a visit to all 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.710
 thank you very much for watching the videos and 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:12.950
 many thanks to what you are 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.950
 subscribing a little kiss to all chao
