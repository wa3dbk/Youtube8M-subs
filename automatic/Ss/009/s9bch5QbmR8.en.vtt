00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.280 
the barrel curler for this
because<00:01:56.119> it's<00:01:56.270> much<00:01:56.450> easier<00:01:56.479> just<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.140> move

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
because it's much easier just to move

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.550 
because it's much easier just to move
out<00:01:58.540> keep<00:01:59.540> watching<00:01:59.869> if<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.020> want<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:00.380> look

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
out keep watching if you want this look

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
so first in order to create this look

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.280 
so first in order to create this look

two<00:02:45.319> times<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:48.019> then<00:02:48.200> curl<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.680> away<00:02:49.610> from

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
two times and then curl it away from

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.789 
two times and then curl it away from
your<00:02:49.970> face<00:02:50.209> depending<00:02:51.170> on<00:02:51.260> how<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.470> want<00:02:51.560> the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
curl to fall away from your faces the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.229 
curl to fall away from your faces the
way<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.690> like<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.350> if<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.560> do<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.239> towards

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
way I like it but if you do it towards

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.870 
way I like it but if you do it towards
your<00:02:59.299> face<00:02:59.510> it's<00:02:59.720> more<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.170> vintage

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880

hold<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.329> about<00:03:05.450> five<00:03:06.170> seconds<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:08.829> I

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
hold it for about five seconds and I

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.430 
hold it for about five seconds and I
usually<00:03:10.190> just<00:03:10.600> when<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.690> falls<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.109> just<00:03:12.290> hold

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
usually just when it falls I just hold

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.860 
usually just when it falls I just hold
it<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.739> crunch<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.269> heat<00:03:14.420> stays<00:03:14.690> in

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
it and crunch it so the heat stays in

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.630 
it and crunch it so the heat stays in
the<00:03:14.930> crow<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.200> when<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.590> falls<00:03:15.829> it<00:03:16.100> just<00:03:16.310> cools

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
the crow and when it falls it just cools

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.750 
the crow and when it falls it just cools
and<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.780> holds<00:03:17.930> longer<00:03:18.380> okay<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.400> what<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.670> did

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
and it holds longer okay so what I did

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.030 
and it holds longer okay so what I did
was<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.209> just<00:03:20.239> dropped<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.040> horizontal

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
was I just dropped the horizontal

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.060 
was I just dropped the horizontal
sections<00:03:22.519> down<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.600> curled<00:03:23.989> her<00:03:24.170> hair<00:03:24.200> just

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
sections down and I curled her hair just

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.560 
sections down and I curled her hair just
with<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.340> regular<00:03:25.640> Sheryl<00:03:25.970> Crow<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.239> use<00:03:26.450> the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
with the regular Sheryl Crow I use the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.819 
with the regular Sheryl Crow I use the
one<00:03:26.750> inch<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:26.989> don't<00:03:27.230> really<00:03:27.440> want<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.650> do

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
one inch you don't really want to do

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.770 
one inch you don't really want to do
much<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.040> curl<00:03:28.549> just<00:03:28.790> let<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.030> fall<00:03:29.299> let<00:03:29.690> it

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
much the curl just let it fall let it

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.660 
much the curl just let it fall let it
cool<00:03:29.959> like<00:03:30.019> this<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.709> then<00:03:31.160> as<00:03:31.250> soon<00:03:31.459> as<00:03:31.549> you

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
cool like this and then as soon as you

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.370 
cool like this and then as soon as you
get<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.030> top<00:03:32.420> section<00:03:32.690> that's<00:03:33.049> by<00:03:33.230> your

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
get to the top section that's by your

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.800 
get to the top section that's by your
face<00:03:33.620> you're<00:03:34.340> going<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.549> curl<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.090> then

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
face you're going to curl and then

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.180 
face you're going to curl and then
you're<00:03:35.959> going<00:03:36.049> to<00:03:36.140> pin<00:03:36.440> them<00:03:36.620> in<00:03:36.920> any

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
you're going to pin them in any

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.000 
you're going to pin them in any
direction<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.880> style<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.350> we're

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
direction that the style is so we're

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.650 
direction that the style is so we're
going<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.220> go<00:03:40.310> backwards<00:03:40.609> so<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.120> just<00:03:41.390> kind<00:03:41.600> of

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
going to go backwards so I just kind of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.009 
going to go backwards so I just kind of
pinned<00:03:41.989> them<00:03:42.109> in<00:03:42.489> anyway<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.760> just<00:03:44.090> curled<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.690> I

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
pinned them in anyway I just curled it I

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.069 
pinned them in anyway I just curled it I
