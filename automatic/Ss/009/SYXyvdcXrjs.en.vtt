00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
okay we're rendering today is we're

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.740 
okay we're rendering today is we're
going<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.190> do<00:00:02.700> an<00:00:02.790> L<00:00:02.939> do<00:00:03.240> water<00:00:03.540> weed

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
simulation where you guys are asking me

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.639 
simulation where you guys are asking me
is<00:00:05.970> Elodie<00:00:06.299> which<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.899> sometimes<00:00:07.109> called<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
is Elodie which is sometimes called the

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.530 
is Elodie which is sometimes called the
water<00:00:07.830> weed<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.429> explains<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.970> here<00:00:09.210> that

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
water weed and it explains in here that

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.240 
water weed and it explains in here that
that's<00:00:09.929> true<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.590> reason<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:10.950> called<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
that's true the reason it's called the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.039 
that's true the reason it's called the
water<00:00:11.429> weed<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.880> growing<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> probably<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
water weed is growing the probably and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.629 
water weed is growing the probably and
definitional<00:00:13.740> weed<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> any<00:00:14.219> plant<00:00:14.490> that

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
definitional weed is any plant that

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.310 
definitional weed is any plant that
grows<00:00:14.820> where<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.179> don't<00:00:15.360> want<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.260> is

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
grows where you don't want it so this is

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.290 
grows where you don't want it so this is
probably<00:00:16.770> growing<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.220> places<00:00:17.670> where<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.060> want

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
probably growing in places where we want

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.580 
probably growing in places where we want
to<00:00:18.390> use<00:00:18.480> propellers<00:00:18.960> which<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.350> gilma

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
to use propellers which can gilma

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
to use propellers which can gilma
propellers<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.430> actually<00:00:20.580> thought<00:00:20.939> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
propellers but is actually thought to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.140 
propellers but is actually thought to
take<00:00:21.330> over<00:00:21.720> normal<00:00:22.470> vegetation<00:00:23.160> lives<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
take over normal vegetation lives in the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.910 
take over normal vegetation lives in the
area<00:00:24.269> well<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:24.960> finding<00:00:25.350> out<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.740> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
area well we are finding out that it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920 
area well we are finding out that it
actually<00:00:26.099> works<00:00:26.789> pretty<00:00:27.180> well<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
actually works pretty well with the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
actually works pretty well with the
vegetation<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.710> definitely<00:00:29.099> gives<00:00:29.189> habitat

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
vegetation it definitely gives habitat

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
vegetation it definitely gives habitat
for<00:00:29.970> small<00:00:30.269> critters<00:00:30.660> keeping<00:00:31.140> them<00:00:31.260> out<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
for small critters keeping them out of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
for small critters keeping them out of
the<00:00:31.590> eyes<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:32.040> larger<00:00:32.550> critters<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.719> we're

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the eyes of larger critters but we're

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.910 
the eyes of larger critters but we're
going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> actually<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> rate<00:00:34.800> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
going to actually look at the rate of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.130 
going to actually look at the rate of
photosynthesis<00:00:35.670> based<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.180> some<00:00:36.420> different

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
photosynthesis based on some different

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.720 
photosynthesis based on some different
things<00:00:37.260> first<00:00:37.559> thing<00:00:37.739> I'd<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.550> is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
decide whether or not you want to open

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.830 
decide whether or not you want to open

here's the actual link and what we have
is<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.809> got<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> water<00:00:58.289> weed<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> elbow<00:00:58.920> Deal

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
is we got the water weed the elbow Deal

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130 
is we got the water weed the elbow Deal
plant<00:00:59.430> sitting<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.910> water<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.660> adjust<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
plant sitting in water we can adjust the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
plant sitting in water we can adjust the
light<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:01.980> adjust<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.370> carbon<00:01:02.730> dioxide

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
light we can adjust the carbon dioxide

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.299 
light we can adjust the carbon dioxide
the<00:01:03.600> color<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> light<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> also<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the color of the light and also the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
the color of the light and also the
light<00:01:05.489> level<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.930> go

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
light level so you can see we can go

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.380 
light level so you can see we can go
colorless<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> blue<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.970> think

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
colorless we can go to blue I think

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.640 
colorless we can go to blue I think
they're<00:01:09.570> supposed<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> red<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.439> there

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
they're supposed to be a red one there

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
they're supposed to be a red one there
if<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.220> go<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> red<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> blue<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
if we can go to red we can go to blue we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080 
if we can go to red we can go to blue we
can<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> green<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> go<00:01:14.460> back<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.820> cuddle

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
can go to green or you go back to cuddle

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.249 
can go to green or you go back to cuddle
of<00:01:15.150> us<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> got<00:01:15.570> four<00:01:15.840> different<00:01:16.140> choices

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
of us you got four different choices

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.560 
of us you got four different choices
light<00:01:17.189> level<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.939> go<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> way<00:01:18.299> down

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
light level you can go all the way down

somewhere it goes all the way up to ten
so<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:31.470> gonna<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.770> back<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:31.979> two<00:01:32.310> same<00:01:33.060> thing

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so I'm gonna go back to two same thing

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.640 
so I'm gonna go back to two same thing
with<00:01:33.329> carbon<00:01:33.689> dioxide<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.439> go<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
with carbon dioxide you can go all the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.170 
with carbon dioxide you can go all the
way<00:01:34.740> down<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> zero<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.640> remember<00:01:35.729> carbon

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
way down to zero and remember carbon

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
way down to zero and remember carbon
dioxide<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> way<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.409> ten<00:01:37.680> carbon

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
dioxide all the way up to ten carbon

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.370 
dioxide all the way up to ten carbon
dioxide<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.119> food<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.259> whole

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
dioxide is more of a food for the whole

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.249 
dioxide is more of a food for the whole
process<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.950> photosynthesis<00:01:42.079> we're<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
process of photosynthesis we're going to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.179 
process of photosynthesis we're going to
default<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:43.950> down<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.770> hate<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.040> when

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
default it back down to I hate that when

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.300 
default it back down to I hate that when
that<00:01:47.340> happens<00:01:48.619> they're<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> fault<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that happens they're the fault it's a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
that happens they're the fault it's a
two<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.540> I'm<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> I'm<00:01:52.140> going

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
two so what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
two so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:52.350> try<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.920> X<00:01:53.310> where<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.729> second<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> one

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to try one X where one second is one

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.450 
to try one X where one second is one
second<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.049> simulation<00:01:55.799> runs<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.219> thirty

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
second this simulation runs for thirty

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.469 
second this simulation runs for thirty
seconds<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.090> gonna<00:01:57.180> click<00:01:57.420> start<00:01:59.479> and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
seconds so I'm gonna click start and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.789 
seconds so I'm gonna click start and
we're<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.930> watch<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.560> out

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
we're just going to watch this thing out

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
we're just going to watch this thing out
there<00:02:02.340> goes<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.759> bubble<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> see

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
there goes one bubble and you can see

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.870 
there goes one bubble and you can see
the<00:02:04.320> bubbles<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.399> heard<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.729> can

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the bubbles but as you heard you can

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.810 
the bubbles but as you heard you can
also<00:02:06.030> hear<00:02:06.360> them<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.689> well

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.370 

okay<00:02:10.820> we're<00:02:11.030> 17<00:02:11.690> 18<00:02:12.590> 19<00:02:12.980> 20<00:02:13.760> seconds<00:02:14.540> we've<00:02:15.260> got

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
okay we're 17 18 19 20 seconds we've got

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.240 
okay we're 17 18 19 20 seconds we've got
four<00:02:15.650> bubbles<00:02:17.320> 25<00:02:18.320> seconds

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
four bubbles 25 seconds

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.150 
four bubbles 25 seconds
still<00:02:19.700> four<00:02:20.000> bubbles<00:02:20.920> there<00:02:21.920> goes<00:02:22.130> another

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
still four bubbles there goes another

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.240 
still four bubbles there goes another
one<00:02:22.670> there<00:02:23.240> goes<00:02:23.420> two<00:02:23.720> more<00:02:23.990> they<00:02:24.860> didn't<00:02:25.130> make

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
one there goes two more they didn't make

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.000 
one there goes two more they didn't make
it<00:02:25.280> up<00:02:25.520> maybe<00:02:26.390> they<00:02:26.600> did<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:27.470> got<00:02:27.620> seven

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
it up maybe they did so we got seven

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.880 
it up maybe they did so we got seven
bubbles<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.000> also<00:02:29.240> adjust<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.020> 5x

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
bubbles you can also adjust it to 5x

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.100 
bubbles you can also adjust it to 5x
we're<00:02:31.340> now<00:02:31.520> one<00:02:31.760> second<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.330> five<00:02:32.540> seconds<00:02:32.990> of

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
we're now one second is five seconds of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.740 
we're now one second is five seconds of
lap<00:02:33.320> time<00:02:33.590> same<00:02:34.580> conditions<00:02:35.120> let's<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.570> if<00:02:35.630> we

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
lap time same conditions let's see if we

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.960 
lap time same conditions let's see if we
can<00:02:35.870> get<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.020> different<00:02:36.410> set<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.620> data<00:02:36.970> one

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
can get a different set of data one

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.350 
can get a different set of data one
bubble<00:02:38.680> two<00:02:39.680> three<00:02:42.550> okay<00:02:43.550> we<00:02:43.700> got<00:02:43.850> six<00:02:44.150> bubbles

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
bubble two three okay we got six bubbles

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.000 
bubble two three okay we got six bubbles
on<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.870> one<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.140> mean<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.500> actually<00:02:45.650> see

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
on that one I mean you can actually see

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.010 
on that one I mean you can actually see
that<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.280> simulation<00:02:47.180> actually<00:02:47.360> adjusts

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
that this simulation actually adjusts

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.710 
that this simulation actually adjusts
data<00:02:48.200> based<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.100> runs<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:50.270> you're<00:02:50.420> trying

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
data based on runs so if you're trying

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.300 
data based on runs so if you're trying
to<00:02:50.750> actually<00:02:51.050> figure<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.440> out<00:02:51.560> same

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
to actually figure it out same

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.710 
to actually figure it out same
conditions<00:02:52.820> don't<00:02:53.060> always<00:02:53.180> give<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
conditions don't always give you the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.510 
conditions don't always give you the
same<00:02:53.750> results<00:02:54.410> which<00:02:54.800> actually<00:02:55.160> works<00:02:55.340> out

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
same results which actually works out

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.420 
same results which actually works out
really<00:02:55.580> well<00:02:56.410> okay<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.709> go<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> our<00:02:58.160> site

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
really well okay if you go to our site

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.540 
really well okay if you go to our site
again<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.570> you<00:03:00.380> click<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.770> link<00:03:00.950> I'm<00:03:01.340> not

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
again and you click the link I'm not

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.000 
again and you click the link I'm not
sure<00:03:01.760> whether<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.150> see<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.570> down<00:03:02.720> here<00:03:03.010> if

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
sure whether you can see it down here if

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.350 
sure whether you can see it down here if
asked<00:03:04.250> me<00:03:04.400> whether<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.640> want<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.880> open<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.209> or

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
asked me whether I want to open it or

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.140 
asked me whether I want to open it or
save<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.840> want<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.200> open<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:08.030> gonna

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
save it I want to open it it's gonna

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.050 
save it I want to open it it's gonna
open<00:03:08.390> up<00:03:08.510> with<00:03:08.660> ie<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:10.130> same<00:03:10.370> thing<00:03:10.640> you

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
open up with ie and the same thing you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.900 
open up with ie and the same thing you
can<00:03:11.209> adjust<00:03:11.570> just<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.260> different<00:03:12.620> colors<00:03:12.910> you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
can adjust just the different colors you

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.180 
can adjust just the different colors you
can<00:03:14.060> adjust<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.660> light<00:03:14.959> levels<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:16.070> can

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
can adjust the light levels you can

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.340 
can adjust the light levels you can
adjust<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.670> carbon<00:03:17.030> dioxide<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:18.140> can<00:03:18.260> do

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
adjust the carbon dioxide you can do

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.990 
adjust the carbon dioxide you can do
anything<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.650> want<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.220> can<00:03:19.370> do<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:19.670> and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
anything you want you can do that and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.259 
anything you want you can do that and
you<00:03:20.060> can<00:03:20.570> see<00:03:20.750> we<00:03:20.900> do<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.140> same<00:03:21.350> sort<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.739> thing

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
you can see we do the same sort of thing

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.690 
you can see we do the same sort of thing
okay<00:03:23.269> we<00:03:23.420> go<00:03:23.540> back<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.989> simulation<00:03:24.700> you're

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
okay we go back to the simulation you're

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.039 
okay we go back to the simulation you're
going<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:25.910> do<00:03:26.030> three<00:03:26.299> different<00:03:26.450> tests<00:03:26.810> you're

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
going to do three different tests you're

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.270 
going to do three different tests you're
going<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.230> affect<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.590> light<00:03:27.769> color<00:03:28.040> so

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
going to affect the light color so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.009 
going to affect the light color so
you're<00:03:29.060> going<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.239> actually<00:03:29.360> set<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.840> light

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
you're going to actually set the light

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.660 
you're going to actually set the light
for<00:03:30.320> six<00:03:30.590> you're<00:03:30.920> going<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.100> set<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.250> carbon

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
for six you're going to set the carbon

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.330 
for six you're going to set the carbon
dioxide<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.840> six<00:03:33.110> keeping<00:03:33.709> them<00:03:33.890> as<00:03:34.190> a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
dioxide to six keeping them as a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.460 
dioxide to six keeping them as a
constant<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.540> only<00:03:35.690> variable<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.350> going

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
constant and the only variable is going

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.259 
constant and the only variable is going
to<00:03:36.560> be<00:03:36.620> color<00:03:36.950> number<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.549> bubbles<00:03:37.700> for<00:03:38.090> red

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
to be color number of bubbles for red

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.240 
to be color number of bubbles for red
blue<00:03:38.660> green<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.590> color<00:03:39.769> that's<00:03:40.040> light

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
blue green and the color that's light

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.020 
blue green and the color that's light
and<00:03:40.459> then<00:03:41.000> answer<00:03:41.330> these<00:03:41.510> three<00:03:41.989> questions

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
and then answer these three questions

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.610 
and then answer these three questions
effective<00:03:44.030> light<00:03:44.299> level<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:45.320> what<00:03:45.500> you're

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
effective light level so what you're

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.300 
effective light level so what you're
going<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.769> do<00:03:45.860> is<00:03:45.950> you're<00:03:46.070> going<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.220> actually

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
going to do is you're going to actually

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.100 
going to do is you're going to actually
set<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.880> light<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.209> colorless<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:48.019> the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
set the light to colorless and the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.590 
set the light to colorless and the
carbon<00:03:48.440> dioxide<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.280> six<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.060> you're<00:03:50.480> going

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
carbon dioxide to six and you're going

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.120 
carbon dioxide to six and you're going
to<00:03:50.660> try<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:50.959> light<00:03:51.200> levels<00:03:51.500> from<00:03:51.709> one<00:03:51.860> all<00:03:52.010> the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
to try the light levels from one all the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.830 
to try the light levels from one all the
way<00:03:52.220> down<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.549> ten<00:03:52.760> answering<00:03:53.330> these<00:03:53.480> two

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
way down to ten answering these two

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.650 
way down to ten answering these two
questions<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.000> last<00:03:56.209> thing<00:03:56.420> is<00:03:56.540> you're

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
questions and the last thing is you're

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.970 
questions and the last thing is you're
going<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.810> actually<00:03:56.930> look<00:03:57.380> at<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.709> can<00:03:57.799> design

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
going to actually look at you can design

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.650 
going to actually look at you can design
your<00:03:58.160> own<00:03:58.370> experiment<00:03:58.880> with<00:03:58.970> carbon<00:03:59.299> dioxide

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
your own experiment with carbon dioxide

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.810 
your own experiment with carbon dioxide
levels<00:03:59.989> and<00:04:00.220> what<00:04:01.220> you're<00:04:01.370> going<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.519> do<00:04:01.700> is

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
levels and what you're going to do is

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
levels and what you're going to do is
you're<00:04:01.970> going<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.120> set<00:04:02.299> up<00:04:02.390> your<00:04:02.510> own<00:04:02.570> data

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
you're going to set up your own data

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.990 
you're going to set up your own data
table<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:03.560> you're<00:04:04.070> gonna<00:04:04.190> actually<00:04:04.400> have<00:04:04.760> your

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
table so you're gonna actually have your

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.120 
table so you're gonna actually have your
light<00:04:05.239> is<00:04:05.570> your<00:04:05.840> constant<00:04:06.320> your<00:04:06.560> light<00:04:06.739> level

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
light is your constant your light level

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.470 
light is your constant your light level
is<00:04:07.220> constant<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.000> you're<00:04:08.150> gonna<00:04:08.269> actually

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
is constant and you're gonna actually

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.449 
is constant and you're gonna actually
set<00:04:08.870> up<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.110> carbon<00:04:09.410> dioxide<00:04:09.530> levels<00:04:10.250> just

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
set up the carbon dioxide levels just

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.970 
set up the carbon dioxide levels just
like<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.820> light<00:04:11.049> going<00:04:12.049> from<00:04:12.290> one<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.470> ten<00:04:12.799> and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
like the light going from one to ten and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.970 
like the light going from one to ten and
then<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:13.880> want<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.269> graph<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:14.870> result<00:04:15.320> so

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
then I want you to graph that result so

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.890 
then I want you to graph that result so

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
case you mess up with one now the first

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.310 
case you mess up with one now the first
thing<00:04:31.880> you're<00:04:31.970> going<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.180> decide<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:33.080> what

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
thing you're going to decide is what

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.560 
thing you're going to decide is what
your<00:04:33.530> IV<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.039> what<00:04:34.160> your<00:04:34.370> DV<00:04:34.729> what<00:04:35.300> did<00:04:35.449> you

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
your IV and what your DV what did you

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.810 
your IV and what your DV what did you
know<00:04:35.720> before<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.320> saw<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.830> experiment<00:04:37.550> well

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
know before you saw the experiment well

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.610 
know before you saw the experiment well
you<00:04:38.270> knew<00:04:38.419> in<00:04:38.570> this<00:04:38.690> case<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:39.199> knew<00:04:39.380> what

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
you knew in this case you knew what

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.990 
you knew in this case you knew what
level<00:04:40.009> of<00:04:40.070> light<00:04:40.280> where<00:04:40.460> you<00:04:40.490> were<00:04:40.789> going<00:04:40.940> to

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
level of light where you were going to

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.379 
level of light where you were going to
use<00:04:41.240> what<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.110> didn't<00:04:42.440> know<00:04:42.590> was<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:44.150> amount

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
use what you didn't know was the amount

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.400 
use what you didn't know was the amount
of<00:04:44.479> bubbles<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:44.870> were<00:04:44.960> going<00:04:45.080> to<00:04:45.139> get<00:04:45.259> with

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
of bubbles you were going to get with

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.610 
of bubbles you were going to get with
each<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.680> those<00:04:45.830> levels<00:04:46.639> so<00:04:47.539> your<00:04:47.840> IV<00:04:48.199> is<00:04:48.380> this

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
each of those levels so your IV is this

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.730 
each of those levels so your IV is this
one<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.100> your<00:04:49.250> DV<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:49.940> going<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.479> be<00:04:50.600> here<00:04:50.870> so

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
one and your DV is going to be here so

the next thing is you always put the IV

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.260 
the next thing is you always put the IV
down<00:04:54.440> on<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.680> x-axis<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.280> bottom<00:04:55.729> do<00:04:56.180> you

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
down on the x-axis the bottom do you

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.760 
down on the x-axis the bottom do you
want<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.479> do<00:04:56.539> this<00:04:56.660> one<00:04:56.870> portrait<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.650> way

this right now and what that will do is
you<00:04:59.630> put<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.020> number<00:05:00.260> of<00:05:00.350> bubbles<00:05:00.680> here<00:05:01.039> it'll

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
you put the number of bubbles here it'll

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.000 
you put the number of bubbles here it'll
actually<00:05:01.789> show<00:05:02.180> carbon<00:05:03.139> dioxide<00:05:03.590> on<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.830> long

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
actually show carbon dioxide on the long

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.250 
actually show carbon dioxide on the long
one<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.460> then<00:05:05.210> bubbles<00:05:05.600> on<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.870> short<00:05:06.110> one

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
one and then bubbles on the short one

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.719 
one and then bubbles on the short one
and<00:05:06.410> you'll<00:05:06.530> actually<00:05:06.650> watch<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.220> bubbles<00:05:07.370> go

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
this way or would you rather actually

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.830 
this way or would you rather actually
put<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.889> carbon<00:05:10.460> dioxide<00:05:10.880> down<00:05:11.120> here<00:05:11.479> and<00:05:11.750> the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
put the carbon dioxide down here and the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.110 
put the carbon dioxide down here and the
bubbles<00:05:12.229> on<00:05:12.530> here<00:05:13.039> and<00:05:13.220> watch<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.610> bubbles<00:05:13.760> go

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
bubbles on here and watch the bubbles go

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.180 
bubbles on here and watch the bubbles go
up<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.449> down<00:05:14.570> you<00:05:15.349> figure<00:05:15.680> out<00:05:15.740> which<00:05:15.949> one

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
up and down you figure out which one

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.860 
up and down you figure out which one
actually<00:05:16.580> shows<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.789> data<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.449> best<00:05:17.630> way

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
actually shows the data the best way

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.080 
actually shows the data the best way
then<00:05:18.410> go<00:05:18.470> ahead<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:18.889> answer<00:05:18.979> these<00:05:19.280> questions

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
then go ahead and answer these questions

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.909 
then go ahead and answer these questions
the<00:05:20.240> analysis<00:05:20.810> questions<00:05:21.199> sort<00:05:21.530> of<00:05:21.620> like<00:05:21.740> your

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
the analysis questions sort of like your

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.010 
the analysis questions sort of like your
conclusion<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.729> then<00:05:23.240> you're<00:05:23.449> done<00:05:23.660> you'll

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
conclusion and then you're done you'll

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.350 
conclusion and then you're done you'll
