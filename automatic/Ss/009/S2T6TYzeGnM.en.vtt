thought of it that way a little bit and
that's<00:03:28.909> how<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.120> could<00:03:29.239> play<00:03:29.389> a<00:03:29.419> riff<00:03:29.659> kind<00:03:30.290> of

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
that's how you could play a riff kind of

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.750 
that's how you could play a riff kind of
drive<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.799> ground<00:03:31.010> but<00:03:31.340> as<00:03:31.459> long<00:03:31.639> as

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
drive it in the ground but as long as

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.059 
drive it in the ground but as long as
you<00:03:31.849> have<00:03:32.000> everything<00:03:32.180> moving<00:03:32.480> around<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:33.069> you

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
you have everything moving around it you

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.740 
you have everything moving around it you
can<00:03:34.189> still<00:03:34.400> convey<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.969> different<00:03:35.299> start<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.659> a

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
can still convey a different start and a

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.780 
can still convey a different start and a
different<00:03:36.019> feel<00:03:36.400> while<00:03:37.400> keeping<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.729> same
