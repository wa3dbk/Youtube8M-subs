00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.380 
jugger 2.1 system that speed link make
however<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:20.700> powerful

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
however this one here is more powerful

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
however this one here is more powerful
it's<00:01:21.600> got<00:01:21.840> larger<00:01:22.290> speakers<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it's got larger speakers in there so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
it's got larger speakers in there so
it's<00:01:23.430> got<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> larger<00:01:24.060> subwoofer<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:25.259> also

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's got a larger subwoofer in here also

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.710 
it's got a larger subwoofer in here also
the<00:01:25.950> box<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.549> larger<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.119> also<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the box is a lot larger and also the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
the box is a lot larger and also the
port<00:01:28.080> where<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> air<00:01:28.770> will<00:01:28.950> escape<00:01:29.250> from<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
port where the air will escape from the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
port where the air will escape from the
subwoofer<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> larger<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.200> well<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.920> all

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
subwoofer is larger as well so it's all

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
subwoofer is larger as well so it's all
round<00:01:32.549> similar<00:01:33.420> design<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.380> everything<00:01:34.979> is

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
round similar design just everything is

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.340 
round similar design just everything is
bigger<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.939> more<00:01:36.090> powerful<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.259> that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
bigger and more powerful so you get that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.260 
bigger and more powerful so you get that
better<00:01:37.590> sound<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.579> louder<00:01:38.850> sound

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
better sound you get that louder sound

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.050 
better sound you get that louder sound
and<00:01:39.540> ah<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.650> gorgeous<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and ah it is gorgeous so that's the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
and ah it is gorgeous so that's the
subwoofer<00:01:42.420> sight<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:43.259> we've<00:01:43.380> got<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
subwoofer sight there then we've got a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.260 
subwoofer sight there then we've got a
few<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.430> bought<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> bit<00:01:44.909> again<00:01:45.149> with

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
few that's I bought a bit again with

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.760 
few that's I bought a bit again with
Nikon<00:01:45.540> rubber<00:01:45.750> foam<00:01:45.899> pads<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.619> it's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
Nikon rubber foam pads on there so it's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
Nikon rubber foam pads on there so it's
grippy<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.130> also<00:01:47.490> absorbs<00:01:47.759> vibration<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
grippy and also absorbs vibration on the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.960 
grippy and also absorbs vibration on the
floor<00:01:48.680> standard<00:01:49.680> side<00:01:49.890> side<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> port

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
floor standard side side of the port

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.700 
floor standard side side of the port
that's<00:01:51.630> our<00:01:51.840> top<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.500> kind<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that's our top which is just kind of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.969 
that's our top which is just kind of
breaking<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.100> empty<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.740> where<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
breaking on empty and then where all the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.389 
breaking on empty and then where all the
magic<00:01:56.130> happens<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:58.079> pur<00:01:58.259> here<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.130> this

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
magic happens is this pur here so this

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.399 
magic happens is this pur here so this
is<00:01:59.490> where<00:01:59.640> our<00:01:59.850> speakers<00:02:00.540> connect<00:02:00.810> into<00:02:01.110> so

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
is where our speakers connect into so

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.950 
is where our speakers connect into so
that<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:02.009> ass<00:02:02.189> these<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.060> speakers<00:02:03.299> then

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that is ass these are two speakers then

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.420 
that is ass these are two speakers then
the<00:02:04.079> ones<00:02:04.229> underneath<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.340> focus

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the ones underneath here if I just focus

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.670 
the ones underneath here if I just focus
you<00:02:05.790> refocus<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.079> was<00:02:07.560> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
you refocus you there we go was that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.859 
you refocus you there we go was that
almost<00:02:07.829> right<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.340> yeah<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.209> these<00:02:09.360> ones<00:02:09.569> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
almost right there yeah so these ones is

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.960 
almost right there yeah so these ones is
the<00:02:10.080> audio<00:02:10.530> input<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> input

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the audio input so this is the input

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.580 
the audio input so this is the input
into<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> speaker<00:02:12.780> itself

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
into the speaker itself

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.580 
into the speaker itself
then<00:02:13.739> we<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.489> got<00:02:14.760> our<00:02:15.030> base<00:02:15.690> control<00:02:16.260> our

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
then we have got our base control our

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.490 
then we have got our base control our
volume<00:02:17.250> control<00:02:17.700> our<00:02:18.660> power<00:02:18.900> switch<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.349> then

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
volume control our power switch and then

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.350 
volume control our power switch and then
we've<00:02:19.620> also<00:02:19.739> got<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.950> standby<00:02:20.340> button<00:02:20.700> which

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
we've also got a standby button which

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.240 
we've also got a standby button which
lives<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
lives just on here and that is the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.920 
lives just on here and that is the
subwoofer<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.090> bear<00:02:24.360> with<00:02:24.390> me<00:02:24.480> two<00:02:24.629> seconds

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
subwoofer so bear with me two seconds

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.199 
subwoofer so bear with me two seconds
I'm<00:02:25.019> just<00:02:25.230> gonna<00:02:25.349> get<00:02:25.590> one<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.209> satellite

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
I'm just gonna get one of the satellite

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.490 
I'm just gonna get one of the satellite
speakers<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> little<00:02:28.230> bit<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
speakers for you to have a little bit of

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.650 
speakers for you to have a little bit of
a<00:02:28.560> gander<00:02:28.769> at<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.910> here<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.299> one<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.599> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
a gander at and this here is one of the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.030 
a gander at and this here is one of the
satellite<00:02:30.989> speakers<00:02:31.200> now<00:02:31.470> there<00:02:31.590> are<00:02:31.709> two<00:02:31.920> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
satellite speakers now there are two of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.770 
satellite speakers now there are two of
these<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.910> driver<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.480> believe<00:02:33.660> is

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
these the driver and that I believe is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.059 
these the driver and that I believe is
slightly<00:02:34.019> larger<00:02:34.440> than<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.709> one<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
slightly larger than the one on the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.920 
slightly larger than the one on the
jogger<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.459> well<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.390> they<00:02:36.510> seem<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.780> be

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
jogger as well but they seem to be

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.320 
jogger as well but they seem to be
generally<00:02:37.349> similar<00:02:37.769> design<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.640> shape<00:02:38.849> to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
generally similar design and shape to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.150 
generally similar design and shape to
the<00:02:39.480> previous<00:02:39.900> jogger<00:02:40.200> system<00:02:40.709> as<00:02:40.860> well<00:02:41.010> which

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the previous jogger system as well which

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.320 
the previous jogger system as well which
you'll<00:02:41.280> see<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:41.549> is<00:02:41.640> another<00:02:41.790> review<00:02:42.150> for

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
you'll see there is another review for

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.720 
you'll see there is another review for
that<00:02:42.510> one<00:02:42.660> there<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.470> these<00:02:43.620> are<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.069> more

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
that one there but these are a more

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.180 
that one there but these are a more
powerful<00:02:45.030> rated<00:02:45.870> speaker<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:47.160> have

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
powerful rated speaker so you do have

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.979 
powerful rated speaker so you do have
more<00:02:47.459> volume<00:02:47.760> coming<00:02:48.239> from<00:02:48.360> these<00:02:48.540> ones<00:02:48.810> as

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
more volume coming from these ones as

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.539 
more volume coming from these ones as
you<00:02:49.410> would<00:02:49.530> do<00:02:49.680> with<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.920> previous<00:02:50.310> jogger

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
you would do with the previous jogger

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.490 
you would do with the previous jogger
which<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.209> have<00:02:51.390> already<00:02:51.750> reviewed<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.380> that's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the jugger 2.1 system it think is about

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.629 
the jugger 2.1 system it think is about
40<00:03:26.190> 45<00:03:26.670> pounds<00:03:27.440> whereas<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.829> Metron<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.579> a

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
40 45 pounds whereas the Metron is a

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
little bit more expensive I think

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.210 
little bit more expensive I think
they're<00:03:30.870> closer<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.319> 60<00:03:31.739> pounds

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
however for that 15 pounds difference

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.250 
however for that 15 pounds difference
