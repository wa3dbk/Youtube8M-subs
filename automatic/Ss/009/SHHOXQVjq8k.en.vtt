them<00:02:27.500> up<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:29.270> usually<00:02:29.420> good<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.840> tighten

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
them up now it's usually good to tighten

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.280 
them up now it's usually good to tighten
these<00:02:30.590> with<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.030> impact<00:02:32.030> wrench<00:02:32.360> because<00:02:32.840> they

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
these with a impact wrench because they

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.260 
these with a impact wrench because they
are<00:02:33.440> pretty<00:02:33.709> tight<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.250> since<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.760> don't<00:02:35.120> have

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
are pretty tight but since I don't have

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.690 
are pretty tight but since I don't have
air<00:02:35.540> tools<00:02:35.840> or<00:02:36.110> anything<00:02:36.230> like<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.700> I'm

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
air tools or anything like that I'm

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.220 
air tools or anything like that I'm
gonna<00:02:37.820> show<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.000> guys<00:02:38.090> how<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.420> did<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.780> put<00:02:39.140> an

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
gonna show you guys how I did I put an

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.410 
gonna show you guys how I did I put an
extension<00:02:39.790> pushed<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.030> as<00:02:41.150> far<00:02:41.300> as

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
extension pushed it in as far as

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.900 
extension pushed it in as far as
possible<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:43.250> all<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.490> was<00:02:43.580> ready

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
possible and all that was ready

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.170 
possible and all that was ready
I<00:02:44.950> grabbed<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.100> pipe<00:02:46.310> from<00:02:46.550> my<00:02:47.350> jack<00:02:49.090> put<00:02:50.090> it

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I grabbed the pipe from my jack put it

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.420 
I grabbed the pipe from my jack put it
all<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.420> way<00:02:50.510> through<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.040> got<00:02:52.250> more

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
all the way through so you got more

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.670 
all the way through so you got more
leverage<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.090> then<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.140> just<00:02:54.320> deprived

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
leverage and then I just deprived

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.800 
leverage and then I just deprived
pressure<00:02:55.180> until<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.330> snaps<00:02:56.600> up<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:59.510> then<00:02:59.660> you

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
pressure until it snaps up and then you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.840 
pressure until it snaps up and then you
just<00:02:59.840> you<00:03:00.200> know<00:03:02.320> you<00:03:03.320> just<00:03:03.380> hold<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.130> all<00:03:04.280> now

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
just you know you just hold it all now

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.400 
just you know you just hold it all now
this<00:03:05.060> one's<00:03:05.239> already<00:03:05.420> tighten<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.080> drained

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
this one's already tighten and drained

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.440 
this one's already tighten and drained
so<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.160> want<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.459> take<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.239> where<00:03:08.360> you

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
so you want to take this is where you

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.020 
so you want to take this is where you
put<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:10.130> this<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.340> where<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.670> drain<00:03:11.000> it

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
put it in and this is where you drain it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.100 
put it in and this is where you drain it
so<00:03:11.510> make<00:03:11.720> sure<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.989> have<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.380> these<00:03:14.110> oil

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
so make sure you have one of these oil

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.160 
so make sure you have one of these oil
pads<00:03:15.500> or<00:03:15.709> somewhere<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.220> can<00:03:16.370> drain

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.150 

now<00:03:21.060> how'd<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.690> there<00:03:23.010> now<00:03:24.010> it's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
now how'd it get it in there now it's

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.680 
now how'd it get it in there now it's
not<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:24.459> your<00:03:24.610> regular<00:03:24.760> oil<00:03:25.269> but<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:25.599> can

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
not like your regular oil but you can

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.300 
not like your regular oil but you can
use<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.900> funnel<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.500> I'll<00:03:26.650> go<00:03:26.769> in<00:03:26.920> there<00:03:27.069> it's<00:03:27.250> a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
use a funnel and I'll go in there it's a

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.910 
use a funnel and I'll go in there it's a
little<00:03:27.400> bit<00:03:27.550> harder<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:34.230> he's<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.349> hand<00:03:35.680> pump

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
little bit harder so he's a hand pump

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:44.460 
little bit harder so he's a hand pump
they're<00:03:36.670> inexpensive<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.420> like<00:03:42.630> top<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:44.380> it

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
they're inexpensive it's like top and it

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.870 
they're inexpensive it's like top and it
comes<00:03:44.650> with<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:44.860> little<00:03:44.980> cones<00:03:45.519> about<00:03:45.610> to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
comes with a little cones about to

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.660 
comes with a little cones about to
around<00:03:46.450> here<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.080> bottom<00:03:47.380> part<00:03:47.590> I'll<00:03:48.430> show

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
around here the bottom part I'll show

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:57.420 
around here the bottom part I'll show
you<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.049> can<00:03:56.380> get<00:03:56.560> way<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:57.099> bottom

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
you this I can get way to the bottom

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.729 
you this I can get way to the bottom
left<00:03:57.730> alone<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.980> couldn't<00:03:59.980> do<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:01.739> already

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
left alone I couldn't do it so I already

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.170 
left alone I couldn't do it so I already
filled<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.190> up<00:04:03.280> so<00:04:03.519> I'm<00:04:03.610> just<00:04:03.790> gonna<00:04:03.940> show<00:04:04.060> you

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
filled it up so I'm just gonna show you

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.770 
filled it up so I'm just gonna show you
a<00:04:04.540> quick<00:04:05.049> example<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.090> see<00:04:07.329> how<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.599> comes

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
a quick example so you see how it comes

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:17.310 
a quick example so you see how it comes
out<00:04:15.299> keep<00:04:16.299> making<00:04:16.600> more<00:04:16.750> of<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.930> mess<00:04:16.959> because

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
out keep making more of a mess because

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.450 
out keep making more of a mess because
it<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.620> windy<00:04:20.070> here<00:04:21.720> how<00:04:22.720> well<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.050> can<00:04:23.200> say

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
it is windy here how well you can say

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.330 
it is windy here how well you can say
but<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.550> says<00:04:24.760> use<00:04:25.000> Honda<00:04:25.479> engine<00:04:25.870> vtm<00:04:26.470> for

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
but it says use Honda engine vtm for

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.279 
but it says use Honda engine vtm for
fluid<00:04:27.789> only<00:04:28.330> performance<00:04:29.020> will<00:04:29.169> be

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
fluid only performance will be

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.730 
fluid only performance will be
diminished<00:04:30.160> if<00:04:30.580> others<00:04:31.030> are<00:04:31.180> used<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:31.930> it's

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
diminished if others are used so it's

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.080 
diminished if others are used so it's
specifically<00:04:33.340> recommended<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.270> use<00:04:36.090> product

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
specifically recommended to use product

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.340 
specifically recommended to use product
BTM<00:04:37.750> for<00:04:38.020> toilet<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:40.510> it's<00:04:40.690> as<00:04:40.900> simple<00:04:41.050> as<00:04:41.289> that

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
BTM for toilet so it's as simple as that

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.590 
BTM for toilet so it's as simple as that
when<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:42.310> start<00:04:42.550> filling<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.120> feel<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.450> so

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
when you start filling it you feel it so

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.950 
when you start filling it you feel it so
basically<00:04:44.470> it's<00:04:44.860> hard<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.250> see<00:04:45.460> from<00:04:45.960> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
basically it's hard to see from the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.659 
basically it's hard to see from the
camera<00:04:47.139> angle<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.830> just<00:04:48.100> keep<00:04:48.280> pouring

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
camera angle but you just keep pouring

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.940 
camera angle but you just keep pouring
it<00:04:48.789> and<00:04:48.940> then<00:04:49.510> eventually<00:04:49.960> some<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.860> will

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
it and then eventually some of it will

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.379 
it and then eventually some of it will
start<00:04:51.160> leaking<00:04:51.310> out<00:04:51.580> but<00:04:51.789> if<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:51.910> get<00:04:52.240> in

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
start leaking out but if you get in

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.840 
start leaking out but if you get in
there<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.690> just<00:04:52.810> put<00:04:53.190> tip<00:04:54.190> your<00:04:54.430> finger<00:04:54.729> in

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
there and just put tip your finger in

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.320 
there and just put tip your finger in
there<00:04:55.650> see<00:04:56.650> it's<00:04:56.800> pretty<00:04:57.310> much<00:04:57.460> level<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.150> can

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
there see it's pretty much level you can

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.000 
there see it's pretty much level you can
kind<00:04:58.539> of<00:04:58.630> see<00:04:58.780> all<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.169> way<00:04:59.260> back<00:04:59.500> there<00:04:59.770> where

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
kind of see all the way back there where

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.740 
kind of see all the way back there where

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.440 

tying<00:05:37.890> as<00:05:38.070> best<00:05:38.370> as<00:05:38.520> you<00:05:38.550> can<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.330> is

tying as best as you can it is

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.960 
tying as best as you can it is
recommended<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.080> use<00:05:40.290> a<00:05:40.430> torque<00:05:41.430> wrench<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:41.910> I

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
recommended to use a torque wrench and I

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.380 
recommended to use a torque wrench and I
believe<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.840> specifications<00:05:43.680> for<00:05:44.240> for<00:05:45.240> the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
believe the specifications for for the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.080 
believe the specifications for for the
bolts<00:05:46.380> are<00:05:46.530> 35<00:05:47.280> pounds<00:05:47.930> but<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:49.670> don't<00:05:50.670> have<00:05:50.820> one

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
bolts are 35 pounds but I don't have one

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.180 
bolts are 35 pounds but I don't have one
so<00:05:51.410> we're<00:05:52.410> going<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.590> do<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.830> as<00:05:52.950> tight<00:05:53.160> as

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
so we're going to do it as tight as

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:07.430
