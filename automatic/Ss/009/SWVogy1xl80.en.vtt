is<00:00:25.810> I<00:00:25.840> was<00:00:26.079> doing<00:00:26.320> two<00:00:26.739> colors<00:00:27.250> at<00:00:27.460> once<00:00:27.489> to<00:00:27.849> try

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
is I was doing two colors at once to try

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.550 
is I was doing two colors at once to try
to<00:00:28.119> make<00:00:28.359> things<00:00:28.480> go<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.779> little<00:00:28.929> bit<00:00:29.080> quicker

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
to make things go a little bit quicker

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.220 
to make things go a little bit quicker
each<00:00:30.250> saucepan<00:00:30.910> should<00:00:31.240> contain<00:00:31.689> two

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
each saucepan should contain two

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.220 
each saucepan should contain two
tablespoons<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.250> butter<00:00:33.720> there's<00:00:34.720> only<00:00:34.900> one

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
tablespoons of butter there's only one

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.710 
tablespoons of butter there's only one
tablespoon<00:00:35.739> right<00:00:35.920> now<00:00:36.070> I<00:00:36.339> when<00:00:37.059> I<00:00:37.089> was<00:00:37.300> doing

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
tablespoon right now I when I was doing

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.240 
tablespoon right now I when I was doing
the<00:00:37.900> conversions<00:00:38.410> because<00:00:38.500> I<00:00:38.680> scaling<00:00:39.160> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
the conversions because I scaling the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.910 
the conversions because I scaling the
recipe<00:00:39.640> down<00:00:39.790> I<00:00:40.320> misread<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.350> instructions

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
recipe down I misread the instructions

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.829 
recipe down I misread the instructions
so<00:00:42.159> there's<00:00:42.610> only<00:00:42.790> one<00:00:43.000> tablespoon<00:00:43.480> there<00:00:43.659> but

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
so there's only one tablespoon there but

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.060 
so there's only one tablespoon there but
I<00:00:43.870> did<00:00:44.050> add<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.500> little<00:00:44.649> bit<00:00:44.800> later<00:00:44.949> and

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
I did add it a little bit later and

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.880 
I did add it a little bit later and
you'll<00:00:45.190> see<00:00:45.460> that<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.690> butter<00:00:46.870> add<00:00:47.140> one

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890

basically<00:01:18.910> what<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.179> is<00:01:19.209> when<00:01:19.929> I<00:01:19.959> started<00:01:20.289> to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
basically what it is when I started to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.440 
basically what it is when I started to
stir<00:01:20.619> it<00:01:20.740> around<00:01:20.800> I<00:01:21.280> realized<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.970> it<00:01:22.240> was

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
stir it around I realized that it was

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.480 
stir it around I realized that it was
kind<00:01:22.720> of<00:01:22.780> clumpy<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.319> then<00:01:23.950> when<00:01:24.160> I<00:01:24.190> read<00:01:24.340> the

kind of clumpy and then when I read the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.790 
kind of clumpy and then when I read the
recipe<00:01:24.940> I<00:01:25.200> realized<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.349> I<00:01:26.380> was<00:01:26.500> missing

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
recipe I realized that I was missing

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.380 
recipe I realized that I was missing
that<00:01:26.890> extra<00:01:27.160> tablespoon<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.700> butter<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.360> I

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
that extra tablespoon of butter so I

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.559 
that extra tablespoon of butter so I
added<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:28.959> here<00:01:29.289> stir<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.369> around<00:01:30.489> and<00:01:31.060> then

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
added it in here stir it around and then

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.529 
added it in here stir it around and then
bring<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.110> simmer<00:01:32.410> over<00:01:32.800> low<00:01:33.789> heat<00:01:34.000> and

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
minutes keep a close eye on it because

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:41.910 
minutes keep a close eye on it because

sprayed with cooking spray you could

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.770 
sprayed with cooking spray you could
also<00:02:38.260> use<00:02:38.500> parchment<00:02:39.010> paper<00:02:39.190> as<00:02:39.459> well<00:02:39.780> spread

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
also use parchment paper as well spread

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.860 
also use parchment paper as well spread
it<00:02:40.930> out<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.080> little<00:02:41.260> bit<00:02:41.550> if<00:02:42.550> it's<00:02:43.360> too<00:02:43.510> hot<00:02:43.690> you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
it out a little bit if it's too hot you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.100 
it out a little bit if it's too hot you
can<00:02:44.020> use<00:02:44.170> Forks<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.650> do<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.900> that's<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
can use Forks to do this and that's the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.690 
can use Forks to do this and that's the
second<00:02:47.440> color<00:02:47.620> that's<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.040> orange

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
second color that's the orange

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.870 
second color that's the orange
I<00:02:49.260> also<00:02:50.260> spread<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.890> one<00:02:51.100> out<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.519> put<00:02:51.730> two

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
I also spread that one out I put two

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.839 
I also spread that one out I put two
colors<00:02:52.209> per<00:02:52.420> pan<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:54.250> worked<00:02:54.489> just<00:02:54.610> fine

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
colors per pan and that worked just fine

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.130 
colors per pan and that worked just fine
because<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.420> colors<00:02:55.690> aren't<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.989> mix

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
because the colors aren't going to mix

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.780 
because the colors aren't going to mix
up<00:02:56.319> together<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:57.069> you're<00:02:57.280> going<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.459> put<00:02:57.670> it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
up together then you're going to put it

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.390 
up together then you're going to put it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
to give it a stir a couple of times

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.039

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
just spread it out and let it cool

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.979 
just spread it out and let it cool

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.449 
completely and if there are some clumps
there<00:03:23.260> that's<00:03:23.470> not<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> big<00:03:23.890> deal<00:03:23.920> you'll<00:03:24.370> be

there that's not a big deal you'll be

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.210 
there that's not a big deal you'll be

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
thing that disappointed me about this

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.130 
thing that disappointed me about this
recipe<00:04:06.130> was<00:04:06.489> that<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:06.970> found<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.450> colors<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.989> be

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
recipe was that I found the colors to be

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.690 
recipe was that I found the colors to be
a<00:04:08.170> little<00:04:08.440> bit<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.829> pale<00:04:09.040> side<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.370> would

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
a little bit on the pale side I would

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.430 
a little bit on the pale side I would
like<00:04:09.880> them<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.120> have<00:04:10.359> been<00:04:10.540> more<00:04:10.810> vibrant<00:04:11.319> and

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
like them to have been more vibrant and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.470 
like them to have been more vibrant and
brighter<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.670> could<00:04:12.819> probably<00:04:12.940> fix<00:04:13.299> that

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
brighter and you could probably fix that

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.620 
brighter and you could probably fix that
by<00:04:13.660> adding<00:04:13.930> food<00:04:14.170> coloring<00:04:14.680> at<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.400> jello<00:04:16.209> and

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
by adding food coloring at the jello and

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.099 
by adding food coloring at the jello and
sugar<00:04:17.320> syrup<00:04:17.829> mixing<00:04:18.280> stage<00:04:18.690> otherwise<00:04:19.690> it's

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
sugar syrup mixing stage otherwise it's

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.080 
sugar syrup mixing stage otherwise it's
a<00:04:20.169> great<00:04:20.289> recipe<00:04:20.769> I<00:04:20.799> loved<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.310> give<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:22.060> try
