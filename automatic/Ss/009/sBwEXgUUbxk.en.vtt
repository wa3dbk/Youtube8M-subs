00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.320 
apparently so less fish a court but
prices<00:03:39.930> are<00:03:40.140> up<00:03:40.470> as<00:03:40.709> our<00:03:41.280> Fisher's<00:03:41.670> income<00:03:42.090> and

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
so why has it worked I think growing

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.539 
so why has it worked I think growing
