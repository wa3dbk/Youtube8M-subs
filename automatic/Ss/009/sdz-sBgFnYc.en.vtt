00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.660
 the world I am tight and welcome to a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 new episode of compare here on axis 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.290
 from joel guys I bring you a chapter 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.340
 quite strange I would say that it is the most 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.290
 we have done so far 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.760
 because today we are not going to analyze or 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.619
 compare any primary weapon or 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.330
 secondary but we're going to focus 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.369
 in two elements that make up the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.960
 lethal equipment of modern warfare 3 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.669
 I'm talking specifically about the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.750
 fragmentation grenade also 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.950
 known as ms 67 and of the in text 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.840
 this video like any other of the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.460
 what do I do here in gt have like 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.500
 main purpose draw two 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 quite important conclusions both 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.220
 for me as for you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.560
 First decide between all in 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.810
 what situations should we use one or the 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.330
 another and make it possible to decide at the end 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.890
 of the video which is better to do this 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.230
 we really have few elements to 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 keep in mind he took out the chop to see 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.500
 that we have only five factors that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.750
 we can analyze when determining 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.729
 which is better simply to compare these 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.409
 two elements that make up the equipment 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.600
 lethal of modern warfare 3 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.789
 first of all, well, let's observe 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.259
 the time that elapses in both cases 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.450
 since we say of the 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.090
 crank on each until 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.130
 it is shot out of our hand and 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.709
 I advance you that both explosives have 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.569
 the same preparation time so 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.719
 that no one benefits from the 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.719
 other 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.780
 as you can see the time elapsed in 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.220
 both cases is 1.13 a time 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.930
 standardized that has been carried out 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.580
 in the same way in each and every one of 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.530
 the call of duty I will go naming 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.850
 also differences and changes 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.500
 that they have been carrying out a call 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.630
 of duty to another and what differentiates these 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.400
 explosives in modern warfare 3 respect 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.229
 to the previous deliveries we're going 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.240
 to do next let's focus now 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.040
 at the time of explosion a very 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.930
 important to keep in mind since this 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.370
 will determine crucially in what 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.290
 situations we should use one or the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.460
 another the time of explosion is not more 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.229
 the time from which 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.970
 let go of the explosive hand up 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.619
 that this one exploits quite logical not 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.250
 Well, the time of explosion of the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.180
 people is much smaller than the 67 m 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.770
 practically 2 seconds is the time 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.840
 that takes place since we released the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.610
 bodies of the hand until they explode and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.170
 this makes it a grenade in a 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.850
 very lethal explosive at short distances 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.560
 that will work very well on maps 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.540
 relatively small not so much at the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.130
 horizontal but at a vertical level I want 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.110
 say on maps where there are less than two 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.209
 levels above all as a maximum box where 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.550
 we do not have to throw it over 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.709
 all buildings or windows the grenade 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.480
 fragmentation by having say a type 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.060
 of explosion so high because it's going to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.760
 allow 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.020
 move with much more versatility the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.190
 fragmentation grenade will work 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.230
 very good especially to fighting 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.819
 vertical and also horizontal but 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.160
 to be able to delay it with much more time 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.870
 we can meditate much more where 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.120
 we want to launch the would work a lot 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.360
 better if we want to cure it for some 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.630
 window or by some parked hole 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.599
 a little bad actually good the damage and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.000
 the damage in both explosives 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.340
 from a maximum of 130 damage 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.620
 the center of the radius of the range of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.810
 explosion and 55 points of damage as 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.730
 minimum in the outer zone as you see is 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.319
 much smaller damage to the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.360
 previous count useful for example black 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.269
 ops or modern warfare 2 remember also 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.040
 that unlike previous installments 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.200
 of call of duty we can not reset 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.049
 the lethal equipment in the event that you 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.730
 we have good scavengers we are already at 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.380
 conclusions before saying that both 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.880
 we can unblock explosives 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.040
 level 1 that is to say with any of the 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.750
 classes that give us predetermined and that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.220
 the damage in case of direct impact is 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.840
 say in the event that we give it a 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.150
 oyster with the grenade it will be 15 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.580
 damage points practically nothing 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.200
 but good that if we combine it with 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.080
 good aim because it can work 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.340
 pretty good in general none is 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.140
 better than the other because both are 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.060
 grenades that we are going to use in different 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.530
 situations but in my opinion the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.020
 fragmentation grenade is a grenade 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.020
 much more versatile that we can use in 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.120
 many more different situations so 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.070
 well as I say in many cases use the 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.170
 that you feel like trying to decide 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.790
 Which map is better than NATO? 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.710
 especially the people - that their weapons in 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.420
 maps where there are very few levels and the 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.460
 fragmentation use it in maps then in 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.200
 which you share verticals also 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.040
 they are important and well I hope that you 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.270
 have liked the video that is 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.770
 services guys see you in the 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.770
 next a greeting nothing goodbye
