00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
couple of panels off and you know rewire

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370 
couple of panels off and you know rewire
some<00:01:08.430> tubing<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.330> something<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
some tubing or something like that to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
some tubing or something like that to
get<00:01:10.530> things<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.760> that's<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.180> the
