00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 who loves has reached the honda to see 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.130
 the latest results would seem that the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.830
 gap has been filled and who loves 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.960
 has reached the honda before 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.420
 let's listen to what silvano thinks 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.670
 galbusera the technical manager of the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.580
 team yamaha and then we will hear ours 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.410
 bernardelle we are closer 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 we still believe that the honda has 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 still a little something to see now 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.310
 maybe markets free from commitment 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.980
 the world will still make the difference 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.649
 or not in the last races in short a 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.170
 valentino's house with water is here that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.540
 I have to aim for the world we are not so 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.760
 sure to be decided, count 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.430
 of the circumstances they say 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 favored these results could 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.950
 to be because of the supremacy he had 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.399
 marches to come to battle now 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.530
 don't be as fast as you do 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.770
 waited at first with something 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.719
 were this square galbusera giulio 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.940
 what do you think but I think that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.769
 surely the yamaha has there is 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.240
 managed to fill the reggae gap by ha 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.549
 mainly due to the fact of being successful 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 to fully exploit the potential 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 of the bridgestone tires that was the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.150
 problem that emerged from the first tests 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.830
 winter and certainly above all 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.850
 in Milan and then here in the last race 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.040
 motegi 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.140
 the service was very important 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.049
 because they did both valentine a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.580
 above all they put the picture of the times on the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.009
 around constant and absolutely 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.170
 significant up on record values 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.090
 the two bikes are completely different 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.939
 there is the yamaha is a way more bike 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.619
 precise allows the two pilots who were 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.720
 a more precise guide to markers 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.000
 above all to take full advantage of it 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.460
 precisely this guide unloads a lot of grip 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.180
 on the ground while the honda remains a motorcycle 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.979
 perhaps the dowry is more agile and more nervous 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.470
 which is still the honda is to be 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.299
 even less sensitive we say at the level 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 of tuning to the variations of 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.110
 track and asphalt conditions e 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 now we run phillip island 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.640
 what do you say about your verdict but 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.439
 I think phillip island to the difference 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.590
 they will do it for the characteristics of the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.950
 track that is absolutely difficult 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.810
 the drivers will be above all perhaps 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.150
 the only thing that could favor the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.489
 honda compared to a lack are le 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.830
 temperatures there it runs with the season 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.110
 which is not yet the best one 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.400
 average temperatures are stiff 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.200
 it was also seen at silverstone 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.450
 this year that with the cold asphalt la 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.780
 honda manages to be more incisive 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.250
 thanks giulio and we'll see good phillip 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.549
 island everyone still has a question 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.920
 for you from alberto who says yes there is so much 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.569
 electronics on the motogp in particular 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.720
 however the exiles always see is 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.579
 impossible to eliminate them but let's say that 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.880
 to eliminate them completely should 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.880
 simplify
