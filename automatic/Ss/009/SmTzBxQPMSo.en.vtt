00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
the only two major measurements that we

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.120 
the only two major measurements that we
made<00:00:03.570> where<00:00:03.840> there<00:00:03.990> was<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> consistent<00:00:04.620> effect

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
made where there was a consistent effect

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.490 
made where there was a consistent effect
across<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.580> subject<00:00:06.089> was<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.810> average<00:00:06.960> speed

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
across the subject was the average speed

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.890 
across the subject was the average speed
they<00:00:07.710> traveled<00:00:08.099> which<00:00:08.250> was<00:00:08.429> slower<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.030> there

various measures being used which

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.920 
various measures being used which
suggests<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:18.210> higher<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> dose<00:01:18.720> of

suggests that the higher the dose of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.770 
suggests that the higher the dose of
cannabis<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> more<00:01:21.030> cautious<00:01:21.270> perhaps

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
cannabis the more cautious perhaps

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.539 
cannabis the more cautious perhaps
they're<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> driver<00:01:22.740> more

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
they're going to be as a driver more

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.010 
they're going to be as a driver more
cautious<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.330> hand<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
cautious in the one hand but on the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.539 
cautious in the one hand but on the
other<00:01:25.110> hand<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.560> can't<00:01:25.799> react<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.280> quickly

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
other hand they can't react just quickly

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.179 
other hand they can't react just quickly
so<00:01:27.509> anything<00:01:27.810> sudden<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.290> happens<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.979> if

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
so anything sudden that happens or if

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.840 
so anything sudden that happens or if
it's<00:01:29.310> any<00:01:30.950> control<00:01:31.950> skills<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.729> needed

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it's any control skills that are needed

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.539 
it's any control skills that are needed
fairly<00:01:33.509> urgently<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.369> more

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
fairly urgently then there have more

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.319 
fairly urgently then there have more
difficulty

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
difficulty

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.560 
difficulty
so<00:01:37.049> overall<00:01:37.920> alcohol<00:01:38.909> makes<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> more

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
so overall alcohol makes you more

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
so overall alcohol makes you more
confident<00:01:40.020> cannabis<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.100> seems<00:01:41.369> makes<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
confident cannabis it seems makes you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240 
confident cannabis it seems makes you
more<00:01:42.119> cautious<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.380> necessarily<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
more cautious but not necessarily a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.490 
more cautious but not necessarily a
safer<00:01:44.850> driver

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
safer driver

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.109 
safer driver
so<00:01:46.500> how<00:01:46.680> reliable<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.460> these<00:01:47.729> conclusions

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
so how reliable are these conclusions

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.080 
so how reliable are these conclusions
and<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.409> they're<00:01:49.649> reliable<00:01:49.950> how<00:01:50.520> relevant<00:01:50.850> are

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and if they're reliable how relevant are

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.230 
and if they're reliable how relevant are
they<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.720> happens<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> real<00:01:52.439> world

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
they to what happens in the real world

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.420 
they to what happens in the real world
we've<00:01:54.240> conducted<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.990> lot<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.380> trials<00:01:55.860> over<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
we've conducted a lot of trials over the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.120 
we've conducted a lot of trials over the
years<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.850> using<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.390> driving<00:01:57.689> scene

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
years now using the driving scene

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.649 
years now using the driving scene
and<00:01:59.130> an<00:01:59.369> important<00:01:59.850> element<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> has

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and an important element of that has

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.330 
and an important element of that has
been<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.990> validate<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> test<00:02:01.770> hall<00:02:02.009> itself

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
been to validate the test hall itself

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.870 
been to validate the test hall itself
now<00:02:03.000> we've<00:02:03.390> done<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.930> variety<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.380> ways

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
now we've done that in a variety of ways

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.770 
now we've done that in a variety of ways
mostly<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.479> focus<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.290> speed<00:02:08.009> choice

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
mostly we focus on speed choice

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.270 
mostly we focus on speed choice
distances<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:09.869> other<00:02:10.110> vehicles<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.800> laying

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
distances from other vehicles and laying

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.339 
distances from other vehicles and laying
position<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.120> we've<00:02:12.239> observed<00:02:12.599> those<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
position and we've observed those in the

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.770 
position and we've observed those in the
driving<00:02:13.560> simulator<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.459> out<00:02:15.209> there<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.599> real

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
driving simulator and out there in real

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.309 
driving simulator and out there in real
life

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
life

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.979 
life
now<00:02:17.069> those<00:02:17.220> results<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.760> shown<00:02:17.790> two<00:02:18.750> things

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
now those results have shown two things

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.870 
now those results have shown two things
firstly<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.370> driving<00:02:20.700> simulator

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
firstly that the driving simulator

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.330 
firstly that the driving simulator
produces<00:02:21.660> results<00:02:22.019> which<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.290> very<00:02:22.530> close<00:02:22.890> to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
produces results which are very close to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.960 
produces results which are very close to
real<00:02:23.519> life

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
real life

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.540 
real life
however<00:02:24.660> they<00:02:24.840> are<00:02:24.870> different<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.650> most

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
however they are different and most

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.150 
however they are different and most
importantly<00:02:27.060> they're<00:02:27.300> systematically

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
importantly they're systematically

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.470 
importantly they're systematically
different<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.580> those<00:02:29.730> which<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.000> observe<00:02:30.209> in

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
different to those which you observe in

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.000 
different to those which you observe in
real<00:02:30.630> life<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.319> we<00:02:31.410> don't<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:31.620> get<00:02:31.799> more

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
real life so we don't just get more

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.789 
real life so we don't just get more
variation<00:02:32.790> we<00:02:33.420> tend<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.840> get<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.440> example

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
variation we tend to get for example

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.830 
variation we tend to get for example
with<00:02:34.890> speed<00:02:35.190> people<00:02:35.850> will<00:02:36.120> drive<00:02:36.330> slightly

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
with speed people will drive slightly

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.199 
with speed people will drive slightly

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
quicker in this simulator than they will

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.580
