00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.990 
way it'll hang in that direction doesn't
get<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> way<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.550> can<00:02:08.550> still<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:08.879> everything

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
get in the way I can still do everything

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.869 
get in the way I can still do everything
with<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.720> got<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> nice<00:02:10.619> grip<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.489> hand<00:02:11.730> goes

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
with it got a nice grip of my hand goes

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.400 
with it got a nice grip of my hand goes
right<00:02:12.150> over<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.569> don't<00:02:12.900> even<00:02:13.140> notice<00:02:13.379> that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
right over it don't even notice that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
right over it don't even notice that
it's

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.140 
it's
and<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.750> way<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.170> works<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:17.940> this

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and the way this works is you have this

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.210 
and the way this works is you have this
belt<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.620> put<00:02:19.800> around<00:02:19.890> your<00:02:20.190> waist<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
belt that you put around your waist and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.200 
belt that you put around your waist and
this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:24.320> heavy-duty<00:02:25.320> clamp<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.520> it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
this is one heavy-duty clamp on here it

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.740 
this is one heavy-duty clamp on here it
actually<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> three-way<00:02:28.920> position<00:02:29.700> lock<00:02:29.970> so

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
actually is a three-way position lock so

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.410 
actually is a three-way position lock so
you<00:02:31.110> cannot<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.100> get<00:02:32.430> one<00:02:32.670> side<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.210> you

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
you cannot just get one side of it you

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.560 
you cannot just get one side of it you
have<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.660> get<00:02:34.650> both<00:02:34.920> sides<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.730> this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
have to get both sides of it and this

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.640 
have to get both sides of it and this
little<00:02:36.630> tab<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.530> top<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:38.780> order<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.990> open<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.440> so

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
little tab on top in order to open it so

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.190 
little tab on top in order to open it so
it<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.070> going<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.490> be<00:02:41.730> completely<00:02:42.360> secure<00:02:42.990> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
it is going to be completely secure and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.860 
it is going to be completely secure and
then<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.130> has<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.550> pad<00:02:45.000> which<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.600> going<00:02:45.810> to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
then it has this pad which is going to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.860 
then it has this pad which is going to
ride<00:02:46.110> against<00:02:46.500> your<00:02:47.220> side<00:02:47.520> which<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.630> has<00:02:48.840> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
ride against your side which is has a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.360 
ride against your side which is has a
little<00:02:49.290> bit<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.530> padding<00:02:49.740> in<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.250> it's

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
little bit of padding in it but it's

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.190 
little bit of padding in it but it's
just<00:02:50.459> enough<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.690> your<00:02:51.810> camera<00:02:52.140> is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
just enough so that if your camera is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.020 
just enough so that if your camera is
bouncing<00:02:52.620> around<00:02:52.709> on<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.610> don't<00:02:53.730> really

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
bouncing around on you you don't really

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.810 
bouncing around on you you don't really
feel<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.470> has<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.770> heavy<00:02:56.160> duty<00:02:56.610> metal

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820
