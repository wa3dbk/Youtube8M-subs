start off you want to get a container
this<00:00:17.940> size<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.539> ordered<00:00:18.990> out<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.350> cricket<00:00:19.680> so

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
this size I ordered out the cricket so

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.130 
this size I ordered out the cricket so
this<00:00:20.730> size<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.090> container<00:00:21.390> works<00:00:21.689> perfectly

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
this size of a container works perfectly

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.910 
this size of a container works perfectly
fine<00:00:23.000> it's<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.180> 14<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> half<00:00:24.869> by<00:00:25.380> nine<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
fine it's a 14 and a half by nine and a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.140 
fine it's a 14 and a half by nine and a
half<00:00:26.630> container<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.000> will

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
half container that it is so this will

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.339 
half container that it is so this will
work<00:00:30.269> perfectly<00:00:30.660> fine<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.199> dozen

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
works perfectly great for the substrate

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.000 
works perfectly great for the substrate
they<00:01:02.010> use<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> food<00:01:02.760> source<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.149> well

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010

102 and what you also want to use for

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
102 and what you also want to use for
the<00:01:11.939> food<00:01:12.119> sources<00:01:12.570> potatoes<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> see

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the food sources potatoes as you see

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.560 
the food sources potatoes as you see
this<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> potato<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.880> already

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
this is a potato there I already

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
this is a potato there I already
finished<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> cut<00:01:17.250> pieces<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
finished it you want to cut pieces of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.270 
finished it you want to cut pieces of
potato<00:01:17.880> off<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.420> put<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:19.280> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
potato off and just put them there and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280 
potato off and just put them there and
don't<00:01:20.700> use<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.330> their<00:01:21.479> water<00:01:21.720> source<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
don't use that as their water source and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.999 
don't use that as their water source and
the<00:01:22.380> food<00:01:22.590> source

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the food source

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
the food source
so<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.790> works<00:01:24.450> perfectly<00:01:24.930> great<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.259> them

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so that works perfectly great for them

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920 
so that works perfectly great for them
so<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.189> an<00:01:26.310> easy<00:01:26.580> little<00:01:27.270> process<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.900> how

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so this is an easy little process on how

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
so this is an easy little process on how
to<00:01:28.110> keep<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.159> mealworms<00:01:29.520> alive<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.970> you're

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to keep your mealworms alive if you're

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.149 
to keep your mealworms alive if you're
thinking<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> getting<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.840> couple<00:01:31.159> mealworms

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
thinking of getting a couple mealworms

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
thinking of getting a couple mealworms
and<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.700> don't<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.970> how<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.600> keep<00:01:33.750> them

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and you just don't know how to keep them

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
and you just don't know how to keep them
alive<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.290> stuff<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> way<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> go<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
alive and stuff this is the way to go it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.740 
alive and stuff this is the way to go it
works<00:01:36.570> perfectly<00:01:37.079> fine<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.320> guarantee<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
works perfectly fine I guarantee it so

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.090 
works perfectly fine I guarantee it so
you<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> add<00:01:40.259> potatoes<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.860> every

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
you just want to add potatoes like every

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.190 
you just want to add potatoes like every
other<00:01:41.220> day<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> prevent<00:01:42.600> mold<00:01:42.780> since

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
other day just to prevent mold since
