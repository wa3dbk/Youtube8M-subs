speed<00:00:05.819> tree<00:00:06.000> model<00:00:06.240> basics<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:06.839> video

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
speed tree model basics in this video

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.490 
speed tree model basics in this video
we'll<00:00:08.160> start<00:00:08.429> by<00:00:08.639> making<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:09.059> new<00:00:09.269> tree<00:00:10.139> model

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
we'll start by making a new tree model

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.680 
we'll start by making a new tree model
from<00:00:10.650> scratch<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.400> we'll<00:00:12.059> use<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.360> template

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
from scratch and we'll use the template

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.240 
from scratch and we'll use the template
system<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.500> if<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.710> right<00:00:13.920> click<00:00:13.950> in

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
system get going if I right click in

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.060 
system get going if I right click in
here<00:00:14.610> add<00:00:14.990> template<00:00:15.990> trunk<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.740> we'll<00:00:16.890> make<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
here add template trunk and we'll make a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.130 
here add template trunk and we'll make a
standard<00:00:17.670> real<00:00:17.910> time<00:00:18.119> trunk<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.900> they<00:00:19.020> add

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
standard real time trunk so they add

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.260 
standard real time trunk so they add
that<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:20.189> see<00:00:20.340> we've<00:00:20.490> got<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.640> new<00:00:20.820> item<00:00:21.029> here

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
that you see we've got a new item here

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.109 
that you see we've got a new item here
in<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> generation<00:00:21.869> editor<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:23.400> trunk<00:00:23.970> in

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
in the generation editor and a trunk in

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.720 
in the generation editor and a trunk in
the<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.750> tree<00:00:24.930> window<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.550> next<00:00:26.550> thing

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the in the tree window here next thing

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.689 
the in the tree window here next thing
we'll<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:28.080> will<00:00:28.230> add<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.980> set<00:00:29.609> of

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
we'll do is to this we will add a set of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.640 
we'll do is to this we will add a set of
branches<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.240> we'll<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.750> standard<00:00:31.199> real<00:00:31.410> time

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
branches and we'll do standard real time

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.220 
branches and we'll do standard real time
branches<00:00:32.450> zoom<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> generation<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
branches zoom all the generation that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.540 
branches zoom all the generation that
are<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.469> don't<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.680> three<00:00:34.800> elements<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.309> here

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
are we don't have three elements in here

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.410 
are we don't have three elements in here
at<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> trunk<00:00:36.120> level<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.930> level<00:00:37.140> two<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.420> you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
at the trunk level one level two and you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
at the trunk level one level two and you
can<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.829> you<00:00:40.829> know<00:00:40.950> decent<00:00:41.250> treat<00:00:41.550> model<00:00:41.790> in

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
can see a you know decent treat model in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.959 
can see a you know decent treat model in
the<00:00:41.940> tree<00:00:42.120> window<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.430> next<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.730> we'll<00:00:44.850> do

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the tree window the next thing we'll do

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.180 
the tree window the next thing we'll do
is<00:00:45.149> create<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.930> material<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.440> put<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.950> tree

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
is create a material to put on this tree

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.930 
is create a material to put on this tree
so<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> materials<00:00:48.090> tab<00:00:48.649> I'll<00:00:49.649> add<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
so I'll get the materials tab I'll add a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
so I'll get the materials tab I'll add a
broadleaf<00:00:51.690> bari<00:00:51.930> jay<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
broadleaf bari jay this one of the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
broadleaf bari jay this one of the
texture<00:00:53.250> maps<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> comes<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> samples

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
texture maps that comes with the samples

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.139 
texture maps that comes with the samples
of<00:00:54.899> speed<00:00:55.110> tree<00:00:55.350> open<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:56.910> see

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
of speed tree open it up you can see

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.510 
of speed tree open it up you can see
that<00:00:57.180> found

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
that found

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.260 
that found
automatically<00:00:59.520> found<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> normal<00:01:00.120> map

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
automatically found the normal map

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.729 
automatically found the normal map
associated<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.289> based<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
associated with it it's based on the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
associated with it it's based on the
naming<00:01:02.010> convention<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.270> will<00:01:03.449> take<00:01:03.809> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
naming convention and I will take this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.719 
naming convention and I will take this
material<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.530> drag<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> from<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> asset<00:01:05.519> bar

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
material and drag it from the asset bar

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.960 
material and drag it from the asset bar
down<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> trunk<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> drop<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.260> there

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
down to the trunk and drop it on there

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
down to the trunk and drop it on there
we<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.000> also<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> few<00:01:09.420> other<00:01:09.600> things<00:01:09.840> about

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
we can also see a few other things about

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320 
we can also see a few other things about
it<00:01:10.290> there's<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> sign<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> different<00:01:11.820> color<00:01:12.030> set

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it there's a sign a different color set

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.660 
it there's a sign a different color set
to<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.619> edit<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.490> maybe

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to it and go edit that and maybe

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.399 
to it and go edit that and maybe
brighten<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:18.409> maybe

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
brighten it up a little bit and maybe

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.070 
brighten it up a little bit and maybe
we'll<00:01:19.560> add<00:01:19.680> another<00:01:20.310> material<00:01:20.729> cat<00:01:21.540> material

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
we'll add another material cat material

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.690 
we'll add another material cat material
to<00:01:22.290> put<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.360> broken<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.659> her<00:01:25.490> edges<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
to put on the broken or her edges of the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.660 
to put on the broken or her edges of the
branches<00:01:27.170> add<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.500> guy<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.130> zoom<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.520> on

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
branches add that guy and zoom in on

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.109 
branches add that guy and zoom in on
here<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.770> drop<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.400> there<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.909> now<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
here and drop that on there so now the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.580 
here and drop that on there so now the
broken<00:01:33.689> parts<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.170> nice<00:01:34.320> cat

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
broken parts will have a nice cat

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.190 
broken parts will have a nice cat
texture<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.040> them<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.280> well<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.900> if<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.020> click

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
texture on them as well and if we click

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.740 
texture on them as well and if we click
on<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.640> trunk<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.329> show<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.659> these

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
on the trunk we can show you what these

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.090 
on the trunk we can show you what these
materials<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.229> assigned<00:01:40.470> manual<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
materials are assigned manual if you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.440 
materials are assigned manual if you
want<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.790> there's<00:01:42.000> materials

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
want to it that way there's materials

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
want to it that way there's materials
group<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> branch<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
group and you can see the branch in the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
group and you can see the branch in the
cap<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.790> where<00:01:45.079> different

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
cap and you can see where different

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.420 
cap and you can see where different
materials<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> scene<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:47.009> available<00:01:47.310> here

on this combo box okay so the next thing

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.359 
on this combo box okay so the next thing
we<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.509> add<00:01:51.720> some<00:01:52.049> leaves<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> tree<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
we do is add some leaves to the tree and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.170 
we do is add some leaves to the tree and
I'll<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.790> by<00:01:54.540> clicking<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
I'll do that by clicking a little to

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.120 
I'll do that by clicking a little to
adding<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> template<00:01:57.750> please

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
adding a template please

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
adding a template please
standard<00:01:59.700> real<00:01:59.909> time

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
standard real time

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.149 
standard real time
so<00:02:01.710> these<00:02:01.770> are<00:02:01.950> camera<00:02:02.220> facing<00:02:02.460> leaf<00:02:02.820> cards<00:02:04.159> by

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
so these are camera facing leaf cards by

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.710 
so these are camera facing leaf cards by
default<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.760> can<00:02:05.820> put<00:02:06.090> measures<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
default and you can put measures on that

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.210 
default and you can put measures on that
which<00:02:06.840> I'll<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.229> moment<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.160> I

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
which I'll do in a moment for that I

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.160 
which I'll do in a moment for that I
want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.550> add<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> leaf<00:02:09.119> material<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.929> I'll<00:02:10.020> go

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
want to add a leaf material so I'll go

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.870 
want to add a leaf material so I'll go
and<00:02:10.350> add<00:02:11.090> sample<00:02:12.090> leaves<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:13.340> if<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.670> so

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
and add sample leaves one if in that so

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.540 
and add sample leaves one if in that so
we<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> new<00:02:15.209> material<00:02:15.630> sample<00:02:15.990> leaves<00:02:16.170> one

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
we have a new material sample leaves one

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.699 
we have a new material sample leaves one
sign<00:02:17.550> at<00:02:17.700> Ally's<00:02:18.209> color<00:02:18.510> set<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.530> edit

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
sign at Ally's color set and go edit

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.680 
sign at Ally's color set and go edit
that<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> brighten<00:02:20.459> up<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.120> well

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
that and brighten up as well

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.740 
that and brighten up as well
then<00:02:22.590> come<00:02:22.800> back<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.220> material<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.000> drop

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
then come back to the material and drop

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.350 
then come back to the material and drop
it<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:24.989> there<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.500> now<00:02:26.160> we<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.430> leaves<00:02:27.090> these

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
it on there so now we have leaves these

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.970 
it on there so now we have leaves these
are<00:02:27.480> still<00:02:27.660> camera<00:02:28.020> facing<00:02:28.230> leaf<00:02:28.560> cards<00:02:28.860> at

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
are still camera facing leaf cards at

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.850 
are still camera facing leaf cards at
this<00:02:29.130> point<00:02:30.170> if<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.319> want<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.530> make<00:02:31.709> it

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
this point if we want to make it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.290 
this point if we want to make it
something<00:02:32.220> else<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.670> can<00:02:32.790> go<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.000> meshes

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
something else I can go to the meshes

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.680 
something else I can go to the meshes
tab<00:02:33.540> add<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.320> mesh<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:35.269> this<00:02:36.269> case<00:02:36.480> I'll<00:02:36.660> use

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
tab add a mesh in this case I'll use

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.380 
tab add a mesh in this case I'll use
cross<00:02:37.170> foil<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.800> these<00:02:37.920> are<00:02:38.070> STM<00:02:38.880> files<00:02:39.180> that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
cross foil and these are STM files that

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.670 
cross foil and these are STM files that
stands<00:02:39.570> for<00:02:39.660> speed<00:02:39.959> treat<00:02:40.200> match<00:02:40.380> but<00:02:40.590> they

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
stands for speed treat match but they

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.460 
stands for speed treat match but they
can<00:02:40.800> also<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:41.130> obj<00:02:41.640> or<00:02:41.670> FBX<00:02:42.180> files<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:43.410> your

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
can also be obj or FBX files of your

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.020 
can also be obj or FBX files of your
choosing<00:02:44.070> or<00:02:44.160> use<00:02:44.310> ones<00:02:44.489> out<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.730> our<00:02:44.820> library

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
choosing or use ones out of our library

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.020 
choosing or use ones out of our library
so<00:02:45.540> I'll<00:02:45.720> use<00:02:45.959> cross<00:02:46.230> foil<00:02:46.590> add<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.819> get<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so I'll use cross foil add that we get a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.759 
so I'll use cross foil add that we get a
preview<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.750> looks<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.380> here

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
preview of what it looks like in here

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.390 
preview of what it looks like in here
and<00:02:50.610> then<00:02:51.540> I'll<00:02:51.660> drop<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.140> leaf<00:02:52.739> geometry

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and then I'll drop that leaf geometry

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.910 
and then I'll drop that leaf geometry
and<00:02:53.610> now<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.300> have<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.930> mesh<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.470> there<00:02:55.590> instead

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and now we have a mesh in there instead

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.259 
and now we have a mesh in there instead
of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.040> camera<00:02:56.250> facing<00:02:56.489> leaf<00:02:56.760> cards<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
of the camera facing leaf cards in the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.580 
of the camera facing leaf cards in the
fuzzy<00:02:57.450> zoom<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.019> see<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.350> pretty

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
fuzzy zoom in you can see that pretty

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.030 
fuzzy zoom in you can see that pretty
well<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.080> sort<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.290> covers<00:03:01.620> starting

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
well so that sort of covers starting

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.440 
well so that sort of covers starting
with<00:03:02.130> nothing<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.640> getting<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.970> tree<00:03:03.239> with

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
with nothing and getting a tree with

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.720 
with nothing and getting a tree with
some<00:03:03.600> materials<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.280> place<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
some materials on it and in place in the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.580 
some materials on it and in place in the
editor<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.299> now<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.690> want<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.140> talk<00:03:07.290> about<00:03:07.410> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
editor and now I want to talk about the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.560 
editor and now I want to talk about the
difference<00:03:07.890> between<00:03:08.090> generators<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.299> nodes

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
difference between generators and nodes

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.360 
difference between generators and nodes
when<00:03:09.989> you're<00:03:10.140> editing<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.560> tree<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.100> if<00:03:11.220> I

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
when you're editing a tree so if I

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.190 
when you're editing a tree so if I
expand<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.090> guy<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.299> little<00:03:12.510> bit<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.900> we<00:03:12.989> zoom

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
expand this guy a little bit and we zoom

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.170 
expand this guy a little bit and we zoom
out<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.470> see<00:03:13.530> all<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.920> different<00:03:14.579> parts<00:03:15.030> in

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
out and see all the different parts in

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.729 
out and see all the different parts in
here<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:17.299> a20<00:03:18.299> circles<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:19.410> called<00:03:19.650> a

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
here the a20 circles is called a

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.130 
here the a20 circles is called a
generator<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.760> represents<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.660> group<00:03:21.959> of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140

geometry in some cases it may be making

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.160 
geometry in some cases it may be making
one<00:03:23.910> thing<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.480> case<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.900> trunk

one thing like in the case of the trunk

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.479 
one thing like in the case of the trunk
and<00:03:25.410> I'm<00:03:25.500> gonna<00:03:25.590> change<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.890> selection<00:03:26.160> style

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
and I'm gonna change the selection style

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.410 
and I'm gonna change the selection style
a<00:03:26.549> wireframe<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:27.060> make<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> little<00:03:27.299> more

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
a wireframe to make a little more

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.509 
a wireframe to make a little more
obvious<00:03:27.650> or<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.010> could<00:03:29.100> be<00:03:29.190> generating

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
obvious or it could be generating

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.220 
obvious or it could be generating
multiple<00:03:29.670> things<00:03:30.150> case<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> level-1<00:03:31.200> level-2

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
multiple things case a level-1 level-2

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.390 
multiple things case a level-1 level-2
or<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.730> leaf<00:03:32.880> grant<00:03:33.180> relief<00:03:33.799> nodes<00:03:34.799> here<00:03:35.100> so

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
or the leaf grant relief nodes here so

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.759 
or the leaf grant relief nodes here so
when<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.329> edit<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.660> generator<00:03:37.140> property<00:03:37.620> and

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
when you edit a generator property and

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.720 
when you edit a generator property and
it<00:03:37.859> makes<00:03:37.980> little<00:03:38.130> more<00:03:38.280> obvious<00:03:38.519> I'm<00:03:38.609> going

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
it makes little more obvious I'm going

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.580 
it makes little more obvious I'm going
to<00:03:38.790> turn<00:03:38.850> off<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.120> leaf<00:03:39.269> rendering<00:03:39.720> go<00:03:40.530> to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
to turn off the leaf rendering go to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.030 
to turn off the leaf rendering go to
level<00:03:40.920> 1<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.489> go<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.970> spines<00:03:42.420> length<00:03:43.049> want

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
level 1 and go to the spines length want

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.500 
level 1 and go to the spines length want
to<00:03:44.100> edit<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.370> link<00:03:44.519> for<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.790> generator<00:03:45.269> that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
to edit the link for the generator that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.390 
to edit the link for the generator that
it's<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.750> length<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:46.140> everybody<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.280> that

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it's the length of everybody that that

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.949 
it's the length of everybody that that
generator<00:03:47.850> makes<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.269> I'm<00:03:48.329> editing<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.810> whole

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
generator makes so I'm editing a whole

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.190 
generator makes so I'm editing a whole
class<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.799> things<00:03:49.859> at<00:03:50.190> one<00:03:50.340> time

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
class of things at one time

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.170 
class of things at one time
similarly<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.380> could<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.950> start<00:03:53.370> angle<00:03:53.790> and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
similarly you could do a start angle and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.240 
similarly you could do a start angle and
these<00:03:54.510> other<00:03:54.810> procedural<00:03:55.500> procedural

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
these other procedural procedural

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.099 
these other procedural procedural
parameters<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.820> tree<00:03:57.030> model<00:03:57.359> can<00:03:58.019> also

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
parameters of the tree model can also

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.890 
parameters of the tree model can also
take<00:03:58.530> first<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.459> last<00:03:59.670> and<00:04:00.120> control<00:04:00.600> where

take first and last and control where

take first and last and control where
that<00:04:00.950> it's<00:04:01.950> eligible<00:04:02.430> things<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.850> grow<00:04:03.000> and

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
that it's eligible things to grow and

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.880 
that it's eligible things to grow and
I'm<00:04:04.019> not<00:04:04.109> going<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.290> go<00:04:04.380> into<00:04:04.530> detail<00:04:04.859> about

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
I'm not going to go into detail about

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.289 
I'm not going to go into detail about
all<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.280> different<00:04:05.370> options<00:04:05.880> here<00:04:06.030> but<00:04:06.209> this

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
all the different options here but this

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.280 
all the different options here but this
is<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> general<00:04:07.200> gist<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.310> how<00:04:08.459> you

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
is just the general gist of how you

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.660 
is just the general gist of how you
operate<00:04:10.290> edit<00:04:10.709> tree<00:04:10.920> models<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.489> they<00:04:11.550> get

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
operate edit tree models and they get

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.160 
operate edit tree models and they get
this<00:04:11.819> link<00:04:12.360> back<00:04:12.659> in<00:04:12.840> some

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
this link back in some

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.090 
this link back in some
looks<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.319> little<00:04:13.380> more<00:04:13.530> reasonable<00:04:14.099> and<00:04:16.100> now

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
looks a little more reasonable and now

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.490 
looks a little more reasonable and now
you<00:04:17.700> can<00:04:17.850> also<00:04:18.000> get<00:04:18.269> down<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.840> edit<00:04:19.049> any

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
you can also get down and edit any

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.319 
you can also get down and edit any
individual<00:04:20.100> part<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.489> tree<00:04:20.639> one<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.180> do

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
individual part of the tree one you do

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.030 
individual part of the tree one you do
that<00:04:21.480> by<00:04:21.690> switching<00:04:21.840> into<00:04:22.290> node<00:04:22.530> editing<00:04:22.889> mode

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
that by switching into node editing mode

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.530 
that by switching into node editing mode
with<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:23.370> button<00:04:23.639> right<00:04:23.669> there<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.270> node

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
with that button right there so a node

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.540 
with that button right there so a node
editing<00:04:24.900> mode<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.290> can<00:04:25.320> click<00:04:25.680> on<00:04:25.860> any<00:04:26.160> part<00:04:26.490> of

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
editing mode I can click on any part of

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.200 
editing mode I can click on any part of
the<00:04:26.610> tree<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.120> can<00:04:28.110> move<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.100> around<00:04:29.210> change

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
the tree I can move it around change

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.070 
the tree I can move it around change
where<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.510> goes

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
where it goes

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.129 
where it goes
spin<00:04:31.290> it<00:04:31.410> around<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:32.100> if<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.000> if<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.930> change

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
spin it around and if you if you change

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.140 
spin it around and if you if you change
the<00:04:34.290> length<00:04:34.470> now<00:04:34.710> this<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.190> an<00:04:35.340> offset<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.120> the

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
the length now this is an offset to the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.210 
the length now this is an offset to the
parameter<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.320> generator<00:04:37.710> gave<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.100> so

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
parameter that the generator gave it so

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.730 
parameter that the generator gave it so
it<00:04:38.370> says<00:04:38.520> link<00:04:38.730> 0<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.300> means<00:04:39.330> add<00:04:39.660> 0<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.169> what

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
it says link 0 that means add 0 to what

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.530 
it says link 0 that means add 0 to what
the<00:04:40.860> generators<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:41.790> if<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:41.940> go<00:04:42.150> in<00:04:42.270> here<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.450> do

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
the generators so if I go in here and do

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.900 
the generators so if I go in here and do
this<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:42.840> can<00:04:42.990> make<00:04:43.020> this<00:04:43.260> one<00:04:43.440> longer<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.250> can

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
this I can make this one longer I can

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.120 
this I can make this one longer I can
make<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.180> shorter<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.810> can<00:04:46.410> change<00:04:46.620> its<00:04:46.830> start

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
make it shorter I can change its start

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.159 
make it shorter I can change its start
angle<00:04:47.490> either<00:04:47.669> by<00:04:47.910> doing<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.389> like<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:48.630> or

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
angle either by doing it like that or

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.540 
angle either by doing it like that or
coming<00:04:49.470> your<00:04:49.560> grab<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.919> snip<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.280> later<00:04:50.430> and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
coming your grab and snip you later and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.690 
coming your grab and snip you later and
doing<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.790> same<00:04:50.970> thing<00:04:51.270> so<00:04:52.460> when<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.520> switch

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
doing the same thing so when you switch

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.950 
doing the same thing so when you switch
the<00:04:53.850> node<00:04:54.000> editing<00:04:54.240> mode<00:04:54.479> you<00:04:54.660> can<00:04:54.810> move

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
the node editing mode you can move

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.450 
the node editing mode you can move
around<00:04:55.110> any<00:04:55.440> individual<00:04:55.889> part<00:04:56.070> of<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.190> tree
