00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello everyone so we get 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.680
 found for a video dedicated to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 smoothie 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 it's going to be the number 1 recipe of 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.540
 smoothie and there will be many more 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.599
 come 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.679
 I wanted to start with you first 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.160
 explain a little what are the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.509
 smoothies 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.060
 I think you necessarily have 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.520
 heard around you these are in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.130
 makes worried fish made from 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.820
 fruit so it looks like enough 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 Mitschek 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.920
 it's a little more creamy and it's the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.250
 main reason it really is to be 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.290
 the fruits and waters on the other hand one can 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.300
 add yoghurt or ice to 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.059
 to thicken a little fish there but we go 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.280
 really focus on prices so 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.840
 that smoothies can be made to 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.670
 base of fruits or vegetables one can 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.510
 have sweet or salty smoothies 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 I'm happy to make smoothies 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.960
 sweet and for that I use fruit 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.210
 both fresh and frozen when siro 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.470
 you really have a lot of choices that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.119
 available to you since you can 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.840
 realize this folder with roughly 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.150
 any fruit outside 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.060
 fruits I usually add a yoghurt to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.299
 the greek have preferred an eye to 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.220
 tie-break lines 0% so that tonight 's 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.810
 less calories 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.299
 these are actually the ideal yogurts for 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.659
 have this really creamy side I 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.610
 seldom achieves 12th of the class by 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.710
 against when we destroyed a little more 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.229
 thick like apricots and peach 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.670
 I have instead in place and the yang to the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.350
 Greek by milk simply 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.380
 and at the milk level you can 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.149
 use cow's milk of course 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.830
 but also that milk soya milk 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.950
 of almond to give a little taste enough 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.149
 original referred in being a milk times 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.990
 skimmed half skim to make a 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.890
 recipe a little more dietary 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.270
 the smoothies it's really something 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.439
 something that can be abused 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.939
 yeah that's reasonable anyway because 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.649
 we are fighting against 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.810
 calories but it's really going to you 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.930
 bring a lot of vitamins a lot 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.580
 of magnesium calcium benefits in 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.269
 does that will contribute to your contributions 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.099
 daily 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.470
 it's often said that you have to eat five 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.230
 fruits and vegetables a day is fine with 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.810
 the smoothie you already have a good 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.730
 part of its fruits and vegetables that are 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.290
 consumed personally I eat 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.350
 every morning actually I'm getting ready 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.870
 also in the evening for the free morning in 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.480
 party advise anyway to drink the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.799
 just worry after having prepared it but 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.390
 now I will not force my time 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.000
 and it's true that he lost some of his 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.980
 nutritional values ​​but there is when 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.650
 even even leaves me some 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.329
 benefits you can also add 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.840
 in the are also outside the dairy 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:54.709
 fruits and spices such as cane 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.720
 is like mint or thyme 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.480
 it's a free rein to your 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.040
 imagination 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.590
 when you come also added some 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.750
 seeds like fines like 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.909
 pistachios 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.890
 farroqui really give pleasure and 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.720
 varied bring your fish for 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.730
 to realize worry me I use a blender 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.920
 and I think it's really 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.569
 practice between them and not to do 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.200
 personally I was successful on 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.260
 in the private and it's a striking in 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.099
 does a beauty like that with the propeller 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.319
 deep down I now have to have or 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.239
 crime I was moving lis and I put on 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.349
 the blender I press on 1000 c is my 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.799
 preparation is made 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:42.180
 I just have to him if the little lid 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.160
 with the spout like this and my 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.069
 smoothie and fishing opinion and the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.810
 lodgings to take the next morning 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.030
 so today the first recipe is going 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.150
 to be a pineapple mango smoothie 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.269
 so what I like to buy actually this 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.410
 are mangos and nasa the fruits 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:04.530
 actually close cut and that at 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.870
 leclerc i really found in auchan 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.760
 that juppé these are fruits that are 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.019
 already prepared it's super convenient for 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.799
 salmon if you just have to 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.799
 put in a blender 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.470
 good ah it's consumed soon after having 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.840
 bought since it is not very 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.130
 long time 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.680
 so for this recipe you will have 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:29.680
 need August allies to the Greek 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:34.740
 lightened of a pressed orange of 200 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.520
 grams of pineapple and 250 g of mango 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.570
 so I'll start by preparing 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.310
 in an orange 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:45.040
 I prefer to use a juice made myself 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.720
 whatever they saw I rang to that 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.520
 between them bears but you can well 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.610
 heard in buy in the shops 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.910
 and / or paid directly this is not a 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.910
 offense 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.530
 so this recipe makes it a little bit more 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.180
 400 calories 407 colo calories for 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.370
 to be exact it's not nothing in fact you 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.230
 mainly have the yogurt that goes 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:17.860
 to be the most caloric yet these 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:19.140
 lightened periods but that's it for the little 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.580
 already 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.220
 take your smoothie maybe a 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.250
 drink a hot drink and a small 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:33.430
 little bread or biscuits and your 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:35.550
 breakfast is ready I add the juice 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.550
 orange 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.770
 there is a little lower than elsewhere 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.480
 I add the sale I'm going to cut a 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:55.290
 little more finely so that the leader 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:59.000
 can slip the fruit the same for 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.000
 bring it there I discover it in big cubes 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.700
 and finally I add the yoghurt to the 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.700
 Greek 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:44.530
 my preparation is ready 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:46.810
 I only have to mix 10 seconds more 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.220
 later the scoci is ready I have more 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:53.229
 than to pour it in the green and there you 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.060
 do you have for two big 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:57.610
 glasses so it's up to you to see if you 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.050
 take the drink for yourself or 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.970
 if you share at that moment you 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.650
 reduce the number of calories by two 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.419
 you end up with a drink at 200 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.370
 calories for breakfast with 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.290
