00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.860
 so we are ready 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.719
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.309
 after the party first fc kaiserslautern 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.080
 against hertha bsc I welcome of course 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 the opposing coach jos luhukay and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 our chef trainer costa fetsch and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.930
 Please luca to his comment to 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.279
 game 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.289
 I believe that we are a very intense one 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.750
 burgas players have seen where we are 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.570
 maybe even tigers favorite start 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.059
 But we also had to think first 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.090
 half a good first half 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.969
 we also have to go here yes 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.730
 in a game situation where we 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.500
 I think after forgetting the first gate 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.780
 to score the second goal and before the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.430
 halftime break with sami allagui 2 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.829
 the first one was the best one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.539
 one hundred percent and if you are in the train 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.180
 in the half-time break with two only for 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.860
 Then you go to another feeling in me 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 the second half you know the whole thing 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.149
 chatter in the second on her gate with 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 their fans in the back the pressure increased 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.799
 and the problem was that they were so 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.659
 so we could solve it from the pressure 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.180
 football as a player switching 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.710
 come out very well and in the second 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
 at half past time it was only sporadically that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.049
 we get rid of the pressure 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 i could think that the biggest problem 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.049
 in the center lay in the defensive behavior where 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.820
 we seldom got the first tree and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.490
 often speculate on the second ball 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.180
 had to and once that happens then that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.970
 we do not act first but that 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.040
 you only then excellent as first 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.619
 quoted and scored tomorrow's class goal 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 and after the 2 1 we did not have any 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.500
 One hundred percent that was then one 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.079
 class switching motion where they all me 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 Grieben looked super served and in the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.689
 moment you have to aim the boom 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.610
 and in the decisive moments there 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.820
 it is ultimately about the country speaks 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.549
 It's about the details and the whole thing 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.350
 Gradually again what is the detail before 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.360
 The half time that was now makes then 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.799
 I think that then the opponent has more 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.799
 open and then you might get 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.179
 more room to counter and in the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.060
 defensive behavior you do of course 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.420
 itself on 23 crucial mistakes 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.670
 where the opponent gratefully benefits from and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.120
 This makes people deserve one 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.610
 Continue round and we do not thank you very much 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.489
 for the luca toni as your comment please 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.770
 yes I think we are super great game today 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.030
 seen from our team at the beginning 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.410
 was further surprised with the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.150
 But we wanted to set up our own 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.910
 play through and in the first 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.379
 half time I believe that we are the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.569
 but a slightly better team were 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:47.550
 Harder was always dangerous and 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.099
 accordingly if you are with with 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.209
 is a residue in the half time is 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.920
 it is not self-evident that one 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.800
 then in the second half so 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.930
 play as our team has shown 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.849
 He has three goals at half time 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.989
 scored mo idrissou has his 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.599
 kept promise 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.450
 The team was great on the side 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:10.620
 supported by our fans and we are 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.390
 all super happy and happy little ones 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.739
 details certainly have for us too 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.349
 then played 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.700
 the one missed chance where we too 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.569
 in the first as well as the other 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.769
 had a chance and once has tobi 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.659
 held supremely superior ball 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.680
 and you are a team in itself believed 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:35.569
 we were very good 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.569
 supported by our fans 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.580
 great evening a round tomorrow 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.709
 we will train again 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.470
 regenerate and we think intensively 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.900
 make over the next opponent over that 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.549
 next hard game and I hope that 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.569
 many fans come to the stadium and the 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.260
 continue to support the team 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.260
 Many Thanks
