00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.740
 one of the games of action 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.140
 expected of the second half of the year is 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.940
 line mirror a launch that has 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.590
 raised a lot of expectation from his 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.960
 announcement and that has been supported by a 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.210
 setting with few precedents a 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.640
 third-person shooter like that but with 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.080
 a very genuine touch an intense campaign 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.080
 and a good multiplayer 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.600
 in the game of jager such a beautiful place 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.489
 as Dubai is ravaged by a 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.620
 catastrophe that buries the emirate in 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.600
 arena in the game we will be a soldier 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.549
 called walker who will lead a platoon 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.949
 of American soldiers looking for 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.989
 a delta force gone and who is 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.699
 that military officer called jon 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.500
 conrad is disobeying 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.360
 orders of the high command and that has 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.220
 entrenched in the luxurious heart of the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.649
 zone in the purest style of marlon brando 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.420
 in 'apocalypse now' the mission seemed 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.250
 routine at first but as 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.920
 usually happens in this type of cases the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.720
 things are never simple quickly 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.610
 we will discover the dark secrets that 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.830
 they hide behind the luxurious walls of 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.659
 the Middle East area as a site 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.130
 beautiful in appearance as dark and 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.130
 bloodthirsty in its bowels 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.110
 all the action of spec ops the line is 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.810
 poses as that of a shooter in third 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.880
 pretty traditional person for example 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.680
 there are coverages and in fact the use 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.930
 the basis of a certificate along 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.310
 the adventure the enemies may not be 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.229
 as skilled as in launches 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.090
 recent but brave players 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.280
 they will pay dearly in the levels of 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.540
 higher difficulty if they do not use the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.540
 parapets as they should 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.170
 to help us get out of the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.729
 most tricky situations we have the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.579
 help from two colleagues who are 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.899
 we can give very simple orders 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.850
 basically it's about telling them about 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.340
 who center their shots while 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.229
 we open fire on the rest is 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.500
 a very useful maneuver to carry out 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.640
 small tactics of suppression and rodeo 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.959
 especially recommended against 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.959
 machine gun turrets 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.010
 and the individual campaign changes a lot its 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.989
 duration depending on the level of 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.879
 difficulty that we choose between the four 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.500
 available but we can encrypt it in 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.930
 around eight hours for the player 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.150
 half a standard number for the gender 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.650
 the 13 missions of which it is composed 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.440
 they will take us with some skill 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.510
 by relatively varied places and a 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.220
 of the best virtues of spec ops is 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.349
 precisely the one to take a lot of 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.569
 of Dubai as a surprising backdrop 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.549
 background there are abundant sequences in the 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.260
 inside of buildings but when more 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.120
 enjoy the title is when you squeeze 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.739
 its bright exteriors and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.329
 unparalleled proportions of their 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.329
 skyscrapers surrounded by sand 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.250
 in this way history makes a good 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.650
 work although it accuses certain lack of 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.330
 depth in the shootings the game 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.490
 seeks to offer variety with some 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.290
 rappel sections and small drops of 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.819
 exploration but they end up being something 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.819
 monotonous and do not contribute too much 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.370
 to dress up your formula the game 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.099
 includes rich multiplayer modes both 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.720
 of competitive court as a cooperative the 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.730
 cooperative stream is for two 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.650
 users and it's a brief detail in 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.930
 downloadable and free format that 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.180
 contributes 4 unpublished episodes that exert 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.890
 of prequel to explain how he could 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.760
 reach the limit situation that we 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.760
 tell the story 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.310
 the competitive one is more interesting and brings 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.440
 I get six modalities pretty 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.990
 standard for another half dozen maps 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.790
 It is attractive for both fun 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.200
 that offers as per the interesting ones 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.540
 unlocking incentives for 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.000
 customize our soldier we can 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.190
 choose between two sides the exiles and 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.140
 the cursed and the slope in general 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.670
 offers some curious details like 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.670
 active presence of the sand 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.950
 visually spector is a game of 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.050
 contrasts on the one hand it is clear that 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.060
 gives us some spectacular prints 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.859
 and that at an artistic and design level 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.049
 It has very good taste to transmit a 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.090
 very fast pace however 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.160
 reached the final stretch of the campaign 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.990
 to his trips in zip line the scenarios 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.389
 that are coming down and their effects 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.760
 climatological script to 2 end up being 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.290
 something repetitive we have nothing in 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.350
 against such situations 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.340
 programmed because they create very 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.650
 cinematographic but they have to be 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.850
 able to surprise the player and here 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.850
 pecan of predictable 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.210
 on the other hand all that good work that 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.740
 generates beautiful prints and decorations not 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.200
 It is also accompanied by 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.030
 technological as we expected some 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.280
 animations are great while 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.110
 others are somewhat clumsy 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.270
 effects like those of the explosions are 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.550
 pretty loose and saw teeth 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.910
 or the late loading of textures are a 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.910
 constant 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.960
 lastly regarding the sound the game 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.930
 it comes translated and folded to our 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.060
 language with good level the 33 left 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.860
 with the music guru is little 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.330
 frequent and almost always topics 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.090
 graduates but knows perfectly 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.700
 when it should sound and when to make way for 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:31.160
 some dry effects raw and really 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.320
 potent spec ops the line is first of all 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.360
 a good action game although maybe the 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.730
 expectations were much higher 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.800
 their managers wanted to offer a side 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.600
 dark of the war and in the end they have not 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.430
 treated with as much depth as 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.160
 we expected but in the other aspects 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.050
 it's a remarkably fast-paced release and 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.180
 with quantity and variety of modes 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.170
 game and with some very scenes 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.170
 spectacular
