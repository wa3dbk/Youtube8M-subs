a very high two out rate you know really
I<00:00:25.529> wouldn't<00:00:26.400> even<00:00:26.490> bother<00:00:26.670> setting<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
I wouldn't even bother setting it if I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.330 
I wouldn't even bother setting it if I
didn't<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.020> wire<00:00:28.289> that's<00:00:28.680> why<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.070> show<00:00:29.279> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
didn't have wire that's why we show you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.580

it with with cordage but you know 100

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.410 
it with with cordage but you know 100
foot<00:00:49.830> roll<00:00:50.040> of<00:00:50.190> wire<00:00:50.370> doesn't<00:00:50.850> cost<00:00:51.030> anything

foot roll of wire doesn't cost anything

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.719 
foot roll of wire doesn't cost anything
it's<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.409> something<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.979> you<00:00:53.400> know<00:00:53.519> would

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
it's not something that you know would

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.850 
it's not something that you know would
get<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.269> suspicion<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.110> having<00:00:55.739> in

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
get you a lot of suspicion is having in

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.799 
get you a lot of suspicion is having in
your<00:00:56.040> kit<00:00:56.339> because<00:00:56.970> it<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.299> have<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.479> lot<00:00:57.690> of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
your kit because it can have a lot of

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.060 
your kit because it can have a lot of
different<00:00:58.140> uses<00:00:59.360> so<00:01:00.360> all<00:01:00.900> you<00:01:01.110> need<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.769> few

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
different uses so all you need is a few

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219 
different uses so all you need is a few
feet<00:01:02.339> of<00:01:02.369> it<00:01:02.670> find<00:01:03.210> yourself<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.690> little<00:01:03.839> rabbit

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
feet of it find yourself a little rabbit

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.560 
feet of it find yourself a little rabbit
trail<00:01:04.500> somewhere<00:01:05.070> make<00:01:05.760> yourself<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.270> split

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
trail somewhere make yourself a split

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.190 
trail somewhere make yourself a split
stick<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.920> you're<00:01:08.040> gonna<00:01:08.159> form<00:01:08.549> that

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
stick and then you're gonna form that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.730 
stick and then you're gonna form that
loop<00:01:11.119> for<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.540> height<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> type<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
loop for the the height and the type of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.900 
loop for the the height and the type of
animal<00:01:14.160> that<00:01:14.280> you're<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.790> after<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.910> then

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
animal that you're going after and then

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.550 
animal that you're going after and then
place<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.450> along<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.680> trail<00:01:21.080> at<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> right

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
place it along the trail at the right

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890 
place it along the trail at the right
height<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.580> very<00:01:23.880> important<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.750> we're

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
height it's very important so if we're

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.380 
height it's very important so if we're
going<00:01:25.080> after<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.560> rabbit<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.940> have<00:01:27.030> swamp

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
going after a rabbit like we have swamp

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
going after a rabbit like we have swamp
rabbit<00:01:27.840> around<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:28.560> they're<00:01:28.680> fairly

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
rabbit around here and they're fairly

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.030 
rabbit around here and they're fairly
large<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:30.090> want<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.570> gauge<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.500> heights<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
large we want to gauge the heights of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
large we want to gauge the heights of
the<00:01:32.160> snare<00:01:32.630> based<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.870> where<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.260> animal's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the snare based on where the animal's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.590 
the snare based on where the animal's
neck<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.160> because<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.910> want<00:01:36.120> to<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.360> neck

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
neck is because we want to get a neck

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120 
neck is because we want to get a neck
hold<00:01:36.870> because<00:01:37.260> that's<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> increase

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
hold because that's going to increase

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.270 
hold because that's going to increase
our<00:01:38.400> overall<00:01:38.760> odds<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.540> getting<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.900> kill<00:01:40.280> with

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
our overall odds of getting a kill with

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.820 
our overall odds of getting a kill with
you<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.300> without<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> locker<00:01:42.900> snare<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.590> these

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
you know without a locker snare on these

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.130 
you know without a locker snare on these
it's<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.670> there's<00:01:45.480> a<00:01:45.540> little<00:01:45.810> bit<00:01:45.930> lower

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
it's not there's a little bit lower

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.680 
it's not there's a little bit lower
percentage<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.240> actually<00:01:48.240> getting<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
percentage of actually getting the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.600 
percentage of actually getting the
animal<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.260> keeping<00:01:49.620> them<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.190> without

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
animal and keeping them on with without

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.700 
animal and keeping them on with without
that<00:01:50.820> Locker<00:01:51.120> snare<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.870> that's<00:01:52.080> why<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.530> want

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that Locker snare so that's why we want

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.469 
that Locker snare so that's why we want
to<00:01:52.770> make<00:01:52.920> sure<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.310> everything<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.940> perfect

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to make sure that everything is perfect

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.899 
to make sure that everything is perfect
if<00:01:55.170> we're<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.530> setting<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.950> simple<00:01:56.340> peg<00:01:56.580> snare

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
if we're just setting a simple peg snare

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.219 
if we're just setting a simple peg snare
like<00:01:57.120> this

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.980 

the<00:02:03.710> animals<00:02:04.100> gonna<00:02:04.280> walk<00:02:04.520> through<00:02:04.810> gets<00:02:05.810> his

the animals gonna walk through gets his

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.050 
the animals gonna walk through gets his
head<00:02:06.200> caught<00:02:06.440> in<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.830> he's<00:02:07.370> gonna<00:02:07.550> draw<00:02:07.850> out

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.890 
head caught in it he's gonna draw out
the<00:02:08.240> slack<00:02:08.950> it'll<00:02:09.950> tighten<00:02:10.190> around<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.060> this

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
the slack it'll tighten around and this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.960 
the slack it'll tighten around and this
wire<00:02:12.140> will<00:02:12.500> hold<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.920> fairly<00:02:13.520> good-sized

wire will hold a fairly good-sized
animal<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:15.500> they're<00:02:15.770> gonna<00:02:15.860> freak<00:02:16.190> out

and<00:02:16.819> then<00:02:17.060> choke<00:02:17.450> themselves<00:02:17.690> out<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.680> you'll

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
and then choke themselves out and you'll

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.670 
and then choke themselves out and you'll
have<00:02:19.040> dinner<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.610> table<00:02:26.380> what's<00:02:27.380> great

about<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:29.300> particular<00:02:29.959> type<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.440> wire<00:02:32.530> is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
about this particular type of wire is

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.910 
about this particular type of wire is
that<00:02:34.310> it's<00:02:34.700> reusable<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.720> very<00:02:36.620> easily

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
that it's reusable and very easily

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.090 
that it's reusable and very easily
formable<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.930> when<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> animal<00:02:39.950> comes

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
formable so when the animal comes

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.479 
formable so when the animal comes

through you know chokes them out look
look<00:02:43.970> at<00:02:44.090> about<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.450> height<00:02:44.660> I've<00:02:44.870> got<00:02:45.080> about

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
look at about the height I've got about

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.640 
look at about the height I've got about
two<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.980> three<00:02:46.220> fingers<00:02:46.459> here<00:02:47.500> from<00:02:48.500> the

two to three fingers here from the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
ground and you know the difference

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.610 
ground and you know the difference
between<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.540> modern<00:02:53.930> braided<00:02:54.350> snare

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
between this and a modern braided snare

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.310 
between this and a modern braided snare
is<00:02:54.830> once<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.370> use<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> braided<00:02:56.239> snare<00:02:56.660> it's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
is once you use a braided snare it's

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.080 
is once you use a braided snare it's
done<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.860> can't<00:02:58.070> really<00:02:58.250> use<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.550> again<00:02:58.910> as

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
done you can't really use it again as

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.870 
done you can't really use it again as
except<00:02:59.900> for<00:03:00.080> maybe<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.470> lengthen<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.430> length

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880

chokes himself to death now we've talked

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.590 
chokes himself to death now we've talked
a<00:03:09.680> lot<00:03:09.709> about<00:03:09.890> funneling<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.090> lot<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.480> our

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
a lot about funneling with a lot of our

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.780 
a lot about funneling with a lot of our
previous<00:03:11.959> trap<00:03:12.470> trigger<00:03:12.769> systems<00:03:13.310> but<00:03:13.579> it's

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
previous trap trigger systems but it's

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.360 
previous trap trigger systems but it's
specially<00:03:14.480> important<00:03:15.049> with<00:03:15.380> your<00:03:15.769> simple<00:03:16.160> peg

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
specially important with your simple peg

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.640 
specially important with your simple peg
snare<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.780> reason<00:03:18.140> being<00:03:18.350> is<00:03:18.590> because

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
snare and the reason being is because

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.500 
snare and the reason being is because
you<00:03:19.070> don't<00:03:19.220> want<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.610> animal<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.030> walk<00:03:20.329> around

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
you don't want the animal to walk around

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.509 
you don't want the animal to walk around
so<00:03:20.989> what<00:03:21.170> we've<00:03:21.320> got<00:03:21.350> set<00:03:21.739> up<00:03:21.799> here<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.250> just<00:03:22.430> a

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
so what we've got set up here is just a

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.670 
so what we've got set up here is just a
little<00:03:22.730> piece<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:23.030> tree<00:03:23.239> bark<00:03:23.450> but<00:03:24.440> where<00:03:24.650> I

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
little piece of tree bark but where I

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.610 
little piece of tree bark but where I
primarily<00:03:25.519> like<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.970> use<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.420> type<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.170> trap

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
primarily like to use this type of trap

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.460 
primarily like to use this type of trap
is<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:28.190> long<00:03:28.549> rabbit<00:03:29.030> runs<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.930> find<00:03:30.230> like

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
is a long rabbit runs and you find like

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.680 
is a long rabbit runs and you find like
a<00:03:30.500> thick<00:03:30.829> grassy<00:03:31.340> area<00:03:31.760> with<00:03:32.030> maybe<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.360> tree

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
their food source and you you typically

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.080 
their food source and you you typically
always<00:03:45.709> want<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.070> trap<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.640> between<00:03:46.970> the

to<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.290> rules<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.709> can<00:03:51.890> actually<00:03:52.280> trap<00:03:52.579> their

to the rules you can actually trap their
their<00:03:53.090> shelter<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.200> tend<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.620> have<00:03:54.769> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
best success in transition areas okay so

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.400 
best success in transition areas okay so
that<00:03:58.310> was<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.489> simple<00:03:58.910> peg<00:03:59.120> snare<00:03:59.480> very<00:04:00.140> easy
