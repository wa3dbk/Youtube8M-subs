00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
cutting thin strips on the table saw

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.780 
cutting thin strips on the table saw
with<00:00:02.820> strip<00:00:03.270> being<00:00:04.069> cut<00:00:05.069> between<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.460> blade

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
with strip being cut between the blade

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.059 
with strip being cut between the blade
and<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> fence<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.690> not<00:00:06.930> exactly<00:00:07.410> dangerous

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
and the fence is not exactly dangerous

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.209 
and the fence is not exactly dangerous
but<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:08.460> not<00:00:08.610> recommended<00:00:09.800> the<00:00:10.800> piece<00:00:11.010> could

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
but it's not recommended the piece could

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.100 
but it's not recommended the piece could
get<00:00:11.370> jammed<00:00:11.670> between<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.450> fence<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
get jammed between the fence and the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.130 
get jammed between the fence and the
blade<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.950> thrown<00:00:14.250> back<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.700> you

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.380 

and<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:21.740> shape<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.370> surface<00:00:22.820> could<00:00:23.030> be

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
and the shape and the surface could be

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.200 
and the shape and the surface could be
altered<00:00:24.310> due<00:00:25.310> to<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.580> fact<00:00:25.820> that<00:00:25.970> it's

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
altered due to the fact that it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.050 
altered due to the fact that it's
passing<00:00:26.720> spinning<00:00:27.410> blade<00:00:27.650> could<00:00:28.490> easily<00:00:28.670> get

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
passing spinning blade could easily get

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.740 
passing spinning blade could easily get
scarred<00:00:29.980> so<00:00:30.980> it's<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.220> lot<00:00:31.400> safer<00:00:31.700> to<00:00:32.120> to

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
scarred so it's a lot safer to to

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.270 
scarred so it's a lot safer to to
colleague<00:00:33.110> on<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.290> left<00:00:33.620> side<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.100> blade

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
colleague on the left side of the blade

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.950 
colleague on the left side of the blade
so<00:00:35.560> a<00:00:36.560> lot<00:00:36.740> of<00:00:37.150> ripping<00:00:38.150> jigs<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.480> be<00:00:38.660> found

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
so a lot of ripping jigs to be found

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.490 
so a lot of ripping jigs to be found
online<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:39.820> I've<00:00:40.820> collected<00:00:41.630> some<00:00:42.200> of<00:00:42.350> the

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
online so I've collected some of the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.549 
online so I've collected some of the
ideas<00:00:43.220> that<00:00:43.250> I<00:00:43.460> saw<00:00:43.730> online<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.530> made<00:00:45.530> a

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
ideas that I saw online and made a

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.420 
ideas that I saw online and made a
digital<00:00:46.400> version<00:00:46.640> for<00:00:47.770> accurate<00:00:48.770> adjustments

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
digital version for accurate adjustments

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:58.030 
digital version for accurate adjustments
i<00:00:55.329> pre-cut<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.480> parts<00:00:56.870> before<00:00:57.110> gluing<00:00:57.440> on<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
i pre-cut the parts before gluing on the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.240 
i pre-cut the parts before gluing on the
templates<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.060> can<00:00:59.210> easily<00:00:59.420> just<00:01:00.070> go<00:01:01.070> on

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
templates but you can easily just go on

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.979 
templates but you can easily just go on
the<00:01:01.370> templates<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:01.940> cut<00:01:02.450> everything<00:01:02.570> on<00:01:02.930> the

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
the templates and cut everything on the

00:01:02.989 --> 00:02:00.280 
the templates and cut everything on the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
the homemade digital height gauge comes

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.670 
the homemade digital height gauge comes
in<00:02:50.040> handy<00:02:50.250> when<00:02:50.569> getting<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.780> final<00:02:52.170> position

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
in handy when getting the final position

I<00:03:05.690> use<00:03:06.690> walnut<00:03:07.230> for<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> runners<00:03:07.920> for<00:03:08.160> this

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
I use walnut for the runners for this

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:24.500 
I use walnut for the runners for this
but<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.940> use<00:03:09.120> any<00:03:09.270> hardwood<00:03:23.030> some<00:03:24.030> final

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
but you can use any hardwood some final

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.170 
but you can use any hardwood some final
tweaking<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.920> runners<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.490> give

it<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.390> nice<00:03:27.540> slide<00:03:50.240> be<00:03:51.240> careful<00:03:51.690> when<00:03:51.840> cutting

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
it a nice slide be careful when cutting

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.030 
it a nice slide be careful when cutting
off<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.620> end<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.460> the<00:03:53.570> dip<00:03:54.570> gauge<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:55.860> don't

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
to take on a bar for a miter gauge but I

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.409 
to take on a bar for a miter gauge but I
don't<00:05:04.340> have<00:05:04.460> any<00:05:04.610> miter<00:05:04.879> gauge<00:05:05.180> on<00:05:05.389> my<00:05:05.569> saw<00:05:05.840> so

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:16.659 

I<00:05:09.909> just<00:05:10.909> put<00:05:11.120> two<00:05:11.360> dowels<00:05:11.599> in<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.169> but<00:05:15.669> when

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
I just put two dowels in it but when

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.879 
I just put two dowels in it but when
placing<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:18.050> position<00:05:18.469> of<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.680> miter

placing the the position of the miter

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.959 
placing the the position of the miter
gauge<00:05:19.539> adjust<00:05:21.099> the<00:05:22.099> jig<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.370> its<00:05:22.639> fully

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
gauge adjust the jig to its fully

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.300 
gauge adjust the jig to its fully
extended<00:05:23.479> position<00:05:23.509> and<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:25.069> try<00:05:25.250> to

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
extended position and and try to

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.249 
extended position and and try to
position<00:05:25.789> with<00:05:25.909> the<00:05:26.000> bearings<00:05:26.389> as<00:05:26.750> close<00:05:27.050> to

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
position with the bearings as close to

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.379 
position with the bearings as close to
the<00:05:27.379> blade<00:05:27.560> as<00:05:27.710> possible<00:05:28.280> then<00:05:28.969> you<00:05:29.090> have<00:05:29.210> all

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
the blade as possible then you have all

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.529 
the blade as possible then you have all
the<00:05:29.659> 25<00:05:30.379> millimeter<00:05:30.650> adjustments<00:05:31.639> to<00:05:32.449> the

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
the 25 millimeter adjustments to the

00:05:32.539 --> 00:06:10.809 
the 25 millimeter adjustments to the
left<00:05:32.780> side<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.229> the<00:05:33.319> blade

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:13.189 

as<00:06:11.819> you<00:06:11.969> can<00:06:12.089> see<00:06:12.299> I<00:06:12.329> don't<00:06:12.479> have<00:06:12.629> any<00:06:12.809> miter

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
as you can see I don't have any miter
