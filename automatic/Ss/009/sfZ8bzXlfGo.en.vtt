00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
far as I can remember I mean I'm sure

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
far as I can remember I mean I'm sure
that<00:00:54.690> she<00:00:54.899> helped<00:00:55.289> them<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.829> she<00:00:56.129> wasn't

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that she helped them but she wasn't

that she helped them but she wasn't
really<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> tight<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.899> cell<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:59.010> where

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
really a tight for cell but I see where

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.229 
really a tight for cell but I see where
they're<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.789> they're<00:01:00.090> probably

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
they're going with that they're probably

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.700 
they're going with that they're probably
gonna<00:01:00.390> use<00:01:00.629> hair<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> love<00:01:01.379> triangle

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
gonna use hair is like a love triangle

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.640 
gonna use hair is like a love triangle
for<00:01:02.190> Dick<00:01:02.340> Grayson<00:01:02.850> Starfire<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.170> think

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
for Dick Grayson Starfire so I think

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.020 
for Dick Grayson Starfire so I think
that<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.159> interesting<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.850> mean

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that could be interesting and I mean

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.130 
that could be interesting and I mean
Barbara<00:01:06.420> Gordon's<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.810> pretty<00:01:07.020> good

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
Barbara Gordon's is pretty good

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.350 
Barbara Gordon's is pretty good
character<00:01:07.590> overall<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.549> think<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:09.150> being

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
character overall so I think are being

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.289 
character overall so I think are being
in<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.720> pretty<00:01:09.960> cool<00:01:10.369> Hawking<00:01:11.369> Duff<00:01:11.580> again<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
in it's pretty cool Hawking Duff again I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.539 
in it's pretty cool Hawking Duff again I
think<00:01:12.420> they're<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> strange<00:01:13.920> characters

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
think they're kind of strange characters

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
think they're kind of strange characters
but<00:01:14.880> hey<00:01:15.380> what<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> heck<00:01:16.650> throw<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.100> in

because<00:01:43.229> he<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.560> an<00:01:43.680> iconic<00:01:44.270> member<00:01:45.590> cyborg

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
because he is an iconic member cyborg

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.039 
because he is an iconic member cyborg
they<00:01:47.189> could<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.909> include<00:01:48.360> him<00:01:48.600> because

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
they could just not include him because

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.080 
they could just not include him because
of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.350> Cinematic<00:01:50.340> Universe<00:01:50.369> like

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
of the Cinematic Universe like

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.410 
of the Cinematic Universe like
considering<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> TV<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
considering that the TV and the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.270 
considering that the TV and the
cinematic<00:01:54.420> universes<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.170> different<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
cinematic universes are different I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.950 
cinematic universes are different I
don't<00:01:56.579> know<00:01:56.670> why<00:01:56.850> they<00:01:57.000> couldn't<00:01:57.329> include<00:01:57.750> him

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
don't know why they couldn't include him

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.980 
don't know why they couldn't include him
so<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.560> mean<00:01:59.490> he<00:01:59.790> could<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.030> included<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.659> future

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so I mean he could be included in future

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.480 
so I mean he could be included in future
episodes<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.649> don't<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.950> we'll<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.250> have

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
episodes we don't know we'll just have

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.999 
episodes we don't know we'll just have
to<00:02:02.610> wait<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.759> see<00:02:03.049> I'm<00:02:04.049> also<00:02:04.259> hoping<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
to wait and see I'm also hoping then the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.510 
to wait and see I'm also hoping then the
future<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:05.759> Kid<00:02:06.119> Flash

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
future we get Kid Flash

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.180 
future we get Kid Flash
red<00:02:08.239> arrow<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:09.019> maybe<00:02:09.560> even<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:10.720> wonder<00:02:11.720> girl

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
red arrow and maybe even a wonder girl

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.250 
red arrow and maybe even a wonder girl
so<00:02:13.190> yeah<00:02:13.910> just<00:02:14.269> have<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.599> classic<00:02:14.840> Teen

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
so yeah just have the classic Teen

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.589 
so yeah just have the classic Teen
Titans<00:02:15.680> line<00:02:15.860> up<00:02:16.069> there<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.580> don't<00:02:17.420> know<00:02:17.510> about

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
Titans line up there I don't know about

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.300 
Titans line up there I don't know about
our<00:02:17.810> show<00:02:18.080> he'd<00:02:18.230> be<00:02:18.349> another<00:02:18.620> one<00:02:18.830> since<00:02:19.069> he's

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
our show he'd be another one since he's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.089 
our show he'd be another one since he's
already<00:02:19.489> an<00:02:19.670> arrow<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.300> would<00:02:20.450> be<00:02:20.599> kind<00:02:20.900> of

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
already an arrow that would be kind of

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.640 
already an arrow that would be kind of
difficult<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:22.640> do<00:02:22.879> so<00:02:23.780> they<00:02:23.810> might<00:02:24.049> not<00:02:24.230> do<00:02:24.410> him

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
difficult to do so they might not do him

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.009 
difficult to do so they might not do him
but<00:02:24.920> Kid<00:02:25.220> Flash<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.819> especially<00:02:26.030> want<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.480> see<00:02:26.690> I

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
but Kid Flash I especially want to see I

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.320 
but Kid Flash I especially want to see I
think<00:02:27.430> when<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.459> girl<00:02:28.760> would<00:02:28.849> be<00:02:29.000> pretty<00:02:29.269> cool

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
think when a girl would be pretty cool

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.619 
think when a girl would be pretty cool
and<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:31.129> guess<00:02:31.459> they<00:02:31.610> could<00:02:31.760> do<00:02:31.849> Aqualad<00:02:32.420> as

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
and I guess they could do Aqualad as

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.089 
and I guess they could do Aqualad as
well<00:02:32.840> they<00:02:33.140> really<00:02:33.290> wanted<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.739> go<00:02:33.860> out<00:02:33.890> there

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
well they really wanted to go out there

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.600 
well they really wanted to go out there
but<00:02:34.750> yeah<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.780> think<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.349> they<00:02:36.500> could<00:02:36.580> do<00:02:37.580> a

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
but yeah I think that they could do a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.039 
but yeah I think that they could do a
lot<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.849> really<00:02:38.090> cool<00:02:38.120> things<00:02:38.299> with<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.720> show<00:02:39.019> I

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
lot of really cool things with a show I

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.770 
lot of really cool things with a show I
hope<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.470> succeeds<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.400> we'll<00:02:41.239> finally<00:02:41.599> get<00:02:41.720> a

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
hope it succeeds and we'll finally get a

hope it succeeds and we'll finally get a
