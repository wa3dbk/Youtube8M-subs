rebel and professional today I'm here to
talk<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.540> about<00:00:06.629> our<00:00:07.080> permanent<00:00:07.649> range

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
talk to you about our permanent range

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.339 
talk to you about our permanent range

which is revlon des moines mt n mt

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.860 
which is revlon des moines mt n mt
stands<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:11.010> nano<00:00:11.190> molecular<00:00:11.849> technology<00:00:12.509> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
stands for nano molecular technology the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.650 
stands for nano molecular technology the
word<00:00:13.080> nano<00:00:13.530> means<00:00:13.889> small<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.420> means

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
word nano means small so what that means

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.090 
word nano means small so what that means
is<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.080> molecules<00:00:16.500> smaller<00:00:16.830> that's

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
is that the molecules smaller that's

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.050 
is that the molecules smaller that's
ever<00:00:17.279> been<00:00:17.460> before

which go from a 1 to a 10 and we have

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.750 
which go from a 1 to a 10 and we have
our<00:00:40.620> essence<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.370> stands<00:00:41.640> for

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
our essence which stands for

supernaturals which goes from a 5 to a
nine<00:00:44.700> both<00:00:45.420> ranges<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.079> give<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
nine both ranges will give you up to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.910 
nine both ranges will give you up to
100%<00:00:47.309> grey<00:00:47.730> coverage<00:00:47.840> one<00:00:48.840> being<00:00:49.170> cool<00:00:49.559> which

100% grey coverage one being cool which
is<00:00:49.950> our<00:00:50.250> Naturals<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.510> being<00:00:51.780> warm<00:00:52.110> which

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
is our Naturals and one being warm which

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.310 
is our Naturals and one being warm which
is<00:00:52.440> our<00:00:52.620> essence<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.520> gold<00:00:53.820> based

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
is our essence so they are gold based

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.540 
is our essence so they are gold based
when<00:00:55.320> we're<00:00:55.469> using<00:00:55.710> our<00:00:55.920> permanent<00:00:56.370> color

volume<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.090> easy<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.630> select<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
volume it's really easy to select the

strength<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.830> need<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.220> use<00:01:08.430> because

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
strength that you need to use because

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
strength that you need to use because
you<00:01:08.820> drop<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.330> zero<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:10.560> how

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you drop off your zero and that's how

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
you drop off your zero and that's how
many<00:01:10.920> levels<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.340> lift<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:12.000> many

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
many levels of lift you will get many

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.179 
many levels of lift you will get many
that<00:01:12.750> tempo<00:01:13.140> will<00:01:13.350> give<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.770> level<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
that tempo will give you one level of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.210 
that tempo will give you one level of
lift<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:14.909> use<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.479> depositing<00:01:16.220> 25

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
lift we also use this for depositing 25

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.679 
lift we also use this for depositing 25
we'll<00:01:17.340> give<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> two<00:01:17.790> levels<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.180> lift<00:01:18.479> we

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
we'll give you two levels of lift we

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.170 
we'll give you two levels of lift we
also<00:01:18.869> use<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.560> gray<00:01:19.710> coverage<00:01:20.100> 30<00:01:20.850> volts

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
also use this for gray coverage 30 volts

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
also use this for gray coverage 30 volts
three<00:01:21.360> levels<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.780> lift<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> 40<00:01:22.710> volt<00:01:22.920> four

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
three levels of lift and 40 volt four

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:23.929 
three levels of lift and 40 volt four
levels<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.610> lift

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
levels of lift

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.940 
levels of lift
I'm<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> demonstrate<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.830> how

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I'm now going to demonstrate to you how

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.590 
I'm now going to demonstrate to you how
we<00:01:26.220> would<00:01:26.460> mix<00:01:26.670> our<00:01:27.000> permanent<00:01:27.450> color

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.320 

so<00:01:32.600> as<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:32.900> said<00:01:33.110> before<00:01:33.140> if<00:01:33.710> we<00:01:33.920> are<00:01:34.070> using<00:01:34.340> with

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
so as I said before if we are using with

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.360 
so as I said before if we are using with
our<00:01:35.480> mixing<00:01:35.810> ratio<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.620> one<00:01:36.830> plus<00:01:37.040> one<00:01:37.310> and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
our mixing ratio it's a one plus one and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.090 
our mixing ratio it's a one plus one and
a<00:01:37.550> half<00:01:37.760> mixing<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:38.870> would<00:01:39.170> say<00:01:39.770> for<00:01:39.830> a

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
a half mixing so I would say for a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.400 
a half mixing so I would say for a
standard<00:01:40.520> regrowth<00:01:40.940> application<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.290> will

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
standard regrowth application you will

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.010 
standard regrowth application you will
mix<00:01:42.740> approximately<00:01:43.400> 30<00:01:43.670> mils<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.150> color<00:01:45.610> and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
mix approximately 30 mils of color and
