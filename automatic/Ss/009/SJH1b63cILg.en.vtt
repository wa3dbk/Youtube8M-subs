 You moved to Ghibli 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.449
 Asked for the color of tv

 Yasuda 2 32 There was an opportunity to be scared at that time 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:14.909
 A little 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.909
 I would like to talk about what I heard and Kawane town breakdown 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.919
 Mr. Yasuda is 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.529
 A person who has also worked on daily color and color design 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.099
 It's already Miyazaki Univ. The age of Toei Animation 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.119
 It is said that a friend from 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.119
 I have worked together 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.210
 It was Mitaka City, but 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.990
 That's a question Last year's spring one thing 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.300
 I'm retiring from town It's impossible to specify the color even now 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.640
 I do not seem to have 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 Although I did the previous day with that person 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.650
 The good thing is 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.210
 Waste liquid 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.550
 It is said that something like it works well 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.310
 It is said that I am really looking forward to solving 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.240
 I 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 It is a director if you can win by the prefecture plan 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.380
 I'm working on it and I'm coach 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.380
 Mr. Yasuda says 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710
 Unusual 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.600
 Really interesting 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.700
 Special issue 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 You tell me that you have a knife 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.660
 It is when you were doing the color design with Awayama work possible color design 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.910
 Actually the yen 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.860
 Is this color specified 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.730
 Actually I was looking forward to it 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.390
 I'm satisfied with the water 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.670
 It's funny, moving and funny 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.120
 1Chat a cigarette with a different personality 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.630
 For example, I'm responding to that overlapping vacation 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.430
 You 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.160
 There is no small movement that public elementary school changes, and video changes 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.830
 You should specify some place 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.800
 Actually the first and last 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.930
 Unsynchronize it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.840
 Closed school 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.120
 You should change it gradually, but it is round 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.830
 In the case of the video I was in charge of 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.240
 When you want to insert a switchboard circuit 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.740
 At that time, I say it's interesting or provoking 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.699
 I mean 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.699
 Because it was a person with the charm of cherry blossoms 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.329
 Take out the South Buddha 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.629
 So really high and Sasa leaves too 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.279
 I'm looking forward to this certain completion but 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.759
 If you want to see it quickly, you have something to say 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.239
 It was very impressive at that time 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.049
 It is old thing Kyoto 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.929
 It's a little time, I see you meet Mr. Yasuda 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:37.449
 This is gone 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.349
