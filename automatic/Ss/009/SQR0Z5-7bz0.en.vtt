00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.519
 hello everyone i'm nobody gs and do not 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.010
 much in sangoy cafe or a new page 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.320
 dedicated to the fans of toki mickey 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.350
 gray memory 6 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.320
 who are watching at this moment 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:22.390
 appeared a contribution from pandora if 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:26.530
 here that was giving us the steps to 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.220
 to download your khimki restaurant 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:34.420
 is that this application only works with 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.339
 a tablet or with a cell phone an iphone 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.260
 For those of us who have computers 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.480
 desktop as well as that is a 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.050
 little bit 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.470
 as well as discouraging because one does not 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.390
 have 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.210
 and then this one 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.090
 I said ok and then there must be a 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.490
 way to have these options 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.500
 of having this video game without so much 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.350
 problem because we're not going to say it about the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.250
 next way is a program is 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.980
 code 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.840
 and if I can walk it instead 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.150
 can emulate a countable i was 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.310
 working all the blessed day to 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.250
 be looking for how to make this 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.200
 it will work and finally I got it ok 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.700
 that was what I did first to be able 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.960
 make all of this work first 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.400
 I got an emulator 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.180
 from android that is called what sought 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.230
 jac 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.100
 let's look better 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.950
 with your hand on your official page and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.509
 download this program here is free 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.780
 there is no problem you do not have to 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:51.060
 pay nothing you can not go download it for me 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.430
 windows xp version 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.369
 and view and everything else good I took it down 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.009
 for my option ok then I'm going to 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.170
 teach how we will first lower this 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.810
 I already have it. Let's go down. 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.479
 to find the description of the video 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.680
 and after that we're going to install this 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.660
 program do not have to put 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.310
 absolutely nothing install all the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.130
 computer as you take off the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.810

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.810
 have done that we're going 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.200
 take this konami address 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.160

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.160
 restaurant 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.310
 and what good is not compatible with what 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.200
 I have here not with the computer 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.390
 desktop this will not work but 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.590
 what we are going to do next is 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.300
 use a page that we are going to be 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.300
 call to see 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.820
 ap ap that your love and here 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.330
 this direction of tolkien x restaurant 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:09.480
 we're going to stick it here 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.480
 let's let us generate the file 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.600
 and we're going to click on click konami's 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.190
 restaurant now 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.440
 we download without any problem 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.900
 and we already have the file we are going to 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.280
 download one as another computer 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.090
 Now, next, what are we going 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.569
 to do let's run the program 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.420
 Well, I think that you already 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.709
 This program will be installed bruce 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.180
 of the Yankees, I think you already considered 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.099
 that you have not installed lesma 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.440
 Take some time to test before 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.300
 install 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.450
 let the computer finish 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.450
 where they have to finish and they execute it 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.360
 or good the program when it ends 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.970
 installed right runs 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.720
 automatically but now we are going to 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.720
 let them carry 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.829
 okay 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.409
 let's do this 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.030
 here when you start this thing does not make 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:24.960
 full screen you are going to see this 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.669
 and when I loaded everything ok then to 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.440
 below how are you going to install touch 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.050
 make and restaurant we are going to 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.960
 and we're going to remove the full screen and 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.020
 that is achieved here look 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.550
 on this screen here we are going to remove 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.210
 the full screen and let's search 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.940
 our our app that we already downloaded 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.060
 that will be in downloads sorry for the 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.270
 disaster and here is touch mx 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.700
 restaurant we double click 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.610
 and it will install us on the computer and 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.090
 will execute us 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.789
 now one more thing is missing that I took a 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.300
 good time to discover it but this 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:11.449
 option is for this how is it called 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.280
 as it is said to configure the touch mx 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:18.249
 restaurant because when the touch starts 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.539
 make and restaurant happens that looks bad 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.539
 what do I mean wrong 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.940
 I'm going to teach you right now 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.959
 let's run in our house when 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.860
 Immersion runs for the first time 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:38.139
 they will see what happens 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.479
 that runs like this in a way that 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.159
 this system keeps playing like this with the 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.729
 neck are going to cause a 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.870
 torticollis how we fix that problem 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:50.280
 okay 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.280
 us to the aggressor with the little arrow here 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.300
 Those who are a little bit will be in charge 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.590
 yes loading from memory take into account 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:01.139
 that this works counted and cellular 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.370
 and if it demands a bit of memory 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.370
 this musician 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.080
 yes 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.579
 we are going to leave also go out tantito 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.860
 let's go here to the clock we're going to give 

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:21.870
 one click 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.750
 we are not air here where are these 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.350
 this little thing here this little symbol 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.230
 and let's go to adjustments in settings let's 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.660
 to direct us to change the size of the 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.310
 application and we look for removed kim x 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.770
 restaurant we are not going to change the 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:42.199
 tablet click click on ready 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.009
 and now if they are going to be able to play your chemistry 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.009
 rest to one 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.819
 but a little if they arise it does not appear 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.529
 here on the corner but I've already done 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.339
 this mine 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:55.339
 and with that 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.050
 let's see let's go product has 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.130
 but a little bit still 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.330
 and we are going to click on who is now 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.110
 in play when it is installed for the first time 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:27.640
 time will have a good time in installing 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:29.140
 from asking that they configure the wey they are going 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.600
 to give a google address its 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.240
 password and they have to apply two 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.500
 Sometimes they are not charged at all 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.480
 by the application this holiday 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.450
 free indeed this trick only works 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.880
 with applications that is an index and therefore 

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:45.210
 they already have the game to play us 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.740
 a little nor install but 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.590
 and they will have it for your computer 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.020
 but that they enjoy it and without any type 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.400
 of program with complication I hope 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.389
 have enjoyed this video tutorial 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:00.650
 I hope you like it and see you in another 

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:00.650
 video is not to play 

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.470
 saucers 

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.250
 no longer
