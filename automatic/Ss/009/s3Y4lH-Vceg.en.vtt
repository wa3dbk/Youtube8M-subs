that<00:02:39.500> air<00:02:39.650> like<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.100> metal<00:02:40.520> pieces<00:02:41.180> this

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
that air like this metal pieces this

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.810 
that air like this metal pieces this
will<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.170> metal<00:02:42.500> piece<00:02:42.620> are<00:02:42.920> like<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> little<00:02:43.700> bit

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
will a metal piece are like a little bit

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.259 
will a metal piece are like a little bit
out<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.780> can<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:45.350> pull<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.650> out<00:02:46.269> it's

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
out so you can just pull it out it's

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.410 
out so you can just pull it out it's
like<00:02:47.510> state<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.900> in<00:02:48.050> place<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:48.910> we<00:02:49.910> had<00:02:50.060> first

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
like state it in place so we had first

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.680 
like state it in place so we had first
thing<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.230> have<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:52.450> make<00:02:53.450> them

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
thing to do you have to like make them

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.979 
thing to do you have to like make them
straight<00:02:54.820> or<00:02:55.820> try<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.090> do<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.600> little<00:02:56.840> bit

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
straight or try to do like a little bit

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.300 
straight or try to do like a little bit
straighter<00:02:58.390> usually<00:02:59.390> instant<00:02:59.690> this<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.890> can

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
straighter usually instant this you can

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.890 
straighter usually instant this you can
start<00:03:01.550> from<00:03:01.730> one<00:03:01.940> side<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.420> middle<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.840> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
start from one side the middle and the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.640 
start from one side the middle and the
other<00:03:03.019> set<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.620> middle<00:03:03.890> because<00:03:04.040> they<00:03:04.340> are

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
other set in the middle because they are

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.780 
other set in the middle because they are
like<00:03:07.390> something<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:08.810> anyway

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
like something like that anyway

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.140 
like something like that anyway
then<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:10.940> from<00:03:11.239> top<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:16.070> under<00:03:16.340> other<00:03:16.760> top

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
then do it from top the under other top

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.220 
then do it from top the under other top
side<00:03:17.900> okay<00:03:18.799> it's<00:03:19.790> like<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> little<00:03:20.209> bit<00:03:20.510> up<00:03:20.750> like

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
side okay it's like a little bit up like

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.680 
side okay it's like a little bit up like
pushed<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.799> little<00:03:22.549> bit<00:03:22.730> looks<00:03:23.030> more<00:03:23.390> straight

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
pushed a little bit looks more straight

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.020 
pushed a little bit looks more straight
but<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.110> still<00:03:24.350> not<00:03:24.500> very<00:03:24.860> correctly<00:03:25.670> so

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
but it's still not very correctly so

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.330 
but it's still not very correctly so
next<00:03:26.540> thing<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.780> have<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.959> use<00:03:27.200> with<00:03:28.100> very

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
next thing you have to use with very

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.470 
next thing you have to use with very
very<00:03:28.489> pointed<00:03:28.970> ease<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.320> can<00:03:30.470> like<00:03:31.480> touch

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
very pointed ease so you can like touch

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.160 
very pointed ease so you can like touch
this<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:33.440> see<00:03:33.620> start<00:03:34.519> coming<00:03:34.850> up<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:36.110> the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
this you see start coming up to the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.800 
this you see start coming up to the
other<00:03:36.440> side<00:03:38.680> okay<00:03:39.709> it's<00:03:40.220> good<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:41.450> can<00:03:41.600> see

other side okay it's good you can see

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.979 
other side okay it's good you can see
that<00:03:42.019> I'm<00:03:42.380> actually<00:03:42.620> go<00:03:43.390> push<00:03:44.390> them<00:03:44.630> erased

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
that I'm actually go push them erased

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.430 
that I'm actually go push them erased
right<00:03:45.230> that's<00:03:46.010> good<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:47.079> will<00:03:48.079> show<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.260> later

right that's good I will show you later

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.210 
right that's good I will show you later
a<00:03:49.299> better<00:03:50.299> view<00:03:53.200> game<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.350> little<00:03:54.620> bit<00:03:54.829> pushing

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
a better view game a little bit pushing

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:06.039 
a better view game a little bit pushing
back<00:04:03.370> okay<00:04:04.370> let's<00:04:04.910> do<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> how<00:04:05.329> to<00:04:05.359> get<00:04:05.690> out<00:04:05.870> your

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
back okay let's do a how to get out your

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.099 
back okay let's do a how to get out your
radio<00:04:06.760> so

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.729 

so<00:04:12.109> this<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.829> hard<00:04:13.069> way<00:04:14.349> when<00:04:15.349> it's<00:04:15.500> hard

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
so this is the hard way when it's hard

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.340 
so this is the hard way when it's hard
right<00:04:15.859> because<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.850> can<00:04:17.030> like<00:04:17.209> see<00:04:17.449> these<00:04:18.169> on

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
right because you can like see these on

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.830 
right because you can like see these on
this<00:04:18.470> metal<00:04:18.739> piece<00:04:19.039> which<00:04:19.310> are<00:04:19.489> usually

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
this metal piece which are usually

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.010 
this metal piece which are usually
holding<00:04:20.840> this<00:04:21.019> in<00:04:21.229> place<00:04:21.259> and<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.330> see<00:04:23.360> on

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
holding this in place and you can see on

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.310 
holding this in place and you can see on
sides<00:04:24.970> here<00:04:25.970> are<00:04:26.000> like<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.570> metal<00:04:27.020> thing

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
sides here are like this metal thing

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.560 
sides here are like this metal thing
it's<00:04:27.710> like<00:04:27.860> clamp<00:04:28.220> which<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.120> holding<00:04:29.330> this

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
it's like clamp which is holding this

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.719 
it's like clamp which is holding this
radio<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.229> this<00:04:30.440> but<00:04:30.979> if<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.220> pull<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.639> out

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
radio in this but if you pull it out

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.340 
radio in this but if you pull it out
with<00:04:32.000> all<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.360> metal<00:04:32.720> color<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.199> holding

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
with all this metal color and holding

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.629 
with all this metal color and holding
thing<00:04:33.919> you<00:04:34.820> can<00:04:35.030> do<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.660> way<00:04:35.840> too

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
thing you can do it in that way too

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.310 
thing you can do it in that way too
so<00:04:37.639> it's<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.090> hard<00:04:38.539> way<00:04:38.720> but<00:04:38.780> it's<00:04:39.139> also

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
so it's the hard way but it's also

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.779 
so it's the hard way but it's also
possible<00:04:39.650> because<00:04:39.979> there<00:04:40.250> are<00:04:40.310> no<00:04:40.460> screws

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
possible because there are no screws

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.920 
possible because there are no screws
aside

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.990 

yeah<00:04:44.930> but<00:04:45.169> originally<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:45.740> like<00:04:46.070> will<00:04:46.460> push

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
yeah but originally you like will push

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.150 
yeah but originally you like will push
something<00:04:47.449> in<00:04:47.630> here<00:04:47.960> so<00:04:48.590> I'm<00:04:48.650> going<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.830> metal

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160
