looks like and it's right here you can

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.630 
looks like and it's right here you can
see<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.270> they're<00:00:19.199> basically<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.830> grab<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
see it they're basically just grab the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
see it they're basically just grab the
design<00:00:20.939> from<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.150> galaxy<00:00:21.600> note<00:00:21.630> 2<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
design from the galaxy note 2 and I

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.540 
design from the galaxy note 2 and I
don't<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> look<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.369> this

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
don't think it's going to look like this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.099 
don't think it's going to look like this
at<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:23.970> hey<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> could<00:00:24.539> be<00:00:24.630> proved<00:00:24.900> wrong

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
at all but hey I could be proved wrong

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.410 
at all but hey I could be proved wrong
in<00:00:25.260> about<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> week's<00:00:25.740> time<00:00:25.890> who<00:00:26.250> knows<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.760> think

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
in about a week's time who knows I think

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.700 
in about a week's time who knows I think
it's<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.720> look<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> galaxy<00:00:28.410> s3

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it's going to look like the galaxy s3

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.500 
it's going to look like the galaxy s3
just<00:00:28.920> figure<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.359> come

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
just figure can see it's going to come

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.759 
just figure can see it's going to come
with<00:00:30.570> well<00:00:31.050> they<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.470> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.650> come

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
with well they think it's going to come

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.560 
with well they think it's going to come
with<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> Exynos<00:00:32.430> 5<00:00:32.700> octa<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.450> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
moved away from the Mallee and that's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.260 
moved away from the Mallee and that's
interesting<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> mean<00:01:40.920> power<00:01:41.220> vr<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.610> very<00:01:42.000> good

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
interesting I mean power vr is very good

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.700 
interesting I mean power vr is very good
but<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.780> don't<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.320> that's<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.680> good

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

know<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.600> it's<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.140> of<00:02:30.170> those<00:02:30.290> things

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
know you know it's one of those things

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.340

how<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.300> already<00:02:32.600> there<00:02:32.780> now<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:33.200> basically

how is already there now it's basically

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.140 
how is already there now it's basically
just<00:02:33.620> software<00:02:34.040> optimization<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.880> we'll<00:02:35.000> have

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
just software optimization so we'll have

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.780 
just software optimization so we'll have
to<00:02:35.270> wait<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.450> see<00:02:35.600> in<00:02:36.050> terms<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.890> other<00:02:37.430> stats

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
not forget the galaxy s4's rendering at

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.090 
not forget the galaxy s4's rendering at
1080p<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:50.150> nexus<00:02:50.720> 4<00:02:50.990> was<00:02:51.560> not<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.070> was

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
1080p the nexus 4 was not it was

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.730 
1080p the nexus 4 was not it was
rendering<00:02:52.340> at<00:02:52.610> 768<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.170> should<00:02:54.440> mean<00:02:54.590> the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
rendering at 768 so that should mean the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.400 
rendering at 768 so that should mean the
galaxy<00:02:55.130> s4<00:02:55.520> does<00:02:56.030> have<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.270> better<00:02:56.510> GPU<00:02:56.900> but

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
galaxy s4 does have a better GPU but

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.100 
galaxy s4 does have a better GPU but
because<00:02:57.830> of<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.010> resolution<00:02:58.550> difference

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
because of the resolution difference

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.480 
because of the resolution difference
that<00:03:00.110> has<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.380> push<00:03:00.530> more<00:03:00.710> pics<00:03:00.890> or<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.280> the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
that has to push more pics or so the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.610 
that has to push more pics or so the
performance<00:03:01.970> isn't<00:03:02.240> through<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.720> roof<00:03:02.930> now

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
performance isn't through the roof now

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.500 
performance isn't through the roof now
is<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.220> worth<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.790> don't<00:03:05.000> know<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.120> have<00:03:05.390> to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
is it worth it I don't know I have to

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.890 
is it worth it I don't know I have to
see<00:03:05.660> how<00:03:05.750> good<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.050> screen<00:03:06.320> is<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:07.340> um<00:03:07.900> yeah
