00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.060
 new channel and I'm not going to upload it in this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.880
 and two that will happen with this channel 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.040
 I hope the questions are pretty 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.260

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.750

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.760
 rather, with the fastest and most 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.140
 possible simple so you can 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.670
 understand the whole world and the first 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.020
 because open a new channel of pippa 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.640
 good mainly because I love 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.880
 football you already know is a hobby for 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.990
 me and all of life so if together 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.420
 in a few games of my favorite hobbies 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.310
 which are video games and another that is the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.930
 soccer and put it together and make a game that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 fifa 15 flame that is also me 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.060
 charming, I said with why 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 not because I do not upload fifa youtube 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.479
 while you climb fifa youtube a video 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 of a minute that is not true did not give me 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.470
 time to edit it is also true 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 and which and the people said they did not like it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 that he would not like it to come up fifa this 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.250
 channel in favor of london so I thought 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.899
 good if there are people who do not like it and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.970
 only subscribed to the channel for 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.770
 see a quemon and such and the time is that 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.680
 how am I going to start new series and it's going 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.540
 to fill with videos this channel I thought if 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.729
 I want to dedicate a lot exclusively 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.730
 to fifa 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.560
 what can I do then I spoke with 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.750
 several friends and they told me and why not 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.780

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.569

 every day or at least one each 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.680
 two days surely because they are videos 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.299

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.340
 pokemon always and I always follow video to 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.959
 the 10 which is the sum at 8 cent 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.109
 when I do not mind almost every day but 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.849
 8 and well I can skip that video 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.519
 but so to speak but there's a good 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.269
 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock was sure to follow 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.919
 being so 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.689
 so being that way in fact at 8 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.699
 tomorrow there is diversity for people who 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.250
 do not know that it is paid well to 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.959
 at 8 o'clock and diverxity tomorrow without that as 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.269
 5 of the city the channel will continue 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.709
 being the same and the only good thing is that 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.389
 you will have more videos but on the channel 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.650
 exclusive of fifa if here the people who 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.019
 like people who like football 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.060
 and I'm not going to make them subscribe 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.860
 and that says I like the videos but 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.140
 I am going to say that you take a look and 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.150
 if you like that video or if you like 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.230
 like the series or something like that then give 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.630
 something to subscribe to me 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.980
 I would love it directly or can you give it 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.270
 I like the video button if it has 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.610
 liked the hours that I would molaría 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.830
 too much I tell you every day to see 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.319
 videos or at least every two days a 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.940
 day on twitter and such on this channel is 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.099
 a little evolution obviously 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.640
 is a little bit like the works so 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.410
 say it but well there will go 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.090
 increasing I guess but increasing in 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.130
 videos are obviously there would be a video 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.690
 right now but tomorrow there will be two because 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.010
 I have it ready and the second one I think 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.810
 that I like more than the first as 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.160
 honestly edit in the end I hope it is 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.330
 66 participate in this adventure in fifa si 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.940
 is that you like football if you do not like it 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.160
 obviously not, and that's it 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.919
 but what I do not want is that you go to 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.479
 that channel to give me I do not like because I do not 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.609

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.560
 country that channel to say that you do not 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.990

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.940
 of the future evidently so nothing more
