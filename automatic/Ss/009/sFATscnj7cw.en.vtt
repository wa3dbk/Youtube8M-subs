00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
behind it yes they are hanging feel

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
behind it yes they are hanging feel
there<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.009> bolts<00:01:50.490> behind<00:01:50.670> there<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.659> your

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
there are bolts behind there just your

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.149 
there are bolts behind there just your
eye<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.259> better<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.860> take<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
eye it would be better just to take the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.490 
eye it would be better just to take the
full<00:01:53.369> assembly<00:01:53.700> off<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.350> because

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
full assembly off to do that because

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260 
full assembly off to do that because
that's<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.149> make

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that's how I would do it just to make

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050 
that's how I would do it just to make
sure<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.670> entrusted<00:01:59.670> too<00:01:59.850> much

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
sure that this is entrusted too much

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.510 
sure that this is entrusted too much
because<00:02:00.659> then<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.290> paint<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> all

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
because then you can just paint it all

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.979 
because then you can just paint it all
right<00:02:02.729> look<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> good<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.290> know
