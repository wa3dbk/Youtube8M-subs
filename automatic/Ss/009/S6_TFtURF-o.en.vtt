00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the Canon 700d after at least four

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.540 
the Canon 700d after at least four
generations<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.260> using<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> same<00:00:20.100> battery

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
generations of using the same battery

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.320 
generations of using the same battery
the<00:00:21.180> Canon<00:00:21.740> 750d<00:00:22.740> got<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> new<00:00:23.460> battery<00:00:23.730> design

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the Canon 750d got a new battery design

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.950 
the Canon 750d got a new battery design
which<00:00:24.990> are<00:00:25.170> smaller<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.830> black<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.779> me

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
which are smaller and black that for me

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.040 
which are smaller and black that for me
who<00:00:28.289> already<00:00:28.500> has<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> whole<00:00:29.279> collection<00:00:29.609> of

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
who already has a whole collection of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.910 
who already has a whole collection of
lp8<00:00:31.050> batteries

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
lp8 batteries

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.209 
lp8 batteries
why<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.550> 700d<00:00:33.480> only<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.500> button<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
why the 700d only has one button on the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
why the 700d only has one button on the
very<00:00:35.430> top<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.559> 750d<00:00:37.559> has<00:00:37.950> three<00:00:38.390> one<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> them

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
very top the 750d has three one of them

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.160 
very top the 750d has three one of them
is<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.110> Display<00:00:40.530> button<00:00:41.120> seriously<00:00:42.120> yes

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
is the Display button seriously yes

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.549 
is the Display button seriously yes
this<00:00:43.739> means<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.390> 750d<00:00:45.420> has<00:00:45.719> no<00:00:46.079> sensor

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
this means the 750d has no sensor

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
this means the 750d has no sensor
anymore<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.340> shut<00:00:47.550> off<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.730> screen<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.629> the

object approaches the viewfinder it was

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.770 
object approaches the viewfinder it was
there<00:00:51.780> under<00:00:52.190> 550d<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.399> wasn't<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
there under 550d it wasn't there on the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.680 
there under 550d it wasn't there on the
600d<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:56.100> implemented<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> again<00:00:57.329> under<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
600d they implemented it again under the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.639 
600d they implemented it again under the
650d

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
650d

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.470 
650d
and<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.789> omitted<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.390> again<00:01:00.750> under<00:01:01.250> 750d

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
and now they omitted it again under 750d

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.939 
and now they omitted it again under 750d

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
this is particularly helpful for sports

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.429 
this is particularly helpful for sports
photography<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.640> also<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.810> liked<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.200> how

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
photography I also really liked it how

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499

the<00:01:43.500> autofocus<00:01:44.159> points<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.820> shown<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the autofocus points are shown in the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.560 
the autofocus points are shown in the
viewfinder<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:47.250> hard<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> show<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.240> hope

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
viewfinder a bit hard to show but I hope

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.469 
viewfinder a bit hard to show but I hope
you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.640> 750d<00:01:50.670> has<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> much

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you can see that the 750d has a much

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.840 
you can see that the 750d has a much
clearer<00:01:51.869> feedback<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.649> which<00:01:53.009> focus<00:01:53.460> points

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
clearer feedback of which focus points

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.359 
clearer feedback of which focus points
got<00:01:54.090> selected<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:55.229> they<00:01:55.470> are<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:55.979> small

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369

got selected because they are not small
red<00:01:56.610> lights<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.689> big<00:01:58.110> black<00:01:58.469> squares
