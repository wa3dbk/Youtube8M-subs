00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
think that's pronounced berman de and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.399 
think that's pronounced berman de and
here's<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:22.049> good<00:01:22.170> free-kick

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
here's actually really good free-kick

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.340 
here's actually really good free-kick
take<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.920> can't<00:01:23.220> remember<00:01:23.400> his<00:01:23.580> cost<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.030> their

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
take I can't remember his cost of their

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
take I can't remember his cost of their
350<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.530> he<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.770> absolute<00:01:25.890> bargain<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.850> he

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
350 so he is an absolute bargain and he

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
350 so he is an absolute bargain and he
is<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> default<00:01:28.229> free<00:01:28.500> kick<00:01:28.680> taken<00:01:28.829> us

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
is the default free kick taken us

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
is the default free kick taken us
company<00:01:29.520> actually<00:01:29.790> sometimes<00:01:30.570> gets<00:01:31.049> them

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
company actually sometimes gets them

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.380 
company actually sometimes gets them
into<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> top<00:01:31.710> round<00:01:31.860> corner<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.640> always<00:01:33.090> had

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
into the top round corner I always had

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
into the top round corner I always had
difficulty<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> bronze<00:01:34.650> players<00:01:34.950> with

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
difficulty with the bronze players with

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.410 
difficulty with the bronze players with
free<00:01:35.369> kicks<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> kind<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.210> stuff<00:01:36.270> so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
free kicks and all that kind of stuff so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.819 
free kicks and all that kind of stuff so
I'll<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.630> find<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.259> hard<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
I'll just find them really hard to do it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.350 
I'll just find them really hard to do it
with<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.189> he<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:38.939> really

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
with but he is actually really

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870 
with but he is actually really
surprisingly<00:01:40.140> good<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.560> free<00:01:40.799> kicks<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
surprisingly good with free kicks and so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
surprisingly good with free kicks and so
then<00:01:42.000> finally<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> defense<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> right

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
then finally in the defense in the right

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
then finally in the defense in the right
back<00:01:43.619> position<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.369> squad<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:45.149> have

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
back position for this squad we have

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.240 
back position for this squad we have
area<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.409> pronounced<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> French

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
area I think that's pronounced a French

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.670 
area I think that's pronounced a French
right<00:01:47.640> back<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.479> he<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
right back then he so there is the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.920 
right back then he so there is the
chemistry<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.790> C<00:01:51.090> 2<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.420> well<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
chemistry with C 2 as well so the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.450 
chemistry with C 2 as well so the
chemistry<00:01:52.290> does<00:01:52.409> quite<00:01:52.619> come<00:01:52.950> together<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
chemistry does quite come together I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.060 
chemistry does quite come together I
think<00:01:53.970> I've<00:01:54.119> got<00:01:54.390> I've<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:54.869> 99<00:01:55.350> chemistry<00:01:55.920> but

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
think I've got I've got 99 chemistry but

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.260 
think I've got I've got 99 chemistry but
it's<00:01:56.189> um<00:01:56.280> because<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.610> can't<00:01:56.820> afford<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it's um because I can't afford the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.929 
it's um because I can't afford the
formation<00:01:57.869> card<00:01:58.079> at<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.320> moment<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.880> we

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
formation card at the moment then we

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.340 
formation card at the moment then we
move<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> set<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.780> defensive<00:02:01.170> mid

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
move on to the set of defensive mid

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.929 
move on to the set of defensive mid
positions<00:02:01.799> we've<00:02:01.979> got<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> two<00:02:02.369> obviously

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
positions we've got the two obviously

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.539 
positions we've got the two obviously
and<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.570> first<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.200> Papa<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.369> did

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
and the first one is a Papa and I did

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.160 
and the first one is a Papa and I did
have<00:02:05.700> him<00:02:05.850> moved<00:02:06.060> from<00:02:06.299> sentiment<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
have him moved from sentiment to a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.529 
have him moved from sentiment to a
Senate<00:02:07.469> defensive<00:02:07.979> mid<00:02:08.160> he<00:02:08.879> does<00:02:09.030> cost<00:02:09.300> when<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
Senate defensive mid he does cost when I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.900 
Senate defensive mid he does cost when I
built<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.929> squad<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.379> mother<00:02:10.920> price<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.819> them

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
built this squad I mother price of them

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.520 
built this squad I mother price of them
coming<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.270> there

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
coming up there

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.220 
coming up there
did<00:02:12.709> cost<00:02:12.950> around<00:02:13.180> 40,000<00:02:14.180> i'm<00:02:14.810> pretty<00:02:15.050> sure

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
did cost around 40,000 i'm pretty sure

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.720 
did cost around 40,000 i'm pretty sure
you<00:02:15.350> were<00:02:15.410> built<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.620> pick<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:15.950> for<00:02:16.160> 30<00:02:16.400> or<00:02:16.580> even

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
you were built to pick on for 30 or even

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.130 
you were built to pick on for 30 or even
at<00:02:16.970> less<00:02:17.209> than<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.480> nowadays<00:02:17.690> fees

at less than that nowadays fees
dribbling<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.920> unbelievable<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:20.450> i<00:02:20.660> could

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
dribbling is unbelievable if i could

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.949 
dribbling is unbelievable if i could
show<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.080> his<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:22.010> gamestats<00:02:22.640> i<00:02:22.940> would<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:23.750> i

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
can't right now so then next time we

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.740 
can't right now so then next time we
have<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.590> guy<00:02:27.830> gallardo<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.000> only<00:02:29.270> non

have this guy gallardo is the only non

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.190 
have this guy gallardo is the only non
shiny<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.650> squad<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.420> again<00:02:32.780> he<00:02:33.020> is

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
shiny in this squad but again he is

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.570 
shiny in this squad but again he is
probably<00:02:33.470> i<00:02:33.680> would<00:02:33.770> probably<00:02:34.130> say<00:02:34.310> he's<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
probably i would probably say he's the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.800 
probably i would probably say he's the
worst<00:02:34.730> player<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.270> nonetheless<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
worst player but nonetheless the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.360 
worst player but nonetheless the
chemistry<00:02:36.230> all<00:02:36.410> does<00:02:36.620> come<00:02:36.860> together<00:02:37.130> there

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
chemistry all does come together there

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.160 
chemistry all does come together there
she<00:02:37.489> can<00:02:37.580> see<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> left-back<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.420> him<00:02:38.600> both

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
being Spanish they're all linking

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.310 
being Spanish they're all linking
together<00:02:43.430> I'll<00:02:44.000> do<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.330> centre-forward<00:02:44.810> next

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
together I'll do the centre-forward next

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.880 
together I'll do the centre-forward next
in<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.709> we<00:02:46.040> have<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> logo<00:02:46.760> jr.<00:02:47.269> an<00:02:47.450> 80<00:02:48.200> peso<00:02:48.769> is

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
in and we have a logo jr. an 80 peso is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.550 
in and we have a logo jr. an 80 peso is
pretty<00:02:49.190> quick<00:02:49.489> for<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.180> bronze<00:02:50.989> player<00:02:51.260> and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
pretty quick for a and bronze player and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.250 
pretty quick for a and bronze player and
again<00:02:51.920> he<00:02:52.160> does<00:02:52.370> cost<00:02:52.670> 1000<00:02:53.510> coins<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.019> you

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
again he does cost 1000 coins and you

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.900 
again he does cost 1000 coins and you
look<00:02:54.440> at<00:02:54.560> his<00:02:54.680> stats<00:02:54.950> they<00:02:55.220> are<00:02:55.310> fairly<00:02:55.610> good

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
look at his stats they are fairly good

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.270 
look at his stats they are fairly good
not<00:02:56.090> too<00:02:56.360> good<00:02:56.630> but<00:02:56.780> they're<00:02:57.739> fairly<00:02:58.040> average

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
not too good but they're fairly average

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.100 
not too good but they're fairly average
but<00:02:58.730> then<00:02:58.880> if<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.060> ever<00:02:59.150> look<00:02:59.330> at<00:02:59.450> his<00:02:59.630> goals

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
but then if you ever look at his goals

back down to four so you can get a
hundred<00:04:37.259> chemistry<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.949> can<00:04:38.069> see<00:04:38.250> he's<00:04:38.370> not

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
hundred chemistry you can see he's not

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.969 
hundred chemistry you can see he's not
in<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.849> right<00:04:39.000> formation<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:40.289> I<00:04:40.379> don't<00:04:40.650> have

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
in the right formation and I don't have

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.460 
in the right formation and I don't have
a<00:04:41.280> impact<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:41.819> can<00:04:42.000> add<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.389> manager<00:04:42.960> here<00:04:43.169> just

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
a impact I can add a manager here just

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.059 
a impact I can add a manager here just
so<00:04:43.620> 4<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.550> 3<00:04:44.840> 143<00:04:45.840> one<00:04:46.349> that's<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.650> little

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
so 4 to 3 143 one that's a little

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.469 
so 4 to 3 143 one that's a little
got<00:04:47.280> one<00:04:47.430> here<00:04:49.129> for<00:04:50.129> 23<00:04:50.430> one<00:04:50.849> year<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:51.240> we<00:04:51.330> can

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
got one here for 23 one year so we can

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.869 
got one here for 23 one year so we can
see<00:04:51.659> that<00:04:51.810> we've<00:04:51.930> gone<00:04:52.050> English<00:04:52.669> manager<00:04:53.669> and

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
see that we've gone English manager and

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.790 
see that we've gone English manager and
that<00:04:54.030> gives<00:04:54.180> us<00:04:54.360> 99<00:04:54.780> chemistry<00:04:55.319> so<00:04:55.379> if<00:04:55.650> you

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
that gives us 99 chemistry so if you

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.580 
that gives us 99 chemistry so if you
were<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:55.979> get<00:04:56.539> Zaha<00:04:57.539> in<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.930> right<00:04:58.110> formation

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
were to get Zaha in the right formation

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.529 
were to get Zaha in the right formation
his<00:04:58.919> chemistry<00:04:59.310> there<00:04:59.520> would<00:04:59.759> be<00:04:59.789> pushed<00:05:00.180> up<00:05:00.330> a

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
his chemistry there would be pushed up a

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.170 
his chemistry there would be pushed up a
higher<00:05:00.900> than<00:05:01.080> six<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:02.520> is<00:05:02.639> this<00:05:02.879> week's

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180
