00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.000 
posted
I<00:00:31.920> was<00:00:33.239> yeah<00:00:34.239> it<00:00:34.420> was<00:00:34.540> totally<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.960> both<00:00:35.800> wog

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
I was yeah it was totally to both wog

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.180 
I was yeah it was totally to both wog
and<00:00:36.219> Jetta<00:00:36.399> with<00:00:36.699> no<00:00:36.910> key<00:00:37.649> well<00:00:38.649> guess<00:00:39.040> what

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
and Jetta with no key well guess what

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.600 
and Jetta with no key well guess what
the<00:00:39.309> problem<00:00:39.670> is<00:00:39.730> with<00:00:39.940> this<00:00:40.059> one<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:42.370> has<00:00:42.550> a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
the problem is with this one it has a

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.970 
the problem is with this one it has a
key<00:00:42.969> if<00:00:43.629> he<00:00:43.960> doesn't<00:00:44.290> work<00:00:44.550> does<00:00:45.550> it<00:00:45.699> turn

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
key if he doesn't work does it turn

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.760 
key if he doesn't work does it turn
so<00:00:47.580> that<00:00:47.730> means<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.060> locked<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.510> part<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so that means it's locked in part the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.820 
so that means it's locked in part the
steering<00:00:50.100> wheels<00:00:50.280> lock<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.990> behind<00:00:52.380> an

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
steering wheels lock and it's behind an

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.790 
steering wheels lock and it's behind an
apartment<00:00:54.110> just<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.830> last<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.340> was<00:00:57.800> so

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
apartment just like the last one was so

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
apartment just like the last one was so
we'll<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.490> what<00:00:59.790> happens<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.240> I<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.480> there

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
we'll see what happens when I get there

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.990 
we'll see what happens when I get there
is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700 

I<00:01:03.030> might<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.630> to<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:03.900> skates<00:01:04.230> or<00:01:04.440> whatever

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
I might have to use skates or whatever

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.230 
I might have to use skates or whatever

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
on this I don't know if I've ever showed

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.560 
on this I don't know if I've ever showed

you guys skate
I<00:01:08.659> get<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.380> show<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.620> this<00:01:09.890> morning

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
I get to show you this morning

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.840 
I get to show you this morning
I<00:01:10.969> got<00:01:11.869> loaded<00:01:12.439> one<00:01:13.039> the<00:01:13.219> key<00:01:13.429> wouldn't

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
I got loaded one the key wouldn't

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.990 
I got loaded one the key wouldn't
actually<00:01:14.060> he<00:01:14.420> won't<00:01:14.600> even<00:01:14.810> go<00:01:14.899> in

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.850 

I<00:01:20.030> didn't<00:01:20.780> have<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:21.020> use<00:01:21.170> gates<00:01:21.470> because<00:01:21.620> it's

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
I didn't have to use gates because it's

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.130 
I didn't have to use gates because it's
a<00:01:21.950> standard<00:01:22.220> transmission<00:01:22.760> but<00:01:23.510> I<00:01:23.750> did<00:01:23.990> have

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
a standard transmission but I did have

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.640 
a standard transmission but I did have
to<00:01:24.170> ramp<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.740> around

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
to ramp it around

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.630 
to ramp it around
the<00:01:27.650> front<00:01:27.979> end<00:01:28.220> on<00:01:28.400> this<00:01:28.580> would<00:01:28.880> have<00:01:29.500> dragged

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
the front end on this would have dragged

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.710 
the front end on this would have dragged
if

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
if

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.130 
if
maybe<00:01:33.080> drug

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
maybe drug

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.580 
maybe drug
if<00:01:35.680> without<00:01:36.670> any<00:01:36.910> ramps<00:01:37.270> under<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.350> what<00:01:38.470> I've

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
if without any ramps under so what I've

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.950 
if without any ramps under so what I've
done<00:01:38.800> is<00:01:39.130> place<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:40.030> four<00:01:40.570> by<00:01:40.720> fours

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
done is place the four by fours

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
done is place the four by fours
underneath<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:42.340> deck<00:01:42.550> of<00:01:42.700> my<00:01:42.820> truck<00:01:43.120> and

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
underneath the deck of my truck and

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.340 
underneath the deck of my truck and
serves<00:01:44.980> a<00:01:45.250> two-fold<00:01:45.430> purpose<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.900> brings<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
serves a two-fold purpose it brings the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.410 
serves a two-fold purpose it brings the
truck<00:01:47.590> up<00:01:47.770> more<00:01:48.010> level<00:01:48.430> or<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:48.940> deck<00:01:49.120> up<00:01:49.270> low

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
truck up more level or the deck up low

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.110 
truck up more level or the deck up low
level<00:01:50.100> which<00:01:51.100> means<00:01:51.310> it's<00:01:51.610> less<00:01:51.820> than<00:01:52.000> an

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
level which means it's less than an

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.219 
level which means it's less than an
angle<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.690> ground<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.850> also<00:01:55.229> keeps

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
angle to the ground and it also keeps

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.130 
angle to the ground and it also keeps
the<00:01:56.470> tires<00:01:57.100> at<00:01:57.400> higher<00:01:57.610> off<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.880> ground<00:01:58.140> now

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
the tires at higher off the ground now

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.570 
the tires at higher off the ground now
from<00:01:59.410> this<00:01:59.530> side<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.950> can<00:02:00.070> see<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.250> little<00:02:00.430> bit

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
from this side you can see a little bit

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.940 
from this side you can see a little bit
better<00:02:00.790> probably<00:02:01.330> is

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.900 

actually<00:02:04.340> I've<00:02:04.430> got<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:05.060> little<00:02:05.689> bit

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.610 

have<00:02:09.510> to<00:02:09.630> move<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.930> out<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> little<00:02:10.170> bit<00:02:10.320> further

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
have to move it out a little bit further

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.520 
have to move it out a little bit further
here

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:29.309
