00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.019
 About Us 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.279
 you are well especially how I 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.480
 am not bad when I take a small 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.029
 video to show how to recruit 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.290
 larry prog so a 4th to third 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.230
 person who will allow us to finish 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.300
 of the game to recruit shadow so I did 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.500
 the video I made the videos for 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.329
 recruit both just before so 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.320
 it was bernie and decker so you got 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.579
 than in rotterdam and last video 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.149
 maybe put a link I do not know 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.969
 I'll see then I do it quickly 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.679
 video because we have plenty who have me 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.820
 asked and I did not have time before 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.219
 and since it's holidays 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.140
 I'm doing it now brief so are 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.690
 larry prog his password 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.980
 so what's hi my name is prog 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.620
 larry proof then you think you can 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.359
 win a football match 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.859
 what idea finally if you get there 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.310
 could the following rebuild me from 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.060
 nine but the next step and lennar 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.440
 but it is not that simple 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.260
 nothing is ever simple but in any 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.700
 thing you will have to secret this famous 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.850
 india moment looking elsewhere in a little bit 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.310
 password so the password 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.310
 it's j 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.390
 then I 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.030
 2 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.030
 at 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.300
 so unfair 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.960
 agreement 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.330
 mister csa before I just have to hold 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.680
 my promise 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.479
 so let's do a little defect package late 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.880
 so I'm the commissioner ajmal the 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.640
 head of the three pokemon games so 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.729
 start a pass 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.830
 but and that's what needs to be done to 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.830
 full time of such quality 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.460
 I score a goal a first month I 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.220
 believed in fact so seen as one is in 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.120
 did I believe that what needed to be done 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.120
 and keep the ball 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.720
 at 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.720
 so 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.970
 so what is heartbreaking this game too 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.320
 it's that the techniques 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.540
 instead of doing for example for the 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.680
 technical that they were in the process that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
 does not google small evolves 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.520
 there are many ways that you him 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:07.880
 would like to evolve angers and the g1 bass 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:11.670
 g2 g3 g4 g5 either she evolves by removing 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.080
 our passes lv1 so 25 years the peÃ±a 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:19.920
 normal then had 2 and 3 where is she 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.950
 evolves in China where Japanese caillan have 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.840
 french has improved in time china 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.660
 and in France had improved or 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.250
 new and so in the anime did that 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.530
 it's better a new hand 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.020
 dimensional for example here is in 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.950
 did what they did what they 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.800
 so could v2 v3 and china cays 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.350
 they put the same thing all the time 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.620
 they put a nest all the time 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.519
 that's the technique 1 2 actually you have 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.380
 nothing understood to what I mean 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.780
 since I say anything wait 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.310
 we go to the baths at worst if you have 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.480
 understood that's good but that's me 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.790
 I did not understand what I was saying so 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.650
 that it's a little bit complicated for 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.970
 you since to explain I'm bad 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.970
 I do not know how to explain or initial 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.970
 new 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.960
 football 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.980
 Wucher 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.090
 org so what is needed for banks 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.410
 is absurd hockey so in fact I 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.070
 will see if the blue capsules that he 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:42.990
 I had to parries to annoy me if you 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:46.530
 please thank you so it was capsules 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:52.220
 blue as I convince myself and honda 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.220
 speed is troublesome about nine capsules 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.419
 is to handle this magnificent so the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.419
 first time I had box is beautiful 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.330
 so that's on that determined life 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.650
 I hope she will have you more crazy 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.880
 a I like a comment subscribe to 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.390

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.160
 subscribers now it's really about 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.950
 especially sick who barely a month you 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.150
 were still 550 so 150 subscribers in one 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.280
 month is really being sick 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.600
 manage understood if it goes super fast 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.250
 I had ten subscribers a day that's 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.690
 like that finally sometimes I wonder 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.430
 how the lowest of the good days 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:37.080
 but it was really a sick thing 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.940
 thank you marc it touches you frankly 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.530
 is great fun and for the draws 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.479
 the lot of the contest if you 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.560
 ask why I'm not doing the 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.000
 draw now everything 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.479
 simply because a participant pass 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.770
 I expect at least we have seen 25-20 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.410
 that the majority wrote in the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.700
 comments from the video and that I had 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.860
 said I was going to die a private message 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.180
 I do not listen to what they are told 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.509
 short 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.180
