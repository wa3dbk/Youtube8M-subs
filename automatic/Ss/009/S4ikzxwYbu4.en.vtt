00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that is say roughly 8 inches so you want

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to wet to an 8 inch depth in the soil

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.039 
to wet to an 8 inch depth in the soil
program<00:01:16.439> half<00:01:17.009> an<00:01:17.189> inch<00:01:17.399> to<00:01:18.149> an<00:01:18.299> inch<00:01:18.479> will<00:01:18.750> wet

one to one and a half inches of water
including<00:01:24.960> rainfall<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.520> an<00:01:26.640> inch

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
including rainfall so if you get an inch

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.639 
including rainfall so if you get an inch
of<00:01:26.969> rain<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.719> really<00:01:28.020> shouldn't<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
of rain you really shouldn't have to

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.800 
of rain you really shouldn't have to
irrigate<00:01:29.100> irrigation<00:01:29.969> frequency<00:01:30.509> also

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
irrigate irrigation frequency also

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.410 
irrigate irrigation frequency also
depends<00:01:31.469> on<00:01:31.560> soil<00:01:31.979> conditions<00:01:32.609> coarse

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
depends on soil conditions coarse

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.959 
depends on soil conditions coarse
textured<00:01:34.049> sandy<00:01:34.619> soils<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.520> hold<00:01:35.729> much

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
textured sandy soils don't hold much

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.700 
textured sandy soils don't hold much
water<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.630> therefore<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> water

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
water so therefore you have to water

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.779 
water so therefore you have to water
more<00:01:38.009> frequently<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.500> less<00:01:40.500> deeply<00:01:40.920> heavier

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789
