name<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.449> honest<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> theme<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
name to be honest and the theme is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.380 
name to be honest and the theme is
basically<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.960> completely<00:01:01.649> see-through<00:01:01.890> thing

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
basically a completely see-through thing

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
basically a completely see-through thing
so<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.510> you're<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.780> him<00:01:04.220> everything<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> see

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so if you're on him everything I see

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.250 
so if you're on him everything I see
fruit<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.240> personally<00:01:06.570> think<00:01:06.990> that's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
fruit which I personally think that's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.929 
fruit which I personally think that's
really<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.070> small<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:10.580> with<00:01:11.580> everything

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
really really small so with everything

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.890 
really really small so with everything
as<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.810> said<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.260> seafood<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.479> at<00:01:15.479> times

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
as I said it's all seafood and at times

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.219 
as I said it's all seafood and at times
it<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.430> really<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.820> annoying<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.990> on

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it is really really annoying but on

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.510 
it is really really annoying but on
other<00:01:19.439> times<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.979> quite<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> nice<00:01:20.960> thing<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
other times it is quite a nice thing I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.230 
other times it is quite a nice thing I
say<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:24.030> instance<00:01:24.090> i<00:01:24.630> will<00:01:24.840> opener<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
say for instance i will opener and a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.340 
say for instance i will opener and a
program<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.880> obstinate<00:01:29.880> spirit<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:33.110> as<00:01:34.110> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
program so obstinate spirit and as you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.039 
program so obstinate spirit and as you
can<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.509> things<00:01:36.900> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
can see this is one of the things I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.780 
can see this is one of the things I
don't<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.380> about<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.270> your<00:01:40.790> exit

up<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:47.149> well<00:01:48.149> basically<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.689> exit<00:01:49.350> full

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
up on up well basically this exit full

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.789 
up on up well basically this exit full
screen<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.640> minimums<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:52.140> can't<00:01:52.439> see

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
screen and minimums and you can't see

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.929 
screen and minimums and you can't see
them<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.610> guess

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
them so you have to just guess

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
them so you have to just guess
roundabout<00:01:54.689> where<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.799> most

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
roundabout where they are but most

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.550 
roundabout where they are but most
people<00:01:56.369> know<00:01:56.490> where<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:56.969> anyway<00:01:57.560> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
people know where they are anyway so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.120 
people know where they are anyway so
that<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.340> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
that is the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.969 
that is the
pretty<00:02:00.969> much<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.360> only<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.930> hair<00:02:02.439> cover<00:02:02.740> beta

pretty much the only of hair cover beta

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.179 
pretty much the only of hair cover beta
software<00:02:03.509> after<00:02:04.560> everything<00:02:05.560> else<00:02:06.070> just

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
software after everything else just

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.460 
software after everything else just
looked<00:02:06.549> really<00:02:06.759> nice<00:02:06.939> like<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.020> that's<00:02:08.289> real

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470
