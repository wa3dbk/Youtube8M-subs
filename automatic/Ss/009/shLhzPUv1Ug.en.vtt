00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.959
 the exams are encouraging 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.019
 in the news 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.019
 never was there water 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 if you know that I have goals and I went to see 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 I see that when we see the climb on the left 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.730
 good it's true they are fake 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 it goes up a little bit along the coast 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 that's a shame 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.030
 maybe I would have every Christmas day 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.590
 these words are back 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 a month ago 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.029
 we will not accept the exit 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.769
 we think of his initiative on the referral 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.419
 we lay flat 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.419
 for the singer is going on 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.839
 they flew away 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.469
 we will look at access for all 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.709
 today the power 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.509
 this special flight 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.509
 earlier this morning 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.659
 here are a few words 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.659
 more we have more 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.329
 if it's never good 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.639
 I have to look 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.639
 the Belgians are on the program 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.599
 my daddy is this report 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.449
 nothing is impossible clinical 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.439
 human rights useless to insist 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.779
 on the edge of the precipice 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.370
 they are already organizing for me
