00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.549
 hi everyone is playing for the center 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.420
 find today for a new 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.590
 video on minecraft xbox 360 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.660
 today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 little glitch so you do a little 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.810
 tutorial for a glitch who will you 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.420
 allow to duplicate 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.849
 blocks so any blog finally 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.230
 apart from the ores and diamonds but 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.259
 good it's not very important since I 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.829
 explain why so this glitch 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.360
 and functional on version 1.3.1 and 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.040
 all previous versions of course 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.640
 so I'm going to show you how the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.610
 to do so first of all you go 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.210
 have to have a piston and pistons 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.500
 sticky so like this so can 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.890
 see there you put them just a block in 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.129
 below the earth here you go 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.680
 put some redstone 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.269
 that's how it is here then you 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.030
 go put a block on top of the red 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.320
 stone so to put the torch you 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.860
 go see why I'm going video 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.409
 to keep a block of diamond here are 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.820
 shown as what is the pic well 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.479
 because just before I was in creative 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.280
 to take it 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.740
 that's where you can see we're at 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.960
 this step there is chile guide 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.219
 illegal almost built so you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.359
 go put your block and you 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.499
 say I 'm applying is so here by 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.509
 example to resume the example with some 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.310
 diamond you will take the torch of 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.670
 redstone 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.009
 and to get buggered a little bit you 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.189
 do that and the lever and you go 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.850
 quickly broke the block from the top and the block 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:52.229
 from below so here is the block going 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.789
 come back you ask your blog fight 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.069
 you still wait a shot and 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.880
 normally after two or three strokes 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.170
 it should come so there still not there 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.369
 must be broken several times and after 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 for a moment you will normally 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.040
 a down stroke was waiting 4 by breaking 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.100
 this one so that's it depends a little 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.460
 this is a bit complicated at this 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.810
 level since could see that reacts 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.540
 not always the same way but good 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.350
 the glitch if his dance as a whole 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.690
 that's it so you'll have it here 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.760
 so as soon as it is mounted of 2 cases it is 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.850
 once broken that blocks will reappear 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.950
 so you ask here and that's it and you 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.240
 recover so this is the first 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.410
 blow and you go you can see that 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.390
 I have too many huh I have not been 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:57.500
 recover I'm going to do it again one more 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:59.720
 you're going to go back to the block 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.840
 to wait until they reappear 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.020
 here you put the jamond block by 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.340
 earth and you recover and so you 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.890
 can see that at the beginning of this video 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.019
 I had 4 and there I have one I had one 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.459
 there I have four so after what is 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.570
 interesting is where we could 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:22.140
 turn into pure diamond to make 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.800
 so other things very useful here 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.150
 So I show you these glyphs 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.230
 so I show you how it is 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.320
 so constitutes the level a block under the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.799
 earth you put a sticky piston the 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.090
 red stone right in front and a block at 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.549
 above the red sun who will you 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.790
 enable to activate the red torch 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.330
 stone and I become it so that's it 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.350
 the end of this glyph thank you 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.160
 have watched this video 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.070
 not to put a little green thumb and you 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.880
 shoots towards on video so it's a 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.650
 glyph that has me and that he has been putting the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.910
 wearing and pink so wind is happy so 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.799
 it's exclusive on youtube 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.160
 since apparently they would not be there 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.850
 again 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.250
 so here is enjoy it well and she is 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.299
 good survival for people who 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.250
 play again we survive on minecraft 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.229
 it can be interesting and 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.780
 why not duplicate a little bit 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.729
 blocks go bye bye everyone 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.940
