00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.150
 the four best exercises for one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.150
 crisp po 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.689
 we start with an exercise of the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.720
 big vessels had to be busy 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.490
 in the belly wear when I completely relaxed 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 approach 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.539
 then a leg wraps around that is called the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.300
 jeans and lower leg should be one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:42.960
 form right angles and then move 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:45.840
 easiest very very direction blanket 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 This exercise can also others like 20 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.199
 make euro and advanced 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.199
 to do 30 to 40 repetitions 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.210
 Little exercise is the so-called buttocks 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.160
 comeback this is why because 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.170
 this exercise several others of the 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.530
 buttock muscles are combined 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.720
 become 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.810
 the starting position in this exercise 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:20.960
 yours, the upper one with me that long 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.820
 along and then start this exercise 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.490
 so that we will be just that 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:35.479
 Tighten the outstretched leg to chest 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:38.300
 our next exercise relation 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.890
 is a direction blank that is from 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.649
 starting position calls now must 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.350
 one on the lid also rises again 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:51.110
 at least ten times more than in 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.610
 connection condition we stretch that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.530
 leg forward that is already 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.399
 send out starting position before the post 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.759
 So the legs forward and at the latest 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.490
 now 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.479
 we feel which muscle groups 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.189
 If we always do that, we train 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.799
 the kamps we hold it to the front 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.380
 in front and still a small circles 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.840
 in both directions is ten times in the 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.590
 establishment for the sixth time in the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 poverty performance 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.890
 our next exercise is called good at 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 to pee 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.080
 We go to a bank 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.850
 position and our band just one 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.330
 movement that looks like a dog 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.340
 barks 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.520
 that is, we lift is one-sided only 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:46.170
 to reach maximum and work out 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:48.950
 so these buttock muscles beginners can 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.040
 The exercise likes at least ten times 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.730
 repeated and advanced about 20 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.730
 to the side 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.820
 and when I bend the extension 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.500
 the most trained the buttocks 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.930
 also our thigh muscles 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.910
 the starting position is the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.760
 Failure step that just makes one 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.459
 Step forward looked that the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.140
 Front knee never over the team 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.780
 that's what you mean when you say that 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.280
 prohibit from which he has the feeling 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.280
 is just after us 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.140
 That never does not need to the ground 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.819
 but go down but it should all 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.819
 important rather ever needed 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.310
 Beginners like ten 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.990
 repetitions make the side 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.430
 I would be 15 to 20 advanced 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.430
 recommend repetitions
