 Then when you lift your arm it turns green. 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.540

 for me to get the same creators to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.570
 this botnet application our good 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.570
 next folks how is talking is a 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.640
 chance this app is very good but 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.190
 however there is a part that left me very 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.240
 which did not want the application not to 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.270
 but that's right 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.710
 if you have a facebook account 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.320
 I suggest you close it by case. 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.300
 He is trying to break into your account. 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.970
 I suspect this because you have two 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.030
 has tried to hack into my account and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.720
 always when this application is here 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.910
 enabled and active for evidence of 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.550
 next cup lord 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.750

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.410
 application is attempting to invade the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.360
 internet is sending data to another 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.690
 such a machine to another place and the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.590
 google has blocked the data from google 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.630
 chrome 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.950
 I could unlock Olympus 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.930
 historical 'that thou 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.100
 in this data extraction I did not want 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.880
 that the application did not but I was 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.380

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.510
