okay here is a 82 Datsun 280zx had this
car<00:00:08.610> for<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> number<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.120> years<00:00:09.769> obviously<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
car for a number of years obviously the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.079 
car for a number of years obviously the
bumper<00:00:11.280> needs<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.610> be<00:00:11.759> recoded<00:00:12.980> but<00:00:14.089> other

bumper needs to be recoded but other
than<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.630> pretty<00:00:15.809> good<00:00:15.929> shape

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
than that it's in pretty good shape

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.550 
than that it's in pretty good shape
there's<00:00:16.500> almost<00:00:16.650> no<00:00:16.980> rust<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:18.529> except<00:00:19.529> for

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
there's almost no rust on it except for

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.820 
there's almost no rust on it except for
this<00:00:19.800> little<00:00:20.010> minor<00:00:20.369> blemish<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:22.490> then<00:00:24.830> but

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
this little minor blemish and then but

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.730 
this little minor blemish and then but
anyway<00:00:26.330> I<00:00:27.330> did<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> lot<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> work<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.619> this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
anyway I did a lot of work to this

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.870 
anyway I did a lot of work to this
vehicle<00:00:31.040> rebuilt<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> fuel<00:00:32.399> injection

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
vehicle rebuilt the fuel injection

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.750 
vehicle rebuilt the fuel injection
system<00:00:33.380> it<00:00:34.380> didn't<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:34.890> necessarily<00:00:35.040> need

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
system it didn't really necessarily need

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.750 
system it didn't really necessarily need
it<00:00:35.820> actually<00:00:36.800> but<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> original<00:00:38.399> exhaust

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it actually but the original exhaust

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
it actually but the original exhaust
system<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.450> still<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> cars<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.680> like

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
system was still on the cars from like

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.119 
system was still on the cars from like
two<00:00:41.160> three<00:00:41.370> years<00:00:41.610> ago<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.469> I<00:00:43.469> needed<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
two three years ago and I needed to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.650 
two three years ago and I needed to
replace<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.390> exhaust<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.300> leaking

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
replace that exhaust and it was leaking

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.720 
replace that exhaust and it was leaking
everywhere<00:00:48.809> before<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> after<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> cat<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
everywhere before and after the cat and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
everywhere before and after the cat and
even<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.780> header<00:00:51.960> pipe<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.500> goes<00:00:52.530> down<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
even the header pipe that goes down to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
even the header pipe that goes down to
the<00:00:53.280> cat<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.410> went<00:00:56.039> ahead<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.550> since<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.239> was

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the cat so I went ahead and since I was

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.020 
the cat so I went ahead and since I was
committed<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.079> decided<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.920> clean<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
committed I decided to just clean up the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.750 
committed I decided to just clean up the
fuel<00:01:00.780> injection<00:01:01.140> rail<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.980> forth<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
fuel injection rail and so forth and I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640 
fuel injection rail and so forth and I
put<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.539> new<00:01:03.690> sensors<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> fuel

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
put all new sensors in the fuel

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.969 
put all new sensors in the fuel
injection<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.900> I<00:01:06.900> had<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> tear<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:07.950> out

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
injection and I had to tear it all out

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
injection and I had to tear it all out
of<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.340> anyway<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.060> went<00:01:09.450> ahead<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
of there anyway so I just went ahead and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990 
of there anyway so I just went ahead and
did<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.619> exhaust<00:01:10.950> system<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.580> well<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
did the exhaust system as well as the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000 
did the exhaust system as well as the
fuel<00:01:12.360> injection<00:01:12.689> system

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
fuel injection system

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
fuel injection system
there<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.180> injector<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.049> didn't

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
there was one injector that didn't

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.280 
there was one injector that didn't
amount<00:01:16.770> properly<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.270> cracked<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
amount properly and it was cracked so I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.890 
amount properly and it was cracked so I
replaced<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.130> green<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.180> there<00:01:21.420> towards

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
replaced that green one there towards

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.670 
replaced that green one there towards
the<00:01:21.960> firewall

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the firewall

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.999 
the firewall
anyway<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:24.540> exhaust<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> car<00:01:25.500> has<00:01:25.710> now

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
anyway the exhaust that the car has now

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.789 
anyway the exhaust that the car has now
is<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:27.380> motorsport<00:01:28.380> auto<00:01:29.390> header<00:01:30.799> ceramic

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is a motorsport auto header ceramic

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.170 
is a motorsport auto header ceramic
coated<00:01:32.159> inside<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.880> then<00:01:35.880> powder

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
coated inside and out and then powder

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.310 
coated inside and out and then powder
coated<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.720> believe<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> outside<00:01:39.020> six<00:01:40.020> into

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
coated I believe on the outside six into

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.920 
coated I believe on the outside six into
one<00:01:40.530> header<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.299> then<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.659> also

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
one header and then it's also

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.060 
one header and then it's also
Motorsports<00:01:44.689> exhaust<00:01:45.689> system<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.710> it's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
Motorsports exhaust system I think it's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.560 
Motorsports exhaust system I think it's
two<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.399> half<00:01:47.579> inch<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.030> way<00:01:48.119> out<00:01:48.360> back

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
two and a half inch all the way out back

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.030 
two and a half inch all the way out back
it<00:01:48.780> doesn't<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.140> make<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> difference<00:01:49.470> but

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it doesn't really make a difference but

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.429 
it doesn't really make a difference but
um<00:01:51.500> there<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.649> no<00:01:52.680> catalytic<00:01:53.399> converter<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.439> I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
um there is no catalytic converter and I

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.359 
um there is no catalytic converter and I
didn't<00:01:55.799> want<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> car<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.520> loud<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:58.369> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
didn't want the car to be loud and the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.030 
didn't want the car to be loud and the
good<00:01:59.490> news<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.149> isn't<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.570> loud

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
good news is that it isn't very loud

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
good news is that it isn't very loud
it<00:02:02.040> has<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> nice<00:02:02.430> Rumble<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.630> about<00:02:03.899> it

exhaust and it I have a flames that was
put<00:02:25.740> in<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.700> was<00:02:26.910> too

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
put in there so that if that was too

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.949 
put in there so that if that was too
loud<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.300> can<00:02:27.630> bolt<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.290> another<00:02:28.590> muffler<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
loud I can bolt on another muffler and

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.240 
loud I can bolt on another muffler and
replace<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.650> kind<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.920> nice<00:02:32.100> to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
replace it so that's kind of nice to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.230 
replace it so that's kind of nice to
have<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.459> as<00:02:32.760> an<00:02:32.880> option<00:02:34.550> but<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:36.000> car<00:02:36.209> has

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
have that as an option but this car has

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.330 
have that as an option but this car has
no<00:02:36.420> catalytic<00:02:37.140> converter<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.680> fairly<00:02:37.920> open

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
no catalytic converter it's fairly open

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.920 
no catalytic converter it's fairly open
exhaust<00:02:38.700> from<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:38.970> header<00:02:39.270> all<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.570> way<00:02:39.660> back

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
exhaust from the header all the way back

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
exhaust from the header all the way back
and<00:02:40.739> like<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.550> said<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.209> very<00:02:42.600> loud<00:02:43.940> I'll

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
and like I said it's not very loud I'll

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.340 
and like I said it's not very loud I'll
go<00:02:45.090> ahead<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.450> start<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.870> for<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.230> because

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
go ahead and start it for you because

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.380 
go ahead and start it for you because
this<00:02:47.100> seems<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.610> be<00:02:47.640> what<00:02:47.910> everyone<00:02:47.940> does

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this seems to be what everyone does

00:02:48.390 --> 00:03:00.350 
this seems to be what everyone does
anyway<00:02:56.150> 90,000<00:02:57.150> 159<00:02:58.050> miles<00:02:58.940> was<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> first

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
anyway 90,000 159 miles was the first

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.290 
anyway 90,000 159 miles was the first
time<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:01.080> starting<00:03:01.560> over<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.860> winter

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.070 

that<00:03:07.870> was<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.110> radio<00:03:08.410> antenna<00:03:08.560> going<00:03:09.010> up<00:03:10.080> the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
that was the radio antenna going up the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.970 
that was the radio antenna going up the
battery's<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> little<00:03:11.860> weak<00:03:12.100> from<00:03:12.430> sitting<00:03:18.960> wow

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
battery's a little weak from sitting wow

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.500 
battery's a little weak from sitting wow
that's<00:03:20.980> amazing

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:34.220 

okay

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:43.699 

sounds<00:03:34.860> like<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.100> valves<00:03:35.520> need<00:03:35.700> adjusting

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.440 

that's<00:03:44.099> not<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> big<00:03:44.579> deal

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
that's not a big deal

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.220 
that's not a big deal
oh<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.260> put<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.500> K<00:03:47.770> in<00:03:47.800> air<00:03:48.010> intake<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:49.230> but

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
oh and I put a K in air intake on it but

00:03:50.230 --> 00:04:09.890 
oh and I put a K in air intake on it but
other<00:03:50.379> than<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.950> car<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.370> bone<00:03:51.610> stock

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.880 

it's<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.960> little<00:04:11.230> bit<00:04:11.350> louder<00:04:11.560> than<00:04:11.860> normal

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
it's a little bit louder than normal

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.229 
it's a little bit louder than normal
because<00:04:12.310> I'm<00:04:12.630> somewhat<00:04:13.630> inside<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.170> garage

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
because I'm somewhat inside the garage

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:26.670 
because I'm somewhat inside the garage
but<00:04:16.239> here's<00:04:16.480> what<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.750> exhaust<00:04:17.110> sounds<00:04:17.470> like

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.830 

I'll<00:04:27.190> go<00:04:27.370> ahead<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.790> whack<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.389> throttle

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
I'll go ahead and whack the throttle

00:04:28.840 --> 00:05:07.110 
I'll go ahead and whack the throttle
lightly<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.710> then<00:04:29.949> heavier

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.869 

it's<00:05:08.120> cold<00:05:08.419> out<00:05:08.599> so<00:05:08.629> it's<00:05:09.110> it's<00:05:09.770> only<00:05:09.889> like<00:05:10.160> 37

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879 
it's cold out so it's it's only like 37

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:19.100 
it's cold out so it's it's only like 37
degrees

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.180 

it's<00:05:19.680> warmed<00:05:20.009> up

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
it's warmed up

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.119 
it's warmed up
that's<00:05:21.790> normal

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.979 

I<00:05:28.219> might<00:05:28.819> want<00:05:28.999> to<00:05:29.059> check<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.449> plugs<00:05:29.719> and

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:29.989 
I might want to check the plugs and

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:31.600 
I might want to check the plugs and
adjust<00:05:30.289> the<00:05:30.409> valves<00:05:30.800> they'll<00:05:30.919> probably<00:05:31.099> idle

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
adjust the valves they'll probably idle

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.809 
adjust the valves they'll probably idle
a<00:05:31.699> little<00:05:31.939> bit<00:05:32.059> more<00:05:32.270> smoothly<00:05:32.599> I<00:05:33.819> learned

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
a little bit more smoothly I learned

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.959 
a little bit more smoothly I learned
that<00:05:34.939> it<00:05:35.449> runs<00:05:35.599> like<00:05:35.749> a<00:05:35.869> top
