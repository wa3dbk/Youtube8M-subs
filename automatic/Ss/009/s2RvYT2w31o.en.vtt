00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
need is ice I use about a cup of ice and

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.530 
need is ice I use about a cup of ice and
then<00:00:32.450> I<00:00:32.840> use<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.740> crystal<00:00:33.950> light<00:00:34.280> singles<00:00:34.850> to

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
then I use the crystal light singles to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.690 
then I use the crystal light singles to
go<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:35.690> packet<00:00:36.140> or<00:00:36.260> just<00:00:36.620> anything<00:00:36.950> this<00:00:37.310> one<00:00:37.550> is

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
go a packet or just anything this one is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.090 
go a packet or just anything this one is
Wyler's<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:39.230> doesn't<00:00:39.440> really<00:00:39.530> matter<00:00:39.800> which

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
Wyler's it doesn't really matter which

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.030 
Wyler's it doesn't really matter which
kind<00:00:40.490> of<00:00:40.670> use<00:00:40.880> but<00:00:41.270> for<00:00:41.930> this<00:00:42.050> recipe<00:00:42.290> i<00:00:42.530> use<00:00:43.010> a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
kind of use but for this recipe i use a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.730 
kind of use but for this recipe i use a
strawberry<00:00:43.790> flavor<00:00:44.150> and<00:00:44.450> you<00:00:45.080> would<00:00:45.230> just<00:00:45.410> use

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
strawberry flavor and you would just use

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.270 
strawberry flavor and you would just use
one<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:46.550> your<00:00:46.850> single<00:00:47.210> packet<00:00:47.600> like<00:00:48.110> this<00:00:48.320> just

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
one of your single packet like this just

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.370 
one of your single packet like this just
one<00:00:49.580> of<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.730> small<00:00:50.000> ones<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.960> crystal

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
one of the small ones and the crystal

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.670 
one of the small ones and the crystal
light<00:00:51.500> gives<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.220> big<00:00:52.580> boost<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.540> your<00:00:54.170> protein

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
light gives a big boost to your protein

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.030 
light gives a big boost to your protein
shakes<00:00:55.010> especially<00:00:55.580> the<00:00:55.700> vanilla<00:00:56.630> and<00:00:57.040> it

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
shakes especially the vanilla and it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.130 
shakes especially the vanilla and it
gives<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.550> good<00:00:58.730> flavor<00:00:59.060> without<00:00:59.450> adding<00:00:59.810> any

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
gives it good flavor without adding any

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.950 
gives it good flavor without adding any
calories<00:01:00.410> which<00:01:00.920> is<00:01:01.070> nice<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.480> then<00:01:02.600> i<00:01:02.690> use

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
calories which is nice so and then i use

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.710 
calories which is nice so and then i use
the<00:01:03.200> EAS<00:01:03.590> way<00:01:03.950> i<00:01:04.879> use<00:01:05.360> one<00:01:05.480> hundred<00:01:05.690> percent

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
the EAS way i use one hundred percent

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.140 
the EAS way i use one hundred percent
way<00:01:06.080> because<00:01:06.380> i<00:01:06.500> found<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.730> mixed

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
way because i found that the mixed

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.090 
way because i found that the mixed
proteins<00:01:08.660> like<00:01:08.960> sometimes<00:01:09.470> you'll<00:01:09.650> find<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
proteins like sometimes you'll find the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.820 
proteins like sometimes you'll find the
soy<00:01:10.370> mixed<00:01:10.820> with<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:10.970> way<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:12.050> it's

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
soy mixed with the way it just it's

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.090 
soy mixed with the way it just it's
gritty<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.520> me<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.650> I've<00:01:15.650> tried<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.890> lot<00:01:16.010> of

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
gritty to me and I've tried a lot of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.500 
gritty to me and I've tried a lot of
different<00:01:16.400> proteins<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.060> I'm<00:01:17.150> most<00:01:17.420> happy

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
different proteins and I'm most happy

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.000 
different proteins and I'm most happy
with<00:01:17.930> one<00:01:18.050> hundred<00:01:18.110> percent<00:01:18.290> way<00:01:18.650> but<00:01:18.920> it

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
with one hundred percent way but it

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.050 
with one hundred percent way but it
doesn't<00:01:19.220> have<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.400> be<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.820> can<00:01:19.940> be

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
doesn't have to be that it can be

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.260 
doesn't have to be that it can be
whatever<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.780> want<00:01:21.650> but<00:01:22.280> personal<00:01:23.060> choice

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
flavor it's not gritty and you don't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.630 
flavor it's not gritty and you don't
have<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.890> depend<00:01:31.040> on<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:32.210> vitamin<00:01:32.930> shoppe<00:01:33.170> or

packets of the crystal light and that's
an<00:02:25.360> oh<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.900> use<00:02:26.110> vanilla<00:02:26.500> through<00:02:27.459> these

protein<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.440> your<00:02:35.590> smoothie<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.640> know<00:02:36.760> what<00:02:36.880> I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
protein in your smoothie you know what I

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.030 
protein in your smoothie you know what I
mean<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.300> if<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.870> were<00:02:38.019> just<00:02:38.260> by<00:02:38.470> strawberry

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
mean like if I were just by strawberry

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.370 
mean like if I were just by strawberry
protein<00:02:39.459> then<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.390> would<00:02:40.540> have<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.260> know

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
protein then I would have to you know

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.680 
protein then I would have to you know
work<00:02:41.890> around<00:02:42.250> strawberry<00:02:42.819> for<00:02:43.060> my<00:02:43.209> flavor<00:02:43.480> of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
work around strawberry for my flavor of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.500 
work around strawberry for my flavor of
shake<00:02:43.959> but<00:02:44.680> with<00:02:44.830> this<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.459> can<00:02:45.940> make<00:02:46.269> anything

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
shake but with this I can make anything

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.949 
shake but with this I can make anything
from<00:02:46.810> chocolate<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.530> Strawberry<00:02:48.069> to

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
from chocolate to Strawberry to

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.670 
from chocolate to Strawberry to
blueberry<00:02:49.959> blackberry<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:52.060> your

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
blueberry blackberry and it's your

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.490 
blueberry blackberry and it's your
selection<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.769> much<00:02:54.010> better<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:56.019> then

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
selection is much better so and then

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.830 
selection is much better so and then
after<00:02:56.890> I've<00:02:56.980> done<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.730> add<00:02:58.299> in<00:03:00.540> one<00:03:01.540> group

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
after I've done that I add in one group

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.410 
after I've done that I add in one group
of<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:03.660> protein<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.930> with<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.709> one<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.040> get

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
of the protein and with this one you get

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.289 
of the protein and with this one you get
23<00:03:07.420> grams<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:08.079> protein<00:03:08.349> in<00:03:08.799> one<00:03:09.160> scoop<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:10.180> I

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
23 grams of protein in one scoop and I

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.720 
23 grams of protein in one scoop and I
think<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:10.660> only<00:03:10.870> like<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.500> hundred<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.519> some

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
think it's only like a hundred and some

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.620 
think it's only like a hundred and some
calories<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:14.350> very<00:03:14.650> low<00:03:14.890> carb<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.510> then

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
calories and very low carb so and then

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.920 
calories and very low carb so and then
after<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.109> do<00:03:17.319> that<00:03:17.549> then<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.579> add<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.209> about<00:03:19.720> a

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
after you do that then I add in about a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:31.140 
after you do that then I add in about a
cup<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.880> got<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.910> cup<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.180> ice<00:03:29.220> okay<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:31.120> a

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
cup I got a cup of ice okay that a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.140

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
fiber see that's why I bought the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.009 
fiber see that's why I bought the
Wyler's<00:03:59.980> they<00:04:00.220> have<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:01.180> singles<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.660> go<00:04:01.810> they

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
Wyler's they have the singles to go they

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.379 
Wyler's they have the singles to go they
actually<00:04:02.319> have<00:04:02.440> fiber<00:04:02.769> in<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.069> so<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.700> was<00:04:04.359> very

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
actually have fiber in it so I was very

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.430 
actually have fiber in it so I was very
excited<00:04:04.599> about<00:04:04.930> that

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
excited about that

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.660 
excited about that
fibers<00:04:06.400> good<00:04:06.580> for<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:06.910> so<00:04:07.210> and<00:04:07.750> then<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:09.490> can

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
fibers good for you so and then you can

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.270 
fibers good for you so and then you can
also<00:04:09.790> add<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.120> benefiber<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:12.160> doesn't

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
also add the benefiber and it doesn't

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.560 
also add the benefiber and it doesn't
taste<00:04:12.490> like<00:04:12.550> anything<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:13.180> dissolves

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
taste like anything it dissolves

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.820 
taste like anything it dissolves
instantly<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.290> gives<00:04:14.470> you<00:04:14.560> even<00:04:14.680> more

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
instantly and it gives you even more

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.759
