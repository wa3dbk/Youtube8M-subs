00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.540

 Also beautiful come to validity Sun. 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.900
 they look 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.540
 They are now about three meters high 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.509
 they have them up in length 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.610
 shortened on flower buds 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.790
 Tufts of flowers are shortened here 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.899
 This year again something grow and in 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.290
 Two years later we will be back 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.939
 always take it back to this height 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.360
 they are able to hold in the broad 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.220
 maybe 50 centimeters to 100 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.140
 centimeter wide everything was longer 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.369
 we have schmidt in spring 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.780
 March cut away 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.329
 There is also the possibility of mine 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.200
 marine stronger growing in june / july 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.409
 everything about 20 centimeters is on 15 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.220
 cm back and so the crown so 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.000
 Beautifully beautiful culinary acids 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.860

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.210
 But this year will be a full one too 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.640

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.020
 marini out after ten years like this 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.120
