00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
period of time you'll see all the water

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
period of time you'll see all the water
that<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.789> poured<00:01:03.120> into<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.539> fuel<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.650> now<00:01:04.920> in

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
process to tell you what just happened

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.330 
process to tell you what just happened
because<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> does<00:01:10.380> happen<00:01:10.710> very<00:01:10.830> quickly

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
because it does happen very quickly

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.960 
because it does happen very quickly
we<00:01:12.020> added<00:01:13.020> water<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> bowl<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.790> was

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we added water to the bowl here it was

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.289 
we added water to the bowl here it was
sucked<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.450> into<00:01:16.080> our<00:01:16.229> filter<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:17.299> separated
