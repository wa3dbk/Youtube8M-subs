00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.649
 a few years i'm still a little 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.240
 rusty but hey this project came 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.009

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.750
 exciting we had talked a lot about it 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.369
 was a lot of work that was done 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.500
 behind and finally it happened in 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.269
 regarding my family she will stay 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:20.819 --> 00:03:05.959
 wanted why choose you 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:03:05.959
 refuse to the holidays thing explains to the nose 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.859
 so then what I have to say is that 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.659
 I'm really lucky at my age at 37 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.909
 years of receiving so many offers a lot 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.019
 of many clubs offers in fact I 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.310
 think to have received more offers 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.859
 now that throughout my 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.900
 career what about paris why 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.790
 I have prices vary I understand the project 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.170
 that this team trying to ride I 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.180
 saw also the players they did 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.099
 come here the city the city is a 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.139
 wonderful city but the club is from 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.189
 to register in time to have 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.650
 victories of knowing success in 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.909
 is for the next 10 15 to 20 years 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.069
 so that may not mean that I 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.840
 will play 10 15 or 20 years but it's a 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.939
 honor for me to be part of 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.169
 to be part of this project is to try 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.880
 to bring them a little further 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.239
 that's why I chose paris and 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.239
 this project 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:55.160

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.160
 while homeless then framakey 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:13.470

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.800

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:23.360
