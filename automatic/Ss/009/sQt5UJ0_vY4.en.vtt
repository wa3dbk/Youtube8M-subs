00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
to you Steven do you think you have a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
to you Steven do you think you have a
chance<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.930> competing<00:00:37.350> against<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> big

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
chance of competing against the big

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680 
chance of competing against the big
players<00:00:38.309> because<00:00:38.550> you're<00:00:38.820> pretty<00:00:38.940> small<00:00:39.360> fry

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
players because you're pretty small fry

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
players because you're pretty small fry
in<00:00:39.930> comparison<00:00:40.559> aren't<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> well<00:00:41.520> we're

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
in comparison aren't you well we're

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.670 
in comparison aren't you well we're
small<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.120> growing<00:00:42.329> quickly<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.530> think

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
small but growing quickly so I think

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
small but growing quickly so I think
about<00:00:44.100> two<00:00:44.280> years<00:00:44.460> ago<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.149> independent<00:00:45.750> said

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
about two years ago the independent said

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.160 
about two years ago the independent said
about<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.350> percent<00:00:46.710> market<00:00:47.309> share<00:00:47.340> nights<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
about one percent market share nights to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.270 
about one percent market share nights to
won't<00:00:49.170> take<00:00:49.379> long<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.770> catch<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
won't take long to catch up with that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.100 
won't take long to catch up with that
growth<00:00:50.430> rate<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> serious<00:00:51.480> point<00:00:51.840> I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
growth rate but on a serious point I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.439 
growth rate but on a serious point I
think<00:00:52.829> independent<00:00:53.579> suppliers<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.180> doing<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
think independent suppliers are doing a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
think independent suppliers are doing a
really<00:00:54.600> good<00:00:54.750> job<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.800> growing<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
really good job not just growing the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
really good job not just growing the
market<00:00:56.579> share<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:56.969> keeping<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> big<00:00:57.660> six<00:00:57.930> on

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
market share but keeping the big six on

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
market share but keeping the big six on
their<00:00:58.350> toes<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> think<00:01:00.000> we're<00:01:00.180> playing

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
their toes and so I think we're playing

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.819 
their toes and so I think we're playing
a<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.570> important<00:01:00.960> role<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.770> said

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
a really important role and as I said

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.260 
a really important role and as I said
we're<00:01:02.129> growing<00:01:02.309> really<00:01:02.520> quickly<00:01:02.609> we'd<00:01:03.090> love

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
we're growing really quickly we'd love

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
we're growing really quickly we'd love
to<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.870> government<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.470> especially<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
to see the government and especially the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
to see the government and especially the
regulator<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:06.180> more<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> level<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
regulator doing more to level the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
regulator doing more to level the
playing<00:01:07.020> field<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.680> part<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> problem<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
playing field is part of the problem the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730 
playing field is part of the problem the
fact<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:09.960> generate<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.680> own

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
fact that you don't generate your own

old<00:01:36.540> power<00:01:36.840> station<00:01:37.290> then<00:01:37.770> probably<00:01:38.280> you're

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
old power station then probably you're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.310 
old power station then probably you're
generating<00:01:38.850> electricity<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:40.140> more

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
generating electricity that's more

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.800 
generating electricity that's more
expensive<00:01:40.560> than<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.520> which<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.090> buy<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
expensive than that which we can buy and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.060 
expensive than that which we can buy and
then<00:01:43.079> you've<00:01:43.170> got<00:01:43.200> past<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.829> expensive

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
then you've got past the more expensive

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.069 
then you've got past the more expensive
power<00:01:44.399> onto<00:01:44.579> your<00:01:44.880> energy<00:01:45.570> customers<00:01:45.720> so

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
power onto your energy customers so

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.679 
power onto your energy customers so
that's<00:01:46.229> probably<00:01:46.860> why<00:01:47.420> independence<00:01:48.420> can

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that's probably why independence can

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.210 
that's probably why independence can
offer<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.020> good<00:01:49.259> saving<00:01:49.649> against<00:01:49.890> most<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
offer a good saving against most of the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
offer a good saving against most of the
big<00:01:50.399> six<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> mentioned<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.570> wholesale

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
big six and you mentioned the wholesale

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.440 
big six and you mentioned the wholesale
gas<00:01:52.290> electricity<00:01:53.220> prices<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.030> we've<00:01:54.180> seen

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
gas electricity prices and we've seen

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.969 
gas electricity prices and we've seen
those<00:01:54.840> increase<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> very

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
those increase and that's the very

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
those increase and that's the very
reason<00:01:56.100> why<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.579> likes<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.060> British<00:01:57.390> Gas<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
reason why the likes of British Gas and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.270 
reason why the likes of British Gas and
SSE<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.500> they've<00:01:58.680> had<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.979> put<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.219> their

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
SSE so they've had to put up their

SSE so they've had to put up their

earlier<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.340> year<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:03.030> we've<00:02:03.210> had<00:02:03.329> the

earlier on this year and we've had the

just<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.039> same<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.399> them<00:02:08.520> you're<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
just the same as them you're going to

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.460 
just the same as them you're going to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
have to put up prices when wholesale

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.590 
have to put up prices when wholesale
cost<00:02:11.280> score<00:02:11.640> well<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.209> think<00:02:12.300> if

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
cost score well I think if

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.360 
cost score well I think if
if<00:02:14.050> wholesale<00:02:14.470> prices<00:02:14.800> continue<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.250> rise

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
if wholesale prices continue to rise

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.370 
if wholesale prices continue to rise
over<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.790> coming<00:02:16.000> years<00:02:16.300> then<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.720> course<00:02:17.050> our

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
over the coming years then of course our

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.050 
over the coming years then of course our
prices<00:02:17.770> will<00:02:17.920> go<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.070> as<00:02:18.280> well<00:02:18.460> but<00:02:18.640> one<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
prices will go up as well but one of the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.910 
prices will go up as well but one of the
things<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.270> we've<00:02:19.480> said<00:02:19.750> as<00:02:20.260> recently<00:02:20.860> as

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
things that we've said as recently as

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.980 
things that we've said as recently as
last<00:02:20.980> week<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.910> haven't<00:02:22.270> seen<00:02:22.480> wholesale

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
last week we haven't seen wholesale

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.650 
last week we haven't seen wholesale
price<00:02:23.260> rises<00:02:23.740> for<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.160> last<00:02:24.340> two<00:02:24.520> years<00:02:24.660> since

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
price rises for the last two years since

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.110 
price rises for the last two years since
2011<00:02:26.410> we've<00:02:26.590> seen<00:02:26.800> wholesale<00:02:27.160> prices<00:02:27.520> stay

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
2011 we've seen wholesale prices stay

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.240 
2011 we've seen wholesale prices stay
roughly<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.660> same<00:02:28.840> or<00:02:29.110> even<00:02:29.230> false<00:02:29.620> life<00:02:29.890> even

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
roughly the same or even false life even

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.200 
roughly the same or even false life even
though<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.460> big<00:02:30.610> players<00:02:30.820> are<00:02:31.000> saying

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
though the big players are saying

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.520 
though the big players are saying
they're<00:02:31.360> going<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.840> we've<00:02:32.020> got<00:02:32.200> figures

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
they're going up and we've got figures

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.290 
they're going up and we've got figures
from<00:02:32.710> independent<00:02:33.460> organizations<00:02:34.180> say

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
from independent organizations say

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.000 
from independent organizations say
they've<00:02:34.450> gone<00:02:34.570> up<00:02:34.690> about<00:02:34.810> eight<00:02:35.020> percent<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.980> I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
they've gone up about eight percent so I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.040 
they've gone up about eight percent so I
think<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.280> back<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.760> May<00:02:36.880> 2011<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:37.900> were

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
think that back in May 2011 we were

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.010 
think that back in May 2011 we were
paying<00:02:38.290> about<00:02:38.620> 73<00:02:39.370> 74<00:02:39.910> pence<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.330> therm<00:02:40.600> for

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
paying about 73 74 pence a therm for

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.330 
paying about 73 74 pence a therm for
guess<00:02:41.140> which<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.440> way<00:02:41.500> we<00:02:41.650> measure<00:02:41.830> gas<00:02:42.100> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
guess which the way we measure gas and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.960 
guess which the way we measure gas and
today<00:02:42.940> it's<00:02:43.090> about<00:02:43.150> 68<00:02:43.690> 69<00:02:43.990> pins<00:02:44.320> so<00:02:45.040> if

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
today it's about 68 69 pins so if

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.090 
today it's about 68 69 pins so if
they're<00:02:46.240> buying<00:02:46.540> more<00:02:46.960> expensive<00:02:47.470> gas<00:02:47.650> more

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
they're buying more expensive gas more

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.190 
they're buying more expensive gas more
expensive<00:02:48.430> electricity<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.570> large<00:02:49.810> part<00:02:50.080> we

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
expensive electricity in a large part we

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.320 
expensive electricity in a large part we
think<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.680> because<00:02:50.850> they're<00:02:51.850> selling<00:02:52.210> it

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
think this is because they're selling it

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.060 
think this is because they're selling it
to<00:02:52.450> themselves<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.350> when<00:02:53.530> they<00:02:53.650> report

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
to themselves so when they report

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.060 
to themselves so when they report
wholesale<00:02:54.700> prices<00:02:55.060> going<00:02:55.240> up<00:02:55.710> it<00:02:56.710> may<00:02:56.920> be<00:02:56.980> that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
wholesale prices going up it may be that

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.160 
wholesale prices going up it may be that
their<00:02:57.340> prices<00:02:57.670> are<00:02:57.760> going<00:02:57.910> up<00:02:58.060> but<00:02:58.240> I<00:02:58.420> mean<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
their prices are going up but I mean the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.400 
their prices are going up but I mean the
wholesale<00:02:59.650> market<00:02:59.680> prices<00:03:00.250> aren't
