00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
your mind to it and you really think

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.670 
your mind to it and you really think
that<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.359> can<00:02:39.480> do<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.049> can<00:02:40.409> do<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
and I think that it's something that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.610 
and I think that it's something that
makes<00:02:42.180> me<00:02:42.450> want<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.720> work<00:02:42.810> harder<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.470> show

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
makes me want to work harder to show

makes me want to work harder to show
them<00:02:43.859> like<00:02:44.099> you<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.150> don't<00:02:45.359> have<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.659> be
