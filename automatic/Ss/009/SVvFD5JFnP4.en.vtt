 Ladies and gentlemen, the world's first bad breath detector for the iPhone. Let's test it out. Come on. 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.509
 Hey, one of you got a second? We are testing an iPhone App 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.949
 It's a bad breath detector. 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:15.079
 No way! Way! Look it says bad breath detector right there. "Oh gosh I don't know if my breath will rise to the test." 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.719
 Is this the Orabrush thing? Let's give it a shot, see how effective it is. 

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:25.880
 You press the button, you blow on the bottom for 3 seconds. Ready, go ahead. "Way to breathe dragon. You just have to voided the warranty on this 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.179
 iPhone 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.640
 Wait, did it really just smell me? 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.240

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.950
 Blow again ... 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.729
 How does it work? It tests your breath 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.760
 But what makes a good breath or bad breath? 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.490
 Well, I just drank root beer so she was probably pretty bad actually. 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.490
 it smells like a mongoose ... who crawled out of the sewer into your mouth and left no wind, then died ... and then no wind again. 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.700
 okay 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.370
 Good work ... 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.710
 It was good for me ... How was it for you? 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.070
 perfect 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.610
 Isn't it good? 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.050
 Just because she is sterile doesn't mean you 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.330
 must drink it. Gross! It's awful ... it's so embarrassing 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.260
 "Mmmmm ... mmmmm ... good" 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.920
 Just better and better every time. "I smell dead people." 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.400
 (Laughs) 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.680
 It is crushing my hopes and dreams ..... "You ever made a cell phone? 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.579
 Now your chance. " 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.579
 Alright! certifiably smooch-staat. "They have to breathe fragrant candles." It's so biased! How it's biased, it's a scientific test! 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.150
 "Oh, how is it? I've always wondered what sh $ * tastes like." 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 Do you have good or bad breath? This is excellent. Outstanding? 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.420
 Well, we'll have to try it, okay. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.850
 "It's like fresh bread and flowers are married and done in your mouth." I told you it was good! 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 Fresh bread and fresh flowers are done in my mouth. "Someone has ever told you that your breath smells wonderful?" 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.100
 "They will never ..." 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 Excuse me, is making a youtube video .... Just breathe in the microphone ......
