if<00:00:43.379> you've<00:00:43.559> played<00:00:43.710> titanfall<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.489> you've

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
if you've played titanfall and you've

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.250 
if you've played titanfall and you've
seen<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.360> big<00:00:45.510> machine<00:00:45.690> guns<00:00:46.079> if

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
seen the like the big machine guns if

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.990 
seen the like the big machine guns if
the<00:00:46.350> Titans<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:47.250> sure<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the Titans have I'm sure it's going to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.740 
the Titans have I'm sure it's going to
be<00:00:48.090> something<00:00:48.329> similar<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.570> next

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
be something similar to that so the next

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.600 
be something similar to that so the next
thing<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.320> boost<00:00:52.739> jump<00:00:53.010> now<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
thing is the boost jump now this is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.279 
thing is the boost jump now this is
actually<00:00:53.789> very<00:00:54.059> exciting<00:00:54.809> i'm<00:00:54.870> glad<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
actually very exciting i'm glad that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.540 
actually very exciting i'm glad that
they're<00:00:55.410> incorporating<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> game

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
they're incorporating this in the game

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.220 
they're incorporating this in the game
where<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.030> jump<00:00:57.300> higher<00:00:57.539> you've<00:00:57.840> seen<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
where you can jump higher you've seen it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
where you can jump higher you've seen it
in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> campaign<00:00:58.829> trailer<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:00:59.940> jump<00:01:00.329> up

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
in the campaign trailer you can jump up

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
in the campaign trailer you can jump up
and<00:01:00.690> grab<00:01:00.930> onto<00:01:01.199> things<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.100> lot

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and grab onto things and it's a lot

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.369 
and grab onto things and it's a lot
easier<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.879> navigate<00:01:03.239> around<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.930> map<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
easier to navigate around the map and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
easier to navigate around the map and
get<00:01:04.500> onto<00:01:04.799> platforms<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.549> stuff<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> think

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
get onto platforms and stuff so I think

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.770 
get onto platforms and stuff so I think
that'll<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.409> innovation<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> game

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
that'll be a good innovation to the game

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.929 
that'll be a good innovation to the game
next<00:01:09.780> there's<00:01:10.200> cloaking<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
next there's cloaking and and this is

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
next there's cloaking and and this is
not<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.390> cup<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.720> tea<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> big<00:01:13.530> fan<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
not my cup of tea I'm not a big fan of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
not my cup of tea I'm not a big fan of
the<00:01:13.950> cloaking<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.520> cloaking<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.299> in

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the cloaking but cloaking will be in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
the cloaking but cloaking will be in
multiplayer<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:16.229> hoping<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.310> there's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
multiplayer now I'm hoping that there's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.280 
multiplayer now I'm hoping that there's
some<00:01:17.580> kind<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.970> counter<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.750> way<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> see

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
some kind of counter or way to see

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.249 
some kind of counter or way to see
through<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.810> cloaking

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
through it but for now there is cloaking

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
through it but for now there is cloaking
in<00:01:22.740> multiplayer<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.580> hopefully<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.180> will

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
in multiplayer and hopefully they will

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.120 
in multiplayer and hopefully they will
elaborate<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.009> really

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
elaborate on that because I'm really

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640 
elaborate on that because I'm really
interested<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:27.000> exactly<00:01:27.990> what<00:01:28.470> they're

super<00:01:35.729> strange<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.360> sure<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> has

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
super strange but I'm sure that it has

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.719 
super strange but I'm sure that it has
something<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> quick<00:01:38.369> burst<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
something to do with a quick burst of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
something to do with a quick burst of
energy<00:01:38.820> give<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> couple<00:01:39.750> seconds<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.409> just

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
energy give you a couple seconds to just

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.649 
energy give you a couple seconds to just
totally<00:01:41.040> tear<00:01:41.250> someone<00:01:41.520> apart<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.360> saw<00:01:42.540> in

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
totally tear someone apart if you saw in

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
totally tear someone apart if you saw in
the<00:01:42.689> trailer<00:01:42.780> there's<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> guy<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.920> top<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the trailer there's a guy like on top of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.670 
the trailer there's a guy like on top of
a<00:01:44.310> train<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.850> he<00:01:44.939> grabs<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.509> dude<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:46.290> no<00:01:46.500> he

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
a train and he grabs the dude or no he

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.319 
a train and he grabs the dude or no he
pulls<00:01:46.920> him<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> tank<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.880> he<00:01:48.119> just

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
pulls him out of the tank and he just

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.700 
pulls him out of the tank and he just
throws<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.320> they<00:01:49.409> were<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
throws and that's what they were on that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
throws and that's what they were on that
tank<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> train<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.579> he<00:01:51.000> pulls<00:01:51.240> him<00:01:51.390> out

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
tank not a train and he pulls him out

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
tank not a train and he pulls him out
and<00:01:51.659> he<00:01:51.750> throws<00:01:52.110> him<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.530> 30<00:01:52.890> feet<00:01:53.310> I'm

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and he throws him like 30 feet I'm

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.249 
and he throws him like 30 feet I'm
thinking<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> super<00:01:54.899> strength

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
thinking that's what the super strength

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
thinking that's what the super strength
is<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.310> involved<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
is that it's just going to be involved a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.160 
is that it's just going to be involved a
multi-player<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.719> probably<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
multi-player and it's probably going to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
multi-player and it's probably going to
be<00:01:58.259> some<00:01:58.590> sort<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.040> melee<00:01:59.549> obviously<00:02:00.119> it's

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
be some sort of melee obviously it's

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.789 
be some sort of melee obviously it's
called<00:02:00.450> super<00:02:00.840> strength<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.590> you'll<00:02:01.710> probably

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
called super strength so you'll probably

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
called super strength so you'll probably
be<00:02:02.159> able<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.399> grab<00:02:02.610> someone<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.119> throw<00:02:03.299> them

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
be able to grab someone and throw them

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.030 
be able to grab someone and throw them
really<00:02:03.600> far<00:02:03.810> which<00:02:04.020> will<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.799> cool<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
really far which will be really cool to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.680 
really far which will be really cool to
see<00:02:05.340> how<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:06.240> plays<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.689> okay<00:02:08.119> next<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
see how that plays out okay next is the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.690 
see how that plays out okay next is the
XO<00:02:10.110> slide<00:02:10.379> which<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.099> we've<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:11.520> seen

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
XO slide which we can all we've all seen

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.230 
XO slide which we can all we've all seen
a<00:02:11.760> ghost<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.480> slide<00:02:12.720> they<00:02:12.959> just

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
a ghost it's the slide they just

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.260 
a ghost it's the slide they just
the<00:02:13.480> XO<00:02:13.750> slide<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.260> there's<00:02:15.070> also<00:02:15.280> an<00:02:15.820> XO

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
the XO slide and there's also an XO

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.020 
the XO slide and there's also an XO
boost<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.990> have<00:02:17.140> no<00:02:17.350> idea<00:02:17.470> what<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:17.830> is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
boost and I have no idea what this is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.520 
boost and I have no idea what this is
one<00:02:19.030> thing<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.510> would<00:02:19.600> like<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.990> point<00:02:20.350> out

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
one thing that I would like to point out

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.060 
one thing that I would like to point out
that<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.830> think<00:02:21.340> might<00:02:22.330> be<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.200> XO<00:02:23.560> boost<00:02:23.830> is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
that I think might be the XO boost is

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.830 
that I think might be the XO boost is
that<00:02:24.250> they<00:02:24.400> said<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.910> interview<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.390> you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
that they said in the interview that you

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.620 
that they said in the interview that you
can<00:02:26.620> quickly<00:02:27.040> boost<00:02:27.790> yourself<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.570> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
can quickly boost yourself out of the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.940 
can quickly boost yourself out of the
way<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:28.990> someone's<00:02:29.320> shooting<00:02:29.440> at<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.800> can

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
way like someone's shooting at you can

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.530 
way like someone's shooting at you can
boost<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.460> side<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.000> then<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.300> shoot

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
boost to the side and then like shoot

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.940 
boost to the side and then like shoot
them<00:02:31.630> with<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.750> shotgun<00:02:31.960> or<00:02:32.170> something<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.740> I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
them with a shotgun or something and I

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
them with a shotgun or something and I
think<00:02:33.040> that's<00:02:33.250> what<00:02:33.550> they're<00:02:33.640> talking<00:02:33.910> about

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
think that's what they're talking about

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.670 
think that's what they're talking about
when<00:02:34.090> they<00:02:34.240> say<00:02:34.390> XO<00:02:34.720> booze<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.110> can<00:02:35.260> you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
when they say XO booze that you can you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.530 
when they say XO booze that you can you
know<00:02:35.770> quickly<00:02:36.100> it's<00:02:36.970> pretty<00:02:37.180> much<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.390> a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
know quickly it's pretty much like a

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.320 
know quickly it's pretty much like a
slide<00:02:37.840> just<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.980> horizontal<00:02:39.640> like<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.880> slide

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
slide just just horizontal like a slide

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.580 
slide just just horizontal like a slide
to<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.540> right<00:02:40.720> slide<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.170> left<00:02:41.260> real

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
to the right slide to the left real

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.930 
to the right slide to the left real
quick<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.920> jump<00:02:42.130> out<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.430> way<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.550> bullets

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
quick to jump out of the way a bullets

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.970 
quick to jump out of the way a bullets
which<00:02:43.120> might<00:02:43.750> be<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> little<00:02:44.110> overpowered<00:02:44.770> but

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
which might be a little overpowered but

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.330 
which might be a little overpowered but
again<00:02:45.520> we'll<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:45.940> what's<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.450> come<00:02:46.600> of<00:02:46.630> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
again we'll see what's to come of that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.280 
again we'll see what's to come of that
there's<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.430> brand<00:02:49.000> new<00:02:49.150> combo<00:02:49.630> now<00:02:49.810> it's<00:02:50.020> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
there's a brand new combo now it's the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.650 
there's a brand new combo now it's the
boost<00:02:50.530> jump<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.220> lethal<00:02:51.670> slam<00:02:52.030> from<00:02:52.270> above

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
boost jump and a lethal slam from above

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.100 
boost jump and a lethal slam from above
so<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:53.530> kind<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.950> like<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.300> WWE<00:02:55.300> move<00:02:55.690> now<00:02:55.900> that

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
so it's kind of like a WWE move now that

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.180 
so it's kind of like a WWE move now that
they're<00:02:56.230> bringing<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.560> call<00:02:56.710> of<00:02:56.800> duty<00:02:56.860> where

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
they're bringing a call of duty where

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.620 
they're bringing a call of duty where
you<00:02:57.280> can<00:02:57.430> double<00:02:57.820> jump<00:02:57.850> up<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.420> then<00:02:58.570> a

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
you can double jump up and then a

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.060 
you can double jump up and then a

really bad with knives at all ghosts
it's<00:03:14.020> actually<00:03:14.230> pretty<00:03:14.320> good<00:03:14.470> with<00:03:14.620> black<00:03:14.710> ops

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
it's actually pretty good with black ops

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.100 
it's actually pretty good with black ops
2<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.370> knifing<00:03:15.760> system<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.270> just<00:03:16.450> absolute

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
2 the knifing system it's just absolute

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.440 
2 the knifing system it's just absolute
garbage<00:03:17.380> it's<00:03:17.740> terrible<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.430> really<00:03:19.210> like<00:03:19.420> that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
garbage it's terrible I really like that

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.970

they're<00:03:19.810> they're<00:03:20.020> working<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.440> melee<00:03:20.830> and

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
they're they're working on melee and

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.350 
they're they're working on melee and
trying<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.220> find<00:03:21.400> new<00:03:21.520> ways<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.880> attack

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
trying to find new ways to attack

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.050 
trying to find new ways to attack
someone<00:03:22.600> without<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.990> gun<00:03:23.290> um<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.610> think<00:03:24.910> that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
someone without a gun um so I think that

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.300 
someone without a gun um so I think that
is<00:03:25.240> pretty<00:03:26.140> awesome<00:03:26.350> hopefully<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:27.040> that

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
is pretty awesome hopefully that that

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.010 
is pretty awesome hopefully that that
will<00:03:27.460> be<00:03:27.580> very<00:03:27.760> cool<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.270> to<00:03:28.450> be<00:03:28.570> honest<00:03:28.870> I

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
will be very cool and to be honest I

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.480 
will be very cool and to be honest I
think<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.830> i<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:30.010> that's<00:03:30.310> all

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
think that is it i think that's all

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.630 
think that is it i think that's all
we've<00:03:30.640> got<00:03:30.880> um<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.860> know<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:32.980> shotgun<00:03:33.520> in

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
we've got um you know the shotgun in

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.250 
we've got um you know the shotgun in
close<00:03:33.880> quarters<00:03:34.270> quarters<00:03:34.600> weapon<00:03:35.110> a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
close quarters quarters weapon a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.050 
close quarters quarters weapon a
short-range<00:03:36.160> rotting<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.760> weapon<00:03:37.030> like

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
short-range rotting a weapon like

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.610 
short-range rotting a weapon like
shotgun<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.660> pretty<00:03:37.690> ineffective<00:03:38.200> against

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
shotgun is pretty ineffective against

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.870 
shotgun is pretty ineffective against
the<00:03:38.740> player<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.160> boost<00:03:39.400> out<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.760> way

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
the player can boost out of the way

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.460 
the player can boost out of the way
that's<00:03:40.090> what<00:03:40.270> I<00:03:40.300> was<00:03:40.420> talking<00:03:40.570> about<00:03:40.750> jump<00:03:41.350> out

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
that's what I was talking about jump out

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.370 
that's what I was talking about jump out
of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.680> way<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.450> hopefully<00:03:44.080> get<00:03:44.260> the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
of the way and and and hopefully get the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.750 
of the way and and and hopefully get the
kill<00:03:44.590> op<00:03:44.740> I<00:03:44.920> really<00:03:45.220> think<00:03:45.340> that's<00:03:45.580> going<00:03:45.700> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
kill op I really think that's going to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.670 
kill op I really think that's going to
be<00:03:45.880> overpowered<00:03:46.390> but<00:03:46.570> it'll<00:03:47.350> be<00:03:47.440> interesting

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
be overpowered but it'll be interesting

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.440 
be overpowered but it'll be interesting
