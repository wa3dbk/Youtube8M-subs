00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.020 

so<00:00:11.559> I'm<00:00:11.680> no<00:00:11.800> longer<00:00:11.830> in<00:00:12.250> Russia<00:00:12.490> but

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
so I'm no longer in Russia but

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.520 
so I'm no longer in Russia but
apparently<00:00:13.390> it's<00:00:13.780> still<00:00:14.050> winter<00:00:14.260> survival

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
apparently it's still winter survival

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.750 
apparently it's still winter survival
here<00:00:15.040> in<00:00:15.130> Canada

with<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.620> robotic<00:01:00.130> arms<00:01:00.490> where<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.240> can

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
with the robotic arms where we can

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.240 
with the robotic arms where we can
visualize<00:01:01.870> what's<00:01:02.200> going<00:01:02.290> on<00:01:02.650> here's<00:01:03.130> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
visualize what's going on here's the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.420 
visualize what's going on here's the
station<00:01:04.170> scale<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.470> here's<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.740> robotic<00:01:06.100> arm

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.090 
station scale and here's the robotic arm
also<00:01:06.760> at<00:01:06.850> scale<00:01:07.120> it<00:01:07.630> moves<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.590> we<00:01:08.680> can<00:01:08.800> plan

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
also at scale it moves and we can plan

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.340 
also at scale it moves and we can plan
our<00:01:09.340> maneuvers<00:01:09.880> as<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.510> can<00:01:10.660> see<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.170> main

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
our maneuvers as you can see the main

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.860 
our maneuvers as you can see the main
challenge<00:01:11.979> did<00:01:12.250> not<00:01:12.460> hit<00:01:12.880> any<00:01:13.240> train<00:01:13.600> while

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
challenge did not hit any train while

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.090 
challenge did not hit any train while
you're<00:01:14.020> moving<00:01:14.110> this<00:01:14.350> arm<00:01:14.590> because<00:01:14.830> all<00:01:14.950> you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
you're moving this arm because all you

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.250 
you're moving this arm because all you
got<00:01:15.310> really<00:01:15.790> what<00:01:15.970> you're<00:01:16.090> working<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:17.080> come

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
got really what you're working you come

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.530 
got really what you're working you come
here<00:01:17.590> there's<00:01:18.400> this<00:01:18.580> workstation<00:01:18.910> you've<00:01:19.420> got

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
here there's this workstation you've got

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.300 
here there's this workstation you've got
a<00:01:19.570> couple<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:20.110> camera<00:01:20.440> views<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.920> work<00:01:21.070> from

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
a couple of camera views to work from

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.890 
a couple of camera views to work from
you've<00:01:21.670> got<00:01:21.790> your<00:01:21.910> hand<00:01:22.090> controllers<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.750> move

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
you've got your hand controllers to move

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.109 
you've got your hand controllers to move
the<00:01:23.080> arm<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:24.280> get<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.610> know<00:01:24.850> some

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
the arm and you get to know some

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.820 
the arm and you get to know some
computer<00:01:25.570> displays<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> bunch<00:01:26.710> of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
computer displays and a bunch of

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.040 
computer displays and a bunch of
switches<00:01:27.009> here<00:01:27.400> on<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.910> left<00:01:28.150> that's<00:01:28.720> all<00:01:28.930> you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
switches here on the left that's all you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.859 
switches here on the left that's all you
got<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:29.590> gotta<00:01:29.950> think<00:01:30.009> ahead<00:01:30.729> how<00:01:31.720> are<00:01:31.780> you

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
got so you gotta think ahead how are you

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.080 
got so you gotta think ahead how are you
gonna<00:01:32.020> maneuver<00:01:32.440> this<00:01:32.530> arm<00:01:32.770> without<00:01:33.090> crashing

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
gonna maneuver this arm without crashing

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.330 
gonna maneuver this arm without crashing
into<00:01:34.270> anything<00:01:35.140> because<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.740> course<00:01:35.979> that

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
into anything because of course that

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.249 
into anything because of course that
would<00:01:36.460> be<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.580> very<00:01:36.850> bad<00:01:37.030> day<00:01:37.090> okay

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
would be a very bad day okay

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.320 
would be a very bad day okay
and<00:01:38.380> what<00:01:38.800> do<00:01:38.890> we<00:01:38.979> control<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.460> arm<00:01:39.610> with<00:01:39.850> well

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
and what do we control the arm with well

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.570 
and what do we control the arm with well
so<00:01:40.630> there's<00:01:41.170> actually<00:01:41.380> two<00:01:41.590> joysticks<00:01:41.920> one

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
so there's actually two joysticks one

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.889 
so there's actually two joysticks one
moves<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.090> end<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.690> arm<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:45.040> know<00:01:45.190> in

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
moves the end of the arm you know in

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.320 
moves the end of the arm you know in
macro<00:01:46.899> motions<00:01:47.320> up-down<00:01:48.160> left-right<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:49.119> out

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
macro motions up-down left-right and out

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330 
macro motions up-down left-right and out
and<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.780> other<00:01:49.869> one<00:01:50.080> moves<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.770> arm<00:01:50.950> and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
and the other one moves the arm and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.960 
and the other one moves the arm and
angles<00:01:52.289> down<00:01:53.289> roll<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.580> y'all<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:56.259> I<00:01:56.710> see<00:01:56.920> a

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
angles down roll and y'all and I see a

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.370 
angles down roll and y'all and I see a
trigger<00:01:57.970> switch<00:01:58.300> down<00:01:58.539> there<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.140> for

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
trigger switch down there is that for

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.029 
trigger switch down there is that for
firing<00:01:59.770> space<00:02:00.310> lasers<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.440> that's<00:02:02.440> only<00:02:02.740> to

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
firing space lasers and that's only to

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.020 
firing space lasers and that's only to
act<00:02:03.340> that's<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:04.000> make<00:02:04.209> the<00:02:04.479> arms<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.819> grab<00:02:06.819> on

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
act that's to make the arms and grab on

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.389 
act that's to make the arms and grab on
to<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.390> payload<00:02:07.929> so<00:02:08.530> that's<00:02:08.770> how<00:02:08.890> we<00:02:09.039> command

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
to a payload so that's how we command

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.520 
to a payload so that's how we command
the<00:02:09.520> hand<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.330> close<00:02:10.600> at<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.050> end<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.319> arm

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the hand to close at the end of the arm

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.070 
the hand to close at the end of the arm
so<00:02:12.100> for<00:02:12.310> example<00:02:12.730> we<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.270> use<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.569> arm<00:02:13.750> to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
so for example we can use the arm to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.730 
so for example we can use the arm to
grab<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.830> cargo<00:02:15.580> vehicle<00:02:16.180> like<00:02:16.600> SpaceX<00:02:17.140> control

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
grab a cargo vehicle like SpaceX control

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.650 
grab a cargo vehicle like SpaceX control
for<00:02:17.920> example<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.430> approaches<00:02:18.880> for<00:02:19.209> these

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
for example and approaches for these

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.480 
for example and approaches for these
spacecrafts<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.830> approach<00:02:21.160> space

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
spacecrafts do is the approach space

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.820 
spacecrafts do is the approach space
station<00:02:21.910> they<00:02:22.390> hover<00:02:22.660> nearby<00:02:23.260> within<00:02:23.650> reach

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
station they hover nearby within reach

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.210 
station they hover nearby within reach
of<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.130> arm<00:02:24.310> we<00:02:24.970> maneuver<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.950> near<00:02:26.950> enough

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
of the arm we maneuver to near enough

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.850 
of the arm we maneuver to near enough
and<00:02:27.520> then<00:02:27.700> pull<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.600> trigger<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.650> hand

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
just grab the spacecraft and then we can

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.300 
just grab the spacecraft and then we can
bring<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.050> spacecraft<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.830> docking<00:02:33.280> port
