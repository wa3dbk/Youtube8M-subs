00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is Lenovo K800 with 32-nm Atom Z2460 chip inside.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the first consumer smartphone made by Lenovo.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But you'll be able to buy it in China only.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, it looks like this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's very thick, too bulky...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It works on Android 2.3.7 and Intel assure that it works much faster than with ARM chips.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, I don't know. From the first sight it seems to be similar.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Here we have micro-USB, huge speaker, volume control, one more speaker, On/Off button, audio jack and... that's all.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It also supports Intel Wireless Display technology, that helps you to stream image from phone to TV. It's like HDMI, but without any cables.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
K800 has 8-MP camera with double LED flash. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It has 4.5-inch TFT-display with 720p resolution.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Intel also claims that they made joint product with Motorola, but we didn't find it here, so we probably have to wait till MWC.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Intel now has two partners — Motorola and Lenovo — and Chineese company made it faster. Well, it's not surprise they can =)
