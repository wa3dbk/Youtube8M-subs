how<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> designer<00:04:48.850> that's<00:04:49.210> how<00:04:49.330> it's<00:04:49.630> made<00:04:49.900> but

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
how a designer that's how it's made but

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.220 
how a designer that's how it's made but
if<00:04:50.950> you<00:04:51.100> it's<00:04:51.580> kind<00:04:51.730> of<00:04:51.820> hard<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.150> see<00:04:52.510> but<00:04:52.750> it's

if you it's kind of hard to see but it's
not<00:04:53.470> flat<00:04:53.830> it's<00:04:54.070> not<00:04:54.370> you<00:04:54.460> know<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.790> bubble

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120

like<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.330> weight<00:04:58.600> going<00:04:58.990> on<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.380> case<00:04:59.620> it's

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
like a weight going on in the case it's

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.920 
like a weight going on in the case it's
not<00:05:00.310> too<00:05:00.550> noticeable<00:05:00.700> you<00:05:01.180> kind<00:05:01.420> of<00:05:01.510> notice<00:05:01.810> it

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
not too noticeable you kind of notice it

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.360 
not too noticeable you kind of notice it
maybe<00:05:02.110> if<00:05:02.230> you<00:05:02.320> put<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.620> closer<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.920> your<00:05:03.130> face

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370

kind of like a weight going around the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.640 
kind of like a weight going around the
on<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.390> whole<00:05:07.540> case<00:05:07.810> there's<00:05:08.050> this<00:05:08.290> part<00:05:08.560> is

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
on the whole case there's this part is

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.170 
on the whole case there's this part is
more<00:05:08.800> recessed<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.400> this<00:05:09.610> part<00:05:09.850> is<00:05:09.910> kind<00:05:10.090> of

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
more recessed in this part is kind of

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.150 
more recessed in this part is kind of
like<00:05:10.270> bubbled<00:05:10.750> up<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:11.020> little<00:05:11.260> bit<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.740> doesn't

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
like bubbled up a little bit it doesn't

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.700 
like bubbled up a little bit it doesn't
affect<00:05:12.430> anything<00:05:12.700> but<00:05:13.090> it<00:05:13.330> is<00:05:13.780> there<00:05:14.140> so<00:05:14.680> I

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
affect anything but it is there so I

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.740 
affect anything but it is there so I
wanted<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.100> mention<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:15.850> of<00:05:16.420> course

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
wanted to mention that and of course

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.630 
wanted to mention that and of course
this<00:05:16.870> case<00:05:17.080> is<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.350> little<00:05:17.680> bulky<00:05:17.920> it<00:05:18.280> doesn't

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
this case is a little bulky it doesn't

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.130 
this case is a little bulky it doesn't
add<00:05:18.880> a<00:05:18.910> little<00:05:19.180> bit<00:05:19.300> of<00:05:19.360> weight<00:05:19.600> but<00:05:19.660> you<00:05:19.930> do

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
add a little bit of weight but you do

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.750 
add a little bit of weight but you do
get<00:05:20.290> so<00:05:20.620> much<00:05:20.770> protection<00:05:21.160> with<00:05:21.400> this<00:05:21.550> case

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
get so much protection with this case

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.990 
get so much protection with this case
and<00:05:21.820> if<00:05:22.510> you<00:05:22.630> want<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:22.930> go<00:05:23.080> with<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:24.000> slimmer

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
and if you want to go with the slimmer

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.330 
and if you want to go with the slimmer
case<00:05:25.270> you<00:05:25.630> can<00:05:25.810> go<00:05:25.930> with<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.320> barely<00:05:27.310> there

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
case you can go with the barely there

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.520 
case you can go with the barely there
and<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:28.180> will<00:05:28.300> be<00:05:28.420> a<00:05:28.450> slimmer<00:05:28.780> option<00:05:29.170> and<00:05:29.320> it

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
and that will be a slimmer option and it

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.230 
and that will be a slimmer option and it
will<00:05:29.650> be<00:05:29.740> five<00:05:29.950> bucks<00:05:30.160> cheaper<00:05:30.460> so<00:05:30.970> there<00:05:31.120> it

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
will be five bucks cheaper so there it

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.210
