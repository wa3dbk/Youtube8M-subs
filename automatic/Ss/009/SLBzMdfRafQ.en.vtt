00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.200
 season star series in the discipline flame 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.330

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.210

 in principle, you have the capital tell us 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 about your fifth player how he got 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.670
 Well, in principle, from what date you already 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.940
 bootcamp name is michael me out of 17 years 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.380
 I will play under the nickname Saren I do not study on 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 the first year of Kiev International 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.890
 university finals pass slowly 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.860
 that is, we train for four days 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.489
 already husband arrived rode the day on the train 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.899
 the coupe is from the principle 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 rested the next day began 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.850
 to train went there before that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.680
 sushi ate there our tradition as 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 Usually, we basically play with a degree 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.480
 understand only her tires are training 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.880
 We are trying to bring some new ones there. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.700
 billet tactics that is to say but in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 Basically, you are already on March 29 a bootcamp. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 her tires literally arrived today 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 first day do you think you have 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.259
 some advantage over them 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.509
 tell me a little about your results 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.979
 training file and you beat them 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.960
 don't you beat 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.750
 show rent or still have 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.299
 some secrets 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.369
 Well, the principle is very experienced 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.650
 a team that doesn't need a bootcamp 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.150
 that is, they play almost the very 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.430
 Beginning of the opening of the Inn Bank that is 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.950
 price world championships visited on in cg 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 i.e. starladder i.e. will be in 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.890
 bootcamp they don't need they need 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.079
 just training online in the same 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.759
 there is this most important factor on lan they 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.399
 show pretty stable sure 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.439
 the game that is nothing new they do not come 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.100
 I will demonstrate how they play 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.040
 By default, well, in principle, everything is there 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.590
 there is the main grimbby flu miss played 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.990
 with them probably for all time corr 20 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.289
 of which we lost but this is 56 cards 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.509
 first so we play circle 1 for 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.170
 cards will lose hand all principle 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.879
 pick up that is such a mushroom and they 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.319
 very unstable i.e. they have if 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.209
 trampled by two people that is they 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.650
 calmly take about as long as someone has 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.260
 the main thing is that two people are tough 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.040
 shot everyone else went there at least 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.739
 two three frags further that is so 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.660
 nothing new well tell a little 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.640
 about t-shirts i see last season 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.349
 There was a new logo now 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.910
 do you have a sponsor or is it you 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.440
 own initiative so to speak 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.569
 have shown here gathered with the guys 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.579
 did t-shirts well and in principle come out 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.660
 with you here the girl manager was running 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.629
 tell us a little about it and generally well 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.209
 T-shirts, we collected did quite 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.150
 spontaneous spontaneously a week before 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.489
 lan-finals before the bootcamp 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.450
 ordered them in St. Petersburg that is, they made them 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.010
 Our manager Marie Key Masha name is Anna 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.319
 This is all organized here brought 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.329
 arrived yesterday that is, we have moral then 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.829
 think such made T-shirts 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.959
 urges that there is such a thing trying 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.549
 there is no such sponsor 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.040
 who sponsors us just played 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.099
 addons that is helping us and morally 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.079
 it helps and a little financially that sorens 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.180
 tomorrow you have the first game on stage right away 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.250
 for her tires if you are already more or less 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.230
 lana you are experienced players then how is your fifth 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.120
 the player who first got on lan 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.400
 do you think he will not let you down 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.349
 Will there be a jitter well and basically yours 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.060
 expectations from the game best of 3 you have 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.829
 there is some kind of damn card 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.720
 certain blanks or you in 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.549
 The last moment will decide what 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.530
 do you 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.239
 certain whet cards is that there are about 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.900
 his movies but they are almost always 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.480
 We play for her tires that is blanks a couple 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.370
 blanks will be but not all cards 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.970
 there is a map which we decided to withdraw 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.010
 that is, we will try to bring them 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.019
 about push i mean i'm quite happy 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.609
 even I did not expect that so well 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.950
 will play on vanya as he shows 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.349
 his shooting right now that is 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.019
 by mushroom and who thought what it was he 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.260
 domestic tiger as they say that is 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.340
 favorite phrase about pushe 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.769
 Well, they did not get used the first day 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.120
 that is, to our pingu new pink there for 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.340
 weave at home 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.380
 here we have a twenty that is he 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.690
 attracted the first day he left 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.789
 stable 1 to 1 now shows 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.889
 practically on all maps the first second 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.889
 a place that is, well, of course 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.470
 unstable games but most of them 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.479
 with a good result end in 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.310
 tell me exactly the direction of the push 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.560
 top 4 forecast here we were just talking 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.270
 with poling he is very confident of his victory 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.639
 but basically put my team on 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.169
 tell me about your ambitions first place 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.699
 Well, in principle, about morality and attitude 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.520
 the team is of course also not uk 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.460
 well, the moral of the team of course 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.190
 very good thanks to mary support 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.039
 kay that is electron that is everything in 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.620
 principle is fine only from this season 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.780
 top 4 will be very unpredictable 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.850
 that is, it all depends on how people in 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.160
 the team about the rod that is depends on 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.139
 how much each player will experience 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.389
 Inca how well over one plays 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.550
 one that is a stable game on 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.780
 how many negatives are there for sale 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.389
 important factor as far as I think that is 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.699
 it all depends on how the teams 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.650
 prepare for the enemy with whom 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.160
 they will play that is but of course 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.510
 top 4 my first place is behind her tires 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.990
 the second probably we are 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.570
 3 Do not drown 4 g-grip nuby mushroom and of course 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.580
 here they bootcamp week helped but 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.380
 their very first games are never just 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.260
 came not used to pingu they became 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.300
 much better for some reason and now 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.310
 for some reason lose ground much worse 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.800
 lego maybe we just got used to it 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.970
 no longer know that is so well 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.370
 probably we will finish on this 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.760
 Give a greeting so we say goodbye to 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.760
