00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.909
 good these methods still did not live the 147 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.710
 the dawn 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.480
 there is a favorite followed by his pile to 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.459
 these hours and good is already a day 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.499
 quite long in terms of news 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.419
 I guess I do not know if it will continue or not 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.829
 will continue but we have news 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.949
 quite interesting during the day of 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.420
 today many have been very good and the 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.060
 true many thanks as always 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.170
 for being there always supporting because the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.779
 true that very much happy very much 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.150
 very much and good we go there to say 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.630
 fuck that seeps into billion 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.630
 open windows 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.510
 well it seems that the creator of 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.920
 gta emissions online you already know that 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.840
 the content creator is available 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.969
 in which we can create therefore different 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.039
 little things but good yet the 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.719
 mission creator had not been seen and 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.899
 to say that the things that 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.670
 we can do it and it seems 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.730
 that we can choose almost all of them not 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.840
 will escape reaching the public that what 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.030
 it is true is that the creator of 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.460
 content is in beta that indicates 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.720
 that will add new new things and 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.180
 this could be one of them 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.350
 with which you have photos and videos and a 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.300
 video the description if you want 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.890
 pass or know the truth pasaros fast 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.880
 because surely they finish it erasing 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.790
 basically in ways that touch almost 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 anything from missions time 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.550
 and such good different different things 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.770
 points of everything basically a lot of 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.060
 a lot of things that are going to lengthen 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.010
 quite what is the life of the game and 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.260
 that I think they should have been for 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.720
 already enough time inside the game 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.920
 because they had done it very very very good 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.170
 the truth I think that seeing all this 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.080
 I think many pages scored 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.270
 too fast the game giving it then 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.189
 sometimes as a 918 most of 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.770
 times a 10 and that is true but 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.479
 I think this kind of thing, then , 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.420
 they should also have scored not 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.100
 must do a reanalysis and good to put 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.600
 good and bad things about us that we 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.580
 Do you have online gta because I think 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.119
 that most analysts have been 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.890
 only then of normal gta mode 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.140
 good campaign, as indicated by the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.420
 the millions of analyzes they have done 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.190
 not only have they scored the mode 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.720
 campaign made by other pages 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.760
 they also did the mode analysis 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.680
 online but good I think they score 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.299
 whole crime is there is a game 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.160
 quite quite complete and quite 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.100
 good in the generation already past the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.450
 true so good I invite you to 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.610
 Take a look to see what to see 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.950
 things that we can touch and such in the way 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.950
 mission and the mission creator
