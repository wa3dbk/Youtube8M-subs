00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.370
 and if you see in there are always clouds and you're 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.009
 that cover the celestial shows 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.410
 this always happens and is not the exception 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.060
 the south pacific where there are some 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.920
 fronts that are turning some 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.600
 weakened others a little more powerful 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.369
 clear look at the area that we are 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.560
 speaking we are not talking about a place 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.779
 that is very tiny we will try to 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 explain is this graph of the nasa 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.529
 where the belt describes the area that 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.390
 is going to cover this total eclipse the area 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.720
 in blue means there is the moon 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.850
 project the shadow and cover absolutely 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.650
 to the sun for whoever is located in that 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.690
 sector which is the only place of land 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.000
 what is playing good here is 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.700
 north east australian peninsula 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.010
 sector is the only one where you will be able to 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.740
 position perfectly already in fact 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.990
 now the road that begins 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.570
 starts here in this sector and 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.480
 ends on this tour here to 800 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.370
 kilometers of the Chilean coast that's why 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.500
 we said that the island archipelagos 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.510
 de pascua and juan fernández are the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.250
 places where good more or less are going to 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.970
 be in the area of ​​this eclipse not in 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.060
 total form but if out there 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.060
 in a partial way evidently all this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.520
 area we said is absolutely maritime 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.620
 there is no population, there are no sectors where 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.960
 there is solid ground where you can see 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.500
 this but there are already a number of several 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.000
 boats that have the elements 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.150
 astronomical to follow 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.040
 also this celestial event only 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.130
 there are some islands at the crossroads more 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.660
 close to the australia areas of the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.970
 Australian or Oceania coast in 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.100
 reality and that afterwards from the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.010
 Pacific Center and Asia Chile 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.729
 there is practically no type of island 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.250
 inhabited at least if it is going to be here 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.380
 in this situation where it is already close 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.660
 to the coasts of Chile 800 kilometers sea 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.580
 in why we said that in this 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.290
 model practically if you 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.880
 watch the argentina you do not see looks 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.590
 only the chile coast these are 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.229
 the sectors from where they will be able to 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.240
 appreciate on our side we said of 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.580
 mendoza to the south there are probabilities 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.800
 to see a little bit the sun bitten by the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.720
 moon already in the sunset because it is going to 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.270
 cover the Andes mountain range 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.250
 West 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.290
 that we practically did not see 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.290
 live the show what
