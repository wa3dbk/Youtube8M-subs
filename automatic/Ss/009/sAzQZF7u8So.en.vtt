00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that the torus actually has correct

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
that the torus actually has correct
freight<00:00:23.550> unit<00:00:23.910> measurements<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.900> the

freelancer needs to be updated so in

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.480 
freelancer needs to be updated so in
order<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> correct<00:00:28.740> amount<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.250> went

order to get the correct amount I went

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.609 
order to get the correct amount I went
ahead<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.970> filled<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> torus<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.260> same<00:00:31.470> way

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
ahead and filled the torus the same way

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.270 
ahead and filled the torus the same way
I<00:00:31.650> did<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.040> freelancer<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.800> came<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:35.010> with

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
I did the freelancer and came up with

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.990 
I did the freelancer and came up with
about<00:00:36.000> five<00:00:36.930> wide<00:00:37.230> six<00:00:37.950> high<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.460> ten<00:00:38.760> deep

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
about five wide six high and ten deep

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.819 
about five wide six high and ten deep
now<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> very<00:00:40.020> end<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.500> wasn't<00:00:40.739> quite

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
now on the very end there wasn't quite

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.930 
now on the very end there wasn't quite
enough<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.100> him<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> put<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.489> long<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:41.879> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
enough for him to put it long way so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.720 
enough for him to put it long way so
there's<00:00:42.390> another<00:00:42.629> 15<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.350> end<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.399> after

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
there's another 15 at the end so after

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.540 
there's another 15 at the end so after
doing<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> math<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.500> 315<00:00:46.500> crates<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
doing the math that's 315 crates if you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090 
doing the math that's 315 crates if you
divide<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> 1900<00:00:49.800> freight

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
divide that up with the 1900 freight

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.549 
divide that up with the 1900 freight
units<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> torus<00:00:51.090> has<00:00:51.199> it<00:00:52.199> gives<00:00:52.410> us<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
units that the torus has it gives us a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.979 
units that the torus has it gives us a
figure<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> six<00:00:53.640> freight<00:00:53.910> units<00:00:54.270> per<00:00:54.570> crate

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
figure of six freight units per crate

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.670 
figure of six freight units per crate
which<00:00:55.980> changes<00:00:56.610> things<00:00:56.910> quite<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.510> bit<00:00:57.840> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
which changes things quite a bit so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
which changes things quite a bit so
before<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.129> get<00:00:59.250> into<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.730> changes<00:01:00.329> on

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
before we get into what that changes on

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510 
before we get into what that changes on
the<00:01:00.539> freelancer<00:01:01.050> let's<00:01:01.230> take<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.920> what

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the freelancer let's take a look at what

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.350 
the freelancer let's take a look at what
the<00:01:02.640> actual<00:01:03.090> tourist<00:01:03.600> cargo<00:01:04.019> capacity<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:05.360> now

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the actual tourist cargo capacity is now

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
the actual tourist cargo capacity is now
this<00:01:06.570> looks<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.350> manageable<00:01:07.619> I'll

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
this looks a little more manageable I'll

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
this looks a little more manageable I'll
hop<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.090> top<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:09.479> crates<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
hop up on top of these crates so you can

hop up on top of these crates so you can
get<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> good<00:01:10.560> view<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.060> what<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.570> fit<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
get a good view of what we can fit in a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.550 
get a good view of what we can fit in a
torus<00:01:16.159> definitely<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> good<00:01:17.610> haul<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.560> much

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
torus definitely a good haul and much

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
torus definitely a good haul and much
more<00:01:19.830> capacity<00:01:19.979> than<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> freelancer<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
more capacity than a freelancer but that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.859 
more capacity than a freelancer but that
brings<00:01:21.840> us<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> next<00:01:22.530> point<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.909> 280

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
brings us to the next point the 280

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.530 
brings us to the next point the 280
freight<00:01:25.229> units<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.850> RSI<00:01:27.270> web

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
freight units that is on the RSI web

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.649 
freight units that is on the RSI web
page<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> capacity<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.060> freelancer

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
page for the capacity of the freelancer

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.230 
page for the capacity of the freelancer
is<00:01:30.979> definitely<00:01:31.979> completely<00:01:32.430> wrong<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
is definitely completely wrong so if the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.390 
is definitely completely wrong so if the
tourist<00:01:33.659> measurements<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.229> correct<00:01:34.590> then

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
tourist measurements are correct then

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.420 
tourist measurements are correct then
the<00:01:35.610> actual<00:01:36.090> freelancer<00:01:37.079> storage<00:01:37.770> capacity

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the actual freelancer storage capacity

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.539 
the actual freelancer storage capacity
is<00:01:38.610> gonna<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> area<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.549> 970

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
is gonna be more in the area of 970

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.149 
is gonna be more in the area of 970
maybe<00:01:42.000> 980<00:01:42.869> freight<00:01:43.200> units<00:01:43.530> instead<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
maybe 980 freight units instead of the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.240 
maybe 980 freight units instead of the
280<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.270> at<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> tourist<00:01:47.130> can

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
280 that it's at now so the tourist can

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.520 
280 that it's at now so the tourist can
hold<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.610> thousand<00:01:48.540> more<00:01:48.630> freight<00:01:48.899> units<00:01:49.229> than

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
hold a thousand more freight units than

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.510 
hold a thousand more freight units than
the<00:01:50.600> freelancer<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.439> far<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.310> size

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the freelancer which as far as size

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.910 
the freelancer which as far as size
comparison<00:01:54.149> goes<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.570> seems<00:01:54.869> much<00:01:55.320> more<00:01:55.350> in

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
comparison goes that seems much more in

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.789 
comparison goes that seems much more in
line<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.570> actual<00:01:57.780> visual<00:01:58.380> reference

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
