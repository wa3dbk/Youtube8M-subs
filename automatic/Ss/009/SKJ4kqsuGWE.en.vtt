00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.139
 and that people like me have been 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.320
 reiter here already back with another map 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.150
 this time with a map for the 360 ​​and it's coming 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.310
 being a map this one that does not have much 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.350
 they do not have much truth but what 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.350
 it's pretty good they're going to see that 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.210
 right now I hope I can convince you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.600
 with that but that if I liked it 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.490
 much what you have is quite and whose 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.860
 judith the batán is quite interesting 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.530
 they will see ok 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.500
 this is an iron farm people this 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.280
 it was a block that is this great house or not 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.949
 I know what to call it is an iron farm 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.249
 who is giving 1100 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.839
 approximately 1100 ingots per hour 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.670
 okay 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.190
 Well the truth works quite well 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.559
 as you can see there is at the door 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.679
 all the goals are coming 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 falling is a pretty efficient farm 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.290
 My friend minecraft sent me 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.440
 technical xbox 360 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.610
 because he has put it on my wall I do not know 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.470
 I put on my wall 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.330
 and well, the Czechs and I said well, let's go 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 see what's up with this with this world 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.800
 Well, I thought it was even more than everything 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 the tutorial I do not know this yes it's like a 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.630
 part of the farm as he wanted here 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.310
 be the tutorial I do not know in fact that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.729
 is being this seems also 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.130
 iron farm by the doors but 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.360
 this one I do not believe but good the important thing 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.100
 is here right now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.960
 take out all the ingots that are 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 falling here because in this in this 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.670
 chest all the ingots come to fall 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.800
 I'm going to take out all this and as you can see 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.860
 I'm taking out and they're getting more 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.380
 As I mentioned, approximately 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.500
 1100 per hour although I think they arrive more 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.350
 because much of 1100 so 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.170
 I already filled the inventory well I 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.810
 I'm going to go for a walk around in 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.270
 the world and they will see how this is 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.610
 will be filling quickly as they can 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.280
 see here the blows are falling 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.860
 constantly to see if one hour falls 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.900
 what I'm seeing there is falling 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.690
 always constantly and they are arriving 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.520
 to all the ingots to this block what 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.090
 What I like about this world is that they have 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.850
 done in a normal world, not what it is 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.920
 I like how they have done this this 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.770
 farm have made it a normal world what 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.180
 usually do again in knots 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.300
 extraplanes so do the tutorials 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.910
 but hey, it looks like he did it here 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.040
 because good if someone wants to play and 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.650
 have that farm in survival world 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.010
 like this one, because here you can perfectly 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.710
 play and enjoy the farm 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.040
 and well I leave all these ingots for 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.040
 here 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.880
 and there it is 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.880
 I was already hungry 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.640
 ok I'm going to take a little spin to see what 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.950
 he has more here but I do not think that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.260
 have a lot just have what comes next 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.640
 being the farm is the most important thing of 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.600
 this world 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.850
 this looks like a trap chest 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.850
 and then here is cooking 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.650
 stones this does not make it look like 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.220
 a farm to have that has inside 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.220
 Water 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.600
 This seems to be where we put the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.040
 I think potatoes do not stop looking for potatoes 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.900
 I think I remember how it was that this was 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.900
 if I put raw potatoes 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.520
 it is past 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.190
 look at raw potatoes 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.930
 Well the fact is that if I sow potatoes 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.370
 or carrot I do not know if you can know 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.100
 Now, if I put that in here, they're going 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.360
 reproducing quickly or are born 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.030
 quickly as you say I do not know in 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.510
 good reality around here has a zombie 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.420
 with full iron armor as you can see and 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.940
 because he has everything the truth that he has 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.400
 emeralds and mounts that will be 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.950
 enough armor for your horses 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.420
 labels and then of all the truth has 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.450
 everything here 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.190
 enchanted swords the one that has most 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.920
 here good study blessing for 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.190
 build positions because I imagine that 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.160
 they have many 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.160
 here it has nothing of what they put 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.130
 It has enough things 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.240
 ok that a horse called rogelio 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.460
 street that is called rock the decline good 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.290
 now let's go to this this part of 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.210
 here that there is a farm of maps a 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.920
 pretty curious farm I do not know what wave 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.800
 because I had never seen this system 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.780
 in monster farms 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.550
 and we're going to see that I do not know if it works at 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.759
 one hundred percent as you can see there they are 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.700
 moving pistons constantly those 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.760
 big 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.130
 and they are constantly moving and 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.000
 here is the system of how they have 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.590
 done but 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.560
 As I mentioned, I never had 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.280
 seen this kind of system to for 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.540
 mods to wear and all that but it's weird not 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.210
 I know if it works 100% but good can 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:37.740
 try it arkeolan this boat I do not know for 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.950
 what will it be and here is a chest up 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.140
 there is a chest with the items that 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.720
 go out of the mods that are going 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.730
 dying ok and you have to have a bit of 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.160
 be careful because some are still 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.530
 that have not died then 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.380
 you have to be careful now because I 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.409
 I'm going to go to the chest where the 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.199
 farm of the five-three iron 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.169
 how is everything to see if they have fallen a lot 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.669
 plus 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.279
 can see from here they are burning and 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.869
 then obviously this is 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:14.499
 filling up quickly as you can see 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:17.080
 when I left there was only one and now 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:19.149
 because already we are filling up faster 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.729
 they listened a moment ago this the 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:23.230
 neighbor this week the neighbor has 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.070
 past 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.070
 they listen 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.400
 they are building I do not know what they are 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.860
 making an apartment there next and a 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.560

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.680
