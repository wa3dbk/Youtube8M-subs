hi<00:00:12.420> everybody<00:00:12.690> Mike<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.139> again<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.280> seem<00:00:15.179> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
hi everybody Mike here again I seem to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.420 
hi everybody Mike here again I seem to
have<00:00:15.450> created<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.990> firestorm<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.890> people

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
have created a firestorm of people

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.970 
have created a firestorm of people
arguing<00:00:18.390> back<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.660> forth<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.350> whether<00:00:19.890> or

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
arguing back and forth as to whether or

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.050 
arguing back and forth as to whether or
not<00:00:20.420> my<00:00:21.420> problems<00:00:21.840> here<00:00:22.080> were<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
not my problems here were on the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.189 
not my problems here were on the
reversed<00:00:25.519> insertion<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.090> easements<00:00:28.080> on

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
reversed insertion of the easements on

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.410 
reversed insertion of the easements on
each<00:00:28.349> end<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> super<00:00:29.340> elevated<00:00:29.760> track<00:00:30.029> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
each end of the super elevated track and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.939 
each end of the super elevated track and
there<00:00:30.539> seems<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.260> discrepancy

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
there seems to be some discrepancy

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.799 
there seems to be some discrepancy
people<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.480> put<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.690> in

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
people think that you can put them in

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.209 
people think that you can put them in
the<00:00:33.930> wrong<00:00:34.110> way<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> I'm<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> show<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the wrong way and I'm going to show you

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.770 
the wrong way and I'm going to show you
that<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.579> can't<00:00:35.850> put<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> wrong<00:00:36.570> way

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
that you can't put them in the wrong way

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.380 
that you can't put them in the wrong way
so<00:00:37.559> let's<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.190> take<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> look<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> probably<00:00:39.239> do

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
so let's go take a look and probably do

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.240 
so let's go take a look and probably do
some<00:00:39.629> still<00:00:39.899> pictures<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.440> opposed<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> videos

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
some still pictures as opposed to videos

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040 
some still pictures as opposed to videos
I<00:00:41.579> don't<00:00:41.790> know<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.210> let's<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> look<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
I don't know but let's take a look and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.029 
I don't know but let's take a look and
I'll<00:00:43.110> show<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.379> why<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.739> can't<00:00:45.770> okay<00:00:46.770> gang

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I'll show you why you can't okay gang

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.450 
I'll show you why you can't okay gang
today<00:00:48.440> for<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.559> demonstration<00:00:49.739> we're<00:00:50.430> going

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
today for my demonstration we're going

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.630 
today for my demonstration we're going
to<00:00:50.579> use<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:51.210> super<00:00:52.140> elevated<00:00:53.449> 183<00:00:54.449> which<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
to use a super elevated 183 which is a

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.450 
to use a super elevated 183 which is a
12<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.820> 3/8<00:00:57.180> an<00:00:57.360> 11<00:00:57.780> inch<00:00:57.899> radius<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.980> 12

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
12 and 3/8 an 11 inch radius and the 12

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.479 
12 and 3/8 an 11 inch radius and the 12
and<00:00:59.579> 3/8<00:00:59.850> and<00:00:59.969> 11<00:01:00.270> inch<00:01:00.390> radius<00:01:00.539> easement<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
and 3/8 and 11 inch radius easement and

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.299 
and 3/8 and 11 inch radius easement and
let's<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.640> how<00:01:02.699> they<00:01:02.850> fit<00:01:03.030> together

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
let's see how they fit together

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.560 
let's see how they fit together
okay<00:01:05.309> guys<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> piece<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
okay guys here is a piece of the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.490 
okay guys here is a piece of the
easement<00:01:10.220> attached<00:01:11.220> incorrectly<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.500> while

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
easement attached incorrectly and while

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.760 
easement attached incorrectly and while
yes<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.340> cram<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.909> together<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.500> see

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
yes you can cram it together you can see

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.320 
yes you can cram it together you can see
that<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.100> obviously<00:01:17.549> does<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.970> fit<00:01:18.299> properly

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that it obviously does not fit properly

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.560 
that it obviously does not fit properly
I<00:01:19.220> mean<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.310> pretty<00:01:20.460> obvious<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.299> by<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
I mean it's pretty obvious and by the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.890 
I mean it's pretty obvious and by the
way<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.729> track<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> jointer<00:01:24.360> sit<00:01:24.750> in

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
way the track and the jointer sit in

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.499 
way the track and the jointer sit in
there<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.130> road<00:01:26.310> bed<00:01:26.549> itself<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.299> should

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
there and the road bed itself it should

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
there and the road bed itself it should
be<00:01:27.630> relatively<00:01:28.110> obvious<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.250> doesn't

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
be relatively obvious that it doesn't

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.569 
be relatively obvious that it doesn't
match<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:30.079> also<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.710> bottom<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.280> wanted<00:01:32.520> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
match up also on the bottom I wanted to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.030 
match up also on the bottom I wanted to
point<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.270> some<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.930> someone<00:01:34.350> did<00:01:34.560> there

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
point out that some as someone did there

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.910 
point out that some as someone did there
is<00:01:35.780> an<00:01:37.100> arrow<00:01:39.290> right<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.850> there<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.920> when

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
is an arrow right in there and when

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
is an arrow right in there and when
you're<00:01:44.040> using<00:01:44.250> super<00:01:44.729> elevated<00:01:45.240> track<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you're using super elevated track the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.789 
you're using super elevated track the
arrows<00:01:46.409> should<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> arrows<00:01:47.790> if<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> flat

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
arrows should go to arrows if it is flat

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
arrows should go to arrows if it is flat
track<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.610> no<00:01:50.880> arrow<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> don't

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
track there is no arrow so if you don't

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.490 
track there is no arrow so if you don't
have<00:01:52.979> arrows<00:01:53.250> joining<00:01:54.119> they're<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.259> there

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
have arrows joining they're on there

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.690 
have arrows joining they're on there
incorrectly<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.130> let's<00:01:59.340> turn<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.640> around

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
incorrectly so let's turn this around

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.200 
incorrectly so let's turn this around
and<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.299> what<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> looks<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.750> proper<00:02:02.210> okay

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and see what it looks like proper okay

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
and see what it looks like proper okay
guys<00:02:03.390> here's<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.229> easement<00:02:04.979> installed

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
guys here's the easement installed

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.419 
guys here's the easement installed
properly<00:02:05.930> if<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.140> installed<00:02:07.590> properly<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
properly if it's installed properly you

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.020 
properly if it's installed properly you
will<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.330> there<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.840> no<00:02:10.730> raising<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
will see that there is no raising of the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.780 
will see that there is no raising of the
joiners<00:02:12.480> or<00:02:12.690> anything<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.890> roadbed<00:02:14.459> fits

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
joiners or anything the roadbed fits

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.600 
joiners or anything the roadbed fits
perfectly<00:02:15.270> flush

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
perfectly flush

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.800 
perfectly flush
and<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:19.670> have<00:02:19.820> arrow<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.330> arrow<00:02:20.690> there<00:02:22.810> no

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
and we have arrow to arrow there no

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.000 
and we have arrow to arrow there no
arrow<00:02:24.310> there<00:02:25.310> which<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:27.380> end<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.800> should

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
arrow there which is the end that should

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.380 
arrow there which is the end that should
go<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.190> your<00:02:28.490> flat<00:02:28.760> track

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
go to your flat track

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.840 
go to your flat track
I<00:02:30.910> hope<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.090> clears<00:02:32.390> up<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.720> confusion<00:02:33.140> and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
I hope this clears up the confusion and

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.610 
I hope this clears up the confusion and
Wildlife's<00:02:34.850> well<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.540> stand<00:02:35.930> corrected<00:02:36.140> in

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
Wildlife's well I stand corrected in

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.240 
Wildlife's well I stand corrected in
that<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.700> usable<00:02:38.270> or<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:39.290> connectible<00:02:40.040> it

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
that it is usable or is connectible it

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.490 
that it is usable or is connectible it
should<00:02:41.120> be<00:02:41.240> obvious<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:42.020> connected

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
should be obvious that it's connected

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.330 
should be obvious that it's connected
incorrectly<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> anyway<00:02:45.740> I<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:45.890> wanted<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
incorrectly so anyway I just wanted to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.610 
incorrectly so anyway I just wanted to
clear<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.760> up<00:02:46.820> for<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.210> people<00:02:47.510> who<00:02:47.660> seem<00:02:48.590> to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
clear this up for the people who seem to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.490 
clear this up for the people who seem to
be<00:02:48.860> confused<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:50.630> method<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:50.990> using<00:02:51.380> this

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
be confused on the method of using this

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.320 
be confused on the method of using this
stuff<00:02:53.920> I'd<00:02:54.920> also<00:02:55.160> like<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.520> point<00:02:55.640> out<00:02:56.000> that

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
stuff I'd also like to point out that

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.780 
stuff I'd also like to point out that
it's<00:02:56.870> very<00:02:57.290> clearly<00:02:57.680> stated<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.430> back<00:02:58.610> of

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
it's very clearly stated on the back of

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.190 
it's very clearly stated on the back of
the<00:02:58.880> package<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.880> easements<00:03:01.880> as<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.780> how

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
the package of the easements as to how

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.890 
the package of the easements as to how
they<00:03:03.410> should<00:03:03.440> be<00:03:03.709> put<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:05.390> even<00:03:05.660> shows

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
they should be put in and it even shows

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.340 
they should be put in and it even shows
you<00:03:05.930> where<00:03:06.470> they<00:03:06.800> need<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.130> go<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.720> if<00:03:09.020> you<00:03:09.170> put

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
you where they need to go so if you put

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.510 
you where they need to go so if you put
them<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.590> backwards<00:03:10.040> you're<00:03:10.190> not<00:03:10.340> reading

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
them in backwards you're not reading

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.130 
them in backwards you're not reading
instructions<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.420> course<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.660> lot<00:03:11.810> of<00:03:11.840> us<00:03:11.959> don't

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
instructions of course a lot of us don't

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.370 
instructions of course a lot of us don't
do<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.620> but<00:03:12.920> nevertheless<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.720> information

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
do that but nevertheless the information

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.920 
do that but nevertheless the information
is<00:03:15.530> all<00:03:15.709> here<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.780> make<00:03:17.900> sure

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
is all here you just have to make sure

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.350 
is all here you just have to make sure
you<00:03:18.140> put<00:03:18.320> them<00:03:18.440> on<00:03:18.560> correctly<00:03:18.980> but<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.820> hope

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
you put them on correctly but I hope

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.930 
you put them on correctly but I hope
this<00:03:20.570> clears<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.019> up<00:03:21.110> for<00:03:21.290> everybody<00:03:21.940> okay

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
this clears it up for everybody okay

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.970 
this clears it up for everybody okay
guys<00:03:23.269> as<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.690> see<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:24.019> stand<00:03:24.320> corrected<00:03:24.830> in

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
guys as you can see I stand corrected in

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.199 
guys as you can see I stand corrected in
the<00:03:25.010> fact<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.550> can't<00:03:25.760> connect<00:03:26.090> them

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
the fact that you can't connect them

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.199 
the fact that you can't connect them
together<00:03:26.360> but<00:03:26.930> as<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:28.010> said<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.790> should<00:03:29.060> be

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
together but as I said it should be

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.880 
together but as I said it should be
relatively<00:03:29.810> obvious<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.739> they<00:03:30.860> are

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
relatively obvious that they are

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.100 
relatively obvious that they are
incorrect<00:03:31.730> because<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.239> joiners<00:03:32.600> don't<00:03:32.870> even

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
incorrect because the joiners don't even

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.390 
incorrect because the joiners don't even
begin<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.800> match<00:03:34.190> up<00:03:34.430> properly<00:03:35.980> although<00:03:36.980> it

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
begin to match up properly although it

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.940 
begin to match up properly although it
can<00:03:37.580> be<00:03:37.610> crammed<00:03:38.030> together<00:03:38.200> but<00:03:39.200> anyways<00:03:39.650> I

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
can be crammed together but anyways I

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.680 
can be crammed together but anyways I
hope<00:03:40.160> this<00:03:40.310> helps<00:03:40.640> everybody<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.360> proper

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
hope this helps everybody in the proper

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.780 
hope this helps everybody in the proper
use<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:41.900> easements<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.920> Cato<00:03:43.130> unit<00:03:43.550> rack

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
use of easements on the Cato unit rack

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.530 
use of easements on the Cato unit rack
and<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.090> scale<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:45.970> hope<00:03:46.970> everybody<00:03:47.239> gets

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
and in scale and I hope everybody gets

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.390 
and in scale and I hope everybody gets
the<00:03:47.660> track<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.530> relevant<00:03:48.890> problems<00:03:49.250> and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
the track the relevant problems and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.229 
the track the relevant problems and
stuff<00:03:49.489> sorted<00:03:49.910> out<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.300> my<00:03:50.480> case<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.930> was<00:03:50.959> just

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
stuff sorted out in my case it was just

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.380 
stuff sorted out in my case it was just
letting<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.450> track<00:03:53.720> find<00:03:54.110> its<00:03:54.290> natural<00:03:54.530> plane

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
letting the track find its natural plane

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.790 
letting the track find its natural plane
but<00:03:56.390> anyways<00:03:56.750> we'll<00:03:56.959> talk<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.320> guys<00:03:57.380> next
