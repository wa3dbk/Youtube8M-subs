00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 well then how is it only 39 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.720
 welcome to the block to bruce 2 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.700
 in this second video of recommendations 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.420
 to recommend a lot of movies 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.170
 music series and a lot more things like that 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 let's start 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.900
 in the movies good first I want 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.110
 start with a movie that is 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.450
 right now at the jurassic world cinema in 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.370
 true this movie fascinated me I was 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.200
 so fan of the saga the truth is that I am 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.510
 the first movie because it's a classic 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.550
 the others did not attract my attention because 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.739
 if you have much of the same and this 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.780
 new movie, that is, if it is very 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.300
 same the park opens all that roll 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.040
 but it has a different touch I liked it 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.410
 the humor of the movie the taste the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.260
 new story the new cast and about 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.210
 all the pliers the truth is that I went 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.610
 very fan that this movie makes you 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.140
 He mocks the other movies by saying 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.690
 how is it possible that after 3 to 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.000
 massacre we have opened another park that 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.160
 I liked it so much I was such a fan of 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.500
 movies but that was very fan of the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.540
 video game this video game where you 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.460
 you could create your own park them from 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.800
 counts as the sims but from 'jurassic 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.600
 park ' was a very intense game 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.460
 I recommend and I also recommend that 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.920
 go now to the cinema to see jurassic 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.660
 world I do not know what they are waiting for another 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.640
 movie that I want to recommend you for 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.620
 this fascination that I have with disney is 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.480
 sebin mister danks 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.250
 many people did not see it because he believed 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.470
 that would be boring but the truth is that 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.630
 it's a very interesting movie we 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.210
 tells the whole story behind it 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.280
 de mary poppins all the work that you 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.080
 it cost Walt Disney to convince the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.910
 mary poppins height for you 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.370
 give up the rights either make the 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.040
 movie that we know I'm tom fan 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.290
 hanks I'm a fan of bully are a gem of 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.330
 disney and good leaving us a little 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.070
 I also want to recommend a movie 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.070
 It looks like disney quality but 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.670
 that is not disney and anastasia is not 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.010
 disney 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.350
 this sex movie and century fox but 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.320
 the truth is something extraordinary the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.390
 animation is impeccable and it is based 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.820
 in a real story you know it from russia 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.200
 the Romans good a small part is 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.660
 truth and the rest they invented a 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.290
 good but in essence it was taken out of the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.290
 true story 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.260
 I am very fan and good the last movie 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.870
 that I want to recommend in this video 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.630
 is the edge of tomorrow at the edge of 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.190
 tomorrow with tom cruise and emily blunt 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.080
 Without a doubt, this is the best 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.000
 movie I've seen of tom cruise the 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.490
 action is amazing the story is very 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.500
 exciting the effects do not say are 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.180
 incredible you have no idea what it is 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.800
 what is happening up to half of 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.640
 the movie but when you understand what 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.470
 pass 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.030
 It's a very different story to what 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.760
 we're used to and that's what 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.110
 I liked it I recommend it and good now 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.110
 let's go with the series 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.410
 in this video I will not comment 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.030
 lots of series because in the video 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.960
 last I recommended many of them so I'm going 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.700
 to wait for them to catch up 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.830
 with those that I already recommended for 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.420
 can recommend more but good if not 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.310
 they like the ones I recommended in the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.920
 last video today I bring you some series 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.870
 different I recommend the series of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.550
 gabon that is something like big bang 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.350
 theory 'but instead of turning around 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.150
 science revolves around women 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.550
 I really like the character 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.530
 main is hilarious to see how he 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.990
 try to have your friends rejected 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.940
 get girlfriend I swear they will have fun 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.430
 seeing it and good another series that 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.320
 I want to recommend is Joe if I already know 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.330
 I had mentioned in my top 5 series 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.220
 favorites but I want that now if in 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.770
 truth give the series a chance 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.170
 is a very good series about the 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.600
 richest families of orange county in 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.640
 california the topics that you see in these 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.250
 series are real-life issues the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.690
 series and teen drama par excellence 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.820
 after identifying with a lot of 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.170
 the characters and really that ends 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.170
 wishing to live in california 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.170
 and well it was time to talk about 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.660
 comics today I'm going to recommend some 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.850
 of my favorite comics that 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.860
 they accommodated it opened a little fast the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.620
 comic that I recommend you today is the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.140
 good spider comic is really a 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.670
 marvel treasure in this comic and 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.709
 we come out of the normal is no longer the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.230
 protagonist Peter Parker now the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.730
 protagonist is gwen stacy let's say that 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.400
 He left behind his michelle role in 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.410
 danger and today the heroine is the spider 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.790
 Now it's itchy and the super-powerful 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.740
 to her 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.650
 the design of the character is fascinating 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.780
 the drawings in the comic are very strange 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.420
 this in a different touch to the comic I 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.460
 like and the truth is that this comic just 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.290
 makes me dream of getting to see in the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.030
 cinema to spider wing 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.220
 imagine what it would have been like 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.110
 movie starring the cane in 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.810
 truth would be all that the 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.300
 life plus this comic has 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.040
 that is starting here in Mexico so 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.200
 if they go to a magazine stand or they can 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.150
 find it from the start is a good 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.190
 opportunity for you if you are not 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.630
 convinced to buy comics start at 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.590
 collect those that 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.480
 doing what is truly a treasure is 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.480
 the most innovative code I've seen 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.090
 unlike previous video from 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.430

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.499

 Very fun game for your iphone or 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:23.050
 Android hardware galactic defense is a 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.840
 very fun game to hang out 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.659
 you choose your side at your arrival and you 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.240
 you have your own troop and you take care of 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.129
 exterminate enemies is not the best game 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.779
 of history but as you will know I do not 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.639
 I'm a fan of video games the truth is 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:39.279

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:47.610
 Free time waiting wherever it is 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.610

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.130
