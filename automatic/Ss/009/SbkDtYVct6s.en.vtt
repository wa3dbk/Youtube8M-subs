00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.210
 really five stacks the 50th d5 ​​stacks 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.590
 fireworks upstairs and really looked 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.400
 super greasy 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.470
 would you really so fucking fat life 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.970
 only unfortunately it failed so we have 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 to be back a little fireworks 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.220
 so that you can still have the feeling 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.640
 how it was and everything 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.640
 something like that 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.070

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.110
 pot feeling was a block of fireworks 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.660
 really a whole lot of fireworks was at and 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.100
 yes he was just a fact teasing to such 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.130
 fact that they did 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.260
 and you have to go upstairs 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.810
 but I certainly will not stand up to you completely 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.410
 no i don't think i'm on here so you 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.410
 try to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.459
 I think they have just finished my life 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.459

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:01.280

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.390
 to skip 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.970

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.440

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.260

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.580
 so fixed can still last ff but if 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.850
 we have those reports then I go 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.530
 start on my arm and I watch so much 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.350
 fancy because I actually have nothing 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.700

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.620

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.750
 I waved goodbye to it 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:15.379
 so yes let's just be a lumberjack 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.880
 then i thought i could put my own soul to me 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.310
 uncomfortable to be back after a few days 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.290
 comment back because I am one 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.479
 few days no child king videos 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.520
 and it now feels a bit more 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.940
 yes you would like to know what we link ourselves 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.940

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.960
 I also said that this video is not 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.180
 that is how long it is likely 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.750
 really could not be finished long 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.669
 because it's just an update about the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.669

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.010

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.560

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.300

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.090

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.030
