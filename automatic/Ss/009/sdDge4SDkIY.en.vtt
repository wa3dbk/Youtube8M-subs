00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
fortunately it's a whole different game

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.719

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
get to play as five snails from the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.730 
get to play as five snails from the
movie<00:01:14.040> only<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.610> time<00:01:14.940> there's<00:01:15.710> actually<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
movie only this time there's actually a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
movie only this time there's actually a
functional<00:01:17.580> video<00:01:17.759> game<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.390> play<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.840> in

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
functional video game to play them in

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.050 
functional video game to play them in
now<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> doesn't<00:01:19.770> take<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> obvious<00:01:20.399> path<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
now it doesn't take the obvious path and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.150 
now it doesn't take the obvious path and
just<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:21.539> for<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> kart<00:01:22.140> style<00:01:22.470> racing<00:01:22.920> game

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
just go for a kart style racing game

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.430 
just go for a kart style racing game
console<00:01:23.970> version<00:01:24.270> borrows<00:01:24.570> less<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:25.050> Mario

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
console version borrows less from Mario

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.760 
console version borrows less from Mario
Kart<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:26.310> Tony<00:01:26.850> Hawk<00:01:27.170> turbo<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.229> basically<00:01:28.649> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
Kart then Tony Hawk turbo is basically a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
Kart then Tony Hawk turbo is basically a
skateboarding<00:01:29.520> game<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> Wii<00:01:30.119> U<00:01:30.149> only

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
skateboarding game on the Wii U only

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.520 
skateboarding game on the Wii U only
with<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.850> traded<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.479> skateboards<00:01:34.259> for

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
with like it traded the skateboards for

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.279 
with like it traded the skateboards for
snails<00:01:35.330> wait<00:01:36.330> that's<00:01:36.539> actually<00:01:36.690> kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
snails wait that's actually kind of a

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.130 
snails wait that's actually kind of a
brilliant<00:01:37.710> idea

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.719 

so<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.229> works<00:01:43.410> like<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.770> each<00:01:44.039> level<00:01:44.429> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so it works like this each level is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
so it works like this each level is
basically<00:01:45.149> set<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.200> skate<00:01:46.470> park

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
basically set up like the skate park

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.639 
basically set up like the skate park
there<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.220> ramps<00:01:47.520> jumps<00:01:48.450> rails<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
there are ramps jumps rails all the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.050 
there are ramps jumps rails all the
stuff<00:01:49.890> you'd<00:01:50.039> expect<00:01:50.070> from<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> old<00:01:50.820> Tony

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
stuff you'd expect from the old Tony

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
stuff you'd expect from the old Tony
Hawk<00:01:51.330> games<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> bunch<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
Hawk games they also have a bunch of

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
Hawk games they also have a bunch of
different<00:01:52.979> objectives<00:01:53.759> pulling<00:01:54.270> off<00:01:54.420> point

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
different objectives pulling off point

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.200 
different objectives pulling off point
combos<00:01:55.259> collecting<00:01:55.860> power-ups<00:01:56.280> making<00:01:57.150> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
combos collecting power-ups making a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.060 
combos collecting power-ups making a
certain<00:01:57.570> jump<00:01:57.840> things<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
certain jump things like that so you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.590 
certain jump things like that so you
actually<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> play<00:01:59.909> them<00:02:00.150> several<00:02:00.570> times

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
actually have to play them several times

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.749 
actually have to play them several times
to<00:02:01.079> accomplish<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> objectives<00:02:02.310> which

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
to accomplish all the objectives which

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.380 
to accomplish all the objectives which
unlocks<00:02:03.360> more<00:02:03.630> courses<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.210> do<00:02:06.210> like

unlocks more courses you know I do like

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.660 
unlocks more courses you know I do like
the<00:02:06.600> concept<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.380> mean<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.920> racing<00:02:08.310> game<00:02:08.340> would

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the concept I mean the racing game would

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.460 
the concept I mean the racing game would
have<00:02:08.759> been<00:02:08.850> obvious<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.540> at<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.019> very<00:02:10.229> least

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
have been obvious so at the very least

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.590 
have been obvious so at the very least
doing<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.400> kind<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.760> game<00:02:11.940> shows<00:02:12.239> some

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
doing this kind of game shows some

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.440 
doing this kind of game shows some
creativity<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.890> thing<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:15.180> gameplay

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
creativity but thing is the gameplay

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.569 
creativity but thing is the gameplay
seems<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.019> be<00:02:16.170> at<00:02:16.260> odds<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> genre<00:02:17.310> which

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
seems to be at odds with the genre which

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.330 
seems to be at odds with the genre which
is<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.910> say<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.660> plays<00:02:19.320> more<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.799> racing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
is to say it plays more like a racing

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.520 
is to say it plays more like a racing
game<00:02:20.370> trying<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> Tony<00:02:21.780> Hawk<00:02:22.019> game<00:02:22.320> and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
game trying to be a Tony Hawk game and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.320 
game trying to be a Tony Hawk game and
not<00:02:23.280> quite<00:02:23.700> pulling<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.239> off

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.140 

haha<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.590> what<00:02:29.739> does<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:29.860> mean<00:02:30.159> well<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
haha so what does that mean well the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.119 
haha so what does that mean well the
snails<00:02:31.480> control<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.379> they're<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.709> racing

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
snails control like they're in a racing

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.619 
snails control like they're in a racing
game<00:02:33.159> it's<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.700> they<00:02:34.060> only<00:02:34.209> want<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.510> move

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
game it's like they only want to move

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.080 
game it's like they only want to move
forward<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.319> turning<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.010> bit<00:02:36.159> tough<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.760> a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
forward so turning is a bit tough in a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.240 
forward so turning is a bit tough in a
game<00:02:37.239> predicated<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.049> turning<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.769> freedom

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
game predicated on turning and freedom

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.670 
game predicated on turning and freedom
of<00:02:39.400> movement<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:40.450> kind<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.810> an<00:02:40.930> issue<00:02:41.080> that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
of movement it's kind of an issue that

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.740 
of movement it's kind of an issue that
doesn't<00:02:41.890> ruin<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.340> game<00:02:42.610> or<00:02:42.849> anything<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.360> it

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
doesn't ruin the game or anything but it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.720 
doesn't ruin the game or anything but it
does<00:02:43.930> make<00:02:44.170> navigating<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.830> courses<00:02:45.310> really

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
does make navigating the courses really

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.910 
does make navigating the courses really
difficult<00:02:46.180> at<00:02:46.299> times<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:47.230> also<00:02:47.440> means<00:02:47.769> it

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
difficult at times that also means it

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.680 
difficult at times that also means it
can<00:02:48.040> be<00:02:48.129> tough<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.370> pull<00:02:48.730> off<00:02:48.760> tricks<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.510> mean

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
can be tough to pull off tricks I mean

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.420 
can be tough to pull off tricks I mean
you're<00:02:49.840> gonna<00:02:49.930> miss<00:02:50.230> jumps<00:02:50.769> slam<00:02:51.310> yourself

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
you're gonna miss jumps slam yourself

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.940 
you're gonna miss jumps slam yourself
into<00:02:51.879> walls<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.840> controls<00:02:53.260> just<00:02:53.379> aren't

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
into walls the controls just aren't

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.250 
into walls the controls just aren't
ideal<00:02:54.069> another<00:02:54.970> problem<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.510> your

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
ideal another problem is that your

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.259 
ideal another problem is that your
snails<00:02:56.590> don't<00:02:57.099> seem<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.519> know<00:02:57.700> many<00:02:57.940> tricks

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
snails don't seem to know many tricks

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.509 
snails don't seem to know many tricks
you<00:02:58.870> just<00:02:59.049> keep<00:02:59.260> doing<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.620> same<00:02:59.829> ones<00:03:00.099> which

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
you just keep doing the same ones which

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.880 
you just keep doing the same ones which
obviously<00:03:00.849> gets<00:03:01.150> boring<00:03:01.540> pretty<00:03:01.690> quickly<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
obviously gets boring pretty quickly the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.589 
obviously gets boring pretty quickly the
game<00:03:05.920> doesn't<00:03:06.400> offer<00:03:06.489> much<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:07.150> terms<00:03:07.420> of

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
game doesn't offer much in terms of

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.839 
game doesn't offer much in terms of
variety<00:03:07.780> or<00:03:08.470> content<00:03:09.069> either<00:03:09.250> one<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.790> the

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
variety or content either one of the

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.729 
variety or content either one of the
objectives<00:03:10.390> are<00:03:10.569> generally<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.319> same<00:03:11.500> kind

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
objectives are generally the same kind

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.009 
objectives are generally the same kind
of<00:03:11.799> thing<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.430> with<00:03:12.519> only<00:03:12.640> six<00:03:12.790> courses<00:03:13.390> it

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
of thing and with only six courses it

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.809 
of thing and with only six courses it
doesn't<00:03:14.440> feel<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.620> there's<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.950> lot<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:15.310> do<00:03:15.519> I

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
doesn't feel like there's a lot to do I

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.270 
doesn't feel like there's a lot to do I
mean<00:03:16.269> there<00:03:16.629> is<00:03:16.750> two-player<00:03:17.230> co-op<00:03:17.560> which<00:03:18.099> is

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
mean there is two-player co-op which is

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.069 
mean there is two-player co-op which is
nice<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.760> can<00:03:19.239> design<00:03:19.390> your<00:03:19.569> own<00:03:19.780> co-op

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
nice you can design your own co-op

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.740 
nice you can design your own co-op
courses<00:03:20.769> but<00:03:21.040> it's<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:22.120> really<00:03:22.420> just<00:03:22.660> a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
courses but it's it's really just a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.710 
courses but it's it's really just a
matter<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.049> picking<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.739> few<00:03:23.950> obstacles<00:03:24.720> still

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
matter of picking a few obstacles still

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.380 
matter of picking a few obstacles still
yeah<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:26.470> version<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:27.010> turbo<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.700> at<00:03:28.120> least

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
yeah this version of turbo is at least

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.110 
yeah this version of turbo is at least
functional<00:03:29.109> and<00:03:29.290> coherent<00:03:30.010> it's<00:03:30.579> not<00:03:30.730> great

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
functional and coherent it's not great

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.500 
functional and coherent it's not great
but<00:03:31.480> it's<00:03:32.079> it's<00:03:32.410> an<00:03:32.560> okay<00:03:33.069> movie<00:03:33.099> tie-in<00:03:33.910> or<00:03:34.150> at

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
