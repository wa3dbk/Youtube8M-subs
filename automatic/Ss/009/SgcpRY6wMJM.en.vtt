00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.990 

not<00:02:43.410> better<00:02:43.590> off<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:44.130> was<00:02:44.400> expecting<00:02:44.819> these<00:02:44.940> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
not better off I was expecting these to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.670 
not better off I was expecting these to
say<00:02:45.330> it's<00:02:45.450> pretty<00:02:45.690> bad<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.230> Jeep<00:02:46.440> Lux

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
say it's pretty bad like the Jeep Lux

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.890 
say it's pretty bad like the Jeep Lux
but<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:48.329> pretty<00:02:48.540> good<00:02:49.700> these<00:02:50.700> cost<00:02:51.060> 50<00:02:51.780> P

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
but on the pretty good these cost 50 P

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.090 
but on the pretty good these cost 50 P
for<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.140> pocket<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.530> think<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.769> was<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:52.950> offer

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
for a pocket I think that was on offer

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.819 
for a pocket I think that was on offer
so<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.670> think<00:02:54.360> 50<00:02:54.630> P<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.840> definitely<00:02:55.170> worth<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.530> I

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
so I think 50 P is definitely worth it I

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.789 
so I think 50 P is definitely worth it I
pound<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.790> seems<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.359> little<00:02:57.510> bit<00:02:57.630> steep<00:02:58.410> but

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
pound it it seems a little bit steep but

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.740 
pound it it seems a little bit steep but
um<00:02:59.450> yeah<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:01.250> that's<00:03:02.250> pretty<00:03:02.340> much<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.750> thanks
