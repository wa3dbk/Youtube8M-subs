00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
on my rat 7 mouse so when i'm cancelling

on my rat 7 mouse so when i'm cancelling
the<00:00:38.040> pump<00:00:38.250> animation<00:00:38.730> basically<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.719> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the pump animation basically I have to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.139 
the pump animation basically I have to
accurately<00:00:40.379> go<00:00:40.680> through<00:00:41.010> two<00:00:41.309> graduations<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
accurately go through two graduations of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
accurately go through two graduations of
that<00:00:42.300> thumb<00:00:42.540> wheel<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.230> cancels<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that thumb wheel and it cancels the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.020 
that thumb wheel and it cancels the
animation<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:46.440> okay<00:00:46.829> jay<00:00:47.760> kaiser

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
animation but is this okay jay kaiser

address this in another video where i

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.810 
address this in another video where i
was<00:01:01.739> doing<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> same<00:01:02.219> technique<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
was doing the same technique on the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.740 
was doing the same technique on the
console<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> xbox<00:01:04.049> by<00:01:04.260> using<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:06.299> YY

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

technique to swap to my pistol and back
to<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.760> primary<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.780> also<00:01:10.049> cancels<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
to my primary and that also cancels the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.910 
to my primary and that also cancels the
animation<00:01:11.210> now<00:01:12.210> I've<00:01:12.869> played<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.710> game

that<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.880> agree<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.299> Jay<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.659> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that I kind of agree with Jay on this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.740 
that I kind of agree with Jay on this
that<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.500> able<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.240> practice<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> get

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
that if you're able to practice and get

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
that if you're able to practice and get
good<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> actually<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
good at this because this is actually a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.620 
good at this because this is actually a
technique<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.820> requires<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.450> bit<00:01:45.600> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
technique that requires a bit of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
technique that requires a bit of
practice<00:01:45.799> then<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.250> okay<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
practice then I think it's okay and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.090 
practice then I think it's okay and
that's<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:48.930> opinion<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.530> others<00:01:49.890> have

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that's just my opinion and others have

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.060 
that's just my opinion and others have
other<00:01:50.700> opinions<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.390> clearly<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.890> say

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
other opinions on it clearly but to say

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.620 
other opinions on it clearly but to say
that<00:01:53.100> I'm<00:01:53.310> hacking<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.850> cheating<00:01:54.240> by<00:01:54.360> doing

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that I'm hacking or cheating by doing

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.639 
that I'm hacking or cheating by doing
this<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.530> bit

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
this I think that's a little bit

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.399 
this I think that's a little bit
ridiculous<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.630> using

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
ridiculous you know you're you're using

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
ridiculous you know you're you're using
a<00:01:58.619> game<00:01:58.860> mechanic<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.549> may<00:02:00.060> be

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
a game mechanic that may be

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
a game mechanic that may be
unintentional<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.110> developers<00:02:01.590> part<00:02:01.829> to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
unintentional on the developers part to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.950 
unintentional on the developers part to
gain<00:02:02.130> an<00:02:02.280> advantage<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:03.329> that's<00:02:03.509> far

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
gain an advantage but that's far

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.050 
gain an advantage but that's far
different<00:02:04.020> from<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.310> changing<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
different from you know changing the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.240 
different from you know changing the
game<00:02:06.240> code<00:02:06.689> or<00:02:07.049> using<00:02:07.380> an<00:02:07.469> aimbot<00:02:07.740> or

you don't use these techniques than

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.980 
you don't use these techniques than
you're<00:02:32.370> less<00:02:32.550> skilled<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.120> player<00:02:33.360> or<00:02:33.840> if

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
you're less skilled of a player or if

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.360 
you're less skilled of a player or if

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
you do use the techniques and you're a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.000 
you do use the techniques and you're a
hacker<00:02:35.580> or<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.880> cheater<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.860> know<00:02:37.980> I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
hacker or a cheater and you know I

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
hacker or a cheater and you know I
really<00:02:38.400> don't<00:02:38.430> know<00:02:38.760> what<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.420> say<00:02:39.720> about<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.110> I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
really don't know what to say about it I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.200 
really don't know what to say about it I
think<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.280> canceled<00:02:41.730> animation

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
think that this this canceled animation

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.820 
think that this this canceled animation
thing<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.570> think<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:42.900> legit<00:02:43.260> because<00:02:43.500> it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
thing I think it's legit because it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.760 
thing I think it's legit because it
actually<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:45.060> know<00:02:45.150> unlike<00:02:45.540> picking<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:46.050> you

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
actually you know unlike picking up you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.500 
actually you know unlike picking up you
know<00:02:46.860> some<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.220> auto<00:02:47.370> shotguns<00:02:47.940> where<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
know some of the auto shotguns where you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.640 
know some of the auto shotguns where you
can<00:02:48.630> just<00:02:48.660> kind<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:48.990> hold<00:02:49.140> down<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.440> trigger

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
can just kind of hold down the trigger

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.560 
can just kind of hold down the trigger
or<00:02:49.860> spam<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.280> trigger<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:50.910> spam<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.390> with<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
or spam the trigger so spam it with the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.490 
or spam the trigger so spam it with the
saga<00:02:51.780> hold<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.170> down<00:02:52.290> with<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> usas<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.820> sass

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
saga hold it down with the usas you sass

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.920 
saga hold it down with the usas you sass
you<00:02:55.500> know<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.670> isn't<00:02:56.880> easy<00:02:57.090> honey<00:02:57.690> it's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
you know this this isn't easy honey it's

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.870 
you know this this isn't easy honey it's
not<00:02:57.990> terribly<00:02:58.650> difficult<00:02:58.890> i'm<00:02:59.250> doing<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.670> but

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
not terribly difficult i'm doing it but

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.180 
not terribly difficult i'm doing it but
it's<00:03:00.390> not<00:03:00.600> dirt<00:03:01.080> simple<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.740> if<00:03:02.070> you've

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it's not dirt simple and if you've

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.010 
it's not dirt simple and if you've
actually<00:03:02.370> tried<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.850> pick<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.180> up<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.600> learn

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
actually tried to pick this up and learn

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.470 
actually tried to pick this up and learn
the<00:03:04.200> technique<00:03:04.620> then<00:03:05.400> you'll<00:03:05.820> realize<00:03:06.030> that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the technique then you'll realize that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.910 
the technique then you'll realize that
it's<00:03:06.630> kind<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.870> tough<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.110> coordinate

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
it's kind of tough to coordinate

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.800 
it's kind of tough to coordinate
shooting<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.610> canceling<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> animation<00:03:09.660> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
shooting and canceling the animation and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.260 
shooting and canceling the animation and
moving<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.590> aiming<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.640> know<00:03:11.730> avoiding

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
moving and aiming and you know avoiding

and it still happens and I mean it I

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.400 
and it still happens and I mean it I

that<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.709> could<00:03:29.040> find<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.610> order<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.910> try<00:03:30.090> this

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
that I could find in order to try this

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.810 
that I could find in order to try this
out<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:31.290> works<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.770> lot<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.400> do<00:03:32.550> get

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
out and it works a lot like I do get

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.640 
out and it works a lot like I do get
better<00:03:32.970> hit<00:03:33.270> registration<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:33.990> that<00:03:34.140> scenario

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
better hit registration in that scenario

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.400 
better hit registration in that scenario
but<00:03:35.400> there's<00:03:36.209> still<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.480> lot<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.720> times<00:03:37.050> where

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
but there's still a lot of times where

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.930 
but there's still a lot of times where
you're<00:03:37.620> completely<00:03:38.010> whiff<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.490> shot<00:03:38.760> gun

probably<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:12.000> block<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.540> but<00:04:13.020> if<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.170> have

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
probably just block you but if you have

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.660 
probably just block you but if you have
something<00:04:13.530> interesting<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.980> say<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.400> i<00:04:14.459> want

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
something interesting to say that i want

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.520 
something interesting to say that i want
to<00:04:14.700> hear<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.970> because<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:16.109> know<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.410> is

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
to hear it because you know this is

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.650 
to hear it because you know this is
something<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:17.040> i<00:04:17.430> don't<00:04:17.700> typically<00:04:18.209> do<00:04:18.450> in

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
something that i don't typically do in

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.690 
something that i don't typically do in
my<00:04:18.959> play<00:04:19.140> style<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.799> i<00:04:19.830> have<00:04:20.100> picked<00:04:20.400> up<00:04:20.549> and

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
my play style but i have picked up and

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.280 
my play style but i have picked up and
learned<00:04:20.850> how<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.030> do<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.570> technique<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.080> i<00:04:22.109> can

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
learned how to do the technique so i can

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.120 
learned how to do the technique so i can
demonstrate<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.950> and

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
demonstrate it and

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.010 
demonstrate it and
and<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.910> know<00:04:25.030> give<00:04:25.210> my<00:04:25.300> two<00:04:25.360> cents<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.840> it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
and you know give my two cents on it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.400 
and you know give my two cents on it
because<00:04:26.290> it's<00:04:26.710> it's<00:04:26.980> not<00:04:27.160> as<00:04:27.340> easy<00:04:27.460> as<00:04:27.760> as

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
because it's it's not as easy as as

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.080 
because it's it's not as easy as as
using<00:04:29.410> an<00:04:29.680> assault<00:04:30.040> rifle<00:04:30.100> for<00:04:30.490> example<00:04:30.970> you

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
using an assault rifle for example you

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.560 
using an assault rifle for example you
know<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.240> do<00:04:31.450> get<00:04:31.630> some<00:04:31.810> one<00:04:31.990> shot<00:04:32.230> kills<00:04:32.530> but

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
know you do get some one shot kills but

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
know you do get some one shot kills but
oftentimes<00:04:34.570> like<00:04:35.050> there's<00:04:35.230> very<00:04:35.500> few

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
oftentimes like there's very few

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.740 
oftentimes like there's very few
situations<00:04:36.010> in<00:04:36.520> this<00:04:36.670> game<00:04:36.910> we're<00:04:37.210> canceling

situations in this game we're canceling

situations in this game we're canceling
that<00:04:37.780> animation<00:04:38.790> got<00:04:39.790> me<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:39.970> kill<00:04:40.240> when<00:04:40.390> I

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
that animation got me a kill when I

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.150
