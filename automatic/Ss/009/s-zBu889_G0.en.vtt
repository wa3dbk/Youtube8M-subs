00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 most likely you will say that in front of you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.069
 already familiar to us volkswagen jetta ii and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.440
 will be right and now in front of you 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.559
 volkswagen golf r at a glance 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
 notice the difference is not so easy 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.750
 volkswagen likes to pay attention 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.420
 little things 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.150
 you might be surprised to find out what 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.699
 this model is more expensive for 10,000 dollars 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.279
 versus basic live aeg let's 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.279
 We will understand what is there to pay 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.160
 outwardly distinct golf r barely perceptible 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.260
 here we have new headlights and others 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.449
 front and rear bumper 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.940
 front bumper has larger 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.580
 air intakes here everything is clear more 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.239
 air to increase power and torque 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.970
 of the moment 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.070
 besides that there are brakes here 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.440
 from the ji pack a performance of them 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.910
 more diameter well and among other things in 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.340
 this configuration also go 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.009
 custom shock absorbers mode 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.869
 comfort is an ordinary sport that can be 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.979
 selected based on your preferences and 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.350
 now talk about two big 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.759
 changes you need to know when we 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.100
 talking about golf r 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.560
 The first is of course engine power 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.229
 the car now gives out 292 horse 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.090
 power and a new cylinder head 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.369
 modified internal components and 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.700
 new turbocharger allows you to reach 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.009
 torque of 380 meters 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.750
 the second important change he became 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.429
 all-wheel drive now we have 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.039
 full center differential 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.080
 which can send torque with 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.360
 front shaft on the back depending 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.399
 from the force of adhesion to the road surface 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.470
 and also completely shut off for 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.280
 fuel economy with a slight pressure on 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.039
 gas pedal 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.140
 well, or low speed besides the nervous 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.060
 wheel speed reduction systems 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.149
 cornering him also 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.280
 four pipes about to as many as four but more 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.110
 we are interested in finding out how 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.810
 same affect vehicle behavior 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.760
 disable stability control 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.250
 first golf r model allows 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.319
 completely disable the system dynamic 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.569
 stabilization and we just burn from 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.739
 impatience in anticipation that he 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.739
 will show on the test track 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.580
 four-wheel drive gives the advantage 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.620
 speed compared to g tea allowing 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.450
 golf r reach 100 kilometers per hour and 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.959
 a half second faster golf r 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.600
 accelerates to a hundred in 4.5 seconds and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.790
 overcomes someone for 13 wholes and 1 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.980
 tenth of a second of peak speed in a hundred 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.350
 sixty eight and eight kilometers in 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.600
 hour thanks to the extra horse 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.540
 golf r forces though bypassed but 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.180
 g5 in the passage of the eight best 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.660
 the result was 24 point nine 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.660
 tenths of a second 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.959
 during the existence of golf r and can not 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.750
 to say that we were delighted with everything 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.430
 maybe we judged him too strict to 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.470
 disadvantages and for example attributed 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.900
 inability to turn off the system 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.060
 stability control but now such 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.980
 opportunity to eat and let's check what 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.829
 it gives off system 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.140
 stabilization is not some magical way 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.980
 will not reveal the alleged hidden in 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.140
 golf r potential off dynamic 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.959
 Stabilization on the top three will not let me 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.190
 too early to intervene don't say so 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.040
 spoil all the impressions 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.140
 in the same stabilization model not only 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.560
 switchable my not so obsessive in 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.560
 whole 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.070
 so now we can just not forget 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:08.340
 and enjoy the natural behavior 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:10.290
 car conceived that this 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.960
 the car is sharpened by aggressive 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.330
 driving after all is golf r u claire 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:25.950
 associated with something sports moore 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:28.230
 or racing in a nutshell I would describe 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.420
 its so premium class it's something like 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.300
 Ji ti ai plus for most 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.030
 buyers will be relevant question is 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.030
 whether golf r extra 10,000 dollars 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.980
 compared to ji 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.550
 I think most of you will answer. 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.770
 not 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.660
 because most likely the change in this 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.390
 car will not be so for you 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.640
 essentially truly feel 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.950
 all the benefits of golf r frills 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.840
 this case can only avid 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.840
 volkswagen fans 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.580
 used here in selective a 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.830
 mechanical gearbox dsg will 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.460
 Available as sheep only with the following 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.240
 years but not great trouble gsg personally I 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.240
 no complaints 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.930
 I am very impressed with the stability of this 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.760
 car sustainability however live and 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.560
 It amazes me no less 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.410
 This car gives a feeling 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.360
 confidence stability stability 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.430
 he confidently enters and exits 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.140
 turns at the same time on decent 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.140
 speeds and without undue hesitation 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.640
 I repeat the car is stable and excellent 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.520
 managed by you there will be no excess or 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:53.170
 understeer excellent 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:55.240
 control in turns and what at the end 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.110
 all you still need from the speed 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.110
 hatchback 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.120
 we must pay tribute in his volkswagen 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.970
 the desire to make this car and the times 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.220
 From times all the better and better it is obvious that in 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.710
 eventually they wanted to create high 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.090
 powerful all-wheel drive and steady golf 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.560
 r close gt class they succeeded 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:24.330
 Perhaps this is the best golf r 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:28.970
 he certainly does not have such an excellent 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.970
 sound like say vr6 r32 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.290
 in terms of sustainability and manageability 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:40.330
 and repeat feeling of premium 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.330
 He will give many forum about the like. 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:55.289
 and here again arises 

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:57.360
 question whether golf r is worth its money if 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.639
 look at it from the perspective of the gee tee ah 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.189
 I suspect the answer for many will be 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:05.689
 no, but compared to audi s3 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:08.729
 or BMW m235i golf r gets 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:11.309
 undoubted advantage he gives the same 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:12.569
 combination of power of sophistication but beyond 

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:14.999
 less money 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.739
 golf r seems to have achieved excellent 

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:18.809
 balance he is able 

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:19.769
 quench your thirst for speed on a par 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.629
 rex and stiai 

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:23.579
 and also offers comfort and 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:25.589
 functionality making it 

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:27.829
 perfect for everyday 

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.829
 of use 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:00.969
 with
