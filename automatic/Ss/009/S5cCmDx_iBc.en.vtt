00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 and how very good today packard and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.389
 we are in the tutorial on how to make a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.370
 house under water but in slow version 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.430
 you have the quick version that I made 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.070
 a long time ago 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.890
 in the description for you to see and 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.900
 compare and well the first thing that there is 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.680
 do if you want to make a house from the water 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.130
 after more or less it was a land where 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.110
 there is water where it is quite deep as 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.390
 this with this site that I found here 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.309
 As you can see here, it can not be done because 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.650
 it's not very deep, it's just two 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.650
 so you take a place like that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.170
 Y 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 what you have to do is trace 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 to a square a triangle as you want 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 that is your house is worth in this case 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.780
 my case is going to be triangular 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.780
 Likewise 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.490
 to see more over here 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.430
 It's worth it when we have this figure 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.160
 done up here we have to go down and 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.520
 the same thing that we have done with this one 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.230
 with the other and filling in the figure 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.890
 that this here 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:29.280
 putting it go well 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.640
 whatever is always perpendicular 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.659
 we bought to see if it goes and fits the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.930
 Exact perfection you see and all this well 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.660
 I should go 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.270
 with glass or wood you 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.310
 I recommend the crystals because they are 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.900
 transparent and will guide you better 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.020
 because this later we will have it 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.020
 remove 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.860
 I was a bit slow with the water but 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.270
 and it is what you have to do is that 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.270
 well and traces 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.709
 a figure here up here in the water and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.319
 then all the walls that are with 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.490
 crystals I recommend glass a lot 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.620
 better than if it 's me that I know wood stone 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.600
 anything else so that you 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.250
 I recommend 100% crystal is worth so I'm going 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.490
 to do this when finished 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.460
 We are still good because we are here 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.500
 once we have everything done here like this 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.090
 all like a wall not with a space 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.660
 here we have to fill in everything and when 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.340
 I say everything is absolutely all the 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.349
 cubes here 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.830
 what all the cubes that are inside 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.590
 him but we have to fill in this no longer 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.750
 it needs to be glass it's all 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.800
 the material that you want and you have to go 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.750
 making layers layers layers and more layers 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.360
 ok with 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.450
 with any material you have to 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.720
 fill it absolutely everything without it 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:17.110
 there is no hole because then 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.110
 it would not work so be very attentive 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.180
 there 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.080
 You see how I'm doing here now 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.150
 putting cubes on all sides of 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.769
 where you wish that your house is 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.360
 water or the wall that you have made 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.840
 with the crystals previously as os 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.770
 I said we are scratched here as 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.490
 fill it completely with cubes 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.140
 It's a very long time job 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.850
 but the truth is that the result is 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.850
 very good 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:59.540
 let's see I'm going to cut and I'm still going 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.460
 good guys once we have everything 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.080
 the bucket full of blocks this I'm going 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.930
 down is full of blocks 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.810
 and we're going to do now we take 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.310
 example if we have made a rectangle 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.570
 as I have done 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.810
 we take and in each corner we descend until 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.860
 the soil goes up 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.550
 up in another corner 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.129
 we lower our soil 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.639
 and so on the four corners 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:35.689
 and I recommend it to be crystal because 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.689
 it's much easier to break 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.730
 both in his rival and in creative a 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.730
 Once we have done this 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.150
 we go down and we have to destroy all the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.010
 blocks that we have put 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.010
 because you have to destroy everything just 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.260
 whatever that makes us what we have 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.620
 done here is to do as a guide as 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.660
 one of this so that we do not get 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.830
 water and tend and we have to go back to 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.540
 start good in this case 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.540
 it is only one and nothing happens 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.409
 where are we going to break all this and go back 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:18.539
 to cut and when we have we still good 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.119
 guys once we have all the 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:24.569
 removed blocks as you see there is not one 

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:26.520
 if we go down we can enter here and not and the 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.550
 water stays out there 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.409
 and this is now we can put the 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.560
 ground 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.389
 and 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.330
 let's put the soil first and that 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.729
 I explain how to enter a house below 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.430
 of the water 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.520
 it is very easy, some believe that 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.620
 you have to make another square that makes a 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.229
 tunnel and emerge to the surface enter by 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.840
 a tunnel that can also be done what 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:57.770
 what happens is that it gives more work 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.470
 and what I'm going to do is one thing that in 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.480
 the quick version of how to build a 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.300
 house under the water I already did 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.190
 you have to find good to find 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.720
 look for a place where there is no 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.210
 example earth here in front as you see 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:18.050
 here there is land for example in this case 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.520
 we make two holes we see that here very 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.520
 strong or crystal 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.539
 and we have to do 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:31.189
 4 deep 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:31.669
 34 and we do with a ladder is worth and 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:35.299
 is 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.709
 we can come out okay now the problem is 

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:41.540
 this 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:43.930
 as you see, not normal, we can not enter 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.210
 and to solve this problem we take 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.180
 a bucket with water and we put the water up 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.810
 here 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:57.740
 in this way we can catch like this 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:00.200
 and we can go out and we're here if 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.900
 you want to make a roof so you take and 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.080
 you come here 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.220
 you put a roof here 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.550
 which I will not do 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.800
 and none of this if you want you can go 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:17.190
 changing puts me the crystal and you can 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.700
 put wood although the basics is to put 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.500
 crystal because it helps a lot and does not consist 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.580
 as much to break as wood or stone 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.580
 things about these 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.210
 OK 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.479
 and this is no more than a few alike 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:40.060
 they thought they were very much more difficult 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:40.060
 to build but it's not like that 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:48.469
 because the misunderstanding like this we lowered digi and 

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:49.969
 we can go up here and nothing this has 

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:51.600
 been all this tutorial of how 

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:55.380
 build 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.870
 a house under the water slow version or 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.180
 explanatory version and nothing I hope you 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:03.120
 I have served to give I like favorites if 

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.280
 you want more minecraft tutorials that 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.920
 be useful as for example this that 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.260
 we just do now and nothing a hug 

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.160
 and see you in the next until next 

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.160
 goodbye kids
