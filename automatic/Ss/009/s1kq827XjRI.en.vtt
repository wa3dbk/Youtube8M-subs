I<00:00:26.460> may<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:27.000> at<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.510> minute<00:00:27.689> cycles<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.500> ten

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
I may look at one minute cycles or ten

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
I may look at one minute cycles or ten
contact<00:00:29.640> cycles<00:00:30.150> something<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.630> that

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
contact cycles something like that

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.630 
contact cycles something like that
we'll<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.380> keep<00:00:31.529> switching<00:00:31.800> players<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.460> and

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
pepper this is a pepper that we can do

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.920 
pepper this is a pepper that we can do
with<00:03:27.520> four<00:03:27.760> players<00:03:27.970> instead<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.540> just<00:03:28.690> two

with four players instead of just two

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.200

hitting<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:32.050> may<00:03:32.260> not<00:03:32.410> look<00:03:32.710> like<00:03:32.770> a<00:03:33.010> lot<00:03:33.250> of

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
hitting it may not look like a lot of

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.090 
hitting it may not look like a lot of
quality<00:03:34.000> contacts<00:03:34.600> they<00:03:35.020> can<00:03:35.200> do<00:03:35.470> better<00:03:35.800> they

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
quality contacts they can do better they

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.580 
quality contacts they can do better they
can<00:03:36.250> play<00:03:36.550> sharper<00:03:37.210> but<00:03:37.900> what<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.200> starts<00:03:38.470> to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
can play sharper but what it starts to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.460 
can play sharper but what it starts to
feel<00:03:38.890> more<00:03:38.920> like<00:03:39.190> is<00:03:39.700> volleyball<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.960> have<00:03:41.320> to

feel more like is volleyball I have to

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.930 
feel more like is volleyball I have to
start<00:03:41.680> learning<00:03:41.890> when<00:03:42.160> I'm<00:03:42.280> back<00:03:42.520> here<00:03:42.730> how<00:03:42.880> do

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
start learning when I'm back here how do

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.480 
start learning when I'm back here how do
I<00:03:43.030> read<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.870> hitter<00:03:44.110> how<00:03:44.830> do<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.040> read<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
I read the hitter how do I read the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.330 
I read the hitter how do I read the
hitter<00:03:45.700> around<00:03:46.300> my<00:03:46.600> blocker<00:03:47.160> there's<00:03:48.160> only

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
hitter around my blocker there's only

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.430 
hitter around my blocker there's only
two<00:03:48.640> components<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.420> look<00:03:49.570> out<00:03:49.750> right<00:03:49.930> now<00:03:50.140> one

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
two components to look out right now one

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.010 
two components to look out right now one
block<00:03:50.710> or<00:03:50.950> one<00:03:51.130> hitter<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.360> still<00:03:52.720> need<00:03:52.930> to

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
block or one hitter but I still need to

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.810 
block or one hitter but I still need to
be<00:03:53.080> able<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.350> process<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.250> try<00:03:54.790> to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
be able to process that and try to

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.550 
be able to process that and try to
figure<00:03:55.330> out<00:03:55.480> where<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.050> ball<00:03:56.290> most

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
figure out where is that ball most

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.040 
figure out where is that ball most
likely<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.070> go<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:58.270> all<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.750> this<00:03:58.870> stuff

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
likely to go and so all of this stuff

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.930 
likely to go and so all of this stuff
this<00:03:59.320> is<00:03:59.380> volleyball<00:03:59.950> IQ<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.520> they<00:04:00.640> start

this is volleyball IQ that they start

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.590 
this is volleyball IQ that they start
developing<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.660> it's<00:04:01.990> just<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.800> warm-up<00:04:03.280> drill

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600

this warm-up drill to me is way more

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.100 
this warm-up drill to me is way more
