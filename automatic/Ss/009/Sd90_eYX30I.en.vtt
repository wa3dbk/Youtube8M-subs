00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.450
 that sleeve maybe could continue giving problems I owe to Coca-Cola that Alberta 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.000
 referred now the environment continues and they have 12 - rivalry not necessarily 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.250
 because it will have any damage from arantxa coca cola 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.849
 I would go to first 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.599
 the champagne this has been very consistent tandil in its time but 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.310
 little leads to ample Paranaense advantage in these moments 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.310
 despite this nava díaz your crew manolo garcía 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:31.299
 alex chicón i salvador optician a precious one launched this race we will depart 

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:35.829
 the nova boat that competes in the category next to the motor boat 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.280
 traffic my babe 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.390
 the mining march in the course of the practice had flaws and did not come out 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.179
 to compete 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.699
 therefore the only competition of the spot does not go on the motorcraft launch 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.399
 and these moments what has been the average speed of stay 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.860
 apparently we can record here that the average speed of this boat 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.190
 praise sandoval this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.580
 the 61 points 2 mills 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.850
 the plant that has an extraordinary crew of the boat 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.030
 Coca Cola 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.740
 next to leonardo fields 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.230
 preaches of the hospitalito to pay 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.230
 the boat the new day also stays 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.840
 the position of honor be in the third position 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.710
 to the first position will happen 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.260
 before by action and I will keep it perfect from the catamaran boat 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.760
 As soon as possible before the boat on the shore we will listen to those engines 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.520
 sri flew he jumped soon percent out of three races and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.510
 apparently what we are doing right now that had come off 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.270
 a cover of its engines that actually lost it because it has brought 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.870
 consequences since the promoter is assembled all the time the people of this 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.950
 way the water it puts the carburetors automatically to pay 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.170
 Here we see tremendous competition between Havana before and the Coca-Cola launch 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.199
 we had mentioned 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.839
 the mandatory boat 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.619
 this occasion the flaw so that it can not yield to its maximum 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.559
 ap ease the kraft speck 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.559
 competing in the category 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.149
 balance will not hesitate in cea my baby 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:33.849
 If these boats are capable at royal speed it is approximately one 55 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.720
 60 miles 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.130
 but so much for a hundred the ranchera nova 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.290
 as the motorcraft launch they are at an average of miles per hour per 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.850
 return 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.250
 and approximately 37 38 miles per hour average one can see that 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.969
 this type of sets does not have the same protection as the boat theme 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.429
 particular balance as the construction of each 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979
 after its assignment 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.239
 but Korea there is no need to vary 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.919
 there is that sport adoption aido 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.379
 a continuous development in recent years 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.120
 I have been growing the support of the sponsors cimadevilla in topics and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.650
 port recognized at the time is in a very solid position 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.960
 being the only Puerto Rico institution able to organize that this 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.980
 event type 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.350
 we have had a wonderful endorsement of the trade of which we are going to 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.740
 cover with your 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.419
 new way that we mentioned was the jacket in 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:49.039
 the first position in the category from here to the year be the new day is 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.219
 reaching the Indian goal 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.040
 for the event this is so bad option to ingram pri this fact even so the 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.430
 avalanche of mud and has just concluded with a time of one hour 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.690
 two minutes with 54 seconds at a total average speed of that 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.579
 fiancee 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:04.439
 we have to talk 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.669
 Coca-Cola agencies who are in the first position in the category c 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.849
 and it's close when you get there 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.309
 the old coca-cola concludes with one hour four minutes 4 seconds at a 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.739
 average speed of 62 points 5 miles per hour 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.930
 we have with us 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.250
 the winning boat of the contest bad option the grand prix the boat the new 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.740
 day 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.810
 with his crew manolo garcía alex chicón and salvador picón a tremendous 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.630
 tekoá race contributed to the boat that participated in this event like you 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.389
 could say the strategy that led the new unstable day 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.629
 basically finger 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.830
 bush cruise the sea that had tenth left the strip charge which 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.599
 we could keep such a 73 thousand euros we are not talking about a boat act 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:50.809
 to go out 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:52.009
 was a 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.629
 alavedra 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.789
 salamander faces three miles to consistency 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.419
 I will continue a fantastic shootout the controversial is the winner for late payment 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.860
 It was like the comfortable 3p blunt suspenders but little by little little by little until 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.169
 reach 63 million euros 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.259
 alajuela victoria was the catamaran villamarín and was in front of you 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.450
 practically at all times quite damaged and 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.520
 they worry you 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.880
 you have to be there that was in front and that had consistently been 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:20.889
 advanced 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.889
 well thanks definitely from him 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.889
 a stretch of the race that was a fairly calm sea 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.689
 and the market that was besieged catamaran as such according to marquez 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.059
 guaranteeing with falls of walls slogans that she fled from an average more 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:38.969
 this deficiency tired 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.490
 the league and before the new day 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.720
 sanchez boiling in immense boat 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.339
 good nutrition in the category of this process to that 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:50.399
 we notice in the stretch of the race when I go to our rooms 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.539
 game without problems 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.339
 let's keep the help 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.559
 pretty quick hugs 73 average access to just be difficult 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:01.069
 keep them in that first round that there is no sun and in second place is the 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:01.780
 catamaran 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.360
 and past 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.819

 by request of explanation to hours 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.889
 we are talking only 80 miles 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.800
 Kasianov at its ecoboost engine end
