walmart it was the biggest loser brand
scale<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.170> thought<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.469> cute<00:00:53.930> but<00:00:54.930> i

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
scale and thought that was cute but i

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.950 
scale and thought that was cute but i
took<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.320> home<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.100> stepped<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
took it home and I stepped on it and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.709 
took it home and I stepped on it and
every<00:00:57.960> time<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.320> stepped<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.800> would<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.309> like

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
every time I stepped on it would be like

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.599 
every time I stepped on it would be like
it<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.899> off<00:01:01.079> by<00:01:01.320> two<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.770> four<00:01:02.010> pounds<00:01:02.489> each

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it was off by two to four pounds each

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.850 
it was off by two to four pounds each
time<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.510> knew<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> couldn't<00:01:04.229> rely<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
time and I knew I couldn't rely on that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
time and I knew I couldn't rely on that
so<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.909> least<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.299> older<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.780> reliable

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so at least my older one is reliable

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.820 
so at least my older one is reliable
it's<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.400> by<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> ounce<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:12.770> I'll<00:01:13.770> just

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it's just not by the ounce so I'll just

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.289 
it's just not by the ounce so I'll just
have<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.189> deal<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.700> unless<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
of small episodes of feeling a little

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.449 
of small episodes of feeling a little
light-headed<00:03:26.580> today<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.450> too<00:03:27.660> bad<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:28.459> didn't

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
light-headed today not too bad I didn't

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.390 
light-headed today not too bad I didn't
take<00:03:29.640> any<00:03:29.850> potassium<00:03:30.950> because<00:03:31.950> i<00:03:32.040> knew<00:03:32.190> i<00:03:32.220> was

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
take any potassium because i knew i was

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.740 
take any potassium because i knew i was
going<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.580> be<00:03:32.640> eating<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.209> i<00:03:33.420> figured<00:03:33.720> that

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
going to be eating and i figured that

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.360 
going to be eating and i figured that
would<00:03:34.019> solve<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.440> problem<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.190> did

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
would solve the problem and it did

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.290 
would solve the problem and it did
although<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.150> have<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.420> headache<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:38.000> do<00:03:39.000> have

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
although I do have a headache I do have

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.729 
although I do have a headache I do have
a<00:03:39.330> headache<00:03:39.540> but<00:03:40.190> not<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> big<00:03:41.459> deal<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.500> just

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
a headache but not a big deal so I just

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.729 
a headache but not a big deal so I just
think<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.310> think<00:03:44.700> I've<00:03:45.030> read<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.560> your<00:03:46.560> first

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
think I think I've read that your first

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.030 
think I think I've read that your first
week<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.180> be<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.450> hardest<00:03:49.040> some

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
week is going to be the hardest some

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.800 
week is going to be the hardest some
people<00:03:50.310> are<00:03:50.400> starving<00:03:50.880> some<00:03:51.360> people<00:03:51.780> just
