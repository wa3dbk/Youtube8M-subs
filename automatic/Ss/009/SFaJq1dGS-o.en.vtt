00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
so in this video I'm going to show about

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.360 
so in this video I'm going to show about
how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.149> turn<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.629> curry<00:00:03.840> leaves<00:00:04.049> tree<00:00:04.440> it's

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
how to turn the curry leaves tree it's

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.400 
how to turn the curry leaves tree it's
springtime<00:00:05.700> here<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.450> it's<00:00:06.600> good<00:00:06.960> time<00:00:07.200> to

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
springtime here and it's good time to

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.919 
springtime here and it's good time to
trim<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.890> Crais<00:00:08.820> leaves<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.809> know

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
trim the Crais leaves so that you know

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.070 
trim the Crais leaves so that you know
you<00:00:10.469> get<00:00:10.620> fresh<00:00:10.980> leaves<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.790> probably<00:00:12.719> new

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
you get fresh leaves and probably new

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.670 
you get fresh leaves and probably new
branches<00:00:14.299> so<00:00:15.299> I'm<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.630> cut<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
branches so I'm going to cut it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.460 
branches so I'm going to cut it
so<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.369> know<00:00:17.430> get<00:00:17.760> rid<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:18.000> all<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.470> top

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
so that you know get rid of all the top

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.189 
so that you know get rid of all the top
ones<00:00:19.770> make<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.070> short<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> hopefully<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.630> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
ones make it short and hopefully in you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.390 
ones make it short and hopefully in you
know<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> couple<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.710> weeks<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.100> should<00:00:23.130> all

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
know a couple of weeks you should all

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.269 
know a couple of weeks you should all
see<00:00:23.640> new<00:00:23.939> leaves<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.420> new<00:00:24.570> branches<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.410> I'm

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
see new leaves and new branches so I'm

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.730 
see new leaves and new branches so I'm
going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> start<00:00:26.760> cutting<00:00:27.330> them<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:27.689> from<00:00:28.410> top

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
going to start cutting them now from top

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:41.350 
going to start cutting them now from top
so<00:00:29.340> go<00:00:30.150> from<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:30.750> basically<00:00:36.559> that's<00:00:37.559> one

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.530 

there's<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.690> little<00:00:42.989> short<00:00:43.440> two

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.299 

one<00:00:52.940> always<00:00:53.940> too<00:00:54.360> close<00:00:54.630> I'm<00:00:55.290> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> turn

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
one always too close I'm going to turn

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.820 
one always too close I'm going to turn
that<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.790> off

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:09.900 

maybe<00:01:01.280> click<00:01:02.060> that<00:01:02.360> one<00:01:02.660> right<00:01:03.020> here<00:01:06.760> and<00:01:08.680> that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
maybe click that one right here and that

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:17.940 
maybe click that one right here and that
probably<00:01:10.910> is<00:01:11.120> going<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.540> tall's<00:01:14.500> there

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.789 

and<00:01:18.460> now<00:01:18.549> it's<00:01:18.729> all<00:01:18.850> gone<00:01:19.390> trimmed<00:01:19.750> up<00:01:19.930> so

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
and now it's all gone trimmed up so

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.890 
and now it's all gone trimmed up so
hopefully<00:01:21.159> we'll<00:01:21.310> get<00:01:21.460> some<00:01:21.729> new<00:01:22.360> branches

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
hopefully we'll get some new branches

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.370 
hopefully we'll get some new branches
and<00:01:23.290> before<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.070> gets<00:01:24.280> too<00:01:24.580> hot<00:01:24.759> here<00:01:25.380> all

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
and before it gets too hot here all

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.120 
and before it gets too hot here all
right

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
right

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.609 
right
I'll<00:01:27.909> probably<00:01:28.240> post<00:01:28.630> another<00:01:28.869> video<00:01:29.110> after

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
I'll probably post another video after

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.840 
I'll probably post another video after
the<00:01:29.770> new<00:01:30.220> leaves<00:01:30.520> come<00:01:30.759> up<00:01:31.020> that's<00:01:32.020> fine<00:01:32.850> it's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
the new leaves come up that's fine it's

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.420 
the new leaves come up that's fine it's
two<00:01:34.119> weeks<00:01:34.360> after<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.020> trimming<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.250> see

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
two weeks after the trimming so you see

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.870 
two weeks after the trimming so you see
the<00:01:36.549> buds<00:01:36.700> coming<00:01:37.090> out<00:01:37.420> now<00:01:38.369> needs<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.610> be<00:01:39.729> all

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
the buds coming out now needs to be all

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:50.730 
the buds coming out now needs to be all
then<00:01:40.180> good<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.780> approximately<00:01:50.470> after

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
then good this is approximately after

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
then good this is approximately after
two<00:01:51.460> months<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.940> trimming<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.990> plant<00:01:53.550> see<00:01:54.550> how

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
two months of trimming the plant see how

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.690 
two months of trimming the plant see how
green<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.110> now<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.679> a<00:01:56.799> whole<00:01:57.009> bunch<00:01:57.039> of<00:01:57.429> new

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
green it is now and a whole bunch of new

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.789 
green it is now and a whole bunch of new
leaves<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.200> branches<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:01.560> that's<00:02:02.560> pretty

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
leaves and branches so that's pretty

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.039 
leaves and branches so that's pretty
good
