00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.450
 the Celtic capitals more than a thousand of the great European offers in vital 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.689
 precious in the director and terÃ¡n de weiss 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.609
 and if you fund up to raise the level very good morning good days good in 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.899
 this moment he remembered through the gold ounce fired without stopping the 

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:19.700
 quotation 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.210
 at $ 1,200 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.329
 and this does not seem to define what is happening 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.149
 there are many factors that are driving up the 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.479
 the one of arahal gold of these last months 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.720
 especially the renewed interest of central banks 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.320
 of emerging economies as well as the central bank of india that has 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.210
 bought feel ton 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.380
 If the bank that bought yesterday announced it had bought 10 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.550
 tons 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.330
 in the banks of zambia the central bank of russia there is renewed interest in 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.400
 make a 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.850
 by diversifying the currency portfolio of central banks 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.540
 in guard gold and this is driving the prisoner upward 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.840
 the question we always ask ourselves to what extent the gold goes up because the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.809
 dollar does not stop falling this morning a euro for a 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.240
 tola 52 cents evidently the weakness of the dollar is one of the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.870
 factors that drives the price of gold upwards but these last days 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.730
 we have also been seeing that gold has revalued despite the weak 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.120
 that the weakness of the dollar is attended to a personality of its own in the activity 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.840
 of gold the investment in gold 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.790
 Large jec sanz funds with hedge funds are entering salaries 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.430
 tudorel believe the aecc 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.740
 there are different large funds that have gone in between investing in gold 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.060
 Inti effectively the uncertainty 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.140
 economic and inflation pressure 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.460
 is another important factor for the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.870
 the rise in the price of gold 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.040
 not only precious metals almost all are rising strongly and 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.260
 some like platinum are also underway effectively all are 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.240
 appreciating gold has the peculiarity of what it is 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.490
 we arrived on Monday that the only raw material that is not consumed 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.790
 gold really are half exchange and a refuge asset 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.030
 then what is acting now is acting as raw material in times 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 where the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.400
 the economic and financial situation is calm 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.249
 and acts as a cover in times of crisis thriller transforms 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.930
 it becomes raw materials 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.119
 monetary asset that is what they are 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.469
 supporting the banks right now buying gold which is a currency more 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.589
 you create hundreds of other officials as coverage as speculation 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.879
 of a market in which there are not many alternatives 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.420
 I would say that right now as a cam 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.109
 more are entering him 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.949
 there are speculative positions of gold 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.449
 and is that we can 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.319
 expect p although we are in a good market in a bull market in the 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.189
 gold price 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.980
 does not mean that you press and continue straight up there will have 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:48.319
 corrections probably now we are we are almost a thousand 200 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.569
 and we probably find corrections along the way 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.219
 but effectively the gold market 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.529
 it seemed that of all the components from the fundamentals to continue 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.099
 climbing maple one year was making gold 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.969
 between 700 and 800 dollars today in 1200 almost 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.439
 it is very difficult to make forecasts about the behavior of an asset but 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.249
 how far could sira miller rise stele in fact it is very difficult to do 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.339
 forecasts 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:20.689
 what is evident is that gold when we talk about gold maxima 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.260
 very on the contrary the one that last year oil for example reached 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.269
 the 140 dollars an ounce 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.399
 peron of the neighborhood will persist outside pharmacy 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:32.009
 140 dollars a barrel 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.019
 these were oil peaks adjusted for inflation in relation to 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.309
 the maxima had the 70s 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:42.289
 but gold is not even halfway to its maximum 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:46.759
 positions and we adjust to inflation the maximums that it had in 1980 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:51.009
 from 850 dollars adjusted to current inflation 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:55.649
 they represent 2 thousand 300 dollars we are fresh in 1200 dollars 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:56.990
 he has still left 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.889
 to achieve real gold maximums 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.150
 it's a long way from there we sit down 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.729
 leonardo astrada 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.799
 to converse there will be many people who are not watching listening to the moments 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.429
 thousands ask middle class people who have their savings 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:14.000
 how can they benefit from this bullish gold trend of the comment 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.739
 I would recommend prudence 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.920
 look at the gold 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.329
 there are times where you have to invest in gold and there are times where 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.560
 it is not necessary to invest in gold because the economy does not have enough 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.560
 Trust was good enough so that it is not necessary 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.479
 in times of crisis where we do not know very well where we are going 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.539
 if I would say it's interesting 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:36.340
 it was weird 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.340
 the savings pop part of the savings into something tangible 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.860
 how is the gold here 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.509
 for the silver evidently both physical and also there are means of 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.469
 to enter the financial market is financial instruments to enter into 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:51.610
 gold and silver 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.240
 but above all physical and I think it is 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.240
 a way of turning that preserve the purchasing power 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.610
 very good mario minera expert in everything and precious metals director and treader of 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.009
 finance thank you very much 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.069
